<P>
10. <a name="30917w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has had with the tourist industry in Wales on promotion abroad of tourism in Wales.  [129545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I work very closely with the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government. Tourism is a major focus of our discussions. The tourist industry contributes more than &#163;2.5 billion a year to the Welsh economy and provides employment for around 100,000 people.

<P>
11. <a name="30917w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what recent information the Welsh subgroup of the coal health claims monitoring group has received on payments made to retired miners or their families under the respiratory disease and vibration white finger compensation schemes.  [129546]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 The latest available figures for Wales indicate that at the end of August under the respiratory disease scheme we had settled over 21,000 claims and paid &#163;258.5 million and under the VWF scheme we had settled nearly 10,500 claims and paid &#163;96.4 million.

<P>
12. <a name="30917w01.html_wqn2"><B> Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> Cabinet colleagues and <i>(b)</i> National Assembly for Wales Secretaries about the provision of affordable housing in Wales.  [129547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 This year, Welsh Assembly Government is making available &#163;56.4 million in Social Housing Grant to assist the provision of affordable housing. Together with private funding this will generate investment of over &#163;90 million and provide around 1,000 additional homes for rent and low cost ownership.

<a name="30917w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Economic Growth</H3>


<P>
13. <a name="30917w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. John Smith: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what assessment he has made of the prospects for economic growth in Wales in the next 12 months.  [129548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Most recent economic indicators show that the Welsh economy is performing more strongly now than for a generation, with unemployment continuing to fall, and employment and economic activity rising.

14. <a name="30917w01.html_wqn4"><B> Hywel Williams: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what recent discussions he has had with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Welsh Assembly Government regarding the closure of Friction Dynamex Ltd.  [129549]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has discussed this issue with colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry and the National Assembly for Wales. We are all anxious that those workers treated so badly receive their due.

<P>
15. <a name="30917w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. David: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has had with the Home Office on community support officers in Wales.  [129550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 My hon. Friend and I have regular discussions with ministerial colleagues about matters affecting Wales.
<P>

<a name="30917w01.html_para0">All four Welsh police forces now have funding for Community Support Officers. In July I met a group of CSOs based in my own constituency who are already coming to be recognised as a valuable part of the local policing team.

<a name="30917w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Departmental Food Expenditure</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how much was spent on food by his Department in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; what proportion of that food by value was produced in the United Kingdom; what guidance he has issued to encourage the procurement of home-grown food; and if he will make a statement.  [129384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 The Wales Office has a complement of 55 and does not provide a catering service for staff.
<P>

<a name="30917w01.html_para1">It is not possible to determine how much of the hospitality budget was spent on food; we always ask catering companies to use Welsh produce where possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales which of the four options to reduce bed blocking outlined in the Review of Health and Social Care in Wales advised by Derek Wanless would require primary legislation to implement.  [129674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave him on 17 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 447W.
<P>

<a name="30917w01.html_para2">The Assembly are currently considering all the options outlined in the Review of Health and Social Care in Wales as part of their detailed report and action plan, which is now due for publication in November. It would therefore be inappropriate to comment on the likely need for legislation that may be identified by the Assembly in order to support any proposals detailed in their implementation plan.

<P>
<a name="30917w01.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal is designed to narrow the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest of the country. Low income is a key indicator in the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2000 used to target resources and focus activity on those areas in greatest need. Policies for neighbourhood renewal include the New Deal for Communities partnerships, the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, Floor targets and the development of local partnerships and community networks.

 Due to the nature of the grants it is not possible to provide specific details of allocated funds at ward level. The following are programmes that have received funding in Sefton:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) &#163;4.852 million (2003&#150;04)&#151;Capital Investment in Housing.
<P>
<BR>
(b) &#163;7.37 million (2002&#150;03) &#163;7.191 million (2003&#150;04)&#151;Major Repairs Allowance.

<BR>
(c) &#163;713,000 (2002&#150;03) &#163;720,000 (2003&#150;04)&#151;Disabled Facilities Grants.
<P>

All the above can be borough wide. Major repairs allowance is only for use on local authority stock.
<P>
<BR>
(d) &#163;12.671 million (2001&#150;04) &#163;16,893 million (2004&#150;06)&#151;Neighbourhood Renewal Fund is not prescribed but intended for spend in the most deprived wards.

&#163;128,996 (2001&#150;04) &#163;154,796 (2004&#150;06)&#151;Community Learning Chests.
<P>
<BR>
(g) The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not hold information on levels of European funding at ward level. Also as the Objective One programme is Merseyside-wide in scope, a substantial amount of programme-funded activity will be delivered by organisations that have a pan-Merseyside remit. A project based in one particular area (often at the organisations head office) will therefore draw beneficiaries, or have benefits, and spend money outside its immediate locality. However, Sefton will benefit from the &#163;160 million invested through Objective One in Merseyside in 2002.
<P>
<BR>
(h) Areas that receive Objective 1 monies are not eligible for either Objective Two or Objective Three funding.
<P>
<BR>
(i) <i>Objective 3&#151;see h.</i>
<P>
<BR>
(j) There are seven Community Champions receiving a total of &#163;7,257.

<P>
<BR>
(k) Sefton does not receive Pathfinder Young Community Champions Fund as Sefton is not an eligible area. DfES ran a national competitive bidding process which Sefton did not enter.

(l) &#163;261,813 for three UK Online Centres.
<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister which census figures will be used for the 2004&#150;05 formula funding share.  [129852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intends to use mid-2002 population estimates for the 2004&#150;05 Local Government Settlement.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para0">The formulae used to distribute grant to local authorities in England make use of various sets of data from the Census, apart from the population estimates that are updated each year. Officials of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have been discussing with local authority representatives the use of 2001 Census data other than population in the 2004&#150;05 Settlement. Unfortunately, the late availability of some of the 2001 Census data has limited the options for using it in this years settlement. Therefore the 1991 Census data will be used for the 2004&#150;05 Settlement.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is announcing this now in order to remove any uncertainty felt by local authorities regarding the data that will be used for the settlement.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para2">Officials of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to discuss with local authority representatives the use of the 2001 Census data in future Local Government Finance settlements.

<P>
<a name="30917w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the budgetary impact on social services in the London boroughs named in the Laming Inquiry if the 1991 census figures are used to calculate the 2004&#150;05 formula funding share.  [129853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 None. The 1991 census data were used to calculate the 2003&#150;04 formula spending shares. Continuing to use these to calculate the 2004&#150;05 formula spending shares should therefore have little impact on any authority's grant allocation relative to 2003&#150;04. The level at which a local authority sets its budget is a matter for that authority, depending on its local priorities.

 The March 2002 report, "More than a roof", set out the Government's approach to tackling and preventing homelessness. Specific measures included investment of &#163;125 million in 2002&#150;03 to support local authorities and the voluntary agencies working with them to support new approaches for tackling and preventing homelessness. The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has a revenue budget of &#163;70 million and &#163;23.5 million capital allocation for 2003&#150;04. These resources will help to support the Government's commitment that by March

 Around 4,100 key workers have so far been helped under the Starter Home Initiative to buy homes they would otherwise have been unable to afford. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister receives regular monitoring data from the Housing Corporation on activity under the Starter Home Initiative and, in addition, will be commissioning an evaluation of the effectiveness of the programme. This study is expected to start towards the end of the year and will report during 2004.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently discussing with key worker sponsor departments how key worker housing assistance can best be targeted in future to meet recruitment and retention needs. These discussions include the type of properties and tenure required and take into account views expressed by employers, key workers and others about the operation of the Starter Home Initiative, and also key worker housing preferences. Regional Housing Boards are also advising on the allocation of funding for key worker schemes in their areas. Bids for key worker housing schemes will be invited in the Autumn.

<a name="30917w02.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has funded two studies which explore issues connected with the local authority role after the stock has transferred. They are (i) "Large Scale Voluntary Transfers: Staff impacts and implications" published in August 2003 which explores the impact of the transfer programme on employees in both the local authority and the registered social landlord sectors and considers the role of staff who remain in the local authority post transfer. (ii) "Housing Functions and stock transfer" will be published in late 2003 which will set out the key issues that housing authorities need to consider when deciding whether to retain or contract out the delivery of their statutory housing functions.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para7">The Audit Commission Housing Inspectorate is responsible for inspecting and reporting on local authority housing services, including those retained when stock is transferred.

appraisal of options for delivering decent social housing within their authority. Where the choice emerging from the option appraisal is to pursue housing transfer, we then expect authorities to further explain the transfer proposals to tenants and to provide them with the facts surrounding housing transfer in accordance with the Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity. The code allows authorities to refute any misleading arguments put to tenants by those opposed to transfer.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para8">To enable tenants to make an informed choice the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects accurate information on the housing association sector to be provided to them by authorities and Independent Tenants' Advisors.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 18 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 341, to the hon.

<P>
<a name="30917w02.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Some local authorities will be able to meet the decent homes target using mainstream housing funds and their own resources, e.g. capital receipts, particularly since mainstream housing funds have been increased since the Government came to Office.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para16">However, alternative options have been provided. The Sustainable Communities Plan made it clear that local authorities seeking additional investment in their housing stock are able to choose from three options; set up a high performing Arm's Length Housing Management Organisation (ALMO); pursue a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme; and stock transfer. Only stock transfer results in a change of ownership of the stock.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para17">The Sustainable Communities Plan also made it clear that authorities that do not pursue any of the three alternative options cannot expect increased investment above that provided for in the Housing Investment Programme.
<P>

<a name="30917w02.html_para18">The option appraisal process is designed to ensure that tenants are at the heart of the decisions about the future management of their homes. This process should make a negative vote on the chosen option less likely. However, in the event of a negative ballot the local authority and the tenants will need to revisit the options that will deliver decent homes by 2010.

 The scale of the reconstruction task in Iraq caused by decades of neglect and misrule was greater than expected. But good progress in Iraq is being made despite security setbacks, and Saddam's appalling legacy. The Iraqi Governing Council has appointed Ministers, work is under way on preparing a new constitution, institutions are being rebuilt, the international financial community is engaging, children are receiving better health care and education, and work is in hand to improve the infrastructure deficiencies. We are also giving urgent priority to building up the Police Force, Civil Defence Corps and New Iraqi Army, so that Iraqis assume greater responsibility for their own security.

Formal invitations to DSEi do not imply that Her Majesty's Government would be prepared to issue export licences for the supply of all or any of the equipment displayed, and all export licence applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis in line with the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.

These have included consideration of extraterritorial control in relation to the export of strategically controlled goods, but not specifically of end-user controls. The national security of the United Kingdom and its allies is considered at the time an application for a licence to export is made, under the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The duration of pre-deployment training for military forces deploying on operations depends on two factors: firstly, the existing level of training, which is closely aligned to readiness, and, secondly, the operational task the force is required to undertake. The amount of pre-deployment training required is therefore dictated by the extent to which the troops need to raise their military capability, and it is not meaningful to specify set periods of time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria used for decisions under the War Pensions Scheme. I refer my hon. Friend to the details of my statement to the House of 15 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 39&#150;40WS. I can confirm that there will be no effect on existing war pensioners. Decisions on whether a condition was caused or significantly aggravated by service will be evidence-based, using a 'balance of probabilities' standard of proof. This is in line with the approach of the civil courts and other modern compensation arrangements. All decisions will be appealable to a fully independent tribunal.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what proportion of the population living in <i>(a)</i> rural and <i>(b)</i> urban areas has access to services provided by Community Legal Service Partnerships.  [129360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 To date, Community Legal Service Partnerships cover over 99 per cent. of the population of England and Wales and so include nearly all rural and urban areas. Although the provision of services within the Community Legal Service (CLS) falls to individually contracted providers, each CLS partnership has responsibility for advising on the co-ordination and planning of local service delivery. Data produced by the CLS partnerships, particularly in relation to priority legal needs, helps to inform the allocation of CLS resources through the contracting system. Along with policy developments, such as the Partnership Initiative Budget (PIB) and the Method of Delivery Pilots, the Legal Services Commission ensures that there is both adequate and improving service provision across all regions in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w05.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many claims for negligence, errors or omissions have been made against under sheriffs in each of the last three years; what was <i>(a)</i> the highest claim, <i>(b)</i> the average claim and <i>(c)</i> the total value of claims; what was the total paid in settlement of claims for each of the last three years; what plans he has to indemnify sheriffs against liability for claims against under sheriffs; and if he will make a statement.  [129317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. The courts do not maintain statistics on the identity or role of defendants; nor does the Department employ or have direct responsibility for under sheriffs.
<P>

<a name="30917w05.html_para2">We do, however, consider the responsibility for enforcement of High Court writs as an onerous one for sheriffs to undertake, as their position is a voluntary one, and that responsibility extends for up to six years following their term of office. Therefore we are relieving them of this responsibility through measures contained in the Courts Bill. Present insurance arrangements made by under sheriffs cover the possibility of litigation for the duration of a high sheriffs responsibility. The matter of continuing cover once new measures are brought in is under careful consideration by the representatives of those who undertake this work and wish to continue to do so as well as those who represent under sheriffs and high sheriffs. We have no plans to indemnify sheriffs from public funds.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the duties of the office of sheriff consist of <i>(a)</i> formally and <i>(b)</i> informally; and if he will make a statement.  [129319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 High sheriffs are technically responsible for the enforcement of High Court writs, but this is, in practice, carried out on their behalf by under sheriffs, and this duty will be removed from high sheriffs by legislation currently before Parliament. The traditional role of the high sheriff is to escort to court and offer hospitality to High Court judges who visit their area. Informal duties are entirely a matter for individual sheriffs, who also have an informal representational role for their county. The office is unpaid, and the expenses are borne personally by the incumbent. High sheriffs receive no public funds, other than a small allowance for days when they attend judges in court.

<P>
<a name="30917w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 UK airlines currently have no statutory duty of care to passengers with regard to cancelled flights. However, all the significant "full-service" UK airlines (both scheduled and charter) have signed up to the Airline Voluntary Commitments on Air Passenger Rights, developed in 2001 under the guidance of the European Commission and the European Civil Aviation Conference. These commitments contain non-legally binding agreements to deliver defined standards of service to air travellers in a number of key areas, including the prompt notification of known delays, cancellations and diversions.
<P>

<a name="30917w07.html_para3">At the Transport Council in December 2002 the European Community reached political agreement on a proposal from the European Commission for a regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delays of flights.

 The Government expect local authorities to reflect the principles of sustainable development in their Local Transport Plans (LTPs).

The Government, through their funding of LTPs, aim to deliver better environmental outcomes across the whole range of Local Transport Plan schemes and initiatives. It would therefore be misleading to identify "green transport initiatives" separately&#151;environmental issues are fully integrated into wider local transport policy.

 Malicious software&#151;including viruses&#151;is a global phenomenon. No one Government can eliminate the development and spread of malicious software but the Government are playing their part in a range of activities to minimise the impact on users. We are talking to vendors about improving the identification of vulnerabilities in software and the underlying protocols. We are working with industry to disseminate advice about the availability of solutions to the problems which are identified and how to deal with

<P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 763W</I><P>
the difficulties posed by events, such as viruses, which exploit those vulnerabilities. The Department has taken a prominent role in the promotion of good information security management and has developed promotional material aimed at helping smaller companies understand and deal with common security problems. The detection and prosecution of those who create malicious software is the responsibility of the Home Office and Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act already criminalises the unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer, which includes modifications caused by viruses. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is, however, reviewing the effectiveness of the Act and, as part of this process, will consider whether any further legislation is required to further deter those who write or knowingly disseminate computer viruses.

<P>

<a name="30917w09.html_para12">Based on this evidence, the total cost to UK businesses (employing over 50 workers) of poor basic skill levels was estimated to be in the region of &#163;4.8 billion pounds per annum (&#163;6 billion in 2002 prices).
<P>

<a name="30917w09.html_para13">These costs are likely to be underestimated, as they do not account for costs associated with lost future business, the need for additional training because staff may be unable to cope with written material, the cost of work that needs to be re-done or the costs incurred by firms with 50 or fewer employees.

 In the period January to July 2003, there were just over 2,100 <sup>1</sup> new bovine tuberculosis (TB) incidents in Great Britain. This represents an increase of approximately 2 per cent. over the same period in 2002 when 2,065 new incidents were recorded. To date, just over 1,000 <sup>1</sup>  of the new incidents recorded in 2003 have been confirmed, 840 <sup>1</sup>  are unconfirmed and just under 260 <sup>1</sup> remain unclassified pending the results of tissue culture tests.
<P>

<a name="30917w10.html_para6">Defra is working hard to address the problem of bovine TB, and last year we spent &#163;72 million on a programme of public health protection measures, cattle testing, cattle controls and extensive research.

 The UK's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12. We estimate that this will equate to a reduction in emissions of around 26 MtC (million tonnes of carbon equivalent) by 2008&#150;12. The UK's domestic target, to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, is estimated to equate to a reduction of about 33 MtC by 2010.
<P>

<a name="30917w10.html_para7">Data for emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases for 2001, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in April 2003, show that emissions fell by 12.3 per cent., or 26 MtC, between the base year and 2001. Emissions of carbon dioxide fell by 5.3 per cent., or 9 MtC. Provisional data for 2002 show that total emissions fell by 14&#150;15 per cent. between the base year and 2002, and carbon dioxide emissions fell by 8&#150;9 per cent.

<a name="30917w10.html_para8">Progress that we have made to date and our latest projections to 2010 contained in the UK's Third National Communication to the UNFCCC indicate that we are well on course to meet our Kyoto commitment.

 No formal assessment has been made, although clearly the ban will have an impact on those farmers who had previously buried fallen stock on farm. That is why the Government have announced they are setting up a low cost voluntary national fallen stock scheme in conjunction with the livestock industry to assist farmers in adapting to the new requirements for disposal of fallen stock.

 The England Rural Development Programme was established in 2000 and measures under it are available to all farmers, including tenant farmers, on the same terms. Because the Government were keen to ensure that tenants are not disadvantaged in applying for farm diversification or agri-environment schemes, we asked the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to consider this issue. This group, which included representatives from all key industry stakeholder organisations, published its report in June 2003. TRIG has proposed a comprehensive package of legislative, fiscal and other changes that are intended to ensure both landlord and tenant have more flexibility to deal with the long-term nature of rural land management. These recommendations have the support of all TRIG members.
<P>

<a name="30917w12.html_para6">TRIG did not find sufficient evidence to warrant recommending a change to agricultural tenancy legislation to give tenants a greater ability to diversify or participate in agri-environment schemes. However, they have proposed that a new Code of Good Practice should be drawn up to help avoid disputes between landlords and tenants on consent for diversification into non-agricultural activities. The Group also recommended that if, after a period of years the Code of Good Practice was not seen to be working and there is evidence to show that the legislation is acting as a barrier to diversification, legislative change should be considered.
<P>

<a name="30917w12.html_para7">The Government's formal response to the Group's report has not yet been published. However we have asked TRIG to take work on a Code of Good Practice forward and a small working group will be working on this over the autumn.

I anticipate that the agreement will be debated in Parliament in this session, and that the UK's ratification procedures will be completed by February 2004. The agreement will enter into force when all parties&#151; EU member states, the European Community and Algeria&#151;have ratified.

<P>
<a name="30917w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We have been concerned about reports that Pastor Gong Shengliang has suffered ill treatment in Jingzhou prison, Hubei Province. We supported an EU demarche on this subject in Beijing on 18 July. The Chinese authorities said that the allegations of torture and ill-treatment were untrue and that Pastor Gong was in good health.
<P>

<a name="30917w14.html_para3">We have also raised Pastor Gong's case directly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 31 July the Chinese authorities told us that Pastor Gong had had stomach problems before he was imprisoned and that following treatment the problems had stabilised. His relatives have visited him four times.

 The British Government take the welfare of the Greek Cypriot community in the north of Cyprus seriously. Through our High Commission in Cyprus, and with the Turkish Cypriot authorities, the UN and the Government of Cyprus, we do what we can to ameliorate the situation.

<a name="30917w14.html_para4">Our High Commission is keeping a close eye on the situation concerning those students who have recently finished their primary education and are due to move to secondary education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We estimate that, excluding the reiterations of amendments tabled more than once, the UK delegation submitted 154 amendments. Many of these were technical or legal drafting amendments. Even when not accepting amendments verbatim, the Convention frequently agreed on language which met our underlying concerns in whole or in part.
<P>

<a name="30917w14.html_para6">For that reason, it is not possible to put a precise figure on the number of UK proposals that were agreed to. The Convention's final draft text met the majority of the UK's objectives. As the Thessaloniki Council agreed it is 'a good starting point' for the discussions between 25 European nation states which will agree the next EU constitutional treaty.

 We believe that it should be for the Iraqi people to determine the timetable for their elections, with appropriate international help as required.

the political processes leading to the formation of a representative government. The Secretary-General's report of 17 July (of which a copy has been placed in the Library of the House) identified further areas in which the UN could contribute to the initial effort in Iraq. The Government would support an increased UN contribution in these areas. Following the terrorist attack on the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August, the UN's efforts in Iraq have inevitably been scaled back. We are in discussion with the UN on the security measures needed to ensure that the UN is able to resume and expand its role in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="30917w15.html_para0">Since July, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been active in Iraq producing first needs assessments for the reconstruction of Iraq. This in-country work was cut short by the outrage against the UN headquarters on 19 August, but finalisation of the assessments continues.
<P>

<a name="30917w15.html_para1">It is vital for Iraq that international NGOs continue their work on the ground. It is hoped that, as the security situation in Iraq improves, these organisations will continue with their humanitarian efforts. The Madrid Donors' Conference next month should give a significant boost to Iraq's reconstruction process.

 The UK has regular discussions with international partners at all levels on all matters relating to Afghanistan, including the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). NATO took over leadership of ISAF in August 2003 and is currently engaged in a review of ISAF's role. It would be inappropriate for us to second-guess the outcome of this review and any possible effect it might have on the ISAF mandate. But any change to ISAF's role would also require amendment of its mandate through the UN.

 The collapse of the ceasefire and peace talks between the Government of Nepal and the Maoists is a very disappointing development. It heightens the risk of renewed violence and suffering in Nepal which will benefit no-one.

 The UK supported the recommendation by the Fowler Report to place secondary sanctions against countries complicit in breaching the UN arms embargo against Angola (UNITA) (UNSCR 864(1993). But the UK recognised that there were a number of practical difficulties to overcome, not least gaining consensus amongst Security Council members that there would be sufficient proof to declare a State guilty of deliberate sanctions busting. Initially the issue was kept alive by UNSCR 1295(2000), passed subsequent to the Fowler Report on 18 April 2000. Paragraph 5 of the resolution expressed
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"its readiness . . . to consider appropriate action in accordance with the Charter in relation to States it determines to have violated the measures contained in those [ie sanctions] resolutions, and establishes 18 November 2000 as the deadline for an initial decision in this regard".
But when the Security Council considered the Monitoring Mechanism's (delayed) report in February 2001, Canada called for the Security Council to focus on imposing secondary sanctions, and did so again in November 2001; each time without success due to a lack of consensus.

<P>

 The basis for the county council processing the P45 derives from s. 22(2)(a) of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, and the relevant provision of the applicable Student Support Regulations (e.g. reg 6(3) of the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations 2002 which states:

<P>

<a name="30917w16.html_para4">The basis for keeping a person's P45 details on file is firstly that this is a National Audit Office requirement and as such the NAO is entitled to audit the assessment and payment of loans and can request supporting documentation relating to main ledger financial transactions for a period of up to six years after after the end of the financial year in which the transaction took place. Secondly, the Limitation Act 1980, which applies

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the impact of the area cost adjustment on education funding in <i>(a)</i> Chesham and Amersham and <i>(b)</i> Buckinghamshire.  [129888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Area Cost Adjustment provides funding top-ups for areas where it costs more to recruit and retain staff. It uses the New Earnings Survey to calculate earnings differentials between different areas in the country. A threshold is set below which all authorities are given the same area cost adjustment factor. The area cost adjustment factor for Buckinghamshire is 1.0943. It is for Buckinghamshire local education authority to decide on the distribution of funding within Buckinghamshire, in consultation with its schools.

<P>
<a name="30917w17.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action he is taking to support local technical agreements on skills acquisition and accreditation between employers and further education colleges below national Sector Skills Council requirements.  [129983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The aim of our recently published skills strategy, "21st Century Skills&#151;Realising Our Potential", is to ensure that employers have the right skills to support the success of their businesses, and individuals have the skills they need to be both employable and personally fulfilled. As with "Success for All", the Department's strategy for the reform of further education, a key part of the strategy is to ensure that colleges and training providers are more responsive to the needs of employers, and those of individual learners. Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) will lead the drive to increase productivity and develop the required skills within their industry sectors. Through sector skills agreements they will work with their employers and with planning and funding agencies like the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to agree an action plan for addressing priority skills needs. However, further education colleges will continue to determine the specific range and volume of courses they offer and will need to continue to be responsive to their local employers, providing bespoke training based on local agreements as appropriate. The pattern of provision will continue to be agreed in discussion with the local LSC, reflecting national and regional priorities as well of those of the locality.

 Student loans are available to students domiciled in the United Kingdom. Data are collected on the payment and repayment of student loans, separately for income contingent loans (which were introduced in September 1998 as part of the new student support arrangements) and mortgage style loans (mostly

<P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 796W</I><P>
applying to those who entered higher education before academic year 1998/99). These data are split according to the domicile of the borrower at the point of entering HE.
<P>

<a name="30917w17.html_para1">Data on the current residence of the mortgage style loan borrowers are not available in the Department. The recovery regime for these loans is the same for all borrowers whether resident in or outside of the UK. These loans are repayable on a mortgage style basis over five or seven years, depending on the number of loans taken out. Borrowers may apply to defer repayments for up to a year at a time if their income is below the current deferment threshold, otherwise repayments will be collected, whether the borrower is overseas or not.
<P>

<a name="30917w17.html_para2">Repayments of income contingent loans from borrowers resident in the UK are reported at the time when the Student Loans Company are notified of the repayments by the Inland Revenue, which may be one or more years after the tax year they relate to. Due to the time lag in collecting the information from the Inland Revenue it is too early in the scheme to have robust data for either comparison or trend purposes.
<P>

<a name="30917w17.html_para3">The Student Loans Company operates a separate recovery regime for income contingent loan borrowers who are outside of the UK tax system. The mechanism for collecting repayments requires borrowers to declare their total annual income to the SLC who calculate the repayment due, mirroring the rules applying to borrowers within the tax system. Sufficient robust data are not yet available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to improve the collection of data on the number of people who enter higher education on the basis of <i>(a)</i> vocational and <i>(b)</i> work-based learning qualifications.  [129525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w18.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The main source of data on the entry qualifications of HE students is the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) student record. This already identifies students with vocational qualifications and non-academic qualifications (such as accreditation of prior learning). The student record is reviewed regularly to ensure that it collects data which are relevant and fit for purpose, for instance the 2002/03 return has been enhanced to identify students funded by the University for Industry.

 Our strategy "Full and Equal Citizens", which we will be reviewing shortly, sets out the Government's cross-departmental strategy for the integration of refugees. It is monitored by the National Refugee Integration Forum, which I chair. In addition to the work of other Departments as set out in the strategy, the Home Office itself helps fund a number of community development programmes being taken forward by the leading national and regional refugee organisations. In addition, we fund small community groups working with refugees through the Refugee Community Development Fund. The Challenge Fund and the European Refugee Fund have also been established on the basis of providing a carefully evaluated programme of projects to identify what does work in integration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w19.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government welcome the UNICEF report drawing attention to the heinous crime of trafficking. Work is already in hand to develop a better understanding of the scale of child trafficking, and the Home Office has sponsored research by the International Organisation for Migration that will be presented to a major EU conference later this month.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para0">Work to develop intelligence and co-ordinate operations against trafficking is the responsibility of Reflex, the multi-agency response to organised immigration crime. Reflex has supported Operation Paladin Child which is profiling unaccompanied children arriving at Heathrow, as well as similar exercises at Gatwick and Dover.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para1">The Sexual Offences Bill, currently before Parliament, introduces wide ranging criminal sanctions covering trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. We are committed to introducing legislation covering trafficking for other purposes when parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para2">Responsibility for child protection falls to Social Services under the Children Act 1989. There are wide ranging proposals for changes to the child protection arrangements contained in the Green Paper, "Every Child Matters", published recently. In particular, co-ordination arrangements between social services and the police will be enhanced through greater clarity over the responsibilities of Area Child Protection Committees. The Home Office has developed a Trafficking Toolkit, published earlier this year, with practical advice around identifying and supporting victims of trafficking that is available to police and social services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what resources his Department will make available to provide for specialist training for immigration officers and social workers in order to <i>(a)</i> help them identify cases of child trafficking and <i>(b)</i> provide them with the necessary skills to assist victims of child trafficking; and if he will make a statement.  [129088]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Government are committed to protecting trafficked children, and have recently announced a Children's Commissioner for England and other measures to protect vulnerable children in the wake of the recommendations from the Laming Inquiry into the tragic death of Victoria Climbi&#233;.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para3">All immigration officers are already trained to a high standard in interviewing skills. In addition to this, the Immigration Service is shortly to deliver specialist training to around 600 operational members of staff nation-wide. Central to the theme of the course will be that children arriving in the UK may be here as a result of coercion or criminal activity, including trafficking.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para4">Immigration officers also receive regular intelligence bulletins and inter-agency briefings that highlight issues and trends in respect of trafficking so that they may make informed decisions. All UK immigration officers at ports of entry have been issued with a profile of potential child trafficking victims.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para5">The Home Office has also recently published a 'trafficking toolkit', providing guidance for immigration officers on how to recognise a victim of trafficking and what to do if such a victim is encountered. A vice team consisting of specially selected immigration officers has also been established in London. The team is fully aware of the procedures for the identification of trafficked children.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para6">It is for local councils to decide training priorities for social workers. However, the Government have made &#163;6 million available in the Training Support Programme grant for post-qualification specialist training for social workers, with a target of 7,000 social workers awarded the Child Care Post-qualifying Award by 2006.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w19.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Child victims of trafficking are referred to social services to receive assistance and support based on their particular needs. Social services have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs or, where appropriate, by arranging for the provision of services from other agencies. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and&#151;in many cases&#151;protection under the Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para8">There is no current specific earmarked funding for services of this nature. Instead, Government funding is allocated to councils with social services responsibilities on the basis of the needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each body's target fair share of available resources. It is, therefore, for councils, working in partnership with relevant stakeholders, to determine their spending priorities on the basis of local needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w19.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government have not announced that they will be piloting an entitlement card scheme. My hon. Friend is probably referring to press reports of a proposed UK Passport Service project to pilot the recording of facial recognition, fingerprint and iris image biometric information for passports and the proposed passport card. Discussions with short-listed suppliers are still continuing.

[129770]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what arrangements are in place for ensuring that motorists are not served with fixed penalty notices for speeding when the details of their vehicle are incorrectly recorded.  [129782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w19.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Before the issue of a fixed penalty notice, officers analysing offences caught on film check the registration of the car against the DVLA record and the police national computer. A further check is made on the vehicle model and colour. Plans by a number of 



<P>
<P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 806W</I><P>
police forces to introduce in the near future automated viewing technology into the system should further reduce errors. Where an error is identified, the notice is withdrawn and the situation investigated to see whether further operative training or other remedial action is required.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para9">The most likely reason for an innocent person to be sent a fixed penalty notice is that the vehicle detected had been stolen and given the registration of another registered vehicle to disguise it. The police take this type of criminal activity very seriously and investigate each case thoroughly. To help counter the problem, it has been a requirement since January to show proof of entitlement when buying a number plate; number plate suppliers have to be registered with DVLA and maintain records of transactions. DVLA are currently conducting a consultation exercise on the possible incorporation on number plates of additional features which would make it more difficult to display them on vehicles for which they were not intended.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w19.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Passport Service (UKPS) has a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy that includes a range of initiatives to advise members of the public about the passport requirements for foreign travel. UKPS works closely with the travel trade and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to ensure that timely and relevant information is conveyed. UKPS advises travellers to check with relevant embassies about visa requirements and length of passport validity which must remain to travel to each country as these are matters for them to determine. UKPS also distributes its literature to a range of organisations including the Citizens' Advice Bureau and Registrars offices throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para10">Media campaigns are normally planned to take place in early January and autumn each year to remind customers to think about their passport requirements and act as early as possible. Most recently UKPS and the FCO worked together to publicise the new requirements for travel to USA, about which there are ongoing discussions between the FCO and US.
<P>

<a name="30917w19.html_para11">The UKPS has a range of information channels, which it utilises to convey its messages. These include:

<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In his statement of 17 July 2003, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary explained the reasons for the proposal that the Forensic Science Service should become a public private partnership. To date, representations about the future status of the organisation have been received from two trade unions, Prospect and PCS, from Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the TUC, and from 71 hon. Members.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ivan Henderson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what initiatives his Department has introduced since 1997 to tackle the problems of graffiti.  [129694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Graffiti and abandoned vehicles spoil our enjoyment of public places, and can increase fear of crime and produce an environment where crime and anti-social behaviour can thrive. They are a burden on businesses and the local authorities that are left to clean up graffiti on property and remove abandoned vehicles. The annual cost of graffiti clean up in London alone is &#163;23 million.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para0">We are introducing a package of measures to prevent graffiti and to ensure that it is removed swiftly when it does occur:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Anti-Social Behaviour Bill contains proposals to give local authorities new powers to clean graffiti from certain types of private property, including cable boxes, post boxes, phone booths, and property associated with public transport.
<P>
<BR>
The Bill also contains proposals to ban the sale of spray paints to under 19s. The sale of aerosols will be controlled in much the same way that the sale of glue and solvent are currently controlled. The bill also proposes to give local authorities power to issue Fixed Penalty Notices for graffiti and fly posting. Offenders would have to pay a &#163;50 penalty or be prosecuted through the courts. Councils already use these powers to tackle littering.
<P>
<BR>
The Criminal Justice Bill contains measures to close the loophole which prevents the police from searching for items which they suspect may be intended for use in causing criminal damage, such as spray paints.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30917w20.html_para1">It is estimated that 238,000 vehicles were abandoned in 2000&#150;01. These nuisance vehicles become a magnet for arson and anti-social behaviour. Measures introduced to tackle this problem include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 2002 the period of notice that local authorities and the DVLA need to give before removing and disposing of nuisance vehicles was reduced. Local authorities now only need to give 24 hours notice of their intention to remove an abandoned vehicle of value. Abandoned vehicles of no value can be removed to a pound immediately&#151;and local authorities now only need to 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 808W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wait seven days before disposing of them. We also made it possible for local authorities to take on DVLA powers to tackle unlicensed vehicles.
<P>
<BR>
Continuous registration comes into to force from January 2004. From then, the keeper of a vehicle will be responsible for licensing it until DVLA is informed of its disposal. This will enable more rigorous enforcement action against those dumping vehicles.
<P>
<BR>
There is a lot of good practice already taking place. The "Operation Cubit" model brings together agencies such as the police, local authorities and the DVLA to take action in an area blighted by nuisance vehicles. We will be looking in the coming months at how best to rollout these successes, in the context of our anti-social behaviour agenda.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what annual income his Department expects to gain from introducing charges for international student visas.  [129427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in February 2002 in his White Paper: Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain, that he would be introducing charges in order to fund the modernisation of Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). The regulations were laid on 10 July. IND already charges fee in respect of Nationality applications, for Travel Documents, and since 1 April this year for work permits.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para2">We continue to welcome the many foreign nationals, who choose to study, work and live in the UK&#151;they boost our economy and add to our thriving cosmopolitan society. Many apply to extend their stay each year, and it is right that they should meet the costs of that.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para3">The Government have made significant investment in recent years to improve all aspects of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, including the standard of service people receive when they submit applications. Charging will help us to continue to improve the efficiency and the speed with which we process these applications, leading to ever-higher levels of customer service.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para4">The estimated revenue from the introduction of charging for leave to remain applications is &#163;90 million.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para5">The estimated revenue from international students is approximately &#163;21 million per annum.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will monitor charges for international student visas to see whether they have a deterrent effect.  [129428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The fees are set under Treasury rules to recover the full administrative cost entailed in considering applications and no more. This is calculated by taking the overall costs of processing applications divided by the number of decisions we expect to make.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para6">Treasury rules require us to undertake an annual fee review at which point we will monitor the level of applications that we have received.




<P>
<P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 809W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para7">However, there are many factors which affect the level of intake of applications so it would not be right to conclude without detailed analysis that any perceived decrease was solely due to the introduction of charging.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many vacancies there are for uniformed officers in the Leicestershire Police Service; and what proportion this represents of the approved establishment in Leicestershire.  [127273]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w20.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The establishment figures for the end of 2003 was 2,127 officers. Leicestershire police estimate that they will take approximately 207 recruits in 2003&#150;04; which they estimate will bring establishment up to 2,235 by the end of 2003&#150;04. There are currently around 174 vacancies for new applicants (September figures) and recruitment is healthy. This represents approximately eight per cent. of expected establishment. These vacancies will vary on a day to day basis.
<P>

<a name="30917w20.html_para8">The Home Office does not set establishment figures for police forces and no central record is kept of vacancies. Decisions about the use of resources, including decisions about the number and deployment of police officers are matters for the police authority and the Chief Constable.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2003]:</i> In common with the principles in place for a number of members of the senior civil service across Government, the Head of the Police Standards Unit will be entitled to an annual bonus, of up to 15 per cent. of his basic salary, subject to his performance against a set of specific objectives and targets to be agreed at the start of each reporting period between himself and the Permanent Secretary, Crime, Policing, Counter-Terrorism and Delivery in the Home Office.

<P>

 The Secretary of State has no plans to do so.
<P>

<a name="30917w21.html_para0">The investigation into allegations against senior officers is a matter for the relevant police authority or where the senior officer has left the force and a criminal investigation takes place, the chief officer. They own the report into the investigation and are acquainted with the facts of the case and any decision on disclosure is a matter for them.
<P>

<a name="30917w21.html_para1">However, the new complaints system which is due to be introduced from April 2004, under provisions in the Police Reform Act 2002, will place a clear duty on those responsible for an investigation to keep the complainant properly informed during, and at the end of, an investigation. The presumption will be on openness, specifically allowing for the disclosure of the investigation report, subject to a sensitivity test.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many British police officers are to be sent to Iraq; for how long they will remain there; how their pay and conditions will vary from that in the UK; on what criteria the selection is made; what risk assessment has been carried out; what assessment the Department has made of the effect on crime <i>(a)</i> prevention and <i>(b)</i> detection in the UK of sending officers to Iraq; and if he will make a statement.  [128319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have agreed to a request from my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) to ask the Association of Chief Police Officers to seek up to 200 volunteers to create a pool of United Kingdom police officers for potential deployment to Iraq. The pool is intended to sustain the deployment of up to 100 United 



<P>
<P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 811W</I><P>
Kingdom officers at any one time. Some may be deployed to a third country to assist in the out of country training of the Iraqi police service.
<P>

<a name="30917w21.html_para2">If UK police officers are required they will be deployed for six to 12 month periods. The terms and conditions of service of police officers from English and Welsh police forces will be protected under section 26 of the Police Act 1996. Officers will be recruited according to experience and the skills required for the post. The preliminary selection procedure is a matter for each force. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will conduct the final selection process following recommendations on applicants' suitability from forces.
<P>

<a name="30917w21.html_para3">Every effort will be made to ensure police officers' safety while on mission. Officers will be deployed only when conditions are right. The security position will be reviewed regularly. The advice of the two secondees from the Association of Chief Police Officers presently serving in Iraq will continue to inform any decision on the timing of a deployment of United Kingdom police officers to Iraq. When we judge that conditions are right for deployment, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will approach the Home Office with proposals to draw on the pool.
<P>

<a name="30917w21.html_para4">I have considered the demands on domestic policing resources. The deployment of 100 UK police officers to assist Iraq is within the contingency plans for overall police contributions to peacekeeping missions that have been agreed between the Government and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Chief constables and police authorities will take account of local policing requirements before deciding whether to release officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30917w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Home Affairs Committee recommended that legislation should be introduced to overturn the House of Lords decision in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd. in relation to the vicarious liability of an employer for sexual assaults by an employee. The Government do not propose to change the law in this area. The law on vicarious liability is wholly common law based, and has been developed by the courts over 



<P>
<P><I>17 Sept 2003 : Column 812W</I><P>

 On the basis of underspends in previous years an action plan to address this issue was set out in a Statement to the Assembly on 1 July 2002 by the then Minister of Finance and Personnel. This included setting spending plans at a level which exceeded the actual spending power available by building in underspend assumptions, and the revised spending plans for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, announced on 11 December 2002, built on that approach. Full details are set out in Section 2 of the Budget Document ("Building on Progress: Budget 2003&#150;2006").

 The principal causes of the current waiting time difficulties have been a significant increase in demand and the temporary closure of test centres for the installation of new test equipment.

<a name="30917w24.html_para0">The programme of refurbishment will be completed in September this year. In the meantime, a number of steps are being taken to alleviate the position. These include: continuing efforts to recruit additional staff; increased overtime working; the introduction of extended day working into additional centres to increase capacity; diverting technical staff from other duties to testing; working with the equipment supplier to secure higher levels of productivity; better public information and awareness, so that customers have the option of choosing centres with a lower waiting time; and relocating staff in order to match capacity and demand as closely as possible.

 The Government do not specify the content of the General Practitioner training curriculum. This is the job of the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice (JCPTGP), which is the competent authority for general practice training in the United Kingdom. The JCPTGP is an independent professional body, and it is required by section 9(3) of the Vocational Training Regulations 1997 to determine and publish the curriculum to be followed by a GP registrar (for example a trainee GP).

<i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> The Government's strategy for mental health services in England is set out in the "National Service Framework for Mental Health" which specifies seven standards that people should be able to expect from services. The National Service Framework standards apply to all people of working age who have mental health problems including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
<P>

<a name="30917w31.html_para2">"A Sign of the Times", a consultation document on modernising mental health services for people who are deaf, sought the views of all stakeholders on a number of proposals to improve services for deaf and deafblind users of mental health services through a consultation exercise which ended in April. The Department will publish implementation guidance later in the year that will take all responses to "A Sign of the Times" into account.
<P>

<a name="30917w31.html_para3">It is envisaged that the implementation guidance will set out comprehensive arrangements for performance management of the implementation process.

<P>
<a name="30917w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government's strategy document "Building the Information Core&#151;Implementing the NHS Plan" published in 2000 set the target of March 2003 for all National Health Service staff to have access to email. This target is now reflected in the National Programme for Information Technology in the NHS that provides a new approach to delivering IT in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30917w31.html_para6">At 31 March 2003 NHS trusts reported via the information for health tracking database that 79 per cent. of all NHS staff (822,000 of a total of 1,037,000) had access to email and web browsing. Priority had been given to staff directly involved in the patient care process, so that 98 per cent. of consultants (28,600 of 28,700) and 82 per cent. of clinical staff (602,000 of 732,000, including consultants) had connectivity by that date.

<P>

<a name="30917w31.html_para7">The new centrally provided NHS national email service is now available to all staff, although take-up is a matter for local priorities. The NHS Directory (electronic address book) is one of the largest in the world and today holds 930,000 entries. The simple mail transfer protocol relay service through which internal NHS messaging, including e-mail, is handled, carried over 30 million messages in August 2003.

 Information on the prescribing budgets notified to the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) by each Primary Care Trust has been placed in the Library. They are practice level prescribing budgets. They do not necessarily reflect the total resource set aside locally for prescribing as Primary Care Trusts may hold contingency reserves. Information is now available for the entire financial year (up to and including March 2003) so the outurn and overspend figures are actual figures, not forecasted ones.

<a name="30917w33.html_para0">In June 2002, three pilot exercises commissioned by the Department of Health commenced to examine the electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP). The pilots explained options for linking computerised general practitioner practices to local community pharmacies and the Prescription Pricing Authority using the NHSnet. The pilots, which formally closed at the end of June 2003, were independently evaluated and have helped to identify the benefits, risks and costs associated with ETP. These findings will be used to inform the development of a sustainable, national prescription service which is an integral part of the national health service information technology strategy.

 The Government recognise that the transition from welfare to work can be difficult for many. Consequently it has developed a range of measures to ease the move to new employment. The Job Grant offers &#163;100 to longer-term benefit claimants who move into work. From October 2004 eligibility for the Job Grant will be extended and a new higher rate of &#163;250 for households with children will be introduced.
<P>

<a name="30917w34.html_para11">These enhanced arrangements will replace the Back to Work Bonus and the lone parent Income Support run-on.
<P>

<a name="30917w34.html_para12">They will also be complemented by further changes to additional support. From April 2003, access to the Adviser Discretion Fund (ADF) has been extended to all those who have been claiming benefits for six months or more to meet essential costs of moving into work. In addition, from April 2004 a series of measures to simplify the administration of Housing Benefit will be introduced. These will include ending the requirement for claimants to submit a new claim each time they return to work. Instead they will only need to report their change in circumstances, making the move into work easier and smoother.
<P>

<a name="30917w34.html_para13">Further details of all these measures can be found in the 2002 Pre-Budget Report and 2003 Budget Report.
