<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Local authorities have the power to charge the person who they consider has abandoned a vehicle&#151;for removal, storage and disposal costs&#151;irrespective of whether a vehicle is licensed or not.
<P>

<a name="30609w01.html_para14">Local authorities have, however, had increasing difficulty in enforcing these charges because of the ease with which vehicles can fall out of the current UK vehicles register. New measures being introduced in January 2004, including an automatic &#163;80 fine for failure to re-license a vehicle on time, should help remedy this problem by ensuring that a vehicle has a traceable keeper. If local authorities can enforce charges against those who abandon cars, this should act as a deterrent to their doing so.

 We have no figures for the total length of hedgerows on the Isle of Wight, nor do we have actual figures for the length of hedgerows protected by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997. However, research carried out in 1999 indicated that more than 70 per cent. of countryside hedgerows may be protected by the Regulations by virtue of the fact that they form an integral part of a pre-1845 field system&#151;a criterion that, when met, allows local planning authorities to refuse applications for removal. As the Regulations also lay down other criteria that can be used to prevent removal, the proportion protected may well be greater than 70 per cent., across the country as a whole.

 No estimates have yet been made of what weight of waste will be dealt with in each of the ways listed in 2010. The amount of waste treated under the different waste management options will depend on the actions of householders, waste disposal and collection authorities, business and others, in response to the measures Government have, or intend to, put in place including the targets listed below, to reduce waste growth and increase levels of re-use and recycling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Special waste is the term used in the UK for hazardous waste and is defined in Regulation 2 of the Special Waste Regulations 1996. Hazardous waste is the term defined in the Hazardous Waste Directive (91/689/EEC) as a waste featuring on the European hazardous waste list. This list was recently revised and the European Commission brought the new list into force on 1 January 2002. At present, the Special Waste Regulations are still extant in Great Britain and the term "special" waste is still used in many waste management licences. However, some legislation such as the landfill regulations, already refer to "hazardous" waste as defined in the Hazardous Waste Directive. This means that some wastes not defined as special wastes in UK legislation would still have to dealt with in accordance with the requirements for "hazardous" wastes if disposed of to landfill. The Government are also reviewing the Special Waste Regulations and as part of the review the intention is to replace the term "special" with "hazardous", and to transpose the revised hazardous waste list.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The United Kingdom and other European Union member states are required, under the terms of the recently agreed Directive on the Promotion of Biofuels and other Renewable Fuels for Road Transport, to set their own indicative targets for the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in their areas. Member states are required to set indicative targets to be met in the years 2005 and 2010, and to notify the European Commission of these targets by July 2005 and July 2006 respectively. The Government will consult key stakeholders in due course on possible indicative targets for biofuels sales and sales of other renewable fuels in the UK, as well as on the most appropriate ways of meeting these targets. Regulations will then be laid before the House in advance of the Directive's transposition date of 31 December 2004.
<P>

<a name="30609w04.html_para0">The Government have already put in place a number of measures to incentivise the production and use of biofuels in the UK. These include a 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive for biodiesel, which came into effect in July 2002. Sales of biodiesel in the UK have increased significantly as a result of this, and are now getting on for a million litres a month. Budget 2003 announced that a similar duty incentive in favour of bioethanol would come into effect in January 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will take steps to investigate the basis on which car manufacturers impose a lower limit for the use of biofuels in the UK than in the rest of the EU for the purposes of the engine warranty.  [117593]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Almost all new diesel cars can run on biodiesel without any problems and without invalidating the manufacturer's engine warranty, provided that the biodiesel is blended into mineral diesel at a ratio of no more than 5 per cent. biodiesel to 95 per cent. mineral diesel, and provided that the biodiesel itself is of good quality. Higher rates of biodiesel in blends could cause performance problems and engine damage in some vehicles and would currently invalidate most vehicle manufacturer's vehicle warranties, both in the UK and elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30609w04.html_para1">The suitability of any diesel vehicle to run on blends consisting of more than 5 per cent. biodiesel is dependent upon the make and model of the car, rather than the country in which it is sold and used. For example, new Volkswagen diesel cars are warranted to run on 100 per cent. biodiesel anywhere in the EU. Supplies of 100 per cent. biodiesel are not widely available in the UK, however, and studies show that a greater environmental benefit can be achieved by using the available fuel in blends with mineral diesel than by using it as 100 per cent. biodiesel.
<P>

<a name="30609w04.html_para2">Bioethanol, which can be used as a blend in petrol cars, is not yet on sale in the UK. Budget 2003 announced that a duty incentive for bioethanol of 20 pence per litre would be introduced in January 2005. Ford has developed a 'flex-fuel' petrol-engined vehicle, which can run on blends of up to 85 per cent. bioethanol, and which is already on sale in some other European countries (notably Sweden). Once bioethanol becomes available in the UK, it is likely that similar vehicles will be sold here, with similar warranties.

 A wide range of community transport services have since 1 May last year been eligible for the first time to receive Bus Service Operators Grant from my Department. 800 community transport organisations have already been accepted as eligible under this scheme. Expenditure in the scheme's first financial year, 2002&#150;03, was &#163;0.6 million and is expected to rise to &#163;3 million this year.
<P>

<a name="30609w05.html_para3">Community transport has also benefited significantly since 1998 from support of projects submitted successfully by local authorities to our Rural and Urban Bus Challenge competitions. We estimate that around one-third of the 400 projects supported under these schemes have a community transport element. In total over &#163;120 million has been awarded in Challenge grants to local authorities. However, it is not possible to identify separately the proportion of this total paid by authorities to community transport bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 For 2001&#150;02, the latest year for which figures are available, the Highways Agency allowed &#163;175,333,000 for depreciation of the trunk road network in England. This figure relates almost entirely to bridges and tunnels, as the roads themselves are depreciated on a renewals accounting basis; that is, the level of expenditure on maintenance is treated as a proxy for the depreciation charge on the asset. Further details are available in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts 2001&#150;02, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="30609w06.html_para0">Local highway authorities in England are not currently required to value their road assets nor to establish a basis on which to depreciate them. The total provision for local highway maintenance in the 10-Year-Plan is &#163;30.5 billion, of which &#163;9.2 billion is capital funding and &#163;21.3 billion is revenue funding. This is linked to the Plan target of eliminating the backlogs in road maintenance by the end of the Plan period.

The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (SI 3113) specify the appearance of traffic signals, and of signs and markings associated with signals and roundabouts, and the circumstances in which traffic signs and signals may be placed.

 On 29 November draft guidance, including a draft set of descriptions of each of the types of SEN we will be collecting, was sent out to a sample of 50 schools, 30 LEAs and 50 voluntary organisations for consultation. At the same time the information was placed on the DfES Consultation website. Comments were requested on both the accuracy and the clarity of the descriptions and respondents were also asked to make general comments. The consultation closed on 6 March 2003 and 120 responses were received. Amendments to the guidance have now been made in the light of the responses received.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures he plans to introduce to widen participation in higher education for <i>(a)</i> ethnic minorities, <i>(b)</i> people with disabilities and <i>(c)</i> those of working class backgrounds.  [108270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w08.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We are committed to widening participation in higher education for under-represented groups. While ethnic minorities are generally well represented in higher education, we recognise that there are pockets of under-representation. The Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE) and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service are looking to see what data are available for monitoring purposes.
<P>

<a name="30609w08.html_para5">Through amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which came into effect in September 2002, we have made it unlawful for institutions to discriminate against disabled students in their admissions procedures. HEFCE has, since last year, included benchmark figures for participation by disabled students in its performance indicators for higher education. We have improved the assessment of Disabled Students Allowances, which are now being completed well before the start of the course, giving disabled students confidence about the level and nature of support.
<P>

<a name="30609w08.html_para6">In order to widen participation to those from working class backgrounds, we need to raise levels of attainment, raise aspirations and encourage more applications. Our Aimhigher programme helps universities, colleges and schools to work together to achieve this, and we have recently announced an extension of this programme into 86 new areas over the next three years. The Office for Fair Access will encourage further improvements to widening access through access agreements, which will set out the universities' plans to offer bursaries and other financial support, encourage more applicants from less advantaged backgrounds, and which will include their own ambitions. If there are any particular issues around specific groups relating to any one university, we would expect that university to have plans to address the problem.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the funding of higher education after the introduction of top-up fees.  [116586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w08.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 As set out in the White Paper 'The future of higher education' (Cm 5735), the funding for higher education will increase by over 6 per cent. a year in each of the three years to 2005&#150;06 as a result of the 2002 Spending Review settlement, so that total spending in England in that year will be almost &#163;10 billion. The funding in 2006&#150;07 will be determined through the forthcoming Spending Review, and will be supplemented by additional income generated through the introduction of a graduate contribution scheme for differential fees. The White Paper also made clear, however, that in order to meet the challenges of the future, universities need to develop other non-governmental funding streams. Therefore, in addition to the Graduate Contribution Scheme, the White Paper set out proposals in connection with the development of endowments and maximising donations from alumni.

 We have said many times in the House that we have no intention of closing small school sixth forms where they are successful and popular and meet the needs of their communities. Indeed such sixth forms are an important part of the pattern of provision.

<P>
<a name="30609w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The calculation of Sefton MBC's Education Formula Spending Share (FSS) takes account of the estimated number of children between the ages of 3 and 16 with high levels of educational need. Sefton's overall FSS determines the general funding received through the authority through Revenue Support Grant. The authority decides how much of this funding is used to support spending on educational services for children and people with learning difficulties, disabilities and other special educational needs&#151;it is not possible to identify a separate funding allocation for these services.
<P>

<a name="30609w10.html_para0">The authority also receives funding from the Learning and Skills Council for students over the age of 16 with special educational needs.

 The DCMS has in place an asbestos register in respect of buildings on the estate. The audit and assessment of any asbestos still in situ in buildings is a three yearly occurrence in addition to any risk assessment that would be necessary prior to any works which might disturb asbestos in the structure of the buildings. The same applies to the Royal Parks Agency. Non-departmental public bodies, of which the Department has 60, are autonomous in respect of management of their estate, much of which is minority leased holdings in commercial buildings.

 The Government's Work-Life Balance Campaign actively encourages businesses to follow best practice and offer flexible working opportunities. The Government recently launched the 5th round of the Work Life Balance Challenge Fund, inviting employers to apply by 31 July 2003 for consultancy support to introduce new working arrangements, including flexible working, within their organisations.
<P>

<a name="30609w12.html_para2">On 6 April 2003 the Government introduced a new flexible working law providing mothers and fathers of children under six or disabled children under 18 with the right to apply for flexible working, and placing a duty on employers to consider such requests seriously.
<P>

<a name="30609w12.html_para3">To promote the new right, the Government launched awareness-raising activity last Autumn. We ran a six-week advertising campaign in the national press prior to the new law coming into force, and we briefed representatives of the consumer and life-style media so that they could include articles in their publications, such as parenting magazines.
<P>

<a name="30609w12.html_para4">We have also produced extensive guidance both on the internet at www.dti.gov.uk/workingparents and in hard copy. This includes a set of forms based on best-practice, case studies and user-friendly "How to . . ." tips. Guidance is also available in an interactive form at www.tiger.gov.uk and helpline support is being provided by AC AS on 08457 474747.

 For projects where the cover has been made available since September 2001, ECGD understands all are so far proceeding within the original cost. About 8 per cent. have required a time extension.
<P>

<a name="30609w13.html_para11">It is not unusual for the complex projects which ECGD supports to depart from the original timetable envisaged in the contract. Cost overruns or contractual delays are matters primarily to be resolved between the contractual parties, though ECGD may, as a result of such resolution, be asked to amend the terms of its support. ECGD does not, therefore, monitor this aspect across the whole range of its portfolio. However, ECGD does require notification of any such changes on individual cases, which might possibly affect the risk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w13.html_spnew18"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 ECGD's application process requires certain details of agents' commission to be disclosed to ECGD in order that it can follow its due diligence procedures. In this case such due diligence procedures were followed and no irregularities were detected. For reasons of commercial confidentiality specific details of the commission paid cannot be revealed.

 As at 31 March 2003 sovereign debt owing to ECGD under rescheduling agreements negotiated under the auspices of the Paris Club amounted to &#163;9.6 billion. This debt portfolio consisted of &#163;5.4 billion original debt &#163;3.5 billion of capitalised interest and &#163;700 million interest in arrears.

Moreover, workers must be paid at least the national minimum wage on average for the period of time over which their wages are calculated. Employees are protected against dismissal for asserting their right not to suffer unlawful deductions from wages and enforcing their right to the national minimum wage.

 In March I spoke on the telephone with Andrew Natsios and also wrote to him. The note of that conversation and the letter cannot be placed in the Library since they contain commercially confidential information. However I can let the hon. Member know that I used the telephone conversation and my letter to reinforce my strong wish that UK companies should be given the opportunity to play a full role in reconstruction work in Iraq. I gave Mr. Natsios details of British companies that have relevant experience and were interested in working in Iraq, together with details of companies who had direct experience of working in Iraq through the Oil for Food programme and/or before sanctions were imposed. Mr. Natsios confirmed that he would welcome the involvement of British companies and that he had already agreed to waive the normal requirement that only US companies might bid for work funded by the US Agency for International Development.

 Repeated internal conflict over the last 25 years, the collapse of legitimate economic activity and continuing insecurity in many parts of Afghanistan have all contributed to the creation of the conditions in which drug cultivation and processing have flourished. The Afghan Transitional Administration have made clear their determination to eliminate drugs from the Afghan economy and society.

The UK is leading a Provincial Reconstruction Team in Mazar-e-Sharif and has pledged &#163;200 million of development assistance over five years (2002&#150;07). Since development assistance helps to create the conditions in which viable alternatives to poppy cultivation can emerge, the total cost of eliminating drugs cannot be clearly separated from these broader development programmes.

 The FCO is party to the Whitehall wide target of reducing (weather-corrected) CO2 emissions from buildings on the Government estate by 1 per cent. per annum relative to the base-year 1999&#150;2000. To date, we have met this target through the purchase of green electricity exempt from the climate change levy and by a small reduction in consumption through closer building temperature control. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will agree new targets for 2010, based on benchmarking the performance of individual buildings where possible, by the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="30609w18.html_para0">We have recently reviewed energy consumption across our estate. As a result, we now intend to set further specific efficiency targets which we aim to achieve by upgrading building facilities, using more energy efficient equipment, staff awareness campaigns and improved monitoring.

 The issue of the detainees' rights under international law is linked, at least in part, to the question of their status, which depends on all the facts of the individual cases. Whatever their status, the detainees are entitled to humane treatment and if prosecuted, a fair trial. We have made this clear to the United States authorities. They have assured us they will treat the detainees humanely and consistently with the principles of the Geneva Conventions.

<a name="30609w18.html_para1">UK officials visited the British detainees in Guantanamo Bay for a fifth time in April. As part of this visit they checked on the welfare of the detainees who appeared generally to be in sound physical health. The physical conditions of their detention appear to be satisfactory.

<a name="30609w18.html_para2">There remained, on 18 March, no evidence to show that Iraq's weapons had been destroyed.

 In recent months, the UK, other EU member states and other countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, have pressed the importance of ratification on the Russians on many occasions at ministerial and official level. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wrote to President Putin earlier this year urging ratification and the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and the current President of the European Council, Costas Simitis, wrote more recently. President Putin's replies of 4 February and 9 May 2003 respectively stated that Russia hoped to be in a position to make a recommendation to the State Duma on the issue in the near future. We are now working more closely with Russia to address the technical issues surrounding Kyoto implementation. For example, last month the European Commission hosted a seminar for Russian and EU officials, which discussed these practical issues and the UK jointly funded with other European countries a seminar in Moscow on 'Implementing Kyoto'.

It was never our intention that the new Residence should provide for entertainment on the same scale as the old. Comparisons based on the presumed extra cost incurred by moving to a smaller Residence are therefore unnecessary. I am satisfied that this is a good deal for the taxpayer.

 The Ministry of Defence has not allocated resources specifically to reduce opium production in Afghanistan. Increased security and stability are vital to Afghanistan's attempts to reduce opium production. Our contributions towards this have been considerable through Operation FINGAL (our contribution to International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)) and Operation VERITAS (our contribution to the coalition against international terrorism). The costs for these operations for Financial Year 2002&#150;03 are approximately &#163;30 million and &#163;170 million respectively.

 The Government will continue to ensure that sufficient troops are available to meet the tasks that we ask them to perform. The exact percentage of personnel available for operational duties at any given moment is a combination of a number of factors. These include the level of preparedness of forces, governed by readiness and position in the training cycle, and by the nature of the operation. Time would be needed to bring some force elements to the required level of training for particularly demanding operational theatres. Equally, the medical condition of individual service personnel may impact on their availability for operations, though

The latter is the responsibility of the host nation with whom our Attaches and Fleet Security authorities liaise closely to ensure that adequate security measures, commensurate with the perceived threat, are put in place. Ultimately, a visit may be cancelled if it is considered that the risks outweigh the benefits to be gained from Defence Diplomacy. Measures vary considerably with the perceived threat but have included armed patrol vessel escorts to berths, booms placed around the ship, armed guards on the jetty and controlled access to the port and the ship.

This master list subsumes the 146 sites referred to by the Prime Minister on 14 April 2003 and includes sites identified by our Coalition partners. These sites are being investigated as quickly as practicable and we expect further sites to be identified as investigations progress. Such sites are only one potential form of evidence; others could include delivery systems, documentation or interviews with relevant Iraqi personnel.

 Formal Elementary Flying Training (EFT) has been conducted at the University Air Squadrons (UAS) since 1993. Records of financial benefits have not been kept. However, we have recently studied the benefits of conducting EFT at the UASs compared with providing this training on a regional basis or at central location following recruitment to the Royal Air Force (RAF). The regional option offered no benefits. The central location option did offer a marginal cost benefit, but was not adopted because of the high risk that the removal of flying training from the UASs would render them less attractive to undergraduates and would, consequently, lose the support of universities for the UAS system as a whole. Additionally, there would be a reduction in return of service from graduates entering the RAF through non-flying UASs since these individuals would have to spend several months completing EFT before progressing to the more advanced phases of pilot training.
<P>

<a name="30609w23.html_para1">We are transferring the RAF Direct Entrant EFT currently undertaken at the Joint Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Church Fenton to the UASs when the current contract expires early My 2003. This is expected to yield savings of at least &#163;1.5 million a year.

 Section 43 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) provides for the withdrawal of financial support only to asylum seekers.

<i> Pursuant to her reply, 20 May 2003, 753W.</i> I regret that due to an administrative error the information given in the text was not wholly complete. The complete answer should have been that the nationality of people who are removed from the UK after being detained under Immigration Act powers or on completion of a prison sentence is not available and could only be obtained by examining individual cases files, this would be at disproportionate cost.

<a name="30609w24.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government are committed to removing unnecessary administrative burdens and legal restrictions on charities. We undertook to implement a package of measures to that end, by means of a Regulatory Reform Order (RRO). The need for an RRO has now been overtaken by the review undertaken by the Strategy Unit (SU) 'Private Action, Public Benefit'. We expect to announce our response to the consultation on the SU Report in the summer. We announced in February this year that a Charities Bill would be prepared and published in draft as soon as practicable. The reforms originally proposed for inclusion in the RRO will be considered for inclusion in a Charities Bill.

There has never been any question or possibility of removal from the UK either directly or indirectly to Chechnya. Whether or not an individual removed from the UK to the Russian Federation chooses to return to Chechnya is the decision of that individual.

 The Police Bureaucracy Taskforce's report, which was published on 17 September 2002, recommended that responsibility for dealing with stray dogs should be transferred, in full, to local authorities. The Home Office is continuing to discuss with relevant stakeholders how this recommendation should be taken forward within local government.

 We are working actively to ensure that Iraqis can be assisted to return voluntarily to their homeland as soon as practicable. Many Iraqis in the United Kingdom have skills, which will be of value to the reconstruction of Iraq. The Government are committed to helping clear the way for them to do so.
<P>

<a name="30609w25.html_para1">We already have the Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP) in place. This programme is available to all nationalities and includes Iraqis. A number of Iraqis have already approached the International Organisation for Migration and they are making arrangements for their return over the next few weeks. VARRP facilitates assisted voluntary return as well as providing additional in kind reintegration assistance in the country of origin. The reintegration assistance is worth up to an approximate value of &#163;500.
<P>

<a name="30609w25.html_para2">We are consulting United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration, refugee sector non-governmental organisations and Iraqi communities in the United Kingdom on the type of additional programmes that will be appropriate to facilitate voluntary return to Iraq. No decisions regarding the exact nature of the return programme that might be offered has yet been made.

 We have received several letters from chief police officers and from the Police Federation on health concerns relating to the new TETRA mobile radio system for the police service. We have also received helpful feedback directly from police officers through a series of seminars on TETRA health issues held across the country over the last 10 months.

<a name="30609w26.html_para0">The Home Office has taken advice from independent experts. The experts concluded that TETRA technology was unlikely to pose a risk to health and recommended further research to address remaining areas of uncertainty. Results from the extensive programme of work we set up in response to those recommendations are now becoming available. No effects of TETRA technology on health have been found so far.

 It is Government policy that census returns are closed to public inspection for 100 years. This was restated in the White Paper "The 2001 Census of Population 2001" (Cm 4253) para. 121, March 1999.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what recent assessment she has made of the effect of payments to those involved in criminal cases by journalists upon the judicial processes; and if she will make a statement.  [117814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w26.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In 2002, the Lord Chancellor published a consultation paper proposing to ban payments to witnesses by journalists during criminal proceedings because of the risk they pose to the administration of justice. This followed recommendations by the then National Heritage Select Committee and an inter-departmental working group.
<P>

<a name="30609w26.html_para7">Following the consultation and further discussions, the Press Complaints Commission and other media organisations agreed to change their own codes to achieve this ban. They also agreed to regulate, for the first time, payments to potential witnesses made before criminal proceedings begin but when they are 'likely and foreseeable'. These can only be made when they are demonstrably necessary and in the public interest, for example to expose a crime.

<P>

<a name="30609w26.html_para8">The amended Press Code took effect on 18 March 2003. The Government have said that they will legislate to ban payments should self-regulation prove ineffective.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when the Lord Chancellor received the Treasury documents relating to the five economic tests and the 18 background studies; what discussions he has held with ministerial colleagues on the tests since receipt of the documents; when he expects to complete his analysis of the documents; and what representations <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> departmental officials will make to other Departments before a decision is reached on the economic tests.

 The Treasury's 18 supporting studies on EMU were sent to Cabinet Ministers on 16 May. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are holding meetings with Cabinet Members. There was an initial discussion at Cabinet on 22 May followed by a special Cabinet meeting on 5 June. The Chancellor has today made a statement to the House of Commons.

<a name="30609w27.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Section 10 of the European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 (EPR) requires the Electoral Commission to make a recommendation to the Lord Chancellor before 1 September 2003 as to the electoral region to be combined with Gibraltar. Section 11 of the EPR Act enables the Lord Chancellor to specify the region by order, and he would expect to do so shortly after receiving the recommendation from the Electoral Commission.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what financial savings the Lord Chancellor's Department will make when the responsibility for issuing liquor licences is removed from magistrates.  [116742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w27.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 My Department has not yet undertaken a full costing but it is unlikely there will be significant savings for the Department. The licensing judges and magistrates courts currently recover part of their costs through fees, so only limited savings will be made when responsibility for issuing liquor licenses is removed from magistrates. The magistrates' and clerks' manpower on licensing will be re-deployed so as to reduce unnecessary delay in criminal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30609w27.html_para1">Some savings are expected from changes to the appeal system. Appeals against decisions made by local authorities will be heard by magistrates courts, rather than the Crown Court where the cost of an appeal sitting is greater. The view of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is that the number of appeals to the magistrates court will not exceed the number of appeals currently handled by the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="30609w27.html_para2">During the transitional period the Department is likely to have increased costs as the courts will still be incurring the costs of enforcement without the income from renewed licenses.

<a name="30609w27.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Good progress is being made in creating a world class mental health service, as envisaged in the Wanless Report. Early targets, set in the mental health national service framework and the NHS Plan, have been met and progress is also being made towards the remainder, including a range of specialised teams and services; new staff and new ways of working.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w27.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Implementation of the document Developing Services for Carers and Families of people with mental illness is the responsibility of commissioners and providers of health and social care mental health services. Primary care trusts also have a vital role to play in identifying and supporting carers of people with mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="30609w27.html_para3">The NHS Plan published in July 2000 provided for extra annual investment of over &#163;300 million by 2003&#150;04 to support plans for modernisation and additional resources are delivered within general allocation; funds which are not ring-fenced. This arrangement, consistent with the principles set out in Shifting the Balance of Power, permits resources to be more closely matched to the needs of local people, and enables primary care trusts to take full account of strengths or gaps in local services. Strategic health authorities performance manage PCTs for their responsibilities in this regard, consistent with national guidance and the objectives set out in their local delivery plans.
<P>

<a name="30609w27.html_para4">The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE), including its development centres, are supporting local services and communities to implement this guidance.

 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been considered primarily as disorders of childhood, and are described in the International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10) and the U.S. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), where clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines are to be found. Diagnosis is clearly a matter for the responsible medical practitioner, but I understand that the position concerning ADD/ADHD in adults is less clear. I gather that evidence is accumulating that the disorder found in childhood may persist into adulthood and in some cases be first diagnosed in adulthood.

<i>[holding answer 3 June 2003]:</i> Professional indemnity should ensure that patients who have suffered harm receive the compensation to which they are entitled. Indemnity cover should be occurrence based; that is, claims are met that arise from events which occurred when the clinician was covered but only later come to light, even if this is after the period of cover has ceased. Experience in the United Kingdom is that proper indemnity cover can be provided through membership of a defence society or a suitable insurance policy.

<P>
<a name="30609w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 An on-going rolling programme of events and initiatives is being taken forward to mark the European Year of People with Disabilities (EYPD) in Northern Ireland. This started with the widely publicised official launch of EYPD in Grosvenor House Belfast on 22 January 2003. Since then, Government have made available &#163;100,000 to support 22 small, local projects in Northern Ireland. This adds to the &#163;222,000 awarded to 12 Northern Ireland projects from the UK fund for the Year. These projects will make a significant contribution to the objectives of the Year, which are to increase awareness of rights and increase participation of people with disability in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30609w32.html_para8">Examples of projects being undertaken include the Compass Advocacy Group Regional Development Project, which received funding to establish a comprehensive network of user-led self-advocacy groups in each Health Board area for people with learning disabilities; and the Circles Network, a Northern Ireland Partnership in Policy Making Programme, which received funding to work in partnership with the four Health Boards to facilitate a range of leadership/empowerment courses for disabled people and for the parents and carers of disabled people.
<P>

<a name="30609w32.html_para9">These and other regional and local activities are being co-ordinated in partnership with the Equality Commission, local government, the voluntary and business sectors and trade unions.
<P>

<a name="30609w32.html_para10">A list of events and activities has been placed in the Library of the House and this will be updated throughout the Year as plans are finalised. Information will also be published on the website www.eypdni.gov.uk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w33.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have always recognised that there will be a small group of people who we cannot pay directly into an account and the Department is committed to developing an alternative method to pay this group.
<P>

<a name="30609w33.html_para9">We have analysed a range of options and currently a cheque based solution accommodates most known requirements, however further research with Specific Interest Groups and customers will inform the final decision.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w33.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether benefits paid directly into and held in <i>(a)</i> Post Office card accounts, <i>(b)</i> basic bank accounts and <i>(c)</i> other bank accounts are disregarded for the purposes of calculating entitlement to benefits; and if he will make a statement.  [117586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w33.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 In the context of income-related benefits, resources are either income or capital. In general, any benefit paid to a person is treated as income for the period to which the payment relates, and is therefore not subject at that time to the capital rules for income-related benefits. Any unspent income after that period would be treated as capital and subject to the normal capital rules. This applies regardless of the method of payment or type of bank account into which the benefit is paid.
<P>

<a name="30609w33.html_para10">Some payments of arrears of benefit are classed as capital but are subject to a full disregard for 52 weeks from the date they are received.

<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 2003 : Column 702W</I><P>
what criteria will be applied to determine whether a person will qualify for the exceptions service through being unable to open or manage an account; and if he will make a statement.  [118186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w33.html_spnew11"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our plan is to design the exceptions service to properly meet the needs of the small minority of our customers, who are unable to open or manage an account This will be based on an understanding of the problems such customers will face. We will closely monitor the way the new Direct Payment arrangements work in practice and work with customer representative groups to design a secure and efficient service which meets the needs of those customers who cannot manage accounts.

 Around half of all pensioner households will be entitled to Pension Credit when it is introduced in October and stand to gain &#163;400 a year on average. We are committed to ensuring that as many of them as possible take it up.
<P>

<a name="30609w34.html_para0">We estimate that by October 2003 around 1.8 million MIG claims will be automatically transferred to Pension Credit. Between October 2003 and October 2004 we expect to take on a further million successful applicants for Pension Credit.

<P>
<a name="30609w34.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have set a challenging target to reduce fraud and error in Housing Benefit for working age people. We are working with local authorities to achieve a 25 per cent. reduction in March 2006.
<P>

<a name="30609w34.html_para3">We are already using a wide range of initiatives to tackle Housing Benefit fraud. Since January 2003 the Department has funded Departmental solicitors to take forward prosecutions on behalf of local authorities. Our joint effort with local authorities is paying dividends&#151;local authority prosecutions and sanctions for benefit fraud have more than doubled in the last two years.

<P><I>9 Jun 2003 : Column 703W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30609w34.html_para4">In addition, 81 per cent. of local authorities have now signed up to our Verification Framework, which stops fraud getting into the system in the first place. Additional funding has been made available from April, resulting in an across-the-board 50 per cent. increase for local authorities already compliant with the scheme or considering taking it up.
<P>

<a name="30609w34.html_para5">For the first time we are undertaking an ongoing review of fraud and error in Housing Benefit and first results will be available later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w34.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We launched Measuring Child Poverty: a consultation document in April 2002. We received over 80 detailed written responses to the consultation and have gathered feedback from workshops in London and Edinburgh with academics and organisations interested in child poverty measurement. We have also organised workshops in partnership with organisations such as the Children's Society, Barnardo's, Children in Wales and the European Anti-Poverty Network&#151;to gather the views of children, young people and adults with direct experience of poverty.
<P>

<a name="30609w34.html_para6">Measuring Child Poverty Consultation: preliminary conclusions was published in May 2003. This outlines recommendations and next steps based on a thorough analysis of the responses to the consultation.

 The recent Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and Saving for Retirement' (Cm5677) set out proposals to minimise the number of pension scheme closures or wind-ups by encouraging employers to promote and persevere with pension schemes of all kinds.

 We have made a commitment to introduce legislation to tackle age discrimination in the workplace by 2006. Consultation on this will be taken forward by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="30609w35.html_para0">In advance of this we have launched our Age Positive campaign to encourage employers to employ workers of all ages. The campaign is raising employers' awareness of the business benefits that older workers can bring, as well as the benefits to older people of staying in the workforce.

<a name="30609w35.html_para1">The success of our New Deal 50 plus programme is also contributing to our wider campaign to tackle age discrimination. By the end of March this year over 98,000 people had moved into work with the help of New Deal 50 plus.

<P>
<a name="30609w35.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) if he will make a statement on the means by which the administration of <i>(a)</i> housing and <i>(b)</i> council tax benefit by local authorities is funded;  [94004]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the cost to <i>(a)</i> his Department and its predecessor and <i>(b)</i> local authorities of administering (i) housing and (ii) council tax benefit was in the last four years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.  [94005]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30609w35.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks  </B> 
<i>[pursuant to his answer, 3 April 2003, Official Report, c. 835&#150;37W]:</i> Half of the administration subsidy for both housing benefit and council tax benefit is funded through a grant from the Department for Work and Pensions. This is allocated to individual local authorities using a formula agreed in consultation with the local authority associations. The formula takes account of the size of the caseload and the complexity of housing benefit cases, with elements for accommodation and staffing costs. The remaining half is funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive through the Revenue Support Grant (Grant Aided Expenditure in Scotland) within their local government finance settlements.
<P>

<a name="30609w35.html_para3">From 2003&#150;04, administration subsidy will be paid entirely by this Department as one direct grant to local authorities. During 2003&#150;04, we will also distribute an additional &#163;33 million for on-going and transitional costs associated with the introduction of the pension credit as well as &#163;11 million for on-going costs associated with new tax credits.
<P>

<a name="30609w35.html_para4">The Department also helps fund the administration of the Verification Framework and payments are made through the Help Fund to support various local authority led initiatives aimed at improving housing benefit administration where lack of funds is a barrier. A further &#163;223 million Verification Framework funding is being made available for the three years from April 2003. This will provide a 50 per cent. increase in both set-up and on-going funding. We are also investing &#163;200 million over the next three years in helping authorities meet the new Performance Standards.
<P>

<a name="30609w35.html_para5">Actual expenditure on the administration of these benefits, as reported by local authorities, exceeds the total subsidy provided by central Government. Local authorities account for their expenditure in very different ways. For example, some will include a portion of central charges for administrative costs that will have little to do with housing benefit administration in their housing benefit costs. Some will provide a cost net of additional grants from the Department. Because the data reported by authorities do not reflect a uniform accounting standard across authorities, reported expenditure across all authorities may not be directly comparable with the grants paid figures.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to valuing and promoting diversity and equality of treatment for all regardless of age, and has taken steps to integrate age into equal opportunity policies.

Of our allocation, in 2001&#150;02 &#163;74.2 million was specified for use in CTB administration, a similar amount was supplied by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive. However, the formulae used to split funds between HB and CTB by these administrations are slightly different, therefore the exact amounts may vary.

<a name="30609w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and its predecessors have regularly received representations on various aspects of the risks of all types of inappropriate development, including house building, in areas at risk from river and coastal flooding. These risks have for many years been reflected in planning guidance to local authorities, most recently in Planning Policy Guidance Note 25, "Development and Flood Risk", published in July 2001. This updated, strengthened and replaced the previous guidance in Department of the Environment Circular 30/92. In particular, it introduced a risk-based approach that matches types of development to levels of risk.It makes clear that residential development is not appropriate in the functional flood plain, where excess water must flow in times of flood. In less high-risk areas that are already developed, further residential building may be possible,

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by the then Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on 7 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 25W, in respect of the years before 2001&#150;02. While information in not collected in the form requested, the operation of the policies on development in flood risk areas in PPG25, "Development and Flood Risk", is monitored by the Environment Agency through its high level target 12, which it reports to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and to the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs. The latest report, for 2001&#150;02, shows that around 800 dwellings in England&#151;less than 0.5 per cent. of the total&#151;were subject to sustained objections by the Environment Agency on grounds of flood risk, but permitted after consideration by the local authorities concerned. Since about 10 per cent. of the land area and population of England is within the area of the Agency's indicative flood plain maps, this shows that local authorities are already giving serious consideration to flood risk in permitting new housing developments.
