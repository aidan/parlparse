<P>
<a name="90326w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 A Government White Paper, "The Future Management of Crown Copyright", has been published today (Cm 4300). This document provides a blueprint which sets out the underlying principles which will be at the heart of future licensing of official material. This marks the culmination of a wide ranging consultation exercise initiated by the Government's Green Paper, "Crown Copyright in the Information Age" (Cm 3819), which was published in January 1998.
<P>

<a name="90326w01.htm_para0">The challenge for the Government has been to establish a licensing regime for official material which is responsive to the needs of the citizen and the information industry. It is also important that we embrace the opportunities offered by new technology to encourage access to Government information as we approach the 21st Century. Our aim, therefore, has been to deliver a licensing policy which preserves the integrity and authority of official information, yet at the same time is also flexible, streamlined and transparent for users.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90326w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Conditions on the island now allow for the introduction of a scheme to fulfil the promise I made in September 1997 that the Department for International Development (DFID) would pay the return air fares of those Montserratians who had relocated to the UK or within the Caribbean because of the volcanic activity, who were in need and wished to return to Montserrat, when conditions allowed. The latest volcanic assessment concludes that there has been no resumption of magmatic eruption since March 1998 and that risk levels of a major volcanic eruption are now similar to those in other Caribbean volcanic islands. Projects are underway to encourage small enterprise development and to provide adequate housing for those people who relocated from the south of the island and are now living in a shelter or unsuitable shared accommodation in the north.
<P>

<a name="90326w01.htm_para2">Eligible applicants will be provided with a one-way non-transferable economy class ticket from their current place of residence to Montserrat, plus an additional air freight allowance, travel costs to the airport of embarkation in the UK and overnight subsistence costs in Antigua, where required.
<P>

<a name="90326w01.htm_para3">In order to qualify for the scheme, applicants will need to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) demonstrate that they were resident on the island on 18 July 1995;</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90326w01.htm_para4">The scheme will operate for an initial period of 2 years and be administered by the DFID office in Antigua and by the Montserrat Community Support Trust (MCST) in the UK. Applicants in the Caribbean will be invited to register with the DFID office in Antigua or the British Representative in the island where they are living after 1 May whilst those in the UK can register with MCST after 1 June. Further details will be announced nearer the date of commencement.
<P>

<a name="90326w01.htm_para5">Travel costs incurred by evacuees returning to Montserrat prior to the commencement of the scheme will not be reimbursed.

<a name="90326w01.htm_para6">With the introduction of ERAFS, HMG are to bring to an end the Assisted Passage Scheme and the Regional Relocation Scheme which enable Montserratians to relocate to the UK or within the region respectively. The Regional Relocation Scheme will end on 30 April whilst the Assisted Passage Scheme will finish on 31 May. Applications received after 1 May 1999 will not be considered. People applying for the schemes must travel by 30 April and 31 May 1999 respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90326w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Parts of Tanzania suffered from severe drought in late 1997. The effects of this on Tanzanian agriculture were exacerbated by El Nino-related flooding in early 1998. So far this year there has been a lack of rain in many areas. The cumulative effect has been an increase in vulnerability of already poor people. The Government of Tanzania are planning to distribute food to some 1.2 million people living in the worst affected regions. The Department for International Development (DFID) provided about &#163;1 million of support in late 1997/early 1998. The World Food Programme is coordinating a relief programme, recently extended until June, in the Dodoma and Singida Regions: DFID support since October 1998 has amounted to &#163;400,000. The main rains are now due to begin in Tanzania. This will be a critical period. DFID staff will continue to monitor events very closely over the next few months.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> Fuel duty rebate is an important element in Government financial support for local bus services. Possible changes to its scope will be considered as part of the study we will be asking the new Commission for Integrated Transport to undertake on all aspects of public funding for bus services. We will also be considering carefully all the recommendations of the review of voluntary and community transport commissioned by my Department, the report of which will be published shortly.

<P>
<a name="90326w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department does not hold information on the numbers of British owned road haulage firms. Road haulage companies based in Great Britain are required to hold a goods vehicle operator's licence, issued by the local Traffic Commissioner, for each traffic area in which they have an operating centre: so many of the larger companies will hold more than one licence. Figures for the number of licences in issue each year from 1993-97 show a cumulative decline of 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 1999 : Column: 418</I><P>
some 9 per cent. over the period. Figures for 1997-98 show a slight increase, 0.5 per cent., over the previous year. I estimate that figures for the current year, ending 31 March, will be similar to those for last year. It is too soon to make any estimates for next year.

<a name="90326w02.htm_para2">As regards aviation, the Civil Aviation Authority is requiring all UK licensed operators to provide confirmation that their insurance specifically includes cover for possible computer date recognition problems. Failure to provide satisfactory confirmation will lead to the CAA taking action to suspend operating licences.
<P>

<a name="90326w02.htm_para3">Rail operators are required as a condition of their licence, to have adequate insurance cover. The Rail Regulator has made it clear that he does not expect exclusions relating to the millennium date change problem to be a part of such insurance cover.

 The vast majority of classic cars will be able to operate perfectly satisfactorily on lead replacement petrol which is expected to become widely available from the last quarter of this year. Separate additives will also be available for use with unleaded petrol. The Government are, however, continuing to explore options for implementing the provision in EU directive 98/70/EC which permits sales of leaded petrol to continue to a limit of 0.5 per cent. of total sales, though supply will ultimately be a commercial decision.

In 1995, the Health Survey for England (HSE) took over the monitoring the heights and weights of children and also measured their physical activity in 1997. The data for 1995 and 1996 were published in HSE Reports and the combined data for 1995-97 were published in December 1998 in the Report "The Health of Young People '95-'97".
<P>

<a name="90326w04.htm_para0">The tables give heights and weights for 5 to 10 year olds for 1994 from NSHG and from HSE for 1995, 1996 and on the same basis for comparison purposes with NSHG for 1995-97 combined.
<P>

<a name="90326w04.htm_para1">Heights and weights for children aged 11 to 15 years in 1995, 1996 are given, along with the data for 1995-97 combined, which are the baseline from which changes will be monitored.

<P>

 It is the responsibility of health authorities to provide services to control the spread of head lice among school children. This service is exercised through the primary health care team, which may include the services of a school nurse. It is the policy of the Department together with the Department of Education and Employment, to encourage a "whole school approach" to the detection of and treatment of head lice. This entails parents checking their children and other family members for head lice and arranging treatment where necessary, with such support from the local primary health care team as they may require.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what information he has concerning the nature and scope of the proposed forthcoming recommendations from the European Commission for possible amendments to EU Directive 75/318 in relation to herbal remedies; and if he will make a statement.  [78903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90326w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We have recently received proposals from the European Commission for a directive which would amend the Annex to the Directive 75/318 EEC. The proposed directive seeks to clarify the data on safety and efficacy which companies are required to provide when seeking a marketing authorisation for "well established medicinal products". Our initial assessment is that any direct impact on herbal medicines in the United Kingdom is likely to be limited. In particular, the draft Directive would not change the definition of which products are classified as medicines; nor would the proposals directly affect herbal medicines exempt from the requirement for a product licence under the terms of Section 12 of the Medicines Act 1968. Ministers have asked the Medicines Control Agency to seek further clarification from the European Commission about the draft Directive and any wider implications it may have.
<P>

<a name="90326w04.htm_para6">We have also given consideration to the wider question of future regulatory arrangements for herbal medicines in the United Kingdom. Our objective is that the public should have access to a wide range of safe, high quality 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 1999 : Column: 427</I><P>
herbal medicines with appropriate information about the use of the product. There are currently two contrasting routes to the market for herbal medicines. Licensed herbal medicines have to meet rigorous standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Unlicensed herbal remedies in the United Kingdom do not have to meet any specific standards for safety, quality or efficacy.
<P>

<a name="90326w04.htm_para7">We fully share the view which was expressed at a meeting held by the Under-Secretary, my noble Friend the Baroness Hayman, earlier this week by a range of organisations working in the natural health sector, that the current regulatory arrangements for herbal medicines have significant weaknesses and require review. The regime for unlicensed medicines does not give systematic protection to the public against low quality and unsafe unlicensed herbal remedies which are known to reach the UK market. Nor does it permit manufacturers legally to give written information to consumers about the intended use of the product. In contrast, elements of the regime for licensed medicines--particularly some of the efficacy requirements--are difficult for responsible companies to satisfy in relation to herbal medicines. We believe that there is a need to work towards arrangements which provide better protection and information for the public while continuing to allow responsible businesses and practitioners to operate effectively.
<P>

<a name="90326w04.htm_para8">We have asked the Medicines Control Agency to examine options for achieving our objectives for herbal medicines, consulting widely with interested organisations. Medicines law operates within a European framework. Accordingly, we will need to develop a position which is realistically achievable within the European Union. We intend to participate actively and constructively in any ongoing EU discussions about future regulatory arrangements for herbal medicines.

<P>
<a name="90326w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We received a copy of the final report "Herbal medicinal products in the European Union" earlier this month. We do not see a need to circulate, or to respond directly to, the report which explicitly states that it does not express the Commission's official views. We understand that the report is available on the European Commission's website (http://dg3.eudra.org). We intend to participate actively and constructively in any ongoing European Union discussions about future regulatory arrangements for herbal medicines.

 We regularly raise our concerns in bodies such as the UN Commission on Human Rights.

We played a leading role in the establishment of the use of child soldiers as a war crime in the statute of the International Criminal Court. We take up individual situations case by case, including, for example, the abduction of children in northern Uganda by the Lord's Resistance Army.

The Government Actuary is content with our proposals that the current rate of 4 per cent. of pensionable pay can be maintained until 31 March 2002. Assuming that experience is in line with the assumptions he has made, it will increase to 5.5 per cent. from 1 April 2002, with a further increase to 7 per cent. from 1 April 2005.

In the meantime, the Government Actuary considers that the proposed increases in employer contribution rates are consistent with the nature of the changes likely to be required under the restructuring.

 The reduction in the number of RAF Tristar flights to the Falkland Islands was one of a range of efficiency proposals identified by the Strategic Defence Review. It represents a rationalisation of the use of Tristar aircraft following technical improvements that allow them to carry an increased payload. The effect of this measure, once fully implemented, will be to maintain passenger carriage capacity at its original level.

 The purpose of our nuclear forces is to deter aggression against the United Kingdom or its Allies. The Strategic Defence Review confirmed that, in addition to its strategic deterrent role, Trident would also perform the sub-strategic nuclear role, formerly assigned to RAF Tornado aircraft. A sub-strategic element is an essential component of a nuclear deterrent policy. In extreme circumstances of self defence, a capability for the more limited use of nuclear weapons would allow us to signal to an aggressor that he has miscalculated our resolve, without using the full destructive power that Trident offers.

On 17 March 1999, my

right hon. Friend the Prime Minister presented a certificate to the 6,000th employer to have pledged support. Some 70 per cent. of the nation's workforce are employed by employers who have declared their support for the volunteer reserve forces. In addition, there are many employers who have not formally pledged their support but do have employees who are members of the volunteer reserve forces.

 With effect from 1 April 1996 the salaries of the Chief Constable and the Deputy Chief Constable, Ministry of Defence Police, have been determined in line with the provisions applying to the Senior Civil Service, which includes an element related to performance. The salaries of the ranks of Constable to Superintending grade are calculated at 95 per cent. of the level for analogous Home Department Police Forces.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people responded to the consultation paper on support for disabled people; if he will list those who <i>(a)</i> supported, <i>(b)</i> opposed the proposal to make New Deal interviews compulsory and <i>(c)</i> opposed taking into account income for which people have already contributed against a benefit earned through the payment of contributions.

 Consultation on our proposals for the reform of benefits for disabled people ended on 8 January. 342 responses were received, just over half of which came from organisations representing disabled people. A list of the organisations that responded has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90326w07.htm_para0">150 respondents, including 177 organisations, commented on our proposals to introduce a Single Work-Focused Gateway to benefits for working age claimants. While the vast majority of respondents generally welcomed our initiatives to help disabled people into work, a large number of these felt that final decisions on whether to make interviews compulsory should await consideration of the results of piloting. (Involvement in the New Deal for Disabled People will remain voluntary).

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people since 1995 who had been receiving invalidity benefit failed the work test when they applied for incapacity benefit.  [78280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90326w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 When Incapacity Benefit was introduced in 1995, existing Invalidity Benefit recipients were transferred to the new benefit without being required to apply for it. However, with some exceptions, these cases were subject to the All Work Test, which is being applied on a rolling programme over a period of several years.
<P>

<a name="90326w08.htm_para0">Information on the numbers of former Invalidity Benefit claimants who have failed the All Work Test since the introduction of Incapacity Benefit is not available for the period April 1995 to August 1996. From September 1996 to August 1998 inclusive, it is estimated that some 39,250 ex-Invalidity Benefit claimants have failed to satisfy the test. In addition, just under 4,000 others have had their claims terminated following failure to return the All Work Test questionnaire, or failure to attend a medical examination.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency Reviews.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under Child Support legislation, there are a number of different reviews that can be requested by parties to an assessment (which will include the non resident parent/person with care and child in Scotland). Any of the interested parties can ask for a review of their assessment by another child support officer if they disagree with the decision of the original child support officer. This is referred to as a second tier review. They may also request a change of circumstance review if a change has occurred that may affect their maintenance assessment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We do not collect information on average processing times for the clearance of reviews of maintenance assessments. We measure the clearance of reviews against a target set by the Secretary of State. The 1998/99 target requires 80 per cent. of reviews to be cleared within 13 weeks. The age at clearance is measured from the date of the receipt by the Agency. At 28 February 1999 we have exceeded the target by clearing 87 per cent. of reviews within 13 weeks.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There have been significant improvements in the Agency's performance over the last two years despite an increase in workload of over 20 per cent. in that time. We have reviewed the way we handle complaints and we have increased resources for our Client Helplines and the National Enquiry Line, extended our hours of opening to cover 8.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00 am to 5.00 pm on Saturdays and have completed trials to greatly improve and increase clients' opportunities to secure a face to face service. Also, letters of complaint to the Agency have fallen as a percentage of our caseload.</FONT></UL>

 I am ensuring that ES New Deal Personal Advisers and Advisers operating in a Single Work Focused Advisory capacity use the range of training products that have been developed to equip them with the knowledge and skills needed to work with carers and other client groups.
<P>

<a name="90326w09.htm_para2">It is a prerequisite of undertaking advisory duties that staff fully understand the needs of client groups with special needs, and tailored training material has been produced for this purpose. Line managers and trainers then review the understanding of advisers to check that they can: identify jobseekers who have caring responsibilities or who are ex carers; explain the action to take to help carers and ex carers back in to work; and explain how to help them.
<P>

<a name="90326w09.htm_para3">This training material was recently sent to the Carers National Association for their review.
<P>

<a name="90326w09.htm_para4">In preparation for the introduction of SWFG, we will hold an event for all SWFG Advisers on 17-18 June. This will focus specifically on dealing with special client groups. The event will involve direct input of a number of special clients representative groups including the Carers National Association.

 The introduction of the National Minimum Wage on 1 April will result in all young people employed under the New Deal receiving gross pay above the lower earnings limit for national insurance contributions. A small number of New Deal employees may have had gross earnings just below the lower earnings limit threshold this year. In these cases, as with other employees with low earnings, national insurance contributions will not have been paid and credits will not have been awarded.

<a name="90326w10.htm_para0">Whilst Her Majesty's Government (HMG) welcome the various steps the European Commission has taken over the past year to improve the speed of project delivery in the field of nuclear safety, there is a need for the Commission to be more open to taking on board concerns raised in the Court of Auditors report.

 Pensioners' Bonds are priced like other National Savings products, taking account of the need to compete in the retail savings market, and the need to 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 1999 : Column: 448</I><P>
provide cost-effective financing for the government. Recent reductions in the interest rate on Pensioners' Bonds mainly reflect reductions in medium term interest rates generally, which in turn reflect expectations of lower inflation over the next five years. Lower inflation reduces the erosion of the value of the capital sum invested.

(11) The UK does not produce a CPI. The real rate has been calculated by deflating the cash flows over the five year life of the bond by the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payment (RPIX). An inflation rate of 2&#189; per cent. from March 1999 has been assumed.<P>

 As a general rule, the core Department, the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate have agreed that staff will not be asked to work more than 48 hours per week over a 17 week reference period. Where any potential breaches of the Regulations are identified, managers have first been asked to determine whether it is feasible to reduce hours, adjust working patterns or re-design the job and only then to discuss the option of disapplying the 48 hour limit with staff. Compliance costs are not separately identifiable as they have been absorbed within existing budgets.
