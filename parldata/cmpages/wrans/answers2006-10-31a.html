as well as countries in the Golden Triangle. With respect to the Golden

illicit channels. They have therefore ruled out licit cultivation as a
means of tackling the illicit trade.</p><br>

build African capacity in land policy, and in climate change
adaptation. The Land Policy Initiative will be jointly managed by the
AU, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (UN ECA). This Initiative aims to build consensus
for land reform among AU member states and Regional Economic
Communities and to establish a framework for common actions,
partnerships and peer learning. The Climate Information for Development
Needs in Africa programme (ClimDev Africa) will be led by the AU and
jointly implemented by AfDB and ECA. It aims to strengthen the capacity

The CBI and IOD did not support the introduction into the review of any
additional reporting requirements from the former statutory Operating
and Financial Review (schedule 7ZA of the Companies Act 1985), but made
no particular comments about contractual and other relationships. The
ABI thought that companies should in any case be reporting the matters
included in the previous legislation to the extent relevant for an
understanding of the company and its capacity to succeed in the
creation of shareholder value. The more pressing concern that these
organisations raised was in relation to liability in respect of
reporting and I subsequently introduced amendments to the Companies
Bill to clarify the liability regime. We also received a recent
representation from the IOD expressing concern about the timing, intent
and effect of the Government&#146;s amendment to the Business Review.

Energy Efficiency Commitment, electricity and gas suppliers have to
meet targets for improving household energy efficiency. The current
phase provides incentives for innovative action. In future, we are
looking to include other renewable microgeneration technologies such as
micro-wind. With the Department for Trade and Industry and Ofgem, we
are considering how to make it easier for householders and other
microgenerators to export their energy to the national

Renewables Obligation, energy suppliers are required to source a rising
percentage of their energy from renewable sources. Microgenerators,
such as householders, are entitled to claim Renewable Obligation
Certificates under this obligation. The Government are looking to make
it easier for groups of householders to claim these valuable
certificates. This has also provided incentives for the emergence of a
number of &#147;green tariffs&#148; so that householders can choose
to buy energy from renewable

colonisation of Lough Erne was rapid reaching maximum population levels
within four years. It is not possible at this stage to predict exactly
how quickly the colonisation in Lough Neagh will progress but it may be
slower than in Lough Erne. Lough Neagh has a lower proportion of hard
grounds such as rock and gravel, which are the areas initially favoured
by zebra mussels, and more of the less suitable sand and mud which may
remain zebra mussel free for
longer.</p><p><a name="06103178001833">As population
levels of zebra mussels increase the nature of the lake bottom will
change and their filter feeding activity will reduce the amount of
algae in the lake increasing water clarity. This will have as yet
uncertain implications for fish, birds, water abstraction, navigation
and other interests. The Inter-Departmental Zebra Mussel Control Group
will continue to work closely with the Lough Neagh Advisory Committee
in relation to monitoring the spread of mussels, advising on mitigation
measures and keeping the public aware of the
