<a name="71117w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 27 October, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>721</i>, on workplace injuries, what estimate he has made of the proportion of the increase in major injuries reported between 1995-96 and 1996-97 which is accounted for by the extension of the definition of major injuries in the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995. [14472]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Based on provisional figures for 1996-97 it is estimated that at least 45 per cent. of the increase in major injuries to employees, and all of the increase in major injuries to the self-employed reported to HSE and local authorities between 1995-96 and 1996-97 is accounted for by the extension of the definition of major injury in the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995. The remaining 55 per cent. of the increase in major injuries to employees could be due to extensions to the definition of injuries reportable under RIDDOR 1995. These cannot be separately identified since they are classified within general categories previously reportable as major injuries.
<P>

<a name="71117w01.html_para0">Figures for 1997-98 will be available next summer. At that stage we will be able to make a better assessment of the effects of the changes brought by RIDDOR 1995. However, there is no room for complacency, any accidents at work are unacceptable and we have asked the Health and Safety Commission to analyse the statistics further and to try to identify the main influences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 27 October, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>713-14</i>, relating to bridge strengthening, how many bridges on the trunk road network have been strengthened to date; when he expects local authorities to complete their assessment of their bridge stock; and by what criteria and by whom decisions on which require strengthening will be made. [15033]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 With regard to bridges on the trunk network, the position at 1 April 1997 was that 528 had been strengthened. Work on the strengthening programme continues and I shall write to my hon. Friend in due course providing an update on progress.
<P>

<a name="71117w01.html_para1">The vast majority of local authority assessments will have been completed by 31 March 1999. However, it seems likely that a small number, on roads of less strategic importance, will remain to be assessed in 1999-2000. It is for local authorities to decide, in the light of local needs and

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to introduce procedures to enable local planning authorities to extend the 28 day limit in their determination of prior approval for telecommunications developments; and if he will make a statement. [15662]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 An application for prior approval determination in respect of telecommunications development provides the local planning authority with 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 1997 : Column: 3</I><P>
the opportunity to say whether they wish to approve, within 28 days, details of its proposed siting and appearance. Currently we have no plans to extend the 28-day period allowed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of the 28 day prior notification limit for telecommunications developments on <i>(a)</i> consultation with parish or town councils and councillors, <i>(b)</i> the opportunities for comment from local residents and <i>(c)</i> the opportunities to negotiate and amend proposed schemes; and if he will make a statement. [15663]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Where an application for prior approval determination is to be made, Appendix E to the Department's Circular 9/95 emphasises the importance of discussions between the operator and the local planning authority to minimise any difficulties about the proposal and avoid delay in processing the application. It also encourages publicity for such proposals so that people likely to be affected can make their views known to the local planning authority. It is important that authorities make satisfactory arrangements to enable them to deal with these applications. The Department's Code of Best Practice on telecommunications prior approval procedures as applied to mast/tower development provides guidance on how local planning authorities and operators can co-operate to make it easier for prior approval applications to be dealt with effectively within the 28 day period allowed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will introduce national guidance in respect of <i>(a)</i> the circumstances in which the public health impact of telecommunications developments should be a planning consideration and <i>(b)</i> the weight which should be given to public health issues by local planning authorities; and if he will make a statement. [15665]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Planning Policy Guidance note 1 advises local planning authorities that any consideration which relates to the use and development of land is, in principle, capable of being a planning consideration. The issue of whether, in any individual case, a particular matter is a material consideration will depend on the prevailing facts and circumstances. It is for the body determining the application (usually the local planning authority) to decide which are the material considerations applicable in the first instance. This is the planning position. Any organisation engaged in telecommunications development should comply with Health and Safety legislation.

<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the findings of the Medical Research Council's Institute for Environment and Health's preliminary assessment of health risks associated with the domestic use of medium-density fibreboard. [16069]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Medical Research Council's Institute for Environmental Health has not yet undertaken a formal assessment of the risks associated with the domestic use of medium-density fibreboard. Without wishing to prejudice the outcome of the assessment, the 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 1997 : Column: 4</I><P>
Institute has expressed the preliminary opinion that inhalation of dust from operations involving medium-density fibreboard is more likely to be an occupational rather than a domestic hazard. Although inhalation of any dust is to be avoided (especially very fine particles which can reach the deep lung) the Institute does not consider occasional "DIY" activities involving medium-density fibreboard to pose a particular risk. Good working practice when cutting or sanding medium-density fibreboard, would be to wear a suitable dust mask or where possible, perform this work out-of-doors. Like other types of particle board, medium-density fibreboard can give off formaldehyde gas (used in resin bonding) but only in exceptional cases is this likely to cause problems.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps his Department is taking to encourage the use of <i>(a)</i> alternatives to medium-density fibreboard and <i>(b)</i> low or zero formaldehyde emission fibreboard in do-it-yourself home construction. [16065]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w01.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Department does not consider medium-density fibreboard a risk to health to individuals involved in do-it-yourself activities. Therefore, the Department does not have a policy to encourage the use of alternatives.
<P>

<a name="71117w01.html_para2">Like other types of particle board, medium-density fibreboard can give off formaldehyde gas (used in resin bonding) but only in exceptional cases is this likely to cause problems--such as acute sensory irritation. However, fibreboard with low or zero formaldehyde emissions is available on the market and my Department is encouraging its use in general advice to professionals and the public.

 Figures provided by district councils in a new DETR/Welsh Office survey of municipal waste management suggest that weekly arisings per household are up to 3kg higher in areas where households are provided with wheeled bins than in areas provided with plastic sacks. However, a direct relationship between bin size and waste volume cannot be assumed, as there are other factors which can influence the amount of waste generated, for example the socioeconomic characteristics of households and the type of housing. Local authorities may take these factors into account in any decision to introduce wheeled bins in a particular area.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w02.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 An annual survey of woodland tree condition in the UK is carried out on behalf of my Department. While there was evidence of decline in the health of woodland oak over the period 1989 to 1993, this trend has been reversed during the past four years. Previous analysis for this survey has indicated that air pollution, such as acid deposition and low level ozone, could account for only a small proportion of the observed changes in tree health. Other stresses, including climatic factors, such as drought stress, are thought to be of much greater significance. Ash, which grows on lime-rich soils, is not susceptible to damage from acid deposition.
<P>

<a name="71117w02.html_para5">Other research and monitoring, commissioned by my Department into the health of non-woodland trees, however, does show that both native ash and oak have experienced damage in recent years, probably due to drought stress. It is too early to say whether recent warm, dry years are a part of a long-term climate change, but they give an indication of the kind of damage which could, in future, become more prevalent.

 The frequency of horizontal transfer of any genes of genetically modified crops to certified organic crops is very low and no formal safeguards exist to prevent this occurring with respect to the release of genetically modified crops. Where gene transfer between compatible species (vertical transfer) is feasible, consent conditions (including isolation distances) can be imposed to minimise undesirable effects.

 Disabled or elderly people are already able to buy bungalows under the right-to-buy scheme, unless the dwelling is sheltered accommodation which is specially built for people with disabilities, or let to elderly people and part of a group of dwellings with support services or facilities provided nearby. Under paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985, landlords may exclude from the right to buy non-sheltered bungalows if

they were first let to elderly people before 1990 and are particularly suitable for such people; however, tenants who disagree with their landlords have a right to appeal to the Secretary of State against such decisions. Housing which has been adapted to make it suitable for disabled people is not excluded from the right to buy.

 We have today set up a finance, management and policy review of the Local Government Commission for England (LGC), as part of a programme of reviews of non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="71117w03.html_para0">This review will be conducted in two stages. The first will be a "prior options" study focusing on whether the functions carried out by the LGC are needed and, if so, whether those functions are best undertaken by the LGC or some other body. Subject to the outcome of this first stage, the second stage will consist of a more detailed review of the LGC's structure, funding, financial management and methods of operation.

 To improve still further the high level of service provided by Her Majesty's Coastguard I am able to announce today that I have endorsed a strategy for HM Coastguard which involves a substantial investment in new technology and which will take the Service into the next century. That investment will introduce operational flexibility which will increase the safety of those who use our sea and shores, and will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of an already highly proficient Service. The key to the strategy is the introduction of digital communications technology at Coastguard rescue centres and remote radio sites to replace aging equipment. Once the new technology is in place HMCG will be able to concentrate their operational expertise within fewer rescue co-ordination sub-centres by

closing the rescue sub-centres at Oban and Pentland (Orkney) by the end of 1999, and Tyne-Tees and Liverpool by the end of 2000. Portland and Solent rescue sub-centres at present in unsuitable buildings will be bought together under the same roof by March 2002.

<a name="71117w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The Government encourage commercial access to the opportunities for digital broadcasting via terrestrial, cable and satellite delivery by maintaining the lightest regulatory regime compatible with protecting the public interest and with the capacity constraints of each delivery platform. Those with proposals for digital television services may approach the digital terrestrial multiplex operators; companies holding cable franchises or operators of digital satellites. Authority to provide programme content on digital broadcasting services is via the appropriate programme service licences, which are available effectively on demand from the Independent Television Commission to any fit and proper applicant. Plurality of voice is underpinned by the requirement that no single person may control licences which together have more than 15 per cent. of the total television audience.
<P>

<a name="71117w04.html_para4">General competition law provides powers to act against the abuse of monopoly position or anti-competitive behaviour. The new Competition Bill will introduce two prohibitions which will prove a highly effective deterrent against cartels and abuses of dominance. The provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1996; the Advanced Television Service Regulations 1996 and the Class Licence for the running of telecommunications systems for the provision of conditional access services granted on 7 January 1997 by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry under section 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 collectively safeguard the use of critical technology and customer data.

Commission Directive 97/47/EC, which takes effect in the UK in the New Year, deletes the "Land Animal Products" category and requires any animal material still permitted in compound feed to be separately identified. The European Commission is now considering the complete removal of the category option, which would receive UK support.

 There is still some substantive agriculture, fisheries and food business to be completed under the Luxembourg Presidency. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to go into the detail of priorities for the UK Presidency at this time.

 Having studied the issues closely, the independent Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food has expressed concern about the microbiological quality of unpasteurised cows' milk for drinking and has recommended that the sale of such milk be banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Consequently, I have initiated a public

 I have asked Professor Kennedy, Professor of Health Law, Ethics and Public Policy at University College, London to carry out an assessment of alternatives to quarantine and of the current policy of quarantine. The assessment will consider the risk of introduction of rabies into the United Kingdom, the practical aspects of enforcement and the costs and benefits involved. The assessment will take several months. I will publish Professor Kennedy's report, and will thereafter hold a full public consultation.

 The Government are in the process of deciding the HLCA rates for 1998. My right hon. Friend and I met both Welsh farming unions recently and heard their concerns about hill farming in Wales. I share much of that concern, as I made clear in my speech in the House on 5 November.
<P>

<a name="71117w07.html_para0">It is also important not to raise false expectations. The Government have indicated that they intend to live within public expenditure targets set by the previous Government. That Government provided an extra &#163;60 million for HLCAs in 1997 only.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what reference was made to <i>(a)</i> the Robson statistics on deprivation and <i>(b)</i> geographical rural isolation in the formulation of the capitation system of funding for health and social services boards. [15050]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The Robson statistics on deprivation are not suitable for use in the capitation system of funding health and social services boards as they do not enable finance to be allocated in proportion to the need for health and social care. This is because differences in Robson statistics are not proportionate to differences in deprivation. For example, an area with a Robson score twice that of another area may not necessarily be twice as deprived. In addition, Robson is not the most focused measure of health and social care need. It is a very broad measure of general deprivation, combining a large number of indicators from areas such as environment and education as well as health and social care.

 The Department continues to promote music teaching in schools through the provision that is available as part of the National Curriculum for all children aged five to 14 in maintained schools. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is also exploring ways of promoting musical instrument teaching for school pupils in addition to the National Curriculum requirements.

 European matters already have considerable coverage in the National Curriculum for schools, mainly through the mandatory study requirements for geography, history and modern foreign languages. To reinforce those and to celebrate the forthcoming United Kingdom Presidency of the European Union we are producing, with the professional help of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, a curriculum pack for schools. It will be entitled "Partners in Europe", and it will emphasise the importance of building a European dimension in the curriculum. We plan to publish the pack in December so that it will be available to schools in January for the start of the Spring term.

 The issues raised by the judgment in the case of Marschall <i>v</i>. Land NordRhein Westfalen are complex. The implications are still being considered. The European Court of Justice's judgment does not require an amendment to be made to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, because Article 2(4) of the Equal Treatment Directive (under which the judgment is made) operates as a derogation from the equal treatment principle. It permits Member States to have positive discrimination provisions in certain limited circumstances it does not require them to have such provisions.

 The Government are encouraging and will encourage universities to meet the needs of employers and others in their communities in a number of ways.

<a name="71117w09.html_para1">We are continuing the Higher Education and Employment Development Programme, which exists to improve responsiveness to the labour market at a national level and to enhance the ability of employers to use the skills and knowledge that graduates bring.

<a name="71117w09.html_para2">The Higher Education Regional Development Fund came into operation this year. This initiative aims to engage higher education systemically in supporting competitiveness and economic growth at a regional level through close partnerships with employers and employer-led organisations. The 1997-98 budget of &#163;2.7 million is supporting 58 projects. Although funding is due to end in April 1998, the Government are considering a recommendation from the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education--the Dearing Committee--to extend it.

<a name="71117w09.html_para3">My Department is also supporting four feasibility studies on the development of graduate apprenticeships. These will explore the potential for creating opportunities for undergraduates and postgraduates that combine academic study with work-based learning.

Schedule 2 applies to the examination of European Economic Area (EEA) nationals in accordance with Article 20(2)(e) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994. Article 3 of that Order provides that (subject to article 15(1) of the Order) an EEA national will be admitted to the United Kingdom on production, on arrival, of a valid national identity card or passport issued by another EEA State and, if required, proof that he is the family member of an EEA national. "EEA nationals" includes all nationals of the European Economic Area, including European Community nationals, except British citizens. No new powers are conferred by the Protocol, which instead confirms the United Kingdom's (and Ireland's) rights to conduct checks on persons at the internal frontiers of the European Union.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will set out the detailed procedures in place for processing asylum seekers on their arrival at United Kingdom ports of entry. [15085]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71117w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The procedures in place at ports of entry are designed to meet the United Kingdom's obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees while minimising the scope for abuse of the asylum process. These procedures allow for the prompt identification of asylum seekers; information to be provided about the asylum process and the agencies that can offer assistance; and the asylum claim to be forwarded to the Asylum Directorate of the Home Office at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="71117w10.html_para1">All procedures are kept under review and revised as necessary. More generally, a study of all aspects of the asylum process across Government is currently being carried out.

 <i>[holding answer 13 November 1997]:</i> The Prison Service has made available in the current financial year an additional &#163;1 million in support of offending behaviour programmes, including sex offender treatment programmes.

<a name="71117w10.html_para2">There are no plans at present to devote additional Prison Service resources to programmes aimed at sex offenders sentenced to short terms of imprisonment because they would not be in prison for long enough after sentencing for them to complete a meaningful programme.

 Section 45 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, as amended by the Interception of Communications Act 1985, provides that public telecommunications operators commit an offence if they disclose any information concerning the use made of their telecommunications services by any other person except where disclosures are made for the prevention or detection of crime, for the purposes of any criminal proceedings, in the interests of national security or in pursuance of the order of a court.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 To introduce a general offence outlawing unauthorised surveillance by an electronic device would raise particular technical and definitional problems. Remedies are already available to take action against those who carry out surveillance which transgresses the current criminal law, for example if they commit theft or criminal damage, behave in a threatening or violent way or where there is harassment. Furthermore, the act of simple trespass is a civil tort.
<P>

<a name="71117w10.html_para6">There are also offences under the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967 to regulate the use of certain techniques and methods. On the other hand, there are legitimate uses of electronic surveillance by other than law enforcement agencies which are of benefit to society and the safety of the public. The use of closed circuit television in shopping centres, car parks, on housing estates and inside offices, banks, shops and public buildings is generally welcomed by the public and accepted as necessary for crime prevention.
<P>

<a name="71117w10.html_para7">The media would argue that cameras and other equipment are an essential component of investigative journalism and that any prohibition on their use would be a form of censorship. To regulate the use of all such equipment would create a massive administrative burden. Existing offences under the criminal and civil law already provide a degree of cover and redress for infringements of privacy by the use of electronic surveillance. Incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights will also impact upon this issue.

It is for Departments to assess which posts, by virtue of their assess to sensitive Government assets, should be subject to security vetting. Before any vetting is carried out, the individual is informed of the processes involved and gives his or her consent to the relevant checks being made.

 Claims submitted under options A and B of the compensation scheme are being processed in 12 to 14 weeks. The more complicated option C claims will be processed when the bulk of these have been cleared.
<P>

<a name="71117w11.html_para2">More than 37,800 compensation claims and ex gratia applications under the small calibre pistol scheme have been received since 1 July, and the volume is such that some delays are inevitable. More than 14,200 payments have been made to a value of more than &#163;17 million.
<P>

<a name="71117w11.html_para3">It has always been recognised that the pressure of claims received over a short hand-in period was bound to lead to processing delays, and claimants were advised that they may have to wait several weeks before receiving any payment. Despite that, an additional factor in delay is the burden of telephone enquiries about the progress of claims. A recent survey showed that the Home Office was receiving around 2,000 such calls a week.

taken by Her Majesty's Government to send copies of the draft convention to bodies or persons in the United Kingdom whose duties or obligations will be affected by its operation and requirements; if he will publish a white paper containing the changes which it will require in the existing powers available to the Government or Parliament; and what final powers the convention provides for the European Court. [15573]

<P>
<a name="71117w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 A revised draft External Frontiers Convention was presented to the Council by the Commission on 10 December 1993; a draft Convention had earlier been under consideration by member states of the European Union under the ad hoc arrangements for co-operation on immigration and asylum which preceded the coming into force of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). 
<P>

<a name="71117w12.html_para0">The Government are not aware of any specific consultations on the Commission's proposals but it was based on the earlier text of the draft Convention subject to the changes brought about by the TEU. The Commission's proposal for a Convention was deposited in Parliament on 1 February 1994, together with an Explanatory Note; the draft Convention which preceded it was deposited in Parliament in July 1992. The Commission's proposal was published in the <i>Official Journal</i> on 15 January 1994 and is publicly available. The Government did not formally consult on the Convention but the Government's Explanatory Note set out the legal changes which implementation of the External Frontiers Convention would require. It would not be appropriate to publish any more detailed proposals in the absence of final agreement on the text. Jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice remains an unresolved matter.
<P>

<a name="71117w12.html_para1">The draft External Frontiers Convention has been blocked since 1991 because of Spain's objections to its application to Gibraltar, and no discussions of substance have taken place within the European Union since June 1996 during the Italian Presidency. However, arrangements have now been agreed allowing the Schengen countries to pass measures within the European Union framework relating to their external frontiers, while the United Kingdom and Ireland continue to operate the Common Travel Area. Given these changes, secured at the Amsterdam Summit, there is now little impetus behind the draft External Frontiers Convention.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(i) Draft Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement in Family Matters</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This draft European Union Convention, on which my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has the policy lead, has not been published in the <i>Official Journal</i> but was submitted to the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities in May, together with an Explanatory Note. The Select Committee consulted a wide range of interested academic and professional individuals and organisations and published the evidence it collected in its report (HL Paper 19, printed on 22 July 1997). The matters raised in the memorandum submitted to the Select Committee by the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Scottish Court Administration are still under negotiation with other member states. The enactment of primary legislation will be needed before the Convention can be ratified.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The draft Convention has the following main purposes; first, to establish grounds of jurisdiction in relation to proceedings for divorce, nullity and judicial separation and orders relating to children made in those proceedings; secondly, to make provision relating to concurrent matrimonial procedings in different jurisdictions; and thirdly, to provide for the recognition and enforcement of the relevant decrees and orders. Whether, and, if so, to what extent, the European Court of Justice should be given jurisdiction in relation to the draft Convention is a matter which is still under consideration and negotiation with other member states. The Lord Chancellor's Department and the Scottish Courts Administration will publish a memorandum on the draft Convention before it is finally agreed; the timing of such publication with depend on the future progress of negotiations.

<BR>
<i>(ii) Draft Convention on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs authorities (Naples II)</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The text of this draft European Union Convention is still under negotiation and has therefore not yet been published in the <i>Official Journal</i>. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has the policy lead and intends to deposit the latest text and an Explanatory Note with Parliament shortly. It will be for the scrutiny committees to decide whether to call for evidence from interested bodies or persons. The Government have been fully involved in negotiations concerned with the drafting of the convention and, where appropriate, have sought changes to the text.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If agreement is reached on the Convention, it will be tabled in Parliament in accordance with the Ponsonby rule for ratifying international agreements. The draft Convention does not provide for changes in the rights or obligations of United Kingdom citizens. The powers to be invested in the European Court of Justice in respect of the draft Convention are still under consideration.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(iii) Draft Convention regarding the establishment of the EURODAC system for the comparison of fingerprints of asylum applicants</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The first version of this draft European Union Convention was brought forward by the Italian Presidency on 14 March 1996. The text, which remains the subject of negotiation under the Third Pillar of the Treaty of European Union, has not been published in the <i>Official Journal</i> but was deposited with Parliament on 6 June 1996, together with an Explanatory Note. The text has so far not been the subject of any wider consultation in the United Kingdom. The Luxembourg Presidency recently forwarded the draft convention to the European Parliament for an opinion.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If adopted by the Council, the draft Convention would be laid before Parliament in the usual way prior to ratification and Parliamentary approval sought for any necessary changes to existing legislation. The inclusion of provisions relating to the European Court of Justice has yet to be determined.</FONT></UL>

The figure for turnover from provision of mining reports and records includes reports provided in respect of house and land purchase, development proposals and infrastructure developments, and for access to geological and other records held by the Coal Authority. The Authority's mining records and reports service is required to cover its costs, and adjustments are made to the cost of the service to reflect this requirement. Following the computerisation of the reports service, fees for each mining report were reduced by 17.5 per cent. on 1 June 1997.<P>

In intellectual property rights, the UK opposes the draft directive on artists' re-sale rights and is pressing the Commission to consider more fully the impact upon business. In the area of air quality and vehicle emissions, the Commission has produced impact assessment work for the proposals currently being negotiated. In the other areas cited, electronic waste, distance selling of financial services and the domestic usage of electrical plugs and sockets, there are not published Commission legislative proposals at present. However, we understand that the Commission is preparing a draft Directive on the distance selling of financial services, which features in the Action Plan for completion of the Single Market. The Commission has not included any proposals for electronic waste or for domestic plugs and sockets in its 1997 Work Programme.

I understand that something in the region of 1,500 agreements are now being entered into each month. By the time I spoke at the PSI conference on 23 September some 28,000 cases had been entered into.

<a name="71117w16.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many NHS trust non-executive appointments were due on 1 November; how many individuals concerned had been informed of the outcome by that date; how many appointments were outstanding on 7 November; when he anticipates all such appointments to be announced; if he is following the guidelines on NHS appointments established in line with the recommendations of the Nolan Committee; and if he will make a statement on delays in the NHS appointment process. [15442]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 A total of 570 trust board vacancies were due to be filled on 1 November; 261 of these appointments had been made by that date and a further 105 had been made by 7 November. This left 204 of these appointments still to be confirmed. We expect virtually all of them to have been made by the end of November. All appointments are made in accordance with the guidance issued by the Commissioner of Public Appointments and the principles established by the Nolan Committee. The slight delays that have occurred have been due to the introduction of new procedures designed to make boards more representative of the communities they serve.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We have no plans to commission specific research into the use of sedatives in nursing and residential homes. The responsibility for prescribing,

including repeat prescribing and the prescribing of sedatives, rests with the doctor who has clinical responsibility for that particular aspect of a patient's care.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to review the guidelines published by his Department for the administration of medication in nursing and residential homes. [15740]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have no such plans at this time. The Department has worked with other organisations with an interest in residential care and nursing homes and there are various sources of available guidance on the administration of medication. Under the Registered Homes Act 1984 local and health authorities are responsible for regulating homes and should ensure that homes have proper arrangements for the administration of medicines.
<P>

<a name="71117w16.html_para1">The Medicines Act 1968 governs the prescribing, supply and administration of medication in residential care homes and nursing homes. Dr. June Crown is currently chairing a wide-ranging Review of Prescribing, Supply and Administration of Medicines, which will include issues of prescribing, supply and administration of medicines in nursing and residential care homes. Dr. Crown is due to report to Ministers next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to improve the quality of prescribing through the greater use of information technology, with specific reference to ensuring the greater transfer of information regarding older patients between primary and secondary care. [15739]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Much has gone into improving the quality of prescribing through information technology including piloting the Prescribing Rationally with Decision support in General Practice Study--PRODIGY--a computer-aided prescribing decision support system for general practitioners. The aim of this system is to improve the quality of GP prescribing decisions using evidence-based recommendations and faster dissemination of information about new drugs, safety alerts and other research evidence which could affect prescribing choice. PRODIGY is being trialed in some 180 general practices and is in its second phase.
<P>

<a name="71117w16.html_para2">In addition, there has been significant progress towards the development of an NHS network which would allow National Health Service information about patients to pass between primary and secondary care. There has also been development in standards for GP systems, which include holding a database of prescribable items incorporating knowledge about drug interactions and contra-indications and cross-checks for patient sensitivities.

<a name="71117w17.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what factors underlie the greater increase in prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists and appliance contractors between 1986 and 1996 for elderly people than for the remainder of the population. [15738]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 A greater proportion of prescriptions dispensed in the community by pharmacists and appliance contractors are for elderly people than for other age groups because they have a greater need for treatment. There is an increasing proportion of elderly people in the population, more treatments are now available for conditions which affect the elderly and there is increased recognition that the elderly can benefit from treatment. In addition, more elderly people are being cared for in the community and thus receiving their medication there, rather than in hospital.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w17.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans his Department has to evaluate the role of community pharmacists in providing advice on therapy of minor illnesses, monitoring drug therapy and reviewing repeat prescriptions for older people. [15737]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Advice on self-care and the treatment of minor ailments is a traditional role of community pharmacists and one which we are keen to encourage. The Department has funded a range of pilot projects designed to test how community pharmacists can play a wider role in the provision of primary health care locally. Subjects covered in these pilots include repeat dispensing and monitoring of drug therapy, including that of elderly people. All the projects will be evaluated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps have been taken since 1967 to clean up radioactive and toxic waste, and surplus military materials, on Christmas Island; what has been the cost to date of the clean-up; how many United Kingdom military personnel are currently involved in this activity; what is the estimated date of completion of this work; and if he will estimate the likely future costs of the operation. [14718]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department is aware of the waste and equipment remaining on Christmas Island after the atmospheric tests in the 1950s. Three separate radiological surveys, including one by the New Zealand Department of Health, have concluded that there is no radioactive contamination which would present a hazard to the inhabitants of Christmas Island.




<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 1997 : Column: 65</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para0">On completion of the atmospheric testing and related programmes, the United Kingdom undertook extensive radiation surveys and rehabilitation work in areas which may have been affected. Surveys and rehabilitation work on Christmas Island would have been completed before the final evacuation of the Island in July 1964. The costs of these operations to the United Kingdom cannot be separated from the overall expenditure on the whole test series.
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para1">We have found no existing records of any action being taken since 1967 to clean up waste and equipment on Christmas Island; nor are there any records of costs being incurred or estimated for such an operation, or of military personnel participating in any clean-up. No clean up is currently being carried out by military personnel; nor are there any current plans to initiate such an operation.
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para2">We are prepared to discuss with the Government of Kiribati options which they might put forward for the disposal of the equipment and waste on Christmas Island; and what advice or assistance we might be able to provide.

<a name="71117w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The British nuclear test programme was carried out in the Central Pacific area between May 1957 and September 1958. Between April and July 1962, with United Kingdom agreement and participation, the United States conducted a series of tests on Christmas Island.
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para3">Christmas Island has been subject to three radiological surveys since the end of the nuclear weapons tests. These were conducted by the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), which reported in June 1964, the University of Washington in September 1975, and the New Zealand Department of Health which reported in 1981. Only the AWRE survey was sponsored by the United Kingdom; the others were conducted at the request of the Island's Government. The conclusion reached by all three surveys was that there was no evidence of any radiological contamination which would present a hazard to the inhabitants of Christmas Island.
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para4">I am not aware of any other recent surveys of Christmas Island having been conducted by my Department.
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para5">A survey of the Island was conducted by the then Overseas Development Administration (ODA) in May 1996.

<a name="71117w18.html_para8">It is likely that surplus MOD land at Colchester will become available as a result of this development. I believe this will be of great benefit to the local Borough Council as it would allow the construction of modern housing and amenities for the local community.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 1997]:</i> A series of reforms to the court-martial system were included in the Armed Forces Act 1996 and came into effect on 1 April 1997. The reforms were wide ranging and affected the pre-trial, trial and post-trial stages of the court martial system. The purpose of these reforms was to reinforce the independence of the court-martial, principally by reducing the apparent influence of the chain of command, whilst preserving its necessary involvement.
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para10">The reforms meet the European Court's concerns about the shortcomings of the system. The ECHR has recognised our actions, noting

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with satisfaction that the UK authorities had made changes to the court-martial system with a view to ensuring the observance of their Conventional commitments".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71117w18.html_para11">Although we are not taking any further steps at present to improve the procedures, we are aware that we cannot afford to be complacent. The system is kept under review and will, of course, be looked at as part of the process of preparing for the next quinquennial Armed Forces Bill.

 For the Chinook HC Mk2 aircraft, a Full Authority Digital Electronic Control system, FADEC, was procured to replace the hydro-mechanical fuel control system which had been used on the Chinook HC Mk1. An initial FADEC target reliability figure of 1.1 failures per thousand flying hours was agreed, to improve to 0.6 after seven years in service with the RAF. After five years, the FADEC system reliability is currently about 0.4 failures per thousand flying hours, and has thus improved upon the contractual target.

 <i>[holding answer 12 November 1997]:</i> Valuation for rating of non-domestic property in Scotland is the responsibility of local assessors who together with the Valuation Office Agency have assured the Government that the 1995 Revaluation has been carried out using cross-Border harmonised valuation techniques. Representations arising since the revaluation have been received from, amongst others, the caravan industry, the hotel industry and representatives of those providing self-catering accommodation. The majority of difficulties have been resolved through negotiation with the assessors and through the well established formal appeals system. There are no plans to commission an investigation into these matters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland (1) if between 25 September and 5 October, transfers of prisoners <i>(a)</i> from Scotland to Northern Ireland and <i>(b)</i> from England to Northern Ireland required the consent of the Secretary of State of both the sending and receiving jurisdictions; [16205]

<a name="71117w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Transfers of prisoners require the consent of both jurisdictions. They are administered by officials under delegated authority and Ministers would not routinely be consulted or receive reports. The question of a delay in informing Ministers in the case of Jason Campbell's application therefore does not arise. My hon. Friend neither sought nor received reports about the progress of the application between 25 September and 4 October. Ministers have since reviewed the relevant procedures and will in future be notified at an early stage of any application for transfer between Scotland and Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland (1) if the request from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland or representations from the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office to the Scottish Office to deal promptly with the application for transfer of Jason Campbell to Northern Ireland was in accord with normal procedure for such transfers; [16209]
<P>
<UL>(2) what reasons were given to the Minister of State at the Scottish Office by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 25 September for the request that the application for transfer of Jason Campbell from HM Prison Shotts to the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland be dealt with promptly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on current controls on the production, use and consumption of unpasteurised milk in Scotland, giving the reasons underlying the introduction of the current policy and when the policy changed. [16385]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71117w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The production and use of raw milk is controlled in Scotland by the Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. They prohibit the sale in Scotland of unpasteurised cows' milk for drinking and unpasteurised cream. Unpasteurised drinking milk from goats and sheep is permitted to be sold only from the farm premises direct to the ultimate consumer. Raw milk may be used in the manufacture of dairy products, in accordance with the conditions specified in the Regulations.
<P>

<a name="71117w21.html_para0">The sale of raw cows' milk for drinking was banned in 1983, as a result of increasing numbers of cases of illness associated with its consumption. The restrictions on the sale of raw sheep and goats' milk for drinking were introduced by the 1995 Regulations based on the same potential risks but reflecting the small specialist nature of this market.

 The Government recognise the importance of good quality, affordable childcare, for all working parents, but in particular for lone parents who have to cope with bringing up children alone. That is why, when we launched the New Deal for Lone Parents in July this year, additional funds were made available to meet childcare expenses while lone parents undertake jobsearch activities.
<P>

<a name="71117w22.html_para8">New Deal Advisers are able to offer up to &#163;60 per week to each lone parent to help them pay for childcare while they attend job interviews or training.
<P>

<a name="71117w22.html_para9">New Deal Advisers also have access to information on local childcare services so they can help lone parents find the most suitable childcare for their children.
<P>

<a name="71117w22.html_para10">In addition, the Cambridge and Peterborough New Deal for Lone parent areas have the added facility of public access to information via the Internet. This is provided through an information kiosk in the waiting area of each and allows lone parents to access information personally on childcare, jobs, training and benefits. We intend to extend this service to around other offices in the 8 New Deal areas.

 The pensions review, announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 17 July, is looking at the central areas of insecurity for elderly people, including all aspects of the basic pension and its value. A key objective of the review is to ensure that pensioners should have an adequate income in retirement, that they should share fairly in rising national prosperity, and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable.
<P>

<a name="71117w23.html_para3">The first part of the review ended on 31 October and we are now carefully considering the many responses we have received. The Government intend to publish an initial framework for change in the first half of 1998. There will then be a period of further consultation before firm proposals are developed.

 Raising awareness of pensions, and improving the level of financial education is one of the key challenges for the pensions review. People need to understand the importance of saving for their retirement, and they must be able to make the right choice about what sort of pension is best for them.
<P>

<a name="71117w23.html_para4">That is why we established a working group of top finance, consumer and regulatory experts to consider how we can ensure that existing initiatives are co-ordinated, well-targeted and effective. The group will also advise what other actions are needed to improve people's knowledge of pensions in general. It will report at the end of January.
