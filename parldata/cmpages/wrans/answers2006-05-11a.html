<a name="stpa_1">The Government and the Devolved Administrations either accept, or accept in principle, 29 of the 32 recommendations. However, some of the responses are preliminary, pending further consultation with stakeholders or completion of further studies. For many of the recommendations, the European Commission would be responsible for taking forward any necessary action. Two of the recommendations require further consideration, and one recommendation regarding pet birds has been rejected. These are detailed in the Government response.

<a name="stpa_2">There is currently an EU ban on imports of captive wild birds, which is due to expire on 31 July. A decision on whether to extend the ban will be taken at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in June.

<a name="60511w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The key elements of the Government response are currently being implemented and will be in place before imports resume. In addition, all approved quarantine premises will need to be reassessed against revised standards before they can accept any birds into quarantine.

<p>
<a name="60511w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">In April 2005 the European Commission requested the European Food Safety Authority to carry out a review of the animal health and welfare aspects of imports of captive wild birds, which is due to report in October 2006. This will inform EU policy and we await their opinion with interest.

 Final calculations about milk production are still being made, but Although it appears that wholesale milk production was lower in 2005&#150;06 than 2004&#150;05, it is too early to tell whether this is a long term trend or has been caused by weather, restructuring

 The Government supported the conclusion of the Environment, Rood and Rural Affairs Select Committee in 2004, that there was no compelling evidence in favour of setting up a regulatory body to oversee the dairy industry. It is difficult to see how a regulator could determine a fair price other than by reference to a market price. A price regulator would almost certainly be incompatible with EU competition law and with the (common organisation of the market in milk and milk products.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60511w01.html_spnew7"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 Since the Department was established in 2001, we have put in place a considerable programme of reforms and improvements. For example, action on sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of achievements relating to these policy areas can be found at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm.

<a name="stpa_10">Under the Nitrates Directive, around 80 per cent. of the West Lancashire constituency was designated as an Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2002; currently about 55 per cent. of England is designated. Farmers in NVZs are required to follow an action programme aimed at reducing the risk of nitrates loss; for example by limiting the amount of Nitrogen applied on the farm during the year and by not applying manure or fertilisers during certain times of the year.

<a name="stpa_12">In March 2005 we announced that Lancashire would be one of eight rural pathfinders in England. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government&#039;s Rural Strategy and reflects the Government&#039;s commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The Lancashire rural pathfinder is helping to ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes, including testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses.

<a name="stpa_13">Lancashire has also proved to be a fertile ground for our Defra&#039;s Project Based Schemes which are generally available to farmers to help them develop new business opportunities and widen the skills they already possess. For example, Farmer Ted&#039;s Farm Park, located at Worral House Farm just outside Southport, was opened in 2003 with the help of funding from the Rural Enterprise Scheme. In the first 18 months it received over 38,000 visitors including 480 school trips. The attraction also contributes to the local economy by employing 10 full-time and 30 part-time employees.

Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation ofICD-9 selection rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994*. The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should 



therefore also be interpreted with caution. An article specifically examining the effect of the change in classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics Quarterly 23**.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England & Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate &#039;total electorate&#039;. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>

<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the &#039;registration rate&#039; using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2006 : Column 425W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">It is not possible to &#039;split&#039; estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a &#039;split&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual &#039;usual resident&#039; mid-year population; (ii) the size of the <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electorate and <i>(b)</i> local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electors and <i>(b)</i> local/European electors. These are labelled as &#039;registration rates&#039; on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">This &#039;registration rate&#039; is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated &#039;registration rate&#039; calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate &#039;registration rates&#039; on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, 30 June, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2006 : Column 426W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated &#039;registration rates&#039; for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps are being taken by his Department <i>(a)</i> to modernise agricultural practices, <i>(b)</i> to increase productivity and <i>(c)</i> to improve access to credit for farmers in India.  [68172]</p>




<p><a name="st_111"><a name="60511w14.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Agriculture in India is generally a success story. India is self sufficient in staple grain crops in most years and stores a substantial surplus. The so-called &#039;green revolution&#039; has been the main driving force behind this success, promoting the use of improved crop varieties and fertilisers in areas with access to irrigation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w14.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_114">However, the benefits of new technologies have not been equitably distributed. DFID&#039;s focus has been on improving the livelihoods of farmers and other rural people in rain-fed areas which are not suited to the particular packages of improvements offered by the green revolution. The focus on livelihoods, rather than agriculture, recognises that poor people are often landless and depend on a diverse range of activities to support themselves. However, DFID-supported projects have developed and tested appropriate new agricultural technologies and tools in these areas that have resulted in increases in production and income, more efficient and sustainable use of soil and water resources and reduction of hard manual labour, particularly for women. Some examples are treadle pumps for small scale irrigation, seed drills, paddy rice transplanters, which have made work easier as well as contributing to improvements in production.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w14.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_115">Consistent with this approach, DFID has concentrated on micro-credit rather than agricultural credit. DFID is working with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to develop the capacity of micro-finance institutions to on-lend to individuals or groups. Approximately 45 per cent. of these loans are for agriculture, livestock, fisheries or related activities. DFID&#039;s rural livelihoods projects incorporate revolving funds at the village level to support agriculture, livestock and micro-enterprise activities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to the answer of 27 April 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1231&#150;2W, on fledgling democracies, why his Department does not track multilateral aid; and what mechanisms are in place in his Department to evaluate the effectiveness of the programmes which UK aid funds.

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60511w14.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID reviews the effectiveness of all bilateral projects over &#163;1 million at least once a year. This includes money which DFID country programmes channel through multilateral agencies since according to international convention this aid is classified as bilateral. DFID has a public service agreement target to achieve a sustained increase in the quality of DFID&#039;s bilateral projects. DFID reports progress towards this target in the Departmental Report and the Autumn Performance Report. This year&#039;s Departmental Report will be published on 9th May.

This monitoring system cannot track core contributions to multilateral agencies because these funds are pooled. However, DFID uses a Multilateral Effectiveness Framework and other assessments to evaluate the performance of the multilateral agencies. During 2004, DFID used the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess 23 multilateral agencies against their objectives. These objectives were agreed jointly with DFID and set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper. These institutional strategies are publicly available. DFID uses the results of the Multilateral Effectiveness Frameworks and other mechanisms to inform decisions around funding for the multilateral agencies.

 There is a close relationship in action to improve reproductive health and family planning, maternal health and to make progress on HIV and AIDS. Closing the gap in unmet needs for family planning would make a big contribution to helping to lower maternal mortality. Sexual and reproductive health services are vital in ensuring that women have a choice about if and when to have children, and play a key role in helping them avoid sexually transmitted infection including HIV, including through condom provision.

The United Nations Secretary General&#039;s progress report on the 2001 Declaration of Commitment in HIV and AIDS, released in April, estimates that only 9 per cent. of HIV positive women in low and middle income countries currently receive antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV.

In November 2005, DFID launched a new &quot;People Strategy&quot;, which outlined our vision and commitments on how we will lead, manage, develop and support our people over the next three years. Individual Departments-within DFID plan and manage development away days and team building exercises for their staff in accordance with their specific needs in the context of business planning, continual professional development and performance improvement. Costs are usually met through delegated divisional or departmental training budgets.

 DFID provides some support to sub-Saharan African countries for the development and facilitation of their national policies on trade, and specific issues like tourism, through its bilateral programmes. Much of DFID&#039;s support on trade to Sub Saharan Africa is provided regionally through programmes such as the Capacity-Building for Trade Policy and Negotiations and the Southern Africa Trade and Poverty Programme, and multilateral through institutions like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

<a name="stpa_119">Governments can access funds for trade delegations to the UK and other destinations from a variety of sources, many supported by DFID funds, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trust Fund for Least Developed Country Travel managed by UNCTAD. This information is not held centrally and would involve a disproportionate cost to collect. For example, a delegation of developing country trade negotiators including from sub-Saharan Africa came to the UK at the end of last year. This was funded by the European Development Fund, to which the UK makes subscriptions.

 The Department is encouraging schools to put the guidance on participation into practice in ways that are meaningful to children and young people.

We have ensured that inspection arrangements make the views of children and young people an important part of assessing how local areas are doing, and of school inspections.
