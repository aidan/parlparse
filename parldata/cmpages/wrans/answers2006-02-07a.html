<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60207w01.html_spnew10"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 We have made no independent assessment of the numbers or strength of Illegal Armed Groups in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan New Beginnings Programme (ANBP), the mechanism through which the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the United National Development Programme and the international community support the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s efforts to disarm, demobilise and reintegrate former Afghan Military Force members, estimates that there are 2,000 groups with a total strength of up to 100,000 members. 579 of these groups are already engaged in the disarmament and demobilisation programme. The UK is represented on the ANBP international co-ordinating body and has contributed over &#163;12 million to the ANBP and separate weapons destruction programmes since 2002.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what quantity of drugs was seized in Afghanistan during 2005, broken down by type of narcotic.  [49282]</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60207w01.html_spnew11"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 We estimate that the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan and the Afghan Special Narcotics Force have seized around 165 tonnes of opiates since November 2004. However, seizure figures since 2001 have been unreliable, due to difficulties in collating data centrally within Afghanistan. Additionally, forensic facilities are not yet widely available in Afghanistan and so Afghan police are often unable to accurately identify substances or record the quantities. We are unable, therefore, to provide a breakdown of types of narcotics seized.

<a name="stpa_7">DFID already recognises that a wide range of circumstances present significant development challenges to the overseas territories (OT) including small size, isolation and access, limited human resource capacity and vulnerability to external shocks. Funding decisions are not based only, or even primarily, on per capita income criteria, but with limited resources prioritisation is inevitable towards those territories which most need development assistance.

We combine this with a development programme to help increase revenue and manage recurrent expenditure efficiently. We do however also provide assistance to other territories through our cross-cutting programme which provides support for a range of activities that are common to many or all of the OTs. These programmes include natural disaster management, environment protection, HIV/AIDS, law revision and child protection. All OTs benefit in some way from this assistance.

<a name="stpa_9">EU programmes have to a large extent focused on those overseas countries and territories whose economic development is least advanced, with wealth per capita criteria being the main deciding factors for allocations. However we are currently in discussion with the European Commission about the arrangements for continued funding for the OTs when the current allocations end after 2007. These discussions have included the commissioning of a study to look at a range of criteria, in addition to gross national income (GNI) per capita, to help determine the allocation of EU development funds to individual territories. We are also working to ensure that, overall, OTs receive an equitable allocation within the total available for EU development funding.

 &quot;The Feasibility Study of Road Pricing in the UK&quot;, published by the Department for Transport in July 2004, showed that road pricing could potentially reduce congestion by some 40 per cent. with benefits of up to &#163;12 billion a year in time savings and increased reliability. The study modelled a wide range of theoretical schemes and charges including variants of national road pricing and of charging in local authority areas.

 The Traffic Management Act (004) enabled the Highways Agency to establish a Traffic Officer Service on motorways and on a limited number of all purpose trunk roads in England. The congestion reduction benefits derived from the introduction of the traffic officer service are not due to be assessed until 2008 when the service will have been fully operational for 12 months. I would expect the assessment, which will cover the impacts of introducing the traffic officer service on reducing incident related congestion; improving safety; improving the accuracy of information on variable message signs and freeing up police resources for tackling criminality, to be published after this time when the data has been gathered and analysed.

 With regard to <i>(a)</i> <i>,</i> the Government considered the responses to a consultation on public entertainment licensing conducted in 1996 and the findings of a review of licensing law conducted with stakeholders between 1998 and 1999. The outcome of the Government&#039;s consideration of the evidence was reported in the White Paper &quot;Time for Reform: the Modernisation of our Licensing Laws&quot; (Cm 4696). The Government subsequently considered about 1200 responses to the White Paper and the views of relevant stakeholders, including the Arts Council for England, the Musicians&#039; Union, Equity, the Independent Street Arts Network and the Circus Arts Forum.

<a name="60207w07.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_49">The evidence showed that live music in bars and restaurants was generally licensable under the 1963 and 1982 Acts, save for the narrow exemption under section 182 of the 1964 Act applying to live music performed by not more than two people throughout the day on premises licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises. Punch and Judy shows were licensable under the Theatres Act 1968, but in practice this law was rarely, if ever, enforced. The position of circuses was unclear under the 1963, 1982 and 1968 Acts because of anachronistic exemptions in the 1982 Act which related to entertainments at pleasure fairs and the lack of any obvious exemptions under the 1963 and 1968 Acts. However, in practice circuses were not being licensed, though some were being controlled by local authorities through the unsatisfactory use of public health legislation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry why energy from waste plants accepting mixed waste will not be eligible for renewable obligation certificates.  [47813]</p>




<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60207w10.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government made clear in the statutory consultation document on the 2005&#150;06 review of the renewables obligation that the majority of new energy from waste projects should not need the support of the obligation to be economic. For this reason the Government does not propose to introduce an amendment to eligibility, which would allow the majority of new projects using conventional technologies to claim renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) from mixed waste.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w10.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_60">The statutory consultation document also made clear that whilst the majority of new energy from mixed waste plants, utilising conventional combustion technology, should be economic without the support of the obligation, energy from mixed waste plants, which utilise combined heat and power (CHP), would be likely to face additional capital costs in relation to the supply of heat. Given the carbon abatement benefits arising from the use, rather than the waste of heat from the combustion process, the Government proposes to extend ROC eligibility to electricity generated from the biomass fraction of mixed waste, which uses CHP. This change will take effect from 1 April 2006.

<p>

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60207w10.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s aim is have in place controls which give the consumer sufficient safeguards but which do not unduly hamper the development of the market. Unsolicited text (SMS) messages are illegal under new statutory controls, which were introduced as part of the new Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) is responsible for administering Premium Rate Services (PRS) and can fine companies and bar access to services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_63">As a result of various PRS scams during 2004, the Government asked the communications and media regulator, Ofcom to carry out a review of PRS regulation. In December 2004 Ofcom published a report, which contained a set of recommendations to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Feb 2006 : Column 1072W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
reduce the scope for consumer harm. Most of Ofcom&#039;s recommendations have already been implemented to improve the PRS regulatory regime, including raising the maximum penalty for breaches of the ICSTIS Code of Practice from &#163;100,000 to &#163;250,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w10.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">The recommendations focus on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">Enforcement&#151;tightening up the regulatory regime to give the regulator, ICSTIS, more powers to act more quickly against those abusing the PRS payment mechanism.</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w10.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">One key recommendation that has already been implemented is to slow down the flow of funds from network operators to service providers, by making operators withhold payment for 30 days from when a PRS call is made. New rules on compensation for consumers who have been subject to a scam are also being implemented. Then, if there are complaints, it will be possible to hold back funds for a longer period, thus ensuring that fines and repayments can be paid. This will reduce the likelihood of a quick gain being made through the provision of unwanted or unacceptable practices. The new requirement will allow ICSTIS to have suspect services cut off at an earlier stage using its emergency procedure and prevent service providers from being paid for fraudulent services. The commencement date for this new requirement was 15 September 2005.

<a name="stpa_67">The industry itself announced in January 2005 that consumers must be clearly informed by text about what they have subscribed to, the cost, and how to stop the service (a consumer &quot;must&quot; be able to switch off the service with the universal &quot;stop&quot; command). All the UK mobile operators have signed up to these new safeguards and agreed to require those content providers using their networks to comply with them. In other words <i>all</i> content providers have to comply with the new safeguards or will face the suspension of their services (and therefore the blocking and loss of revenue).

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60207w10.html_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The 2003 Energy White Paper did not specifically forecast the rate of depletion of UK gas but it did say that &quot;it is . . . likely that the UK will become a net importer of gas on an annual basis by around 2006&quot; (paragraph 6.13). This was in line with the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Feb 2006 : Column 1074W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
projections of outside analysts. For example, Wood Mackenzie, in its August 2001 multi-client report entitled &quot;Running Short of Gas: The Outlook for UK and Irish Gas Markets&quot;, had said &quot;It is probable that the UK will become a net importer of gas in either 2005 or 2006.&quot; The following table compares the Department&#039;s central view of both production and demand at the time of the Energy White Paper with its current central view. This shows that our own gas production from the North Sea declined faster than expected in 2004, with declining production from existing fields not being offset by production from new, smaller fields, and we moved to being a small net gas importer.

 As NATO seeks to expand its International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) further across Afghanistan, there are clear benefits in seeking greater synergy with the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) mission. These include less duplication of effort between the two missions, a more concerted approach to support for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and simplified coordination with the Government of Afghanistan of the international community&#039;s military involvement in the country.

 It is for individual departments to consider whether national security vetting, or other checks, should be applied to those who are appointed to the boards of their public bodies. The Cabinet Office issues guidance on public appointments to departments in its publication &#039;Making and Managing Public Appointments&#039;, available on the Public Appointment Unit&#039;s website www.publicappointments.gov.uk/publications. This advises departments to consider during their recruitment of appointees to public bodies whether they need to obtain a Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau because of the nature of the appointment. This will be particularly relevant to appointments to public bodies which work closely with children and vulnerable adults.

<sup>(21)</sup> Changes in BCU boundaries mean that figures for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 are not comparable.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Metropolitan police figures will not agree with totals published in &#039;Crime in England and Wales 2004&#150;05&#039; since not all crimes are assigned to BCUs.<br>

2. Offence rates are not applicable for airports as they have no resident population.<br>

3. All crime rates are based on mid-2003 population estimates supplied by the Office for National Statistics.<br>





4. Caution needs to be taken when considering crime rates of city centre areas, due to the very small population and household levels in these areas. The very high reported crime rates in city centres are partly due to the use of small resident population and household figures as the denominator of the crime rate. The &#039;transient population&#039; that migrates into these areas on a daily basis, either for work or leisure, will not be reflected in the resident population figures. Changes in population estimates between years must also be borne in mind when comparing changes in crime rates.<br>

 Section 64A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 provides that photographs can be taken of persons detained at a police station and elsewhere than at a police station. Under the PACE Code of Practice for the Identification of Persons by Police Officers (Code D), the officer proposing to take a detainee&#039;s photograph may require the person to remove any item or substance worn on, or over, or any part of, their head or face. If the person does not comply with such a requirement, the officer may remove the item or substance. In order to obtain a suspect&#039;s consent and co-operation to remove an item of religious headwear or face covering to take a photograph, officer should consider whether in the removal of the situation the removal of the headwear or covering and the taking of the photograph should be by an officer of the same sex as the person.

 Spirits fraud continues to be a significant problem, and the Duty Stamps scheme is central to the Government&#039;s strategy for tackling it. Duty stamps remain a proportionate response to the problem.

With over 20,000 schools across the country there will of course be a range of differing measures and practices adopted by schools, head teachers and governing bodies to ensure that the work-life balance of their head teachers is appropriately agreed and addressed. We are confident in the professionalism of our head teachers and in the skills and judgment of school governors across the country. We would expect that they will work collaboratively to ensure that the work-life balance of the head and indeed the whole school workforce is addressed accordingly.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what factors explain the reduction in the final financial settlement for 2006&#150;07 to Worcestershire county council from the provisional figures; and what the percentage increase is between <i>(a)</i> 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07 and <i>(b)</i> 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 for non-education services. [49657]</p>




<p><a name="st_241"><a name="60207w26.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 There are a number of factors which explain the reduction of &#163;19,692, or 0.03 per cent., in formula grant for Worcestershire county council between consultation and settlement. These are described briefly as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91"><i>(a)</i> A 0.1 per cent. decrease in the 2005&#150;06 Adjusted Local Education Authority Central Functions Formula Spending Share. This was due mainly to a downward revision of the control total for this service block which affected all relevant authorities. A smaller downward revision was also made to the teachers pay grant adjustment for Worcestershire.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92"><i>(b)</i> A further transfer of &#163;12.269 million for the WEEE directive was added into the 2006&#150;07 formula grant between Consultation and Settlement. In order to ensure a like-for-like comparison between 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07, an adjustment of &#163;11.974 million was made to the County-Level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services Formula Spending Share in 2005&#150;06. This led to a 0.3 per cent. increase for all authorities.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"><i>(c)</i> A 0.1 per cent. decrease in the 2005&#150;06 Adjusted Capital Financing Formula Spending Share due to a change in the methodology of adjusting for the Education SCE(R) programme which transferred to capital grant in 2006&#150;07. The SCE(R)&#039;s for Building Schools for the Future were excluded from this adjustment thereby increasing the 2005&#150;06 Adjusted Capital Financing Formula Spending Share for those authorities that received a Building Schools for the Future SCE(R) in 2005&#150;06, and decreasing the 2005&#150;06 Adjusted Capital Financing Formula Spending Share for those authorities that did not receive a Building Schools for the Future SCE(R) in 2005&#150;06, like Worcestershire.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w26.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_140">The combined effect of the adjustments shown in <i>(a)</i> to <i>(c)</i> led to a decrease of &#163;19,307 in the Adjusted Formula Grant for 2005&#150;06.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"><i>(d)</i> The number of pupils aged 3 to 18 increased by 7 pupils for Worcestershire between consultation and settlement due to the inclusion of pupils aged 16 and over on Form 8b. However as these had previously not been included for all authorities, this had a negligible effect on Worcestershire&#039;s Local Authority Central Education Functions Relative Need Formula.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"><i>(e)</i> A further transfer of &#163;12.269 million for the WEEE directive was added into formula grant. This increased all upper-tier authorities&#039;, including Worcestershire&#039;s, County-Level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services Relative Needs Formula by approximately 0.3 per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Feb 2006 : Column 1140W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"><i>(f)</i> A 0.2 per cent. decrease in Capital Financing Relative Needs Formula. At consultation, the Capital Finance Relative Needs Formula is calculated with provisional SCE(R) data and this is expected to change at settlement. Extra SCE(R)s were included in the calculation of the settlement that were not included at consultation. This results in a lower scaling factor for all authorities i.e. those authorities who see an increase in their SCE(R) allocation take a larger slice of the fixed control total so reducing the Capital Financing Relative Needs Formula for other authorities. Although Worcestershire did receive an increase in SCE(R) allocations at settlement, this increase was not enough to counter the reduction in Relative Needs Formula resulting from the reduced scaling factor.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"><i>(g)</i> The changes to both the Adjusted 2005&#150;06 Formula Grant and the 2006&#150;07 Relative Needs Formulae, led in turn to changes in both the share of taxbase for authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities, and in the split between the Relative Needs Amount, the Relative Resource Amount and the Central Allocation blocks.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w26.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_141">The combined effect of the changes shown in <i>(d)</i> to <i>(g)</i> led to a decrease in formula grant before floor damping of &#163;10,880. The combined effect of the changes shown in <i>(a)</i> to <i>(g)</i> led to a decrease in formula grant after floor damping of &#163;19,692.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w26.html_para11">
<a name="qnpa_38">In 2006&#150;07 Worcestershire received an increase in Formula Grant of 3.8 per cent. on a like-for-like basis, after adjusting for changes in funding and function. However, we are also making Amending Reports for both 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 at the same time as the 2006&#150;07 Settlement. Worcestershire&#039;s 2004&#150;05 Amending Report Formula Grant was &#163;1,007,385 less than the 2004&#150;05 Settlement Formula Grant; Worcestershire&#039;s 2005&#150;06 Amending Report Formula Grant was &#163;196,583 less than the 2005&#150;06 Settlement Formula Grant. Therefore the net change in Formula Grant for Worcestershire in 2006&#150;07 is 2.0 per cent. Worcestershire is a floor authority: it receives &#163;3,381,779 formula grant from the floor damping mechanism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60207w26.html_para12">
<a name="qnpa_39">In 2007&#150;08 Worcestershire received an increase in Formula Grant of 2.7 per cent. Again Worcestershire is a floor authority: it receives &#163;2,958,439 formula grant from the floor damping mechanism.

 This cannot be determined until the Valuation and Lands Agency completes the revaluation process in the spring of 2006.

The Department&#039;s own analysis supports these estimates and indicates that the proportion of properties which will experience a decrease in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 52 per cent., the proportion that will face an increase in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 35 per cent. and the proportion with no change in bill (that is, between + /- 5 per cent.) is 13 per cent.

<sup>(39)</sup> Leeds had problems with its software system in 2005 which had a negative impact on the processing times for 2004&#150;05. The average housing benefit processing for all Pathfinders excluding Leeds is 46 days in 2004&#150;05 compared to 53 days in 2003&#150;04.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The reported figures are for housing benefit claims and do not include council tax benefit claims. The processing times cover claims from tenants renting from a social landlord as well as those 



renting from a private landlord, so the large majority of these claims in Pathfinder areas will not be for the local housing allowance.<br>

2. The reported averages are weighted averages (by new claim workload).<br>

 We want to make sure that everyone in society has the opportunity to enter into employment including those who misuse drugs. We have been working towards this goal for some time. The progress2work initiative, which supports those who are recovering from drugs misuse into work, has now been rolled out across Jobcentre Plus. It delivers specialist support to help people find and sustain employment. So far, over 4,000 claimants on incapacity benefits have participated in the initiative.

<p>
<a name="60207w33.html_para9">
<a name="qnpa_86">Our assessment is that making participation in a rehabilitation scheme compulsory for incapacity benefit claimants who misuse drugs would be inappropriate. For drug and alcohol misuse, the most effective medical intervention is likely to be counselling/cognitive behavioural therapy, but neither route is going to be effective unless the patient willingly engages. Compulsory therapy with an unwilling participant is most likely to be ineffective.

<p>
<a name="60207w33.html_para10">
<a name="qnpa_87">Medical treatment can be agreed as part of a claimant&#039;s action plan. This is because an individual can volunteer to undertake treatment (whether of their own volition or by persuasion from a personal adviser) as happens in Pathways. However, for a health care professional to carry out a medical intervention, there must be patient consent. That consent must be informed consent, given freely. In law, consent given under duress is not given fully and freely and the fear of losing benefit could amount to duress. This means that we cannot sanction a claimant for not undertaking medical treatment if they decided they did not want to do it at any point in the process.

For lone parents who remain on IS until their youngest child reaches 16, this will involve a series of up to eight work focused interviews over a two year period, which is six more than under previous arrangements.

 There are approximately 1 per cent. of human tuberculosis (TB) cases attributed to M. bovis each year. Most of these cases are reactivated disease in older adults who were infected perhaps decades ago or are due to more recent infections contracted abroad.

<a name="60207w38.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_149">The strict policy of testing cattle for TB infection combined with meat inspection and pasteurisation of milk and milk products has dramatically reduced the risk from bovine TB. While transmission of tuberculosis from cattle to humans is possible, it is extremely rare. There has been no reported case of transmission of bovine TB from cattle to a child in England and Wales since the Health Protection Agency national reporting system MycobNet began in 1993.
