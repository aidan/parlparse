 Cost sharing on animal health issues between Government and industry is a key part of our Animal Health and Welfare Strategy. As there are benefits to herd owners from buying or selling cattle with additional disease assurance, it is right that they should share the cost of tests which are outside the routine surveillance programme. The Government continue to fund the provision of tuberculin and all routine surveillance testing at a cost of over &#163;40 million per annum.

This document ensures that the use of genetic information by insurance companies will be transparent, fair, and subject to independent oversight. It sets out a range of protections against the use of genetic information by insurers and puts in place until November 2011 a voluntary agreement banning the use by insurers of the results from predictive genetic tests, including tests on breast cancer genes, in deciding the premiums of insurance policies.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will break down the number of active members of schemes referred to in Table 3.14 of Occupational pension schemes 2004: the twelfth survey by the Government Actuary by <i>(a)</i> normal pension age, <i>(b)</i> sector and <i>(c)</i> benefit type; whether those public sector employees who are not members of public service schemes are treated as being in the public sector category; and whether the data for public and private sector schemes are consistent with previous such surveys by the Government Actuary.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60306w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The definitions of public sector and private sector pension schemes are set out in paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14 of the report &#039;Occupational pension schemes 2004: Twelfth Survey by the Government Actuary&#039;. This follows a classification used by the pension schemes registry. Exactly the same approach was adopted for the previous (2000) survey. Members of schemes are categorised according to the scheme of which they are a member, and not by the sector in which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Mar 2006 : Column 1105W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
they are employed. Those employees in both the public and private sector who are not members of occupational pension schemes are not recorded in the survey.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding the population of each <i>(a)</i> Lancashire constituency <i>(b)</i> each Ribble Valley ward according to figures from (i) the 2001 Census, (ii) most recent electoral rolls, and (iii) most recent figures for health service users; and what projections have been made for the next five years. I am replying in her absence. (55882)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">The tables attached provide the information you have requested. Data for Lancashire constituencies are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Data for Ribble Valley wards are shown in Table 3.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">Electoral rolls provide counts of the number of people registered to vote. Local/European electorate and Parliamentary electorate counts for Lancashire constituencies can be found in Table 1 The 2005 figures are the latest available data. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are a number of reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">The number of people registered with a GP, living in each Lancashire constituency, in July 2004, can also be found in Table 1. It should also be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">The projections in Table 2 for mid-2006 to mid-2010 are based on the mid-2003 population estimates and are the latest population projections available. They assume that trends in fertility, mortality and migration at the time of the mid-2003 population estimate will continue into the future. Population projections are not available for most of the Lancashire constituencies because projections are not routinely produced for constituencies. Local Authority population projections are however produced, and where constituency projections are shown, this reflects that these constituencies have common boundaries with local authority districts.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">Ward data are shown in Table 3; the points set out above also apply to wards. However, there are some further points to note for wards. The local government electorate is definitionally closer to the population estimates; however these data are not available at ward level. Hence, the Parliamentary electorate is shown, the most recent data available are for December 2004.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps were taken to ensure the seafood purification plant project in Warrenpoint does not duplicate services provided by other Government-funded projects in Northern Ireland.  [54648]</p>




<p><a name="st_152"><a name="60306w16.html_spnew5"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The shellfish purification plant currently under construction at Warrenpoint will be the first such public facility of its kind in the Carlingford Lough region. This is an important part of the reconstruction of Warrenpoint harbour area being undertaken with assistance from the Interreg Programme to provide safe, modern facilities for mussel dredgers using the Lough. Since this will be the only public shellfish purification unit in the area, there is no duplication with any other grant-aided projects.

<a name="stpa_111">I understand from the chief constable that the decline in BCU strength between March 2004 and March 2005 is due to the transfer of custody officers to a centrally managed criminal justice unit and the creation of operational support teams also centrally resourced. Although these officers continue to be based within each BCU they are not under its control. These changes have been cosmetic and do not reduce the number of officers available for front-line duties in each of the BCUs.

In cases where after taking reasonable steps the police have not been able to notify the owner of the recovery of his stolen vehicle, they will normally authorise its disposal on a date not less than 14 working days after the date of its recovery.

The Actual Average Clearance Times (AACT) for JSA is measured from the date the customer first contacts Jobcentre Plus to the date the customer is sent a notice of entitlement. The performance of AACT for JSA has increased nationally from 11 days in April 04 to 15 days in December 05. Initial analysis showed that shortfalls in performance in the &#039;initial contact&#039; part of the process were critical. Delays in contact centres and local service outlets were a contributory factor to the situation as well as the time it can take to gather evidence from third parties before claims can be processed.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">Some of our customers did experience problems getting through to our contact centres over the Summer months. Robust plans were put in place to address this, which resulted in week on week improvements. The most recent performance information for our contact centres shows that in the week ending 3rd February we answered over 94 percent of calls offered.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">To address the issue of fluctuating clearance times in benefit processing a taskforce has developed immediate recovery measures. Building on the taskforce&#039;s work, the Jobcentre Plus Chief Operating Officer launched a National Action Plan in the week commencing 30 January. The Action Plan is built around a mandatory series of &quot;health checks&quot;, taking local managers through the whole end to end process, identifying key risk elements and, where a part of the process fails the health check, directing managers to appropriate good practice products and tool-kits. Regular reviews are undertaken to ensure areas of our business do not fall below expectation. We are already seeing improvements following the introduction of these measures.</p>

<a name="stpa_129">A number of sets of regulations came into force on 30 December 2005 which related to the European Directive on Occupational Pensions (Directive 2003/41/EC). These regulations had initially been expected to be in place by 23 September 2005, in line with the overall timetable for implementing the directive. The delay was necessary in order to take account of the issues raised following extensive consultation earlier in the year.

<a name="stpa_130">There has also been a delay to our planned timetable for the introduction of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2006. Consultation on the regulations raised a large number of helpful technical comments that need to be carefully considered. Therefore, although these regulations were scheduled for April 2006, they will now come into effect in October 2006. The delay will not have any untoward effects on schemes, as the existing regulations will still apply.

 The British overseas territories (as listed in annex II to the EC Treaty) were consulted between 1991 and 1995 by the United Kingdom when the WTO was being negotiated as to whether they wished to be covered by it.

The figures provided are based on the total service expenditure. This is the only definition for which figures are available on a consistent basis from 2000&#150;01 to 2005&#150;06. This is because fire authorities in shire areas were financed largely by contributions from county councils and unitary authorities in their area before 2004&#150;05, and these amounts were netted off under all the other definitions. Since 2005&#150;06 fire authorities have been able to finance their budget directly. Year-on-year percentage change in real terms has been calculated using the HM Treasury&#039;s GDP deflators.

However, overall there has been a clear deterioration in the human rights situation in Uzbekistan. The arbitrary arrest, detention and trials of eye-witnesses to the events in Andizhan of 12&#150;13 May 2005 have been accompanied by increasing restrictions on freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion, by a continuing refusal to register political parties, and by ongoing harassment, detention and trial of human rights defenders, journalists and others.

 We have received reports that Shearia and its surrounding villages, along with other areas in North and South Sudan, have in the last two weeks been subjected to fighting between forces of the Government of Sudan and elements of the Sudan Liberation Army/Movement (SLA/M). The African Union Mission in Sudan is investigating the series of incidents which, if reports are verified, would constitute violations of the Abuja Security and Humanitarian Protocols.

 The Government of Sudan (GoS) continues to fly helicopter gunships in Darfur, but it is unclear whether they have been active in attacks. The African Union is currently investigating and we await their reports. Offensive military flights by the GoS would constitute a breach of its obligations under the Abuja Security Protocol and, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591, those responsible would be liable to targeted sanctions.

We have received no reports of the Sudanese army making incursions into Chad, although we understand that rebel groups and militia from both Chad and Sudan regularly cross the border.

 Under the Austrian Presidency, the European Commission is taking forward the negotiations following the framework agreed on 3 October 2005. It is currently screening Turkey&#039;s legislation against the EU <i>acquis</i> and has completed screening on 9 Chapters. The Commission presented its first screening reports, on Science and Research and Education and Culture, to Member States in February, concluding that Turkey is ready to open negotiations in both chapters. Following the presentation of the Commission&#039;s screening reports it is for Member States to consider whether to set benchmarks for Turkey to fulfil before the opening of chapters, and then decide whether any chapters are ready to be opened. The relevant Council Working Group has recently recommended the opening of the Science and Research Chapter and we expect this to happen during the Austrian Presidency.
