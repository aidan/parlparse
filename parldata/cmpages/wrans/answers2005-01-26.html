 No research has been commissioned in respect of air launched cluster munitions as they are gradually being withdrawn from service over the next five years. Recent statistics show an overall failure rate which is in line with expectations. For Ground Launched systems, the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is due to be replaced by the future GMLRS Area Effects Munition (AEM) with a planned in service date of early 2007. The new system has bomblets fitted with a self destruct faze giving a failure rate of less than 1 per cent. Whilst the Shell 155mm HE L20A1 Extended Range Bomblet Shell (ERBS) has a maximum failure rate of 2 per cent. at the 95 per cent. Confidence LeveL The bomblet fuze has a self destruct mechanism. Analysis shows that for a significant percentage of likely targets the bomblet remains the most effective munition.

 Aerosol pollution cools the climate and partially offsets some of the warming due to greenhouse gases but we don&#039;t know with certainty by how much. Defra&#039;s Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre has been investigating the impacts of aerosol on climate change and the risks of acceleration of climate change for some time. Good climate models already include the effects of aerosol and look at how climate change could be affected if the whole range of uncertainty in aerosol is included in model calculations. The result is an increase to the uncertainty range of climate sensitivity both globally and in the UK.

<p><a name="50126w05.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Prospects for Palestinian economic regeneration are bleak unless the underlying causes of economic decline and poverty are addressed. The Government of Israel needs to ease the system of restrictions on the movement of people and goods imposed since the beginning of the &quot;intifada&quot;. The Palestinian Authority also needs to invigorate its programme of governance reforms in order to create an internal environment more attractive to private investors. The UK is working closely with international partners on both these issues. Economic issues will be a key theme of the London meeting on 1 March. This will be an opportunity to support the new Palestinian leadership in strengthening its institutional capacity and will also help stimulate progress on the Road Map towards a settlement which will allow the Palestinian economy to grow again.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the Government&#039;s priorities for the Education, Youth and Culture Council will be during the United Kingdom&#039;s Presidency of the European Union; and if she will make a statement.  [209555]</p>




<p><a name="50126w08.html_spnew1"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Operational Programme of the Council for 2005 submitted by the incoming Luxembourg and United Kingdom Presidencies and based on the Multi-Annual Strategic Programme for 2004&#150;06 sets out priority areas of work in all policy 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Jan 2005 : Column 358W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
areas, including education, youth and culture. A copy of the Annual Operation Programme for 2005 is available in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w08.html_para1">
The focus of the programme is on the on-going handling of EU business. What will fall to the UK Presidency depends on the progress made by the Council, European Parliament and Commission under the Luxembourg Presidency. The programme reflects the main UK Presidency objectives and provides the basis for us to take forward our priorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w08.html_para2">
Key issues for the UK Presidency generally are likely to include progressing the delivery of the Lisbon agenda of more and better jobs, sustainable economic growth and greater competitiveness. In the Education part of the Council, we will aim to make good progress on the proposed new Integrated Lifelong Learning programme 2007&#150;13. We will also begin work on the preparation of a report to the 2006 Spring European Council on the implementation of the detailed work programme 2010 for education and training systems agreed at Barcelona in spring 2002. In the Youth part of the Council, we will continue our negotiations on the Youth in Action programme for 2007&#150;13. In the Culture and Audiovisual part of the Council, we will seek to move towards agreement on the proposed new culture programmes (2007&#150;13) and the new Media programmes (2007&#150;13). We will also seek to make progress on priority initiatives flowing from the new Culture Council work plan, in particular those on digitisation of cultural heritage and mobility of museum collections. In addition, we will take forward the preparatory work for a review of the Television without Frontiers (&quot;TVWF&quot;) directive.

 The Government do not provide guidelines specifying how much time non-resident parents should have with their children. The Government believe that children benefit from a meaningful relationship with both parents following divorce or separation, where it is safe to do so. The Children Act 1989 supports this and, most importantly, it makes the welfare of the child concerned, rather than the rights of the parents, its paramount consideration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w09.html_para3">
In 2002 the Government published the Parenting Plans which contained a checklist of issues for parents to consider in making contact arrangements. We are currently developing a new edition of the Plans. The new Parenting Plans will contain a set of templates which seek to show parents the sort of contact arrangements that work well for children of different ages and who are living in a range of circumstances. They will describe, in practical terms, arrangements that are generally beneficial for children. They are intended to be used as practical aids, both by parents themselves and by solicitors, conciliators and mediators, to help parents to reach reasonable agreements. These will be made widely in solicitors&#039; offices as well as through advice and mediation services.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what proportion of a school&#039;s governing body is required to be filled by parent governors for <i>(a)</i> community, <i>(b)</i> foundation, <i>(c)</i> voluntary aided, <i>(d)</i> voluntary controlled and <i>(e)</i> academy schools; and whether the proportion has changed since 1997.

 Before the introduction of the Education Act 2002 the number of each category of school governor on a school&#039;s governing body was fixed according to the type and size of school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w10.html_para0">
Governing bodies can now choose their own size and the proportion of membership of the various stakeholder groups with an interest in the school: parents, staff, the local authority, the community, and the school&#039;s foundation body if it has one; in accordance with guiding principles. In all categories of maintained schools parents must constitute at least one third of the total governing body membership. This compares favourably with the proportion of governors of maintained schools required to be parents in 1997. The Academies programme was launched in March 2000 and the first Academies opened in 2002. Academies have different governance arrangements to maintained schools. Their Funding Agreements have required that at least one parent governor is represented on the Governing Body.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will eliminate the LD50 test as a regulatory instrument for the safety and potency testing of Botox, in favour of in-vitro methods; and if he will make a statement.  [209075]</p>




<p><a name="50126w12.html_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Botox is the trade name for one of the products containing botulinum toxin. International and UK regulations concerning safety and efficacy of medicines require testing for botulinum toxin products at various stages of their processing, from harvesting through to marketing as a finished product for use as a prescription only medicine.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Jan 2005 : Column 378W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="50126w12.html_para2">
The European Pharmacopoeia states that the potency of the toxin as a reconstituted product is determined by an LD50 assay in mice (the reference method), or by a method validated with respect to the LD50 assay. Unfortunately there is at present no accepted and validated alternative to the LD50 test for determining the potency of botulinum toxin at the production stage. Other methods, including an in vitro test, can additionally be employed, and are being used, for example when confirmatory assay of potency is needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w12.html_para3">
Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 only the test method which causes the least animal suffering, while achieving the scientific objective, can be licensed in the UK. This means that in vitro tests must be used wherever possible and, when there is no non-animal alternative, animal suffering must be minimised by use of the mildest procedures available. Conditions on project licences require this, so that when a less severe validated alternative to the LD50 test becomes available, it must be used.

 The Home Office Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) produces Country Reports on the 20 countries that generate the largest number of asylum applications in the UK.

The majority of these costs are attributable to heroin and crack cocaine users. The cost per user is estimated to be &#163;7,013 per annum.

<p><a name="50126w14.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The new biometric passports (ePassports) will have a chip that is to be read by readers located at airports. While all ePassports should conform to a number of international standards, there remains room for interpretation, and thus there will be differences in the way the passports are presented to, and read by, the readers. The time taken to read an ePassport will therefore depend upon the nationality of the ePassport presented and the make/model of the scanner to which it is presented. Trials to assess the

interoperability of nations&#039; ePassports and candidate readers are being conducted by some 20 nations. UKPS is fully involved in these. In addition we will be conducting our own tests in UK on a variety of ePassport/reader combinations.

<p>
<a name="50126w14.html_para3">
Until satisfactory interoperability can be demonstrated between UK preferred readers and a range of ePassports from other nations, the time to check biometric passports at UK airports cannot be accurately determined. However, current test results indicate that the average reading time is likely to fall in the range 7&#150;10 seconds. It is difficult to make direct and meaningful comparison with non-biometric passport checks since this depends on the actual processes involved.

 The brief given to PMI (later Osprey PMI) in April 2000, on their appointment as Consultants, was that there was a requirement to provide 1,800 additional detention places by the end of the financial year 2000&#150;01. PMI initially advised the Immigration Nationality Directorate (IND) that the timescale was not feasible but, after discussion, it was agreed that tenders would be issued to provide the first centre at Yarl&#039;s Wood. If the marketplace in general came back with the answer that the timescale for the programme was impossible re-assessment would have to be made. In the process, tenders returned documents offering to complete the project within the required timescale by adopting a modular building solution. Following contract award, IND&#039;s contract administrator, PMI carried out continual reviews of programme and progress on Yarl&#039;s Wood and advised IND on at least a weekly basis.

<p class="tabletext">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

<sup>(75)</sup> For the years 1999&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>





For the years 2001&#150;03 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Further to discussions between Foreign Ministers at the extraordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council on 7 January, ECOFIN discussed the economic consequences of the South-Asian Tsunami.

EU financial support could be up to 1.5 billion euros, which will include 100 million euros in humanitarian aid, 350 million euros in reconstruction aid and a proposed EIB loan facility of up to 1 billion euros guaranteed by the EC budget.

All information on the safety of these products is evaluated as it becomes available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w20.html_para1">
Insulin glargine (Lantus) is a long acting insulin licensed throughout the European Union. As with all new medicines, it is currently under intensive monitoring by the MHRA and the CSM. Prescribers are asked to report through the yellow card scheme all suspected adverse reactions for products under intensive monitoring, which are identified by an inverted black triangle symbol in the British National Formulary. When reports are received they are added to the database of adverse drug reactions. All reports of serious adverse drug reactions are evaluated by a member of the professional staff of the MHRA with particular responsibility for that product. These reports are then discussed in the context of all reports for the product at a weekly meeting of professional medical and scientific staff of the MHRA to identify any new safety issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w20.html_para2">
A total of 142 reports of suspected adverse reactions were reporting through the Yellow Card Scheme in association with all human insulins in 2003. The most common adverse drug reactions reported related to decreases or increases in blood sugar, headache, injection site reaction and pruritis (itching).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50126w20.html_para3">
In 2000, the CSM&#039;s sub-committee on Pharmacovigilance (SCOP) considered a systematic review of the literature on the safety of human insulins (Airey et al Diabetic Medicine 2000). A total of 52 randomised controlled trials were identified, in addition to 56 studies of other designs and case reports. The SCOP advised that although some patients have experienced problems on transferring to human insulin and are better suited to animal derived insulins, there is no clear evidence of safety problem specific to human insulin. This advice was communicated to prescribers in an article in the drug safety bulletin, &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot; in September 2000. In 2002, SCOP considered a review of human insulin versus animal insulin in people with diabetes mellitus published by the Cochrane Library. This review included randomised controlled trials of at least one month in duration until May 2002. No significant differences in metabolic control or hypoglycaemic episodes between various insulin species could be elucidated. The patient information leaflets for insulins provide detailed information about the risk of hypoglycaemia and the advice on action to take should it occur.

The Government&#039;s teenage pregnancy and wider sexual health strategies reflect the complex reasons behind England&#039;s high rate of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Key aspects of the Government&#039;s response to these issues are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">information campaigns highlighting: the importance of under-16s delaying sexual activity (evidence tells us that delay results in lower rates of regret and improved contraception use); resisting peer pressure to engage in early sexual activity; and&#151;for young people who are sexually active&#151;the importance of using condoms to protect against unplanned pregnancies and STIs. This final message is reinforced through the Department of Health&#039;s sexual health campaign which, as highlighted in the recent Public Health White Paper, will be expanded, with an emphasis on reaching young people and other hard to reach groups;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">improving both the quality of sex and relationships education in schools and out of school settings, and young people&#039;s access to contraception and sexual health advice services in community settings and general practice;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">provision of enhanced support to teenage parents, to provide a pathway out of social exclusion, in particular through re-engagement in education and training; and better partnership working between local health and education partners through the &quot;Healthy Schools&quot; programme and the establishment of Teenage Pregnancy Partnership Boards in each top tier local authority.</p>

Since then antisocial behaviour response courts have been identified across England and Wales. On 21 January 2004 Lord Falconer announced the identification of the 100th antisocial behaviour response court.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware that the perception of domestic oil pollution risks is changing, and it is considering with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency what additional technical guidance may be necessary.
