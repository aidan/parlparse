The UK argued that the treaty does not apply to the use of nuclear energy for military activities and that therefore it was under no duty to provide the Commission with data on the decommissioning. The European Court of Justice found that the Euratom treaty is not applicable to uses of nuclear energy for military purposes and held that article 37 did not apply to the decommissioning of the Jason reactor.

 The future aircraft carrier project is in its assessment phase, the aim of which is to inform how best to meet our developing capability requirements and to balance the key parameters of performance, time and cost. The complement and displacement of the carriers form part of that assessment and final decisions on these and other main specifications have yet to be taken. Such details, together with estimated costs, are being constantly refined and it would be unhelpful to focus on specific figures until after the main investment decision.

Any actual decision to deploy is taken by the Government, voluntarily and on a case-by-case basis.

This assistance covered Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training and the provision of courses to members of the Colombian armed forces, both in Colombia and in the UK. The former aimed to reduce the number of civilian and military deaths from explosive devices, and the latter at introducing Colombian military personnel to British Defence concepts in key areas, such as Rules of Engagement and democratic and accountable control of the armed forces.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) has a number of workstrands under way that are intended to improve the effectiveness of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM), including the possible introduction of a voluntary intergovernmental code of conduct. While this work is not intended specifically at removing duplication, we would expect through a more competitive and efficient EDEM that market forces would have a beneficial impact on surplus capacity and inefficiencies. More generally the EDA intends to look at future demand and capacity in various sectors of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (such as armoured fighting vehicles), as well as member states&#039; national strategies for these areas, which may lead to recommendations for improving the efficiency in these sectors. However it will be for each member state to decide how or indeed whether to take these forward.

The strategy is one of many initiatives that contribute to the wider aim of ensuring that the capability requirements of the armed forces can be met, now and in the future, on a cost-effective basis.

 In 2001, we estimated that the cost to business of an additional bank holiday would be around &#163;2 billion. It is possible that there would be positive social effects of an additional bank holiday, for example working parents spending more time with their children. However, there is a need to balance the possible benefits of increasing the number of bank holidays to individuals and some businesses against the cost and disruption to other businesses and there are other ways of achieving this positive social effect.

 All electrical equipment would be disposed of in the natural course of events. Digital switchover itself does not require any equipment to be thrown away, but its timing may affect the timing of disposal of some equipment such as rarely used televisions that people choose not to adapt. DTI and Defra are commissioning research to model any changes in patterns of waste disposal generated by switchover now that the timescale has been determined. DCMS and DTI will continue to work with Digital UK to ensure that consumer communications do not encourage unnecessary disposal of television equipment.

 The Government&#039;s main mechanism for supporting renewable energy is the Renewables Obligation.

As wind energy is the most economically competitive form of renewable technology with scope for expansion, it is likely that most new renewable capacity between now and 2010 will be wind generation (both onshore and offshore).

If the caller wishes to speak Welsh, the operator will try to connect the call to a Welsh speaker who can deal with the inquiry.

If the caller rings on one of our direct lines but the person taking the call cannot speak Welsh, he or she will try to transfer it to a suitable Welsh speaking colleague. Again, if no-one is available, the caller will be given the choice of a Welsh speaker calling back, or continuing the call in English. There might be times when there is no Welsh speaker available who can answer the query in full, especially if it is complex or specialised. In these cases, the caller will be given the option of discussing the matter in English or writing to us in Welsh&#151;in which case, they would receive a written reply in Welsh. The switchboard serving our London headquarters may not have Welsh speaking staff. If they receive a call from someone wishing to speak Welsh, the operator will explain that he or she cannot speak Welsh but will offer to try to connect the caller to a Welsh speaker within the department. If none of our Welsh speakers was available, the operator would explain that this was so and offer the caller the option of continuing the conversation in English, or of leaving their details so that a Welsh speaker could ring back later. We have no facilities for dealing with telephone inquiries in Scots Gaelic or Irish Gaelic.

 Debt relief is provided to enable countries to make faster progress towards the millennium development goals. In providing debt relief under agreements such as the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, the UK abides by the HIPC standards agreed internationally. The multilateral debt stock cancellation proposed by the G8 and recently agreed at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings also uses these standards. Private sector, investment and trade regulation reforms are sometimes part of the above processes (for example, in a poverty reduction strategy or where derived from national plans and in-country debate), but such economic policy choices would not be imposed on countries.

This excludes the UK&#039;s share of the EC aid budget which is set against DFID&#039;s budget. It also excludes most UK expenditure on debt relief, although DFID&#039;s contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund is included. This is because most of our internationally agreed debt relief is provided on bilateral (government to government) debts held by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Bilateral debt relief that goes beyond what is required by international agreements (such as our 100 per cent. bilateral cancellation policy for HIPC) is funded by DFID. So too is multilateral debt relief, such as under the new G8 proposal and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) for non-HIPCs.

<a name="stpa_106">The HIPC initiative provides relief and cancellation of debts owed to multilateral institutions as well as debts to bilateral governments. To date, debt relief worth $56billion (&#163;30 billion) in nominal terms has been agreed for 28 countries. Other countries are likely to enter the Initiative next year under its extended Sunset clause&quot;. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that in recent years the HIPC Initiative has freed up around $1 billion a year from debt service payments for the 28 countries that have qualified under HIPC. The UK is the second largest contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, which assists multilateral institutions with the costs of providing debt relief under HIPC. We have pledged a total of $436 million (&#163;240 million) to the Trust Fund ($221 million, plus $88 million of the European Commission contribution in 2000, and a further $95 million, plus $32 million of an EC contribution in 2002). The UK also contributed US$43 million (&#163;24 million) to assist the IMF with its costs of delivering HIPC debt relief.

<a name="stpa_107">On bilateral debt, the Government have cancelled the aid debts owed by the poorest countries (not just the HIPCs), worth some &#163;1.2 billion since 1978. In 1999, theGovernment agreed to cancel 100 per cent. of bilateral debts owed by HIPC countries to the UK when these 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 57W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
countries completed the HIPC process. Since most aid debts had already been cancelled, these were generally export credit guarantee debts. For HIPC countries, total UK debt written off so far (to August 2005) is around &#163;1.2 billion; this includes traditional Paris Club debt treatment, as well as the application of our 100 per cent. bilateral cancellation policy under the HIPC Initiative.

<a name="stpa_108">In 2000, the Government announced that it would not benefit from debt service payments from HIPC countries, and that any payments received from December 2000 would be held in trust and reimbursed to the country once it had successfully completed the HIPC process.

<a name="stpa_109">In 2004 the Government proposed greater relief on debts owed by countries to international institutions. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) began on 1 January 2005, under which we committed to pay our share, 10 per cent., of qualifying countries&#039; debt service payments to the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank and the African Development Fund (AfDF). We expect to spend about $46 million (&#163;25 million) on qualifying countries this financial year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_110">In June 2005, the G8 Finance Ministers endorsed a proposal to cancel all the remaining debts of HIPCs to the IMF, IDA and the AfDF. When agreed by the international community, the deal will be worth about $55 billion (&#163;30 billion) in debt stock cancellations for the current 38 HIPCs. Donors will provide about $49 billion of this over the next 40 years to IDA and AfDF to compensate for foregone reflows. The cost of debt relief at the IMF ($6.1 billion) will be financed from internal resources, although the donors have committed to provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF&#039;s ability to assist poor countries is not diminished. Annual resources for poverty reduction freed up by the proposal will be around $1 billion in 2007, rising to around $1.7 billion in 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_111">The precise costs to the UK of the G8 proposal are yet to finalised, but are likely to be about $6 billion (&#163;3.3 billion) over the whole 40-year period of implementation. The G8&#039;s proposal, when agreed, will supersede the MDRI for HIPCs, although the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the MDRI to qualifying non-HIPC countries. Assistance under the MDRI is likely to be worth $184 million (&#163;100 million) over the period to 2015 for currently qualifying countries, and up to $463 million (&#163;256 million) if all potentially eligible countries qualify.

 DFID relies on the joint united programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for official figures on children affected by HIV. UNAIDS has the global mandate for collating and publishing official statistics on global and sub-Saharan African AIDS epidemics.

 Sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, are some of the most cost-effective and beneficial health service interventions available. However, the unmet need for condoms, and other methods of family planning, is very high. The United Nations population fund (UNFPA) estimates that global condom needs for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is around &#163;9 billion annually. Every year there are 340 million new cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Most occur in young people. Many go untreated.

<a name="stpa_134">DFID is working to change this situation. We work with governments and others to help poor countries develop and implement their own national strategies to overturn the HIV epidemic and to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights. As for so many other aspects of basic health, improving sexual and reproductive health depends on well functioning health systems and improving the access of people to supplies such as condoms. We believe that effective HIV prevention programmes include providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services including condoms. We also believe that it is important to make special efforts to ensure that those who are most vulnerable have access to these services. This includes sex workers.

<a name="stpa_135">DFID provides significant support for reproductive health commodities including condoms, through its country programmes and assistance to multilateral organisations such as the UNFPA. The UNFPA estimates that some one billion condoms supplied by donors were used in developing countries in 2001. Nearly half of these were provided by the UK. For the past 10 years, DFID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million condoms annually. We are currently looking at a sustainable long-term response to reproductive health commodity shortages with other donors, in order to provide a more predictable basis for the funding and availability of these essential supplies.

We are also helping to remove financial, social and geographical barriers to the poorer populations, accessing information, health services and commodities; we also advocate against stigma and discrimination related to HIV.

 DFID recognises the important role that parliaments in developing countries can play in the scrutiny of the management of public resources, including aid agreements entered into by the respective governments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_144">However, DFID has not provided support specifically for parliamentary scrutiny of the terms and conditions of aid agreements but we are currently working with many African countries to support and strengthen parliamentary oversight bodies, e.g. Public Accounts Committees and Supreme Audit Institutions such as National Audit Offices. These are the key links in the formal system of financial accountability in most countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_145">This support includes assistance in Malawi for strengthening the institution of parliament to have powers over state spending, the budget and taxation. In Zambia, a new multi-donor public financial management reform programme, to which DFID is contributing, includes a component to enhance a parliamentary oversight of public resource management. In Uganda, together with other donors, DFID has supported the Office for Parliamentary Development, which has helped to strengthen the parliament, including by the provision of training for parliamentarians.

<a name="stpa_146">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the World Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process.

stronger involvement of parliamentarians in the PRS process. DFID is providing support for parliamentary engagement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent monitoring group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.
</p>

<a name="stpa_148">At board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new World Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes board minutes public. The World Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_149">The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has held workshops in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda to raise awareness among parliamentarians.

<a name="stpa_151">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank.

<p><a name="st_154"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In December 2004 the UK agreed a new poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) arrangement with Uganda which provides a grant of up to &#163;145 million over three years to support the implementation of the Uganda Government&#039;s poverty eradication action plan (PEAP). We indicated at that time that &#163;40 million would be set aside as PRBS in the financial year 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">The arrangement links budget support to reforms detailed in the PEAP. It includes criteria on Uganda&#039;s political transition to multiparty politics, which will help maintain the stability required to make progress in reducing poverty, alongside criteria relating to macro-economic and sector policies and management. All the indicators are drawn from the PEAP and are designed to ensure our support is transparent and predictable. When our last release of budget support fell due in March 2005 we were concerned by several aspects of the political transition, including that insufficient progress had been made towards establishing a fair basis for a multi-party system. We, therefore, decided to withhold &#163;5 million out of the total of &#163;40 million for the financial year.

 The conflict in northern Uganda severely disrupts normal economic activity and for the moment constrains economic recovery. Over 90 per cent. of the population in the districts that are most affected are currently displaced and dependent upon humanitarian relief. We are providing substantial humanitarian support in response to this need. In 2004&#150;05 we provided over &#163;11 million of emergency assistance which was channelled mainly through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Red Cross. In 2005&#150;06 a further &#163;3 million for emergency assistance has already been committed and more is planned. The UK and other donors are discussing with the Government what assistance will be required to support economic recovery in the north once the security situation has sufficiently improved.

 In recent years, we have provided resources for UNICEF&#039;s humanitarian programmes in northern Uganda, which includes support for emergency education provision and vocational training.

This has allowed MITIE to offer a pay increase to their staff from &#163;5.20 to &#163;6.00 per hour funded through internal efficiency savings. The company has made it clear that where posts are lost as part of the efficiency savings, individuals will be offered transfer to other MITIE sites wherever possible.

Neither are available statistics about visitors analysed in the same way or over the same time periods for the various separate components. Separately identifiable cash expenditure across both Houses of Parliament for the Financial Year 2004&#150;05 amounted to just over &#163;502,000, of which approximately 56 per cent. was spent on electronic document publication and associated services and 21 per cent. on staff.

 Cross London Rail Links Ltd. (CLRLL), the company set up to develop and promote the Crossrail project, did consider a Crossrail station at Woolwich during the development of the project, but, based on the then current estimates of cost, passenger numbers and benefits, they concluded that it could not be justified. Powers to construct such a station are therefore not being sought in the Bill introduced into Parliament on 22 February 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_159">However, CLRLL are, at the request of the London Borough of Greenwich and other stakeholders, currently undertaking a more detailed study of the costs and benefits of a station at Woolwich, which will be published in due course. This study will assess the case for the station against the Government&#039;s integrated transport criteria for new rail schemes and will include a cost benefit analysis.

<p>
<a name="51010w24.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_160">No estimate has been made of the potential cost of constructing a station at Woolwich once Crossrail is operational. However, this would entail closure of the route from Custom House to Abbey Wood for many months, and therefore the cost would be greater than for construction before operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w24.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_161">CLRLL consulted widely including two twelve-week rounds of public consultation on the project. During both rounds, public information centres were held at Woolwich and Abbey Wood, to provide information and seek residents&#039; views. These were supported by mail drops to those potentially affected, newsletters, a dedicated website and a 24-hour telephone, helpline.

Due to the relatively low number of accidents that occur on motorways it is anticipated that three years of &#039;accident data&#039; will be needed before overall conclusions can be reached on the impact of hard shoulder running on safety. Initial conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the various measures implemented on the M42 are therefore expected in 2008.

 Following the reforms set out in the &#039;Future of Rail&#039; white paper, the previous responsibilities of the Strategic Rail Authority for medium scale rail investment schemes have generally been transferred to Network Rail. The Department for Transport retains a role for some schemes where it has a significant interest, for example where it provides funding for the scheme or if there are major impacts on franchised rail services.

Note:<br>

In reading the data supplied in the table, the following factors should be considered:<br>

(i) The data supplied shows the number of recorded offences and prosecutions for trespass and criminal damage. The category criminal damage includes offences of criminal damage (including racially aggravated), arson, graffiti and vandalism rolling stock offences.<br>

(ii) The rise in railway trespass offences is due to an improved internal audit process which has led to a steady improvement in the recording practice of these types of offences.<br>

 The Department does not routinely prosecute companies which are late in making end of period adjustment returns.

 We will introduce regulations under the Traffic Management Act 2004 intended to reduce the impact of street works on congestion. The measures will not prevent investment or renewal by utility companies but aim to ensure that work is carried out in a way that minimises the impact on road users. Where street authorities operate permit schemes fees will be payable by utilities for permits. These will be payable to Street Authorities to reflect the resource required for them to consider works by utility companies under the more proactive permit arrangements which are intended to improve control and co-ordination of street works by authorities.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_128">2. While these figures represent gross payments actually made to the barristers during the year, some of those monies have been (or may in the future be) repaid to the Community Legal Service Fund by other parties. This will happen in cases where the legally aided party wins the case and recovers costs from the opponent. Once those costs are recovered the legally aided party&#039;s solicitor refunds some or all of the money to the CLS Fund. As a consequence the figures may not reflect the actual cost of the barristers&#039; fees to the Fund. In some cases where costs are recovered from the losing party the actual cost to the CLS Fund may be very little or even nothing.</p>

Therefore, it is possible that the list could change in future following the inclusion of such payments in light of further information and subsequent verification.</p>

<a name="stpa_218">On 29 August, the executive director of the UNODC Costa announced provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&#150;05 from their annual poppy survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes (mt), a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004. Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for a significant increase in yield since last year. UNODC will publish their final report in October, but these figures are unlikely to change. The yield figures are disappointing, but the cultivation figures give a better picture of farmers&#039; intentions (a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05).

<p><a name="st_261"><a name="51010w33.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 In July 2000, the Taliban imposed a ban on opium poppy cultivation. By July 2001, the tactics they employed had led to a 91 per cent. reduction. This ban was enforced with a combination of fear and bribery, and led to a rise in the price of opium so that those with opium stockpiles profited, many of whom colluded with the Taliban Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w33.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_219">The lack of a viable central state and war-damaged infrastructure in Afghanistan created conditions in which opium cultivation could thrive once again. Opium is highly profitable for those controlling land, and for the warlords and Governors controlling peripheral parts of this mountainous country. There has been little incentive for them to engage with the embryonic central state and, until recently, government institutions have been unable to impact on the trade. President Karzai, with support from the international community, is working hard to change this and is increasing central government presence in the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 117W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provinces. The President has made clear that eliminating opium is vital for Afghanistan&#039;s future and is key to stability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w33.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_220">Progress has been made. The provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&#150;05 announced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in August show an estimated 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation over the previous year. Production and yield, however, are expected to be down since last year by only 2.4 per cent. as good weather and an absence of crop disease brought about a significant increase in yield. It is going to take a long time to uproot something so deeply entrenched in Afghanistan&#039;s culture and economy. But like the Afghans, the UK has always maintained that we are in this for the long term.

We are working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and other international partners, including the US, who have significant resources to bring to this issue and are very engaged. However, to date, levels of international assistance to the Afghanistan CN effort have struggled to match the scale of the problem. The UK Government are using their G8 lead nation status for Afghanistan CN to press for increased commitments, particularly in G8 and EU fora. We welcome in this respect the G8 Foreign and Home Ministers&#039; recognition of the need for increased finance and capacity-building for CN, when they met in June this year. We are engaged bilaterally with a range of countries who have expressed an interest in providing specific support.

This and the ongoing violence in Eastern Sri Lanka have put the Ceasefire Agreement in Sri Lanka under increasing strain and the peace process is facing its most serious challenge since the Ceasefire Agreement came into force in 2002.

An immediate end to political assassinations and the recruitment of child soldiers would be two such steps. It is essential that the LTTE responds.

The EU is also actively considering the listing of the LTTE as an organisation engaged in terrorism (the UK has proscribed the LTTE since 2001).

<a name="stpa_294">It is normal practice for the Environment Agency to issue guidance on the operational aspects of relevant regulations, and they have issued a comprehensive raft of guidance relating to the Hazardous Waste Regulations covering the definition of hazardous waste, mixing hazardous waste, the process of premises notification, and the completion of consignment notes and formulation of consignment codes. The agency has also published frequently asked questions (FAQs) on hazardous waste issues and guidance on the management of specific waste streams including fluorescent tubes and cathode ray tubes. All of this is available on the agency&#039;s website at: www.environment-agency.gov.uk and the FAQs are also available on the Defra website listed above.

Since the first survey in 2001&#150;02 the proportion of unsatisfactory sites for litter and detritus has fallen from 28 per cent. to 22 per cent. Local authorities are also now required to provide information on litter levels through the introduction of the street cleansing best value performance indicator, BV199, which is based on the LEQSE methodology.

As a result of this survey and an earlier one carried out by the college, waste was removed from the site and decontamination carried out. The site was then delicensed by HSE. In doing so, HSE were required, under the terms of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, to be satisfied that there was no longer any residual danger from ionising radiation at the site.

<p><a name="st_327"><a name="51010w41.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There are two types of petrol vapour recovery systems which can be fitted at petrol stations. Petrol Vapour Recovery stage I controls (PVR I) reduce emissions of petrol vapour during the delivery of petrol from road tankers to petrol stations; and stage II controls (PVR II) which reduce emissions of petrol vapour during the refuelling of vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w41.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_299">PVR I is required at all UK petrol stations with sales above 500 cubic metres of petrol a year. The PVR I controls should prevent all petrol vapour from this source escaping to the atmosphere. Statutory guidance reflects the mandatory requirements relating to the technical standards systems must meet when installed. The guidance also specifies the maintenance regime which must be carried out to ensure PVR I systems continue to operate effectively. Local authorities carry out periodic inspections of petrol stations to ensure compliance with the requirements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w41.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_300">Research has shown that PVR II systems under laboratory conditions can reduce emissions of petrol vapour to air by around 85 per cent. We are considering whether to require some petrol stations to install PVR II equipment.

 The Department&#039;s current estimate for the number of plastic bags given away in England between these dates is 66.8 billion bags.

This figure was cited by in the Scottish Executive&#039;s Extended Impact Assessment for the plastic bag levy bill. The figure for England per annum is generated by calculating the proportion of the UK population that live in England (currently 83.5 per cent.) and adjusting the UK figure accordingly. In calculating this figure over several years it has to be assumed that the figures have been constant since 1997 as we do not hold any data relating to the fluctuations in usage over this period.

 The Government believes that the current licensing regime exacerbates crime and disorder by encouraging people to drink as much as possible before last orders and forcing large numbers of people on to the streets at exactly the same time. Licensing reforms will put an end to this practice and give licensing authorities the power to impose flexible licensing sanctions to address specific problems as well as additional powers for the police.

<p><a name="st_441"><a name="51010w52.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 To enable women to build up their own entitlement to a pension, we have introduced state second pension which means that women are now just as likely as men to be accruing second-tier state pension rights. The national minimum wage has boosted the earnings of female low earners, enabling more women to start building up state pensions. Separating the primary threshold level from the lower earnings limit means that many low earners are now building up basic and state second pension rights without having to pay contributions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w52.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_424">To encourage the provision of private and occupational pensions that work for women, we introduced part-time workers regulations which ensure that terms and conditions of employment, including those related to access to occupational pension schemes, do not discriminate against part-time workers. We have also introduced stakeholder pensions to offer a low-cost, portable and flexible pension option which can be particularly suitable for women taking career breaks. Measures in the Pensions Act 2004, such as new rules to increase the pension rights of early leavers, are also beneficial to women.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_261">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning what assessment has been made of the impact of the introduction of the SMS2 IT system on staff and customers. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_262">May I assume that when referring to SMS2 that you are referring to the Customer Management System (CMS). CMS2 is the IT system that has been implemented to support a number of changes in the way that our customers claim benefits through Jobcentre Plus. These changes are part of a wider programme of service delivery modernisation in Jobcentre Plus that also include, for example, greater use of telephone based contact with our customers and the adoption of standard operating processes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_263">The impact of CMS is part of a wider assessment of Jobcentre Plus modernisation activity and investment. This will be taken forward as part of the annual review of the Jobcentre Plus Integrated Business Case. This review takes place during Spring 2006 and reports formally to Ministers and the Treasury. We are currently working towards a first assessment of CMS to inform the 2006 review of the Jobcentre Plus Integrated Business Case, and this assessment will include a staff survey, currently scheduled for early 2006.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_264">Customer feedback on our services is gained through the Jobcentre Plus National Customer Satisfaction Surveys, and the results of the 2004 survey were published on 30th September 2004. The 2005 survey commenced in September. The surveys give us a clear picture about how our services are perceived by customers, including how well delivered they are, and how easy or difficult they are to access. However, as these surveys are based on a national sample, of 3000 or so customers, and CMS is still in the process of being deployed on a roll out basis across Jobcentre Plus, the 2005 survey may be too soon to fully capture the impact on customers.</p>

 Registration data have been placed in the Library. Data for 2003 and 2004 include personal dental service counts of patients seen in the past 15 months as a proxy for registrations for some schemes. This is to give greater consistency with registrations data for the general dental service, which has a 15 month re-registration period. Many personal dental service schemes use longer periods and some, such as dental access centres, do not require patients to register.

 The national health service exists primarily for the benefit of people who live here lawfully. Arrangements have been in place since 1982 to charge anyone who is not ordinarily resident here for any NHS hospital treatment received. The current rules are set out in the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. The Department conducted a wide-ranging review of the operation of the hospital charging regime during 2002&#150;03. This identified loopholes and implementation difficulties arising from changes in travel and migration patterns since the 1989 regulations were first introduced. Amendment regulations, to close the loopholes and make the regulations easier to operate, came into force in April 2004. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the hospital charging regime is being operated more effectively since that time. No further changes are currently planned.

Notes:<br>

1.A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

3.Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4.Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data is ungrossed).<br>

 This is a matter for local decision making which should take full account of local circumstances. I have been informed that the South West London Strategic Health Authority (SHA) is actively working to develop and improve maternity services in its area. In August 2004, the SHA commissioned a two-year modernisation of maternity services project and has recently been successful in securing departmental funding of &#163;250,000 to develop a South West London maternity collaborative to build on the work undertaken by this project.

 Mifepristone (Mifegyne) is an antiprogestogenic steroid that is licensed for the medical termination of intra-uterine pregnancy of up to nine weeks, for softening and dilating the cervix prior to mechanical termination of pregnancy and, in combination with gemeprost, for terminating pregnancies of 13&#150;20 weeks gestation.

<a name="stpa_502">The United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) receive reports of suspected adverse drug reactions to medicinal products via the yellow card scheme. Since marketing authorisation for mifepristone was first granted in 1991, the MHRA and CSM have received 47 reports of 79 suspected adverse drug reactions in association with its use. The reporting of a suspected adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug was responsible for that event. Many factors, such as the medical condition that is being treated, other pre-existing illnesses or other medications may play a contributing role.

1.Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March 2005.<br>

2.Three month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (full-time equivalents).<br>

3.Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<br>

4.Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the non-medical workforce census September 2004.<br>

5.Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<br>

Staff in post:<br>

6.Staff in post data is from the non-medical workforce census September 2004.<br>

General:<br>

7.Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

8.Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<br>

9.Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts.<br>

10.Strategic health authority figures are based on trusts, and do not necessarily reflect the geographical provision of healthcare.<br>

 The Government&#039;s target is that by the end of 2008 no patient will have to wait more than 18 weeks from general practitioner referral to start of hospital treatment. We do not currently collect information on the length of time from GP referral to start of treatment, so it is not yet possible to report on individual organisations&#039; progress towards the target. We will be working with the national health service to introduce new data reporting systems to support delivery of the target.

Notes:<br>

1.Where &#163;1 nominal is quoted, the circumstances are typically that the ongoing management costs of or obligation of ownership extinguish any value.<br>

2.Some properties have yet to be valued and the entries for these are marked as n/k (not known).<br>

3.Estimates of value are necessarily provisional in nature. They will be subject to ongoing review so that any changes in circumstances, for instance to planning approvals, can be taken into account prior to disposal.<br>

4.Departments are obliged to keep their property holdings under continual review. Therefore, although the list of properties for disposal is accurate as regards current plans, it may be subject to future amendment.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.The information is based on Funding Authorities published Outturn Statements and comprises funding directly allocated to schools through formula funding arrangements and funding directly attributable to schools (e.g. funding spent on rates; teaching and non-teaching redundancies, etc). It does not include expenditure on central services provided by the Education and Library Boards on such areas as home to school transport, school 



meals and, curriculum advisory support services. Expenditure on those areas cannot be readily apportioned between the primary and post-primary Sectors.<br>

2.The figures for the primary sector include both the pupils numbers and costs of pupils in nursery classes as expenditure for these pupils cannot be separately identified.<br>

3.The figures for the post primary sector include both the pupils numbers and costs of pupils in preparatory departments as expenditure for these pupils cannot be separately identified.<br>

<sup>(76)</sup>The figures in column 2 were supplied by DARD and relate to the number of farm businesses in operation in Northern Ireland each year. The figure for 2005 is not yet available. The statistical definition of an operational farm used for this answer is as follows. All active farm businesses having one hectare or more of farmed land, whether owned, leased or taken in conacre, and those with under one hectare having any cattle, sheep or pigs or with significant poultry or horticultural activity. Landowners who lease out or rent out in conacre all of their land are not included.&quot;<br>





<sup>(77)</sup>These figures are based on the Standard Industrial Classification of agriculture e.g. arable and livestock farming, horticulture and all related services&quot;, and by definition therefore not all the people declared bankrupt under this classification could be regarded as farmers.<br>

The response sets out Government policy on the matter in more detail. Like the Treasury Committee, we see charging cash machines as being a legitimate business model. The majority have been introduced recently in locations where previously there was no cash machine and where there would not be a sufficiently high number of transactions to support a free ATM. The Government does not believe there is evidence to suggest that free ATMs are under threat from charging machines as the number of free ATMs in the UK is still increasing. However, if evidence were found of a significant reduction in the number of free ATMs, then the Government would be concerned.

 As the Prime Minister pointed out in his statement to the House on 20 June 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 523&#150;25, the Luxembourg Presidency proposal would have cost the UK &#8364;25 billion over the period of the next Financial Perspective. This estimate was calculated on the basis of European Commission figures. The Government&#039;s most recent forecast of the UK abatement and net contributions to the EC Budget, covering the period to 2007&#150;08, is given in Table 3.2 (page 15) of the annual European Community Finances&quot; White Paper (Cm 6580) published on 23 June 2005. These forecasts are based on the current Financial Perspective, which runs to December 2006. For the period from January 2007, we simply up-rate the present arrangements to allow for inflation for public expenditure planning purposes. This in no way implies any assumption by the Government as to what the outcome of the ongoing Financial Perspective negotiations might be.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_304">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what assessment has been made of the statistical robustness of the methods used by Eurostat to estimate and allocate extra-regio shares of off-shore GDP. (15739)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_305">In 2001, the Office for National Statistics, along with 5 other EU Member States, participated in a Task Force set up by Eurostat to review a number of quality issues concerning Regional Accounts. The Task Force recommended that extra-regio GDP should be shown as a distinct item in the accounts and that regional GDP per head figures should therefore exclude that part of GDP attributed to extra-regio. The ONS considers that the Task Force recommendation is easy to implement and makes statistical sense. Apart from the assessment of the Task Force, I am unaware of any other assessment specifically made of Eurostat&#039;s treatment of extra-regio shares of GDP.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_306">Eurostat&#039;s current treatment of extra-regio GDP, however, does not comply with the Task Force&#039;s recommendation; they allocate estimates of extra-regio GDP to regions pro rata to their share of national GDP. The Office for National Statistics regards this treatment as inconsistent with the European System of Accounts (ESA) regulation of 1995 and the European Commission&#039;s NUTS regulation (2003). The latter regulation specifically identifies extra-regio as a separate statistical entity and therefore any relevant statistics should be shown separately.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_307">I should say, to avoid any doubt, that there is no difference between the ONS and Eurostat regarding the method used to estimate extra-regio shares of GDP; the ONS in fact supplies Eurostat with extra-regio estimations based on the 1995 ESA regulation.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_308">My predecessor wrote to the Director General of Eurostat earlier in the year to argue that the extra-regio component of GDP should not be allocated to the regions of the Member State, in keeping with the Task Force recommendation and the intention and spirit of the NUTS regulation.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_309">Eurostat have agreed that our concerns are well-founded and demand further examination.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_310">They consider the most appropriate action is to review the issue in the longer term as part of a wide-ranging review of Regional Accounts. They have identified late 2006/early 2007 as the best opportunity to commence such work.</p>

<p><a name="st_646"><a name="51010w76.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 It is not possible to quantify the impact of the inclusion of offshore extra regio GVA on the UK net contribution and the UK abatement because Eurostat does not publish the data required for such a calculation.

There have been delays in answering calls but they are currently answering calls within five minutes. Each call lasts on average between three and four minutes. Staffing levels have varied and figures are not available for the period requested. There are currently approximately 25 to 30 staff on the Helpline each day. Since 1 December 2003 HMRC have constantly monitored the Helpline and made various improvements. In June 2005 a new interactive voice response (IVR) options system was introduced to route calls to the operator most able to assist.

<p><a name="st_717"><a name="51010w83.html_spnew8"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The procurement policy of HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Custom&#039;s, covers timber used on and in the construction of departmental building projects. HMRC and HMT&#039;s procurement policy pays proper regard to environmental issues while still securing best value for money. Assessments of environmental impact and against sustainable development criteria are made by the Departments&#039; procurement staff, who consider environmental issues at the start of a procurement. Details of any environmental requirements that suppliers need to be aware of will always be included in our invitation to tender documents. To support the general greening Government policy, we would expect a potential supplier to have environmental management systems in place on the lines of ISO 14001, which is increasingly being adopted by the more responsible sections of industry.

Unfortunately, since parents and schools contact the Department on an ad hoc basis we are unable to provide more specific data. Those wanting assistance and guidance are also able to make contact electronically, using the Department&#039;s dedicated anti-bullying mailbox. Since March 2005, the mailbox has received 13 requests for support directly from schools.

<p>
<a name="51010w85.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_665">The Department is also involved in funding several prominent organisations, who are actively involved in providing support for schools, parents, children and young people and promoting anti-bullying good practice. The Department therefore often recommends that inquiries are directed to these organisations themselves for a response. According to recent figures, the ChildLine partnership in schools (part-funded by the Department) was contacted by 425 primary schools, 482 secondary schools and 63 other education settings all requesting support with anti-bullying practice over the period. Furthermore, the Anti-Bullying Alliance (an independent umbrella organisation part-funded by the department) reports that 3,505 schools attended ABA training courses and conferences on anti-bullying, or requested an information pack between September 2004 and April 2005, whilst the ABA also gave direct support to 223 local authorities.

 As data on bullying are not collected centrally we do not have statistics relating to the number of cases of bullying in each London borough. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise.

<a name="stpa_667">We have raised awareness of the importance of children who are being bullied telling an adult about what is happening, through our public information film &#039;Tell Someone&#039; and our leaflets and postcards for children and their parents. Our recent &#039;Beat Bullying&#039; blue wristband campaign was launched in partnership with Radio 1, during the first national anti-bullying week in November 2004. By the end of December, one million children and young people had answered our call to &#039;Make a Stand, Wear a Band&#039; and make a visible commitment that they are not prepared to tolerate bullying and will stand by their friends.

 At 31 March 2004, there were an estimated 41,600 children in foster placements in England, representing 68 per cent. of all looked-after children. The Department itself does not currently hold information centrally about the number of foster carers. However, assisting local authorities to recruit and retain foster carers is a key priority for my Department, to ensure that placements which meet the needs of children and young people can be found without delay. A number of national initiatives are already in place or planned to encourage greater numbers of people to become and remain foster carers, including a Fostering Publicity Pack designed to help local authorities to run targeted local campaigns to recruit new foster carers for looked-after children.

 We have no plans to standardise the payment of fees to foster carers.

Research indicates that payment rates&#151;including the payment of fees while placements are empty&#151;are but one of a number of issues of concern to foster carers.

 The Government&#039;s Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on the 22 March, sets clear priorities for public funding to support the drive to ensure that employers have the skills they need to be successful, and individuals have the skills they need to be employable and personally fulfilled. Finding a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners is crucial. My Department&#039;s policy is that employers should pay a contribution towards the tuition fee costs for all employees undertaking publicly supported training unless those learners are eligible for free provision eg if the learners are studying for a first full level 2 qualification or undertaking a literacy, numeracy or English language course.

Parents are encouraged to check their children and other family members for head lice as need arises, and to arrange treatment with such additional advice and support from the local health care team&#151;a school nurse, general practitioner, health visitor or local pharmacist&#151;as is required. If this exercise is undertaken at the same time by all parents of children attending the school, then the spread of head lice can be controlled. Schools are resourced to maintain relations and facilitate discussion with families over a range of issues which, from time to time, impact upon school activities. These discussions may include, in consort with the school health service, the best approach to tackling head louse infestation.

 All schools in England are under a statutory obligation to complete a review of their staffing structure by 31 December 2005. The time needed by head teachers will vary from school to school, depending on how far they have already progressed with implementing the remodelling agenda and the extent to which they wish to propose changes to their structures.

Also included is the funding delegated to primary and secondary schools identified as notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget for special schools. The figures recorded against notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might by spent by schools on SEN and, from 2004&#150;05 onwards, notional SEN&quot; delegated to nursery schools was reported on section 52 for the first time and this accounts for &#163;10,975 and &#163;16,944 of the 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 totals respectively. In 2005&#150;06 Milton Keynes LEA also budgeted &#163;1,662,081 for the transport of pupils with SEN but this is not included in the above totals as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>

2.The figures reported are the amount allocated for SEN by Milton Keynes, as recorded on their section 52 budget statement, and are shown in cash terms and rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.<br>

 Teaching involves a variety of skills and trainee teachers learn how to create lessons where pupils want to learn and where teachers do not need to shout. To meet the rigorous standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), trainee teachers need to demonstrate that they can create such learning environments. Nonetheless, voice care is important for teachers at every stage of their careers. The training leading up to QTS is the very beginning of a teacher&#039;s learning about how to teach. Once a teacher has gained QTS they will pursue continuing professional development opportunities throughout their careers including, if their school agrees it is needed, voice care training.

In the period 31 March 2000 to 31 March 2004, the number of women employed by Fire and Rescue Services in England increased by 1,338. In the same period, the number of personnel who classified themselves as belonging to one of the minority ethnic groups increased by 468.

 Over a 15 year period (2004&#150;05 to 2018&#150;19) running the control service and implementing the FiReControl project is expected to cost &#163;988 million. Over the first six years, the Government will spend an additional &#163;74 million over and above Fire and Rescue Authority&#039;s forecasts for replacing existing controls, as part of its substantial investment in the modernisation of the fire and rescue service. After all nine controls are operating it is expected that there will be annual savings of over &#163;20 million (30 per cent. reduction in annual running costs), recouping the initial investment and freeing up additional resources, which will be available for spending on other local initiatives such as community fire safety. Over the same 15 year period, leaving the control service in the existing 46 controls would cost &#163;1,090 million and would not provide a fully resilient service.

 Fire and rescue authorities are required by the fire and rescue service national framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (ERMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities.

 Green belt is a planning designation and the planning system does not control the sale of land. Planning applications would still need to be submitted for the development of green belt land. Such applications would need to be considered in light of the development plan for the area concerned and other material considerations, including national policy on green belts as set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note2 (PPG2). There are no plans to prevent sales of green belt land.

 The Local Government Pension Scheme in England is administered by 81 separate pension fund authorities. The Suffolk County Council Pension Fund is the responsibility of the county council; district councils are employer-members. Actuarial valuations of the pension fund take place every three years, as required by the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997. Contribution rates for each employer are set having regard to the employers&#039; liabilities and the investment programme of the fund. The rates are designed to ensure that Scheme pension funds remain solvent and meet their statutory pension payment responsibilities. Individual local authorities in Suffolk, other than the county council, do not have separate pension funds. The assets and liabilities for the Suffolk county council pension fund for the last three actuarial valuation exercises are as follows:
