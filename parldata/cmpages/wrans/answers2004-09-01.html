 Responsibility for advice on the purchase of UK military equipment UK Diplomatic Missions overseas normally rests with Defence Attaches or staff from the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO). In the case of Saudi Arabia, there is a dedicated First Secretary (Defence Supply) based in Riyadh. A number of other British Missions overseas also have both military and civilian staff who are dedicated to Defence sales. The duties of staff employed in Trade and Investment work in Embassy commercial sections world wide do not usually include defence sales, except in the few cases where neither DESO nor Defence Attache staff are represented at the Mission. To provide a more detailed breakdown would incur disproportionate costs. I refer my hon. Friend to the reply I gave to the hon.

<p><a name="40901w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Significant progress has been made putting measures in place to tackle congestion. 100 road schemes have been completed since 2000, 22 of these delivered since June 2002. This includes the M6 Toll, which opened in December 2003. A further 12 strategic road schemes are currently under construction, including widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15 around Heathrow. The London congestion charge has delivered significant benefits. Traffic Officers are already being deployed on the motorway network starting in the West Midlands, to improve the clearing of incidents, and new technologies are being introduced to help improve traffic flow. The Traffic Management Act gives new powers to the Traffic Officers, and to local authorities to improve the management of local roads.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w05.html_para2">
At the current exchange rate this means that the UK has been awarded &#8364;30.618 million (equivalent to &#163;20.413 million at present exchange rates). This is subject to confirmation from the Commission for two 2004 awards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w05.html_para3">
While TENs projects are awarded funding there can be a number of reasons as to why the payment could be less than the original award, including exchange rate fluctuations, changes in the scope of a project, or the Commission deciding that some costs are ineligible. It is therefore not possible to translate the awards into annual financial support.

On local roads there have been no starts on major schemes in the Thames Valley or Oxfordshire since 1998.

<p><a name="40901w05.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Department sets the Highways Agency an indicator to measure its performance in maintaining the network in a safe and serviceable condition. A new way of measuring the performance was introduced in the 2004&#150;05 Highways Agency Business Plan, with a target to &quot;achieve a road surface condition index score of 100l&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w05.html_para6">
In consultation with the Department the Agency has developed an index that measures road surface condition. This is a major improvement on the previous indicator that was based on the percentage of the network that required investigation. The measure of road surface condition is based on a wider range of surveys covering rutting, unevenness, cracking and skid resistance. The target takes account of the fact that it is not practical or sustainable to maintain the whole road network in an as-new condition. The condition of the network is established, using the principles of minimising whole life costs taking into account disruption to road users. The condition at which the road network is to be maintained has been equated to a road surface condition index score of 100 and is the target level at which the road network will be 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 697W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

We estimate that the level at 1 April was within the parameters set out i.e. an index of 1001. The actual figure will be calculated and the result audited during 2004&#150;05.

The training capacity detailed for ATR(P), ATR(L) and ATR(W) is limited by the number of training teams that are available at any one time. For example, ATR(W) has an establishment of 15 training teams with a maximum capacity of 40 trainees per training team. However, due to leave and instructor training, the number of training teams that are available for training purposes at any one time is 13. This figure, multiplied by 40, provides the training capacity of 520 for ATR(W).

<a name="40901w07.html_para5">
ITC Catterick combines both Phase 1 (initial) and Phase 2 (trade) training for the Infantry. Since the establishment of the Combined Infantry Training course at ITC Catterick in 2002, infantry training at Catterick cannot be divided into defined stages, as the course is essentially one seamless progression from Phase 1 to Phase 2.

Recruitment is buoyant and the Army Training and Recruiting Agency has outperformed against mandated targets over the last two years. Although some battalions are understrength, the general situation across the infantry remains healthy. It is difficult to attain an even manning balance across all regiments. Some regiments benefit from excellent recruitment inflow and a balance has to be made. Where there are shortages elsewhere every effort is made to alleviate the situation.

 The Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme is not a privatisation of IT infrastructure.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w08.html_para0">
A significant proportion of the Department&#039;s IT provision has been outsourced in recent years as part of wider initiatives to make greater use of the private sector in the provision of public services. The Department&#039;s policy is that when services already delivered under outsourcing arrangements are re-competed or rationalised, in-house bids should not normally be invited because the associated requirement for substantial reinvestment in management, training and support systems makes it unlikely that an in-house option would represent value for money. Where no in-house bid is invited, an estimate of the costs of a public sector option would normally be made, in order to provide a value for money benchmark.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w08.html_para1">
In the case of the DII project, the Public Sector Comparator (PSC) is currently being developed with the Trades Unions and reflects the &quot;fallback&#039; option that the MOD would pursue if the commercial bids for DII failed. The PSC assumes the continuation of the current mix of in-house and commercial arrangements including some internal efficiencies and a capability uplift. It will be used within the DII Future Main Gate Business Case as a Value for Money comparator against which to assess the commercial bids. The Trades Unions have been briefed on the current scope of the first increment of DII Future and the related PSC. They have been given the opportunity to comment on the robustness of the PSC and associated risks by 30 July 2004. They have also been invited to submit alternative proposals in the context of the PSC.

The Department&#039;s Supplier Relations Group has conducted research of bidding consortium members&#039; performance both in Defence and across Government. In addition, the project has taken up references, by telephone and through visits, from existing customers of the key companies in the bidding consortia. Further reference visits will be conducted during the final phase of the procurement, targeting customers in receipt of a similar volume and range of services.

Risk management is a key feature of the business of any IPT and its associated Senior Responsible Owner (SRO).

As part of the concept phase of the Smart Procurement process, the Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC) for the DII programme outlined the headline risks identified at that stage of the programme.

Over the planned three main increments of the DII programme, it is estimated that up to 1,500 civilian staff fall within the full scope of the project, including both staff supporting current systems and those presently within the IPT.

<p><a name="40901w10.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Since November 2000, it has been the Ministry of Defence&#039;s policy, in common with other Government Departments, that all Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts and those Public Private Partnership contracts involving the use of private finance, must contain legally binding conditions whereby any gains from refinancing are shared with the MOD on an equal basis.

stakes to another commercial entity. Such restrictions would constrain the availability of capital for such projects and therefore adversely affect value for money. Exceptions to this can be made during the construction/introduction to service phase when some restrictions may be placed on sales or transfers of equity from shareholders who are also key subcontractors, as these might have an adverse impact on the success of the project. Additionally, provisions are usually included in MOD PFI and PPP contracts which place an obligation on the service provider and its shareholders to obtain the MOD&#039;s consent to any sale or transfer. This is to prevent any transfer that might be prejudicial to the national interest, e.g. for reasons of national security.

 A Royal Navy ship, together with a royal fleet auxiliary support tanker, is allocated to the Atlantic Patrol Task (North) (APT(N)). The APT(N) duty ship provides a tangible presence in the Caribbean area of responsibility including throughout the hurricane season (May to November). For the remainder of the year they remain within 14 days sailing. APT(N) provides security to United Kingdom overseas territories including support to humanitarian operations and disaster relief. APT(N) also makes a major contribution as one element of HMG&#039;s broader counter-drugs activity and promotes UK interests in the region, supporting defence relations and military training assistance and the wider defence diplomacy effort through a series of high-profile port visits.

After six months as APT(N) ship, five of which were within the Caribbean AOR, HMS Monmouth handed over duties to HMS Richmond on 12 July and is currently en route home. During her deployment HMS Monmouth made two successful interdictions of suspected drug smugglers using &quot;go fast&quot; boats.

In August 1998, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced that no proposal for regulation which has an impact on business, charities or the voluntary sector should be considered by Ministers without a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) being carried out. Where EU Directives impose significant costs on business, charities and the voluntary sector, RIAs are carried out to gain collective ministerial agreement for a negotiating line and RIAs accompany the explanatory memorandum produced for parliamentary scrutiny. Departments will then refocus the RIA when determining the options for implementing the directives.

 We attach a high priority to helping schools prevent and combat bullying: it is a serious problem which puts the emotional well-being and

educational achievement of pupils at risk. Our guidance pack &quot;Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter for Action and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.

<a name="40901w23.html_para7">
In November 2003 I launched our anti-bullying Charter for schools, which schools are now signing. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. The Charter was launched at the first of the Make The Difference series of regional conferences. The programme of conferences began in November 2003 and culminated with a final event on 14 June. These conferences, the West Midlands one of which was well attended by Staffordshire head teachers, offered an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue and to learn at first hand about what has worked elsewhere. Details of the conferences can be accessed online at www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying. Our new public information film, &#039;Tell Someone&#039;, also encourages children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied.

Last week, we announced funding of &#163;570,000 for the Anti Bullying Alliance; an umbrella group of over 50 voluntary sector organisations, professional associations and leading local authorities. The Alliance will work to support schools in addressing bullying behaviour and lead on preparations for the first national anti-bullying week in November. Schools in Staffordshire will have access to an anti-bullying coordinator based in the West Midlands region, and working with the National Strategies, who can provide practical help, advice and support in tackling all forms of bullying in schools.

<p><a name="40901w25.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Chris Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what funding has been made available in each year since 1997 and for projected future years for education in schools within the area of the London Borough of Islington; whether these amounts include those sums made directly to headteachers of both primary and secondary schools; and whether it is possible to provide a breakdown of overall funding on a school-by-school basis.

<p><a name="40901w25.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Department does not produce projected figures for future years. The available information about funding in Islington local education authority is contained in the following tables.

Notes:<br>

1. The funding and budget figures quoted are derived from different sources and are not directly comparable.<br>

2. The funding figures in the table are not available by sector as this is not how allocations are made to LEAs.<br>





3. Therefore, these figures are not those sums given directly to headteachers, but the funding allocated to LEAs in terms of Education Formula Spending for pupils fading into age groups 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15.<br>

4. Figures reflect education Standard Spending Assessment/Education Formula Spending settlement (all sub-blocks), plus all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to EFS pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15.<br>

5. Figures exclude Education Maintenance Allowance and grants not allocated at LEA level and the pensions transfer to EFS and Learning and Skills Council for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05.<br>





6. The pupil numbers used are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC 3-year-olds maintained pupils and estimated 3&#150;4 year olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

7. 1997&#150;98 figures for LEAs subject to Local Government Reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

8. 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

9. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;0.1 million.<br>

 Neighbourhood nurseries are intended to provide child care and early education places for children under five in the most disadvantaged areas of the country.

It is for individual providers to establish their own admissions policy and determine how they will deal with oversubscription. However, in doing so they must meet this requirement.

This will apply to new entrants from 2006 and to the future service of existing teachers from 2013. Teachers will, however, still be able to retire at, before or after age 60 as they do now. Where pension benefits are drawn earlier than the normal pension age, they will be reduced to reflect the fact that the benefits will be in payment for longer.

Suggestions for change to the TPS are included on the TeacherNet website www.teachernet.gov.uk/pensions which will form the basis of a consultation planned to take place during the Autumn term 2004.

 Information on the total amount of debt on leaving higher education, including private sector debt, is not collected annually, although we do estimate it in successive student income and expenditure surveys.

The latest 2002/3 Student Income and Expenditure Survey showed that students graduating in 2003 anticipated leaving with an average total debt of &#163;8,666. During the passage of the Higher Education Act through Parliament we estimated that this might rise to an average debt of about &#163;15,000, once students paying variable fees have graduated. The 2004/5 Student Income and Expenditure Survey&#151;which is expected to report in early 2005&#151;will provide an estimate of total debt on leaving HE for those graduating in 2004.

From April 2003, Nursery Education Grant was consolidated within the under-fives sub-block of the Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS)&#151;local authorities&#039; main education budget. It is for individual LAs in consultation with local partners to determine how overall resources should be used.

<p>
<a name="40901w29.html_para6">
All LAs received sufficient funding to enable them to meet their statutory responsibilities to provide free nursery education for three and four-year-olds. The overall EFSS under fives sub-block in 2003&#150;04 was &#163;2.6 billion.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether reported incidence of bovine TB in <i>(a)</i> 2002 and <i>(b)</i> 2003 offer a secure statistical baseline against which differences in incidence in 2004 may be measured.  [184694]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 798W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40901w30.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 TB testing was all but suspended during the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in 2001 and did not fully recover to pre-FMD levels until February 2002. The effect of this suspension of testing on the underlying trends in TB incidence for 2001 and subsequent years is hard to gauge, for the following reasons:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The TB testing effort in 2002 was initially aimed at high-risk herds.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Disease would have had more time to spread in herds where normally it might have been detected more quickly.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Restocking of herds after FMD led to the disease being spread to areas it had not been found for some time.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The level of testing in 2002 and 2003 required to clear the backlog was much higher than normal (the backlog was reduced to pre-FMD level by spring 2003).</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w30.html_para11">
The trends seen in TB herd incidence and number of reactors slaughtered in 2001 and 2002 should, therefore, be treated with caution and are probably not comparable with those of earlier years. TB incidence rates and testing patterns for 2003 and 2004 appear to have settled down enough to make valid comparisons with pre-FMD trends.

<p><a name="40901w30.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra has not carried out an assessment of the cost of complete separation. These will vary significantly from farm to farm. Improving biosecurity provides a range of benefits for many diseases. The measures that are taken should be based on a risk assessment approach and the costs of any specific measure balanced against its likely benefits. Complete separation of wildlife and farmed livestock may not be either practical or cost effective, but farmers should consider what measures they can take to reduce the interaction of wildlife with their animals.

<p><a name="40901w30.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b>

These represent times when the badgers&#039; natural food sources are of very limited availability and when badger mortality may otherwise be higher.

Since 1997 until earlier this year, investigation of the prevalence of TB in wild badgers has been restricted to the Randomised Badger Culling Trial and the Road Traffic Accident survey of badgers found dead in seven counties (Somerset is not one of the counties selected for this survey). The trial will provide some information on badger numbers within the triplet areas, which could be related to cattle herd breakdown rates.

<p><a name="40901w31.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I have been made aware of the recent e-mailed communication by individual members of the Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (CERRIE), although this was not sent directly to the Department. CERRIE held its last formal meeting on 24 June, and its report is currently being finalised by the Committee members, who anticipate that it will be ready for publication in the autumn. It is regrettable that members of the Committee have chosen to pre-empt publication by issuing a statement critical of the report and of other members of the Committee. We will welcome an informed debate on the scientific issues in the CERRIE report, once it is published. In the meantime, I have asked officials to consider with the Committee Chairman whether there are any lessons to be learned from the experiences with the CERRIE Committee that should be taken into account in the future.

<a name="40901w34.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Fly-tipping</h3>





<p><a name="40901w34.html_wqn0"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what volume of waste she estimates was illegally fly-tipped in the most recent year for which figures are available, broken down by <i>(a)</i> the nature of the waste and <i>(b)</i> whether it was fly-tipped in urban or rural areas.  [184855]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 811W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40901w34.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Both the Environment Agency and local authorities have responsibilities for tackling fly-tipping. Prior to the launch of the Flycapture database on 5 April 2004, there was no national system for gathering and reporting data on fly-tipping dealt with by the Environment Agency and local authorities. However, the Agency did have its own incident reporting system that did record summary data on fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the Agency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para0">
The most recent year for which complete data is currently available is 2002. Data for 2003 will be released on the 27 July 2004 with the Agency&#039;s Spotlight report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para1">
During 2002, the Agency dealt with 4,997 fly-tipping incidents. Of these, 1,392 incidents involved Construction, Demolition or Excavation wastes (including asbestos), 891 involved Household waste, 432 involved Tyres and 197 involved Fuels/oils.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para2">
No data are available on the volume of wastes fly-tipped during 2002 and the Agency does not currently collect data on the urban/rural split.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para3">
In future years, the Flycapture database will be able to provide more comprehensive data on the nature and scale of the problem dealt with by both local authorities and the Agency.
</p>






<a name="40901w34.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Foot and Mouth</h3>





<p><a name="40901w34.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what actions on the part of the UK authorities were <i>(a)</i> required and <i>(b)</i> recommended by the European Union with regard to the September 2000 foot and mouth disease outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal; and when these were implemented;  [183401]

</p>



<p>(2) what actions the UK authorities took in regard to the November 2000 foot and mouth disease outbreak in Mpumalanga that were not taken in regard to the September 2000 outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal.  [183403]</p>








<p><a name="40901w34.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. At the time of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, it was not deemed necessary to take safeguard action since the South African authorities had prohibited the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from the area in which the outbreak had occurred. This meant that exports from South Africa could not take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para4">
On 7&#150;8 November 2000 the European Commission informed the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) (now known as the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) of the outcome of an inspection and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary. On 25 November the Commission published legislation prohibiting imports into the Community of fresh meat from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 812W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para5">
On 5 January the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting imports into England and Wales of meat from all of South Africa. Similar action was taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w34.html_para6">
The outbreak in Mpumalanga was confirmed on 30 November. The Commission took action in February 2001 to extend EU restrictions on imports of meat in respect of Mpumalanga. By that time, the UK had already banned imports of meat from the whole country, so no further action was necessary.

<p><a name="40901w34.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Under the Animal Welfare Bill we are considering the possibility of introducing secondary legislation to cover racing greyhounds. A decision on the content of any regulations will be made in light of the outcome of work currently being done within the industry to raise welfare standards.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what Environment Agency <i>(a)</i> procedures and <i>(b)</i> resources will be used to ensure that all hazardous waste producers, including those producing small and sporadic quantities of hazardous waste are (i) made aware of and (ii) comply with the requirement to register as a hazardous waste producer.  [185011]</p>








<p><a name="40901w34.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We expect to go out to consultation on the new hazardous waste regulations, including the proposed requirement for hazardous waste producers to notify their premises to their Environment Agency, later this month.

<p><a name="40901w34.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 It is not proposed that the Hazardous Waste Regulations, to be implemented in 2005, should make it an offence for householders to dispose of such items in the municipal waste stream. Mixed domestic waste containing small amounts of hazardous wastes such as fluorescent tubes and used batteries will continue to be dealt with as non-hazardous municipal waste.

<p><a name="40901w34.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 For a waste to be classified as &quot;hazardous&quot;, it must normally be listed as such in the European Waste Catalogue. Nappies, incontinence pads and cat litter are not listed as hazardous. It is open to Member States to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 818W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
determine that other wastes are hazardous where these display one or more of the hazardous properties specified in the Hazardous Waste Directive at above the thresholds the Directive specifies. Waste such as used disposable nappies and incontinence pads would be considered under property H9 (infectious). However, to be considered hazardous there would need to be a high risk that infectious substances were present in the waste at a concentration above that naturally encountered. Since the source population for household waste is healthy, the risk of infection is very low and nappies and incontinence pads do not therefore meet the criteria necessary for a &quot;hazardous&quot; classification. Where an individual is being treated by a health professional in their own home, it is for the health professional to make a clinical decision on whether or not the nature of the patient&#039;s illness would render the patient&#039;s hygiene waste infectious.

The Government are totally committed to this aim, as well as believing that landfilling waste is a lost opportunity to obtain economic value from discarded materials. While there is no doubt that one consequence of the Landfill Directive is to increase costs, it is true to say that in the past, the cost of landfill has not reflected its adverse environmental impact. In the many meetings with the non-ferrous metal industry, the Government have been encouraging it to reduce as far as possible the waste output from its operations, look at alternative treatments to landfill, see how the industry can still dispose of waste to landfill when there is no alternative disposal option currently available and encourage it to come forward with research proposals to achieve those above aims that may be able to draw on landfill tax funding.

The Government&#039;s intention is that the agency should regulate the requirements of the Landfill Regulations during the period July 2004-July 2005 via the application of site-specific assessments. The agency is actively undertaking this work in order to provide for an appropriate level of environmental protection, conscious of any potential implications for hazardous waste capacity. This includes ensuring consideration of wastes that display hazard category H12 (substances and preparations which release toxic or very toxic gases in contact with water, air or an acid).

<p><a name="40901w35.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The cost of landfill disposal for the non-ferrous metal industry, as for other industries, is likely to rise. This will act as an encouragement to waste producers to examine their processes to see if waste arisings can be reduced and to consider other treatment and disposal options that may be more environmentally and economically sustainable than landfill. Defra and Environment Agency officials have met with representatives of the non-ferrous metal industry on a number of occasions in the past year to help them understand their obligations and to discuss any issues that arise. In addition, the Non-Ferrous Alliance is a member of the Hazardous Waste Forum, a group that consists of waste producers, waste managers, central and local government and regulators and looks at issues surrounding hazardous waste.

This licence may be used by authorised persons only and the landowners&#039; permission must be obtained. This licence is among a number of general licences relating to birds that is currently the subject of a consultation exercise.

<a name="40901w35.html_para7">
The decline in farmland birds has come to prominence during the last 10 years, but long term data on bird numbers indicates that many of these declines began over 25 years ago. The precise reason for the declines in different species varies, but in the majority of cases can be attributed to an intensification of farming practices during recent decades. This is demonstrated by the fact that population declines have been more marked in intensively managed arable farmland habitats compared with other habitats. The population status of songbird and farmland bird species are monitored and Defra is aware of declines in certain species.

<p><a name="40901w37.html_spnew10"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I launched the Code of Practice on How to Prevent the Spread of Ragwort at the Royal Show on 4 July. The code provides comprehensive guidance for all those with land management responsibility, including the Highways Agency and local authorities, on how to develop a strategic approach to ragwort control where there is a risk to animal welfare. It sets out clearly the responsibilities of horse and livestock owners, as well as those of land managers. The code provides advice on how to assess the risk posed by ragwort to horses and other grazing animals, the different control methods available, environmental factors, and health and safety issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w37.html_para5">
A copy of the code has been sent to the Highways Agency and to all local authorities. I have urged all landowners and land managers to work with horse and animal owners to implement the recommendations of the code which have legal underpinning in enforcement proceedings under the Weeds Act 1959. A representative of the Highways Agency was involved last year when I launched an earlier draft of the code at Hickstead as a voluntary code, prior to completion of the legislation and spoke in support of the code.

 A recent report commissioned by Defra on the economic contribution of sea angling estimates a figure of &#163;538 million for England and Wales.

 EU Regulations governing the Common Fisheries Policy require account to be taken of all landings, with certain specified exceptions, for the purposes of quota management: there is no exemption for landings made by recreational fishing vessels. However, within the UK, vessels engaged in recreational fishing are not generally subject to quantitative restrictions on landings: they might be prohibited from making further landings if it became necessary to close a fishery to the commercial inshore fleet, or to the UK fleet as a whole, when the UK&#039;s quota for that fishery had been taken in full.

 For the purposes of this answer, &quot;inappropriate development&quot; is taken to mean development that is causing the unfavourable condition <sup>1</sup>  of a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). To provide this information since 1997 would involve disproportionate cost. Factors adversely affecting sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) are continually updated according to the latest condition assessment completed by English Nature conservation officers. All SSSIs are assessed on a rolling basis at least once every six years. English Nature carried out the first round of condition assessments on the complete SSSI series in England between 1997&#150;2003.

According to the latest condition assessments <sup>2</sup>  for each unit, 1,052 hectares of SSSI land <sup>3</sup> , on 55 different SSSIs, were in unfavourable condition due to activities authorised by development or mineral planning permission, excluding peat permissions.

 The European Commission&#039;s latest Communication on sugar reform, presented to the Agriculture Council on 19 July, aims to move away from the present systems of price and production support towards a sustainable decoupled, market-based approach in line with other recent CAP reforms. It would involve both price and quota cuts in an initial phase, followed by a further review in 2008. This approach, which the Government welcomes as an important step in the right direction, should help to make sugar beet itself more competitive with other sources of biomass and biofuels, as well as promoting diversification among existing growers.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) were informed of our programme of enforced returns to Somalia and we keep in close contact with these Departments at official and ministerial level on the situation in Somalia. The Home Office&#039;s Country Information and Policy Unity (CIPU) produce country information materials that are used as the background against which asylum applications are considered. The FCO are consulted about these country information materials, prior to the publication of the documents in order to ensure that this material is accurate and comprehensive.

<p>
<a name="40901w39.html_para9">
Caseworkers also have access at all times to senior caseworkers with specific country knowledge, as well as to CIPU which provides up-to-date and specific information on request, drawing on a range of reliable sources, including the FCO, with which CIPU maintains regular contact. If, on the basis of the available information, a Somali asylum applicant is found not to be in need of protection by the Home Office and by the independent Immigration Appellate Authority, then it is considered safe for that person to be returned to Somalia, and they will be considered for removal. We do not routinely monitor the conditions of failed asylum seekers once they have been returned to their country, having been found to have no protection needs.

It is also worth noting that according to the UNHCR&#039;s 2003 Global Refugee Report, 9,543 Somali refugees were assisted to return to North West Somalia (Somaliland) from Ethiopia and Djibouti, while 680 returned to North-west Somalia (Puntland) and four to Mogadishu, bringing the total number of assisted Somali returnees to 10,227 last year.

Single Additional Payments were introduced when financial assistance was paid by way of vouchers. Now that support is provided entirely in cash, asylum seekers are no longer limited to where they can shop and can get better value for their money. Moreover, as applications are being processed more quickly, with 80 per cent. of initial claims processed within two months, the justification for one-off payments every six months is reduced.

<a name="40901w39.html_para13">
Asylum seekers can still apply for a &#163;300 maternity payment and since March 2003 additional support for pregnant women and children under three has meant that the level of asylum support has increased overall for these more vulnerable groups.

<p><a name="40901w45.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart </b> 
<i>[holding answer 29 June 2004]:</i> On Friday 16 July 2004 the Home Office published a paper responding to the suggestions made by independent consultants in their report &quot;Research into Insurance Cover for the VCS in England&quot;, which was commissioned by the Home Office Insurance Cover Working Group (ICWG).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w45.html_para0">
The paper outlines the practical action that is and has been taken across Government to address the challenges facing voluntary and community organisations in obtaining insurance cover for their activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w45.html_para1">
Five action points have been agreed between the insurance industry, the voluntary and community sector (VCS) and Government:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1. The Home Office Minister responsible for communities will champion the cause of insurance for the voluntary and community sector.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">2. Government work on employers&#039; liability insurance, legal costs and full cost recovery, will be taken forward by The Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Home Office Active Communities Directorate, ensuring that the interests of the voluntary and community sector are taken into account.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">3. Sources of practical advice and expertise on the required needs of the insurance industry will be brought together by providing access to relevant information on the Home Office, Association of British Insurers, and various voluntary and community sector organisation&#039;s websites, in order to increase the capacity of the sector to deal with insurance issues.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">4. Better practical arrangements for working with local government will be investigated by the Home Office, working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Local Government Association.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">5. There will be an on-going dialogue between the voluntary and community sector, the insurance industry and government, facilitated by the Home Office through the Insurance Cover Working Group (ICWG) meeting to discuss progress and on-going issues, as appropriate.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w45.html_para2">
Implementation of the plan has already started and will continue over the coming months as parcels of work are completed. The ICWG will be an &quot;honest broker&quot; between the VCS, the insurance industry and other key players, highlighting and discussing specific issues of concern to the VCS. I will champion this insurance issue for the VCS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w45.html_para3">
The actions we are taking are practical measures to empower the VCS. For example, by encouraging greater understanding of the issues facing the VCS within the insurance industry, by facilitating greater dialogue, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 858W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
encouraging the principle of &quot;full cost recovery&quot; across Government and providing better and more accessible information regarding such things as risk management/bulk purchasing schemes/and basic details to do with the provision of insurance cover, all adding up to practical help for the VCS. However, these are just the first steps in an area where there can be no overnight changes. Therefore, the Government and their partners are committed to making a difference over the long term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w45.html_para4">
In tandem with this longer term commitment, I have now set in motion a process for the delivery of a policy framework designed to address the increasing insurance burden and other concerns in the voluntary and community sector, particularly those parts of the sector that undertake activities with a greater element of risk. From this process we expect guidance to emerge on risk and its management as well as the development of a document similar to &quot;Making the Market Work&quot;, an initiative the Association of British Insurers (ABI) developed for the assessment of Trade Associations Health and Safety schemes.

 Officials wrote to all Chief Constables on 25 May 2004 to set out the Home Office&#039;s position in relation to the National Neighbourhood Watch Association. This letter encouraged Chief Constables to continue to support Neighbourhood Watch in their force areas. No instructions were given.

<p><a name="40901w46.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The commercial sponsorship agreements of the National Neighbourhood Watch Association are a matter for the association and any sponsors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w46.html_para0">
The Home Office generally has no interest in the commercial sponsorship deals of voluntary organisations. The only exception would be when the proposed deal involved the use of a public asset, for example the Neighbourhood Watch logo. In such a case the Home Office would act to ensure that the asset was used properly and that it continued to be publicly available.

<p><a name="40901w46.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Neighbourhood Watch logo was designed by the Central Office of Information in 1985 on behalf of the Home Office, it is therefore Crown Copyright.

<p><a name="40901w46.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I have decided not to give further funding to the National Neighbourhood Watch Association on the basis of a financial audit which was undertaken earlier this year. Under these circumstances it would be inappropriate for us to provide them with a loan.

The figures for the planned number of officer posts prior to 2004 are not an accurate reflection of the operational staffing requirement. These figures, based on forecast planned posts, included staff nominally identified for special units within prisons that were used infrequently and were staffed using additional supplementary hours from existing staff; and the staffing requirements for new accommodation that had not yet opened. The Prison Service introduced new arrangements for the collection of workforce data earlier this year to eliminate these anomalies and to reflect more accurately the operational staffing requirement. Before April 2001 the figures were collected as part of a general planning process and were not specifically designed for workforce planning purposes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w48.html_para1">
A contract supplementary hours scheme has been in operation since April 2001, which allows governors to deploy existing staff on pre-arranged, additional hours contracts, to meet any shortfall in actual staffing availability. In April 2004 this scheme contributed the equivalent of 373 full-time officers. As a result, actual staffing availability at April 2004 (full-time equivalent staff in post plus the use of contracted supplementary hours) was (24,325) compared to the operational staffing requirement of (24,709). This represents a gap of 1.6 per cent, which the Director General considers to be an acceptable operating margin.

 In its Public Service Agreement, published in 2000, the Home Office committed itself to reducing by 2003&#150;04 the proportion of offenders given prison or community sentences who are subsequently reconvicted by 5 per cent. compared to a 1997 baseline. The target was carried forward in the 2002 Public Service Agreement, with a new baseline of 2000. Latest published figures, for 1999, show that 3.2 per cent. fewer offenders were reconvicted than predicted. The Home Office also committed itself to maintaining the (then) current low number of escapes, including Category A escapes. There has been no escape of a Category A prisoner since 1995. The baseline for the total number of escapes in 1997&#150;98 was 0.17 per cent. of the average prison population. The outcome for 2003&#150;04 was 0.067 per cent.

All Prison Service establishments have the objective of offering a range of foods that enable prisoners to make healthy eating choices. All establishments must offer at least one lower fat/high fibre/lower sugar or lower salt item on each menu and there must be a clearly marked healthy eating option included on all menus. In particular prisons are required to offer a wide range of interesting fresh fruits, vegetables and salads. As well as being monitored during the cooking process nutrition is also monitored in food specifications via purchasing. Prison Service caterers are required to look objectively at menu selection and continually seek to modify their recipes, cooking methods and service towards more healthy guidelines.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) for what reasons under the Private Security Industry Act 2001 a security officer pays a much higher sum for licences than the actual cost of the licensing and criminal record check;  [184536]

</p>



<p>(2) for what reasons under the Private Security Industry Act 2001 an individual private security officer will be required to pay for separate licences if during the course of his duties he patrols a shopping centre, monitors CCTV or applies a wheel clamp in a car park;  [184537]

</p>



<p>(4) for what reasons it was decided that in-house manned guarding teams should be exempt from licensing under the Private Security Industry Act 2001.  [184539]</p>








<p><a name="40901w49.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 16 July 2004]:</i> The cost of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence, which is valid for three years, reflects the licence application process and includes the current cost of a Criminal Records Bureau Standard Disclosure (28). It also funds the associated activities undertaken to secure the future of the private security industry. These include compliance with and enforcement of the licensing scheme, raising awareness, accommodation, personnel, and research costs. The licence fee is tax deductible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w49.html_para2">
The private security industry contains a number of sectors each requiring their own skills and competencies. The SIA has worked closely with the industry to both identify and tailor training for these sector specific competencies. The nature of the sectors will mean that some training and competencies require sector specific licences. However, wherever possible, when competencies overlap between sectors, the SIA has exploited opportunities for one licence to be valid across a range of licensable activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w49.html_para3">
The manned guarding sector is expected to commence rollout in January 2005. The industry has been supporting the SIA by working in partnership to find a mutually beneficial approach to the transition to licensing and developing the most appropriate process. The 12 months between commencement and legal requirement will allow business to spread their employees&#039; training requirements and applications over a mutually agreeable time frame that meets both the commercial needs of the industry and the implementation of regulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w49.html_para4">
The Government&#039;s White Paper published in 1999 envisaged that in-house staff employed on manned guarding duties would be covered by licensing arrangements. However, it was subsequently decided that, in light of differences in needs and circumstances between in-house provision and that under external contract, licensing requirements under the Act should not extend to in-house staff. More recently, the SIA has commissioned a detailed examination of in-house security provision, and a report is expected towards the end of the year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact of the EU Clinical Trials Directive in the UK.  [185535]</p>








<p><a name="40901w51.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The United Kingdom Clinical Trials Regulations <sup>1</sup>  to implement the Clinical Trials Directive <sup>2</sup>  came into force on 1 May 2004. It is still early to fully assess the impact of the Directive in the UK. Transitional arrangements allowed holders of existing authorisations or exemptions to roll them over as clinical trial authorisations without applying again to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or paying a fee. The MHRA has met its deadline of 14 days for Phase I applications and of 30 days for all other applications. Generally the new procedures have been introduced without disruption of clinical trials. Industry and academia have both given early positive feedback on the UK&#039;s implementation of the Directive.

<p>(2) what assessment he has made of the effects of supermarkets injecting water into meat products.  [185882]</p>








<p><a name="40901w51.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is aware of concerns about trade in products which appear to be raw unprocessed meat but which have been injected with excess added water, in some cases as high as 50 per cent., and moisture retaining ingredients. While there are no food safety concerns the FSA&#039;s view is that this practice is unacceptable. It is therefore pressing for stronger legislative controls at European Union level to prohibit use of moisture retaining ingredients, introduce limits on addition of water and improve labelling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w51.html_para2">
The FSA is aware of concerns about the labelling of some pork products with lower levels of added water which are sold in United Kingdom supermarkets. A stakeholder meeting held earlier this year concluded that label declarations of added water on these products should be sufficiently prominent that consumers can

 Milk products from other European Union Member States are in free circulation and would not be subject to any special checks when entering the United Kingdom.

<p><a name="40901w54.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 No central comparison has been made of the impact of out-of-hours services on emergency services of areas where general practitioners have not opted-out and areas where organised providers, such as GP co-ops, have been commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs) to provide the service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w54.html_para2">
As recommended by the independent review of GP out-of-hours services, PCTs should be developing integrated networks of unscheduled care, which bring together accident and emergency, ambulance services, walk-in centres and in-hours services, to meet the full range of patient needs and to reduce unnecessary referrals to emergency services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w54.html_para3">
There is to be no change to the pattern of provision for 80 per cent. of Nottingham residents already served by the GP co-operative, Nottingham Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) and which have been so for six years. NEMS is an active participant of the local emergency care network and no adverse impact on emergency care has been identified locally.

<p><a name="40901w54.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national quality standards, which all providers of out-of-hours services must meet, include specific requirements that there is rapid and effective transmission of patient data between general practitioner practices and out-of-hours services, a system for transmitting information on patients with special needs from the practice to the provider, and all providers must be able to supply full clinical details of all consultations to the patient&#039;s GP practice by the next working day.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w54.html_para4">
This will be further improved through the introduction of the electronic patient record. In Nottingham local providers and practices are establishing systems for sharing patient information. Nottingham Emergency Medical Services, in partnership with the local emergency care network and NHS Direct, has already established a database of important information provided by GPs on the most vulnerable members of their practice population. This is being extended and access to this is being enabled for other emergency care providers.

<p><a name="40901w54.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 All organised out-of-hours providers must meet the national quality standards.

<p>

The national quality standards are currently being reviewed by an expert group, to reflect the new contractual mechanisms in primary care. The new standards will come into effect on 1 January 2005 and from this date all providers of out-of-hours services, including GP practices which choose not to opt-out, will have to meet the quality standards as a contractual obligation.

<p><a name="40901w56.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Wiggin: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much the Government owe to the private sector with regard to hospital building programmes in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  [185197]</p>









<p><a name="40901w56.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Under the private finance initiative (PFI), national health service trusts make regular payments (unitary payments) to their private sector partner once the hospital is open; payments are subject to satisfactory performance of the contract. The total PFI unitary payments in 2003&#150;04 were &#163;346 million. This figure includes Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust and Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust&#039;s unitary payments of &#163;10.5 million and &#163;17.8 million respectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w56.html_para2">
The payments figure does not include schemes with a capital value below &#163;10 million as information on them is not held centrally.
</p>






<a name="40901w56.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Hospital Building Programme</h3>





<p><a name="40901w56.html_wqn5"><b> Andy King: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the Government are on track to achieve its target of 114 hospitals by 2010; and what the <i>(a)</i> anticipated construction cost, <i>(b)</i> expected date for start of construction and <i>(c)</i> planned date for completion is of each (i) major and (ii) medium-sized building programme.  [182453]</p>








<p><a name="40901w56.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Currently there are 132 privately financed and public capital funded hospital schemes counting towards the NHS Plan target of 100 new hospital schemes by 2010. 46 of these are already open, so we are well on course to meet this target.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w56.html_para3">
The tables show the estimated capital value, which incorporates construction costs, start on site and first patient date. Planned financial close dates are given for schemes yet to reach financial close and these are subject to change. The tables include the 15 new projects given the go-ahead by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, on 27 July.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to improve and update the hospital cleanliness rating system;  [185334]

</p>



<p>(2) what proposals he has to amend hospital cleanliness inspections to reflect the disparity between inspection outcomes and patient experience noted in the Healthcare Commission State of Healthcare Report 2004.  [185622]</p>








<p><a name="40901w57.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The patient environment action team (PEAT) process for measuring hospital cleanliness was redesigned for the 2004 inspection round, following discussions with a number of representative bodies. The number of areas assessed this year was increased from 18 to 24.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w57.html_para0">
This has significantly extended the information available to hospitals about their performance. A new rating system was designed around a five-point scale and introduced an &quot;excellent&quot; category. The scoring process continues to be weighted in relation to cleanliness issues in wards and accident and emergency departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w57.html_para1">
The new national healthcare standards, published on 21 July, include cleanliness and performance against them will be rated in the Healthcare Commission&#039;s annual assessments of national health service bodies in England.

 Information concerning the specific cleanliness and hygiene of operating theatres is not collected centrally. Guidance was issued in the form of a standard measure of cleanliness for hospitals in the national standards of cleanliness 2002 (further revised in 2003). In this guidance, operating theatres are classified as very high risk and it is stressed that constant cleaning is deemed critical.

It is for the chief executives of national health service trusts to ensure that nurses have enough suitable clothing and equipment to carry out their work effectively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 28 June 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 106W, whether the licensing process compared mortality rates, the development of diabetic complications and the quality of life of those using animal and synthetic insulin; and if he will make a statement.  [184700]</p>








<p><a name="40901w57.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 All authorised insulins, whether human (synthetic) insulin or animal insulin, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in people with diabetes mellitus. As part of the licensing approval process for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Sept 2004 : Column 907W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
any medicinal product, including insulins, the applicant has to provide evidence that the product meets appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. These standards are set out in European Guidance documents, including, for example, &quot;Notes for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus&quot; (CPMP/EWP/1080/00). This will include clinical trial data of appropriate duration in patients with diabetes as set out in the guidance document. The primary purpose of the confirmatory studies involving the assessed insulin is to demonstrate a favourable effect on blood glucose control (this is considered clinically relevant in terms of risk reduction of diabetic complications).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w57.html_para4">
Data on mortality rates, development of diabetic complications and quality of life are not necessarily required for the licensing process. Additionally, there are no requirements for comparative studies between animal and synthetic insulins as part of the licensing process. Therefore, the licensing process has not compared mortality rates, development of diabetic complications or the quality of life of patients using animal and synthetic insulins. After licensing, all drugs, including insulins, are continually monitored for safety. The decision to use one or other of the insulins rests with the physician in consultation with the patient.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40901w57.html_para5">
The committee on safety of medicines and its sub-committee on pharmacovigilance (SCOP) have kept the safety of synthetic (human) insulins under close review and have considered the available data on a number of occasions. Most recently in 2002, the SCOP considered the findings of an independent review of controlled clinical trial data by the Cochrane collaboration. The conclusions of the Cochrane review were that there is no difference in blood glucose control or the incidence of adverse events between patients on synthetic insulin compared with patients on animal insulins. The SCOP confirmed its previous advice that there is no clear evidence of a safety problem specific to human insulin.

<p><a name="40901w59.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 All midwives deciding to return to the national health service are eligible for a returners package including a &#163;1,500 bursary to support them whilst they are retraining. There is also financial support for childcare, travel and books. The chief nursing officer has contacted former midwives by letter to encourage them to return to the NHS. To support this, the Department allocated &#163;750,000 to workforce development confederations in 2003&#150;04 to fund 500 return to practice places for midwives. To encourage returners, a new NHS careers return to practice guide for midwives was published in January 2004. Copies are available in the Library. In addition, the Department has funded the Royal College of Midwives, in collaboration with Open University, to design a flexible return to practice open learning programme.

<i>[holding answer 22 July 2004]:</i> Due to an increase in call volumes and the success of the pilot NHS Direct service for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, the existing premises at Highcroft in Winchester, which had been the location of the initial call centre since March 1999, were considered to be unsuitable for the growth of the service. In February 2001, the NHS Direct management team within the Department, in consultation with external estates advisers and NHS Estates, decided to locate a new call centre at Berrywood Business Village, Hedge End. The selection criteria used for deciding the location of the new call centre included access by public and private transport and security for staff attending and leaving work. The new call centre was opened in September 2001. Other locations considered were Silver Hill in Winchester, Link 414 in Chandlers Ford, Easton Lane in Winchester and Belbins Business Park in Romsey.

<a name="40901w60.html_para1">
There are currently 136 whole time equivalent (wte) staff employed by the NHS Direct special health authority at the call centre. 58 of the staff are nurses (G grade), 47 are health information advisers (administrative and clerical 5) and the rest are managers or support staff. Staffing costs for the

They are made direct to the senior responsible owner (SRO) and are confidential in order not to impair the value of the advice. The SRO has responsibility for ensuring that any recommendations are addressed before the project is permitted to proceed.

 National health service numbers are assigned to all patients who receive NHS care, and underpin the development of electronic care records. Departmental officials have formed the view that the widespread use of the NHS number means that it is a &quot;general identifier&quot; within the meaning of the European data protection directive and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act and therefore formal regulations should be introduced to regulate its use.

 NHS Professionals was operating through various national health service bodies until 1 January 2004, when it was established as a special health authority (SHA) in shadow form.

The Department has set up formal performance review arrangements with NHS Professionals.

NHS trusts have already seen a reduction in temporary staffing costs and improvement in bank fill rates due to NHS Professionals. Local agency agreements have also saved an estimated &#163;50 million over the past year.
