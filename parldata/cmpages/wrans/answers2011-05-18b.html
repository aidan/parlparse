<i>Notes:</i>
1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.
2. To qualify for incapacity benefit (IB), claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work called a personal capability assessment. Under the employment support allowance (ESA) regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment.
From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients have begun to also undertake this assessment.
The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming IB or ESA on the basis of mental and behavioural disorders would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the personal/work capability assessment.
3. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment and support allowance from October 2008.
4. Data include people in receipt of benefit and also those who fail the contributions conditions but receive a national insurance credit, ie ‘credits only cases’.

               <b>Mr Blunt:</b>
 The YJB does not hold data down to local authority level; however we do hold data down to Youth Offending Team level. The majority of Youth Offending Teams are coterminous with local authorities in England and Wales; however there are some exceptions where a single YOT covers two or more local authorities (see Annex A for a list of Youth Offending Teams which cover more than one local authority area). During 2009-10, there were 157 YOTs; 139 in England and 18 in Wales. The following table shows the average proportion per 1,000 young people aged <i>(a)</i> 12 to 15 and <i>(b)</i> 16 and 17 year olds in each youth offending team in England and Wales that were in custody (remanded and sentenced) for the period of 2009-10. The population data are from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and are based on mid-year estimate from 2008, which are the latest available population data with the age breakdown.</p>

 Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office can only license the use of animals for scientific purposes where there is no non-animal alternative, and then only when both the number of animals to be used and any expected suffering is minimised. This reflects the principles of the 3Rs—the refinement of scientific procedures, the reduction of the number of animals used and their replacement with other methods wherever possible.</p>

 No central record is kept of the number of armed forces personnel who registered and voted at either the 2010 UK parliamentary election or the referendum on the voting system earlier this month. Armed services personnel may register to vote as ordinary electors, as service electors or, where appropriate, as overseas electors and therefore it is not possible to readily identify all of them.</p>

I understand that for the 2010 UK parliamentary election, 217 postal votes were successfully returned and distributed out to returning officers. In addition to this, 294 applications to vote by proxy were received and forwarded to electoral registration officers. The corresponding figures for the referendum on the voting system in 2011 were 40 postal votes and 281 proxies. The use of proxies in such circumstances is recommended by both the Electoral Commission and MoD.</p>

 Reducing the number of abortions and repeat abortions is very important. In 2009, the number of abortions fell by 3% from 195,296 in 2008 to 189,100.</p>

               <a name="11051892000966"> Contraception plays a vital role in preventing unintended pregnancy and repeat abortions. Since 1 April 2009, any woman having an abortion on the national health service must be given advice about and supplies of contraception before they leave the clinic. In addition, a specification for abortion services has been issued to support implementation of this requirement.</p>

               <a name="11051892000967"> The Department invested £11.5 million in 2010-11 to improve access to contraception. Abortion should not be seen in isolation, but in the context of wider public health issues as the public health White Paper ‘Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health in England’ highlights and the forthcoming sexual health document to be published in autumn 2011 will make clear.</p>

 The Government appreciate that some parents need extra help because they experience a multitude of problems, which can include learning difficulties. There is a great deal of evidence that parenting and intensive family intervention services are cost effective and can provide much-needed help for these families. In December 2010, the Prime Minister announced a new national campaign to support and help turn around the lives of all families with multiple problems. All parents of young children, including those with learning difficulties, are also able to use their local Sure Start children's centre to gain access to early years services.</p>

The Government want to retain the national network of Sure Start children's centres with a core universal offer, while also ensuring they deliver proven early intervention programmes to support those families in greatest need. The grant is intended to fund universal programmes and activities available to all children, young people and families, as well as specialist services where intensive support is needed.</p>

Raising the number of specialist science teachers in schools is a high priority for the Government and we have already confirmed that trainees starting postgraduate teacher training courses in physics will be offered the highest bursary rate of £9,000 in the academic year 2011/12.</p>
