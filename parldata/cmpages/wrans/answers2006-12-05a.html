The great majority of these were alkaline manganese and zinc carbon varieties. There has been no legislative requirement for waste household batteries to be separately collected and detailed statistics have not therefore been kept.

This is a &#147;producer responsibility&#148; directive and, as such, the onus on collection and recycling will fall on battery producers in the first instance. However, local authorities are also likely to play a role given their current involvement in the collection of household waste. The exact form this may take will not be decided until the completion of formal domestic consultation with all parties concerned.</p>

It is for local authorities to decide what they do with the funding they are allocated. They can use it to install sprinklers where their need is demonstrated by a risk assessment, or where they represent value for money. Where a local authority has a general policy of installing sprinklers in schools, and need or value for money is not demonstrated in a particular project, it can of course provide additional funding to cover sprinklers.</p>

This includes guidance on sprinklers but, following public consultation, we saw the need to do more work in this area. We therefore commissioned consultants to analyse case studies of school projects where sprinklers have been installed. They are establishing reliable figures for both installation and maintenance costs, and developing these into a full cost benefit analysis. This work will be completed in January and then integrated into the final version of Building Bulletin 100, which we expect to publish several months later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="61205w0009.htm_para0"><a name="061205100001470">The figures are for the average number of staff employed by the LSC each year and include temporary staff and agency staff. A rise in staff numbers occurred between March 2002 and March 2003 as the LSC began to build up the organisation, and took on significant new responsibilities, including the funding of school sixth forms. During 2004 the LSC undertook a re-shaping exercise which resulted in a fall in numbers in March 2005. Staff numbers subsequently increased slightly, reflecting the further work which was transferred by the Department to the LSC during 2005, including education maintenance allowances. However, we anticipate a reduction in the average number of staff in post between 2006 and 2007 as a consequence of the announcement in September 2005 by Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, of proposals for a new structure for the organisation. This new structure aims to make the LSC more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. This process is now nearing completion, and will achieve with estimated savings of up to &#163;40 million, which could be released to the front line for the further benefit of learners. As a result, the LSC will have a strong regional and local capacity, spending less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders.</p>

This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup>. 1999-00 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1996 and York LA was separated out from North Yorkshire LA. Hence what was previously regarded as North Yorkshire Local Authority (pre-LGR) was split into new North Yorkshire and York local authorities.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> The 1999-00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
<sup>(8 )</sup>Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-00.<br>
<sup>(9 )</sup>School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> Immediate Custody includes sentences of Secure Training Order, Detention and Training Order, Young Offender Institution and Unsuspended sentence of imprisonment.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Staffordshire police force were only able to submit sample data for persons proceeded against and convicted in the magistrates' courts for the year 2000. Although sufficient to estimate higher orders of data, these data are not robust enough at a detailed level and have been excluded from the table.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

Consequently there was a 60 per cent. increase in cases recorded. This reporting increase has tailed off but a more realistic picture of the levels of self-harm now exists. It is not recommended to compare pre-2003 and post-2003 self-harm figures.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Due to improved recording over the years the annual number of prisoner on prisoner assaults before 2000 are not readily comparable with later years.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. The tables show annual numbers of self-harm and assaults incidents in prisons in England and Wales to the nearest thousand.<br>
2. The number of self-harm incidents and assaults reported are derived from the Prison Service Incident Reporting System (IRS). This system processes high volumes of data supplied by prisons and is constantly being updated. The numbers indicated provide a useful indication of the realistic scale of assaults and self-harm incidents, many of which are relatively minor. The numbers should not be interpreted as absolute.<br>
3. The increase in reported numbers of assaults reflects, in part, the increase in prison population.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
 1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

<a name="61205w0027.htm_brev0"><a name="06120610004556"><ul><p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding how many residents parking schemes are under consideration by the Department for Regional Development in each Northern Ireland council area.

</ul><a name="61205w0027.htm_brev1"><a name="06120610004557"><ul><p class="tabletext">By way of background, I should explain that the Department took powers in the Road Traffic Regulation (NI) Order 1997 to permit the introduction of residents&#146; parking schemes in Northern Ireland. However, one of the key success factors for residents&#146; parking schemes is effective enforcement. At that time, the Police Service of Northern Ireland was responsible for the enforcement of parking restrictions, but indicated that they could not provide resources to carry out this enforcement. No schemes have therefore been implemented to date.</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0027.htm_brev2"><a name="06120610004558"><ul><p class="tabletext">You will be aware that, on 30 October 2006 parking offences were decriminalised and Roads Service took over responsibility for the enforcement of parking restrictions. On 17 November 2006 we launched a draft policy consultation on residents&#146; parking, which will end on 9 February 2007.</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0027.htm_brev3"><a name="06120610004559"><ul><p class="tabletext">While we have received a number of enquiries in relation to residents&#146; parking schemes, none of these will be considered in detail until the consultation has been completed and a policy developed. However, I can advise that following publication of the residents&#146; parking policy, it is intended that the first residents&#146; parking schemes will be implemented towards the end of next year.</p>

The Observatory is funded through the UN and works closely with local authorities in North Kivu and Rwanda, other UN agencies and NGOs. If it becomes necessary to evacuate people from the area, support will be provided through the rapid response mechanism (RRM)&#151;a contingency fund established in DRC to ensure emergency assistance is provided as quickly as possible, supported by the UK and other partners.</p>

The area is now quiet again, but people are delaying their return home, fearing looting. A joint UN/NGO assessment mission has reviewed the situation and made a first distribution of food and other essential items to those in need, using RRM resources.

We inherited around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, several of which were unsuitable for the new processes, or were in the wrong place or in a poor state of repair. Often, the former agencies had offices situated at either end of the High Street and, in some instances, neither was suitable for conversion to Jobcentre Plus so we closed one or both of them. In each District we undertook detailed service delivery planning exercises in consultation with local stakeholders, identifying the sites which we would convert to the new standard and those, which needed to close. We also explained how, particularly in more rural locations, we would offer outreach services (&#147;flexible service delivery&#148;).</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0030.htm_brev8"><a name="06120610004582"><ul><p class="tabletext">Secondly, as a result of our programme to centralise benefit processing we have identified sites which will no longer be viable once processing work has been taken away from them.</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0030.htm_brev9"><a name="06120610004583"><ul><p class="tabletext">Thirdly, we have been looking very closely at the need for public-facing sites in a number of locations. The increased availability of new channels means that Jobcentre Plus customers can access services directly by telephone or Internet rather than needing to call into one of our offices. Reducing expenditure on our office network is part of our wider strategy for focusing resources more effectively on frontline advisory services to help our customers move into work.</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0030.htm_brev10"><a name="06120610004584"><ul><p class="tabletext">The list of closures should also be set against the 837 offices that we have rolled out to date under our restructuring programme, plus over 150 locations where we have installed flexible service delivery arrangements.</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0030.htm_brev11"><a name="06120610004585"><ul><p class="tabletext">I would emphasise that the closure of any of our offices involves consultation with local stakeholders, including MPs, and putting in place suitable alternative arrangements for delivering services to our customers.</p>
