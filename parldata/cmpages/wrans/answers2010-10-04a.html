 DEFRA Ministers and officials are working, as a matter of priority, with the European Commission, European Parliament, member states and domestic stakeholders to press for an ambitious reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) that delivers good value for farmers, taxpayers, consumers and the environment. DEFRA Ministers continue to discuss reform of the CAP with EU counterparts at the Agriculture Council and the Informal Agriculture Council.

 DEFRA has not met with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) recently to discuss reform of its fishery certification programme and eco-label scheme. Officials meet with MSC representatives routinely as one of many partners aiming to achieve sustainable fisheries, in recognition that third-party certification programmes, such as the MSC scheme, have a role to play in supporting efforts by governments to improve the management of our fisheries.</p>

However, the MSC is an independent non-profit making organisation and, while DEFRA and CEFAS officials will provide appropriate policy and technical support as requested, management of their scheme is ultimately a matter for the MSC.</p>

 Financial capability is already a subject covered by the standards that trainees have to meet in order to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status. Standard Q15 currently requires all trainee teachers to demonstrate a familiarity with the non-statutory Programmes of Study for personal, social, health and economic education relevant to the age ranges they are training to teach. This includes financial capability within the economic wellbeing Programmes of Study for key stages 3 and 4. Teachers of Business Education in the secondary phase will receive training in aspects of personal finance relevant to the 14-19 curriculum.</p>

This data is provisional and is the most recent available.

Further years will depend on recommendations made by the independent school teachers' review body. These figures include employers' superannuation and employers' national insurance contributions.

 The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS' laid out proposals for fundamental changes to the ways that the national health service is structured and run, including the abolition of primary care trusts and strategic health authorities (from 2012-13). The precise details of the transition to the new system will not be known until the new organisations that will underpin the new system have been designed in more detail. The Department is in the process of consulting on how the new organisations should be designed, and once the results of this are known we will publish the costs and implications of the new system in an impact assessment.</p>

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i>  The data are not a count of people, as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion.  <i> 1. Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i> A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.  <i> 2. Primary diagnosis</i> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. The ICD-10 code what used to define obesity is E66-Obesity.<i>   3. Number of episodes with a (named) main procedure</i> The number of episodes where the procedure was recorded in the main procedure field in a HES record. Note that more procedures are carried out than the number of episodes with a main procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode. The number of episodes with any main procedure include '&amp;' (not known), and for OPCS 4.3/4.4/4.5 (from 2006-07) codes A01-X97, or for OPCS 4.2 (prior to 2006-07) codes A01-X59.  <i> 4. Ethnicity</i> Ethnicity data may not be good enough to allow accurate analysis, including analysis of ethnic differences. Ethnic group was collected from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 2002 and ethnic category, using the definitions in the 2001 census, from 1 April 2002. Patients are asked to select their category from a standard list, and some decline to do this. Data may therefore be incomplete and of poor quality.  <i> 5. Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i> Data quality</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies.

 The package of measures announced in the June Budget and being introduced for the Local Housing Allowance in 2011-12, including the removal of the £15 excess planned by the previous administration, will achieve savings of around £1 billion by 2015-16. The other changes to Housing Benefit announced in the June Budget are estimated to save a further £1.1 billion in 2015-16.

1. Data are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
2. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. To qualify for IB/SDA, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work called the Personal Capability Assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on IB/SDA claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits. So for example, the decision for a customer claiming IB on grounds of injuries of the spine and trunk would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the Personal Capability Assessment.<br>
3. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<br>

2. Local authorities and parliamentary constituencies are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant ONS postcode directory<br>
3. Constituencies used are for the Westminster Parliament of May 2005.<br>
4. "Unknown" are mainly cases where the payment is actually paid to the IS/JSA claimant whose partner will be aged 60 and over. In these cases the claimants age will be under 60.<br>

 Winter Fuel Payments are annual lump-sum payments with the majority paid in November and December each year. European Community law means that some benefits acquired in one member of state must be paid to people when they move to another country within the European economic area. Winter Fuel Payments are only paid to former UK residents living in the European economic area if they qualified for payment before leaving the UK. The number of Winter Fuel Payments made to former UK residents living abroad is in the following table.</p>
