 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i> (a)</i> steps her Department is taking and <i> (b)</i> funding her Department provides to encourage an increase in the grey partridge population. [17733]</p>

 The grey partridge is a farmland species whose population trend is declining. It is currently being targeted by Environmental Stewardship (ES)-an agri-environment scheme, administered by Natural England-that provides financial support to farmers to manage their land effectively for environmental and wildlife outcomes. ES includes a number of land-management options designed to deliver the nesting and year-round feeding habitats required by farmland birds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="101018w0001.htm_para15"><a name="10101818000041">Recent research by the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, funded by Natural England, suggests that three ES groups of options have consistently shown positive effects on farmland birds, including grey partridges. These are: beetle banks; conservation headlands; and wild bird seed mixtures. A total of £34.2 million will be paid to farmers for these three groups of options over the 10-year life of the agreements (initiated since 2005) for tailored management arrangements, known as Higher Level Scheme agreements. In addition, a further £2.57 million was paid in the past 12 months to farmers implementing these options through the Entry Level Scheme, which requires a simpler, generic management approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="101018w0001.htm_para16"><a name="10101818000042">The grey partridge may also benefit from the Campaign for the Farmed Environment work by farmers. This is an industry-led initiative to which DEFRA is contributing £1.5 million over three years. The campaign seeks to improve the environmental benefits of farmland across three schemes including one focused on increasing the populations of species of farmland birds that are currently in decline.</p>

 The UK Government remain entirely committed to the conventional cage ban coming into force on 1 January 2012 and to supporting industry during this transitional stage. I have received many questions and concerns from UK egg industry representatives and egg producers regarding the introduction of a code 4 for eggs. These concerns have been raised with the European Commission which has made it clear that the introduction of an additional production code would be confusing to consumers and thus is not an option they are willing to consider.</p>

This might be through the introduction of an intra-community ban on the trade in eggs produced by hens still housed in conventional cages after 1 January 2012. In practice this would mean that such eggs may only be sold in the member state of production for a limited period only. This will help protect compliant producers and ensure that they are not disadvantaged if there was any delay to the ban, or other member states do not meet the 2012 deadline.</p>

 Low noise surfacing materials are used as a matter of course when major maintenance is required on the strategic road network. As the noise reduction results are a secondary benefit it would be inappropriate to assign costs from resurfacing to noise reduction alone.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what his policy is on <i> (a)</i> providing support and building capacity for co-operatives in developing countries and <i> (b)</i> enabling smallholders to form secondary co-operatives in such countries. [17247]</p>

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="10101823000053"><a name="101018w0001.htm_spnew60"><a name="10101823000112"><b>Mr O'Brien:</b>
 Cooperatives are key partners in the fight against poverty in many low income countries. The Department for International Development's (DFID's) Food Retail Industry Challenge Fund (FRICH) provides funding to co-operatives which, for example, are helping small-holder Kenyan farmers in co-operatives to access a guaranteed market for the tea they produce. Co-operatives are also eligible to apply to the Department's Business Innovation Facility. In addition our new funding instruments for private sector development will be designed to be accessible to co-operatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="101018w0001.htm_para52"><a name="10101823000054">DFID does not have a specific policy on enabling small holders to form secondary co-operatives. However we do recognise their importance as one way for smallholders to capture more of the value chain and increase their incomes. These are key objectives that we support through our funding for fair trade, private sector enterprise and civil society, a good example of which I have seen for myself in Rwanda as part of a DFID-funded Social Protection Programme.</p>

 The threat level in Northern Ireland remains at severe, meaning terrorist attacks are highly likely. So far this year there have been 37 attacks. To date in 2010 there have been 180 arrests and 64 persons charged with terrorist offences. This compares to 106 arrests and 17 charges in the whole of 2009. While these terrorists pose a serious challenge, the security forces have the manpower, resources and ability to meet the threat.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether the transitional protection given to former invalidity benefit claimants when incapacity benefit arrangements were changed will be applied when incapacity benefit is migrated to employment and support allowance. [15973]</p>

 When invalidity benefit customers had their benefit changed to incapacity benefit in 1995, they received transitional protection that meant they had their existing level of benefit protected. Their awards then continued to be uprated in line with the arrangements for incapacity benefit. This meant that their benefit maintained its value but that they continued to be paid incapacity benefit at a higher rate than many new claimants to incapacity benefit. This remains the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="101018w0002.htm_para7"><a name="10101827000192">These transitional arrangements will not continue on conversion to employment and support allowance. However, new transitional arrangements will be put in place.</p>

However, it will not continue to be uprated beyond the protected level. If the employment and support allowance rate they are entitled to is less than the amount they received on their old benefit, they will receive a transitional addition to make up the difference. The amount of benefit they receive will then not rise with annual uprating, but will be frozen until the rate of employment and support allowance catches up. Over time, all recipients of employment and support allowance will therefore receive comparable awards, dependent on capability.</p>

However, each rank has a pay boundary threshold and, if the score falls within 5% of it, the service concerned may exercise management discretion to allow the rank group concerned to be moved up or down across the pay boundary.</p>

 Information about whether individuals have registered in more than one constituency is not collected centrally. It has been a longstanding feature of the electoral register that some people are legitimately registered in two places; however, it is an offence, subject to a fine of up to £5,000, to vote more than once at an election for the same body.

We have been clear that EADS must deliver to time, cost and quality.

 The Secretary of State's announcement on 22 July made clear that final decisions regarding the future of the Government offices will be made at the end of the spending review following consideration of consequential issues. As a final decision has not yet been announced, formal consultation has not taken place and has not been brought forward. Officials have met, on an informal basis, with Government office trades union colleagues to jointly plan how best to prepare and respond if the in principle decision to close the network is confirmed. They will continue to work together to ensure that we are best placed to address the people issues that will arise from any final decision to close the GO Network. Any decisions on the redeployment or release of staff will be made once the spending review is complete and GO trades unions will at that point be formally consulted.</p>

 Her Majesty's Courts Service is committed to ensuring that there is an efficient and effective estate portfolio to administer the justice system.

HMRC have specialist teams to deal with avoidance and evasion once it has been identified and referred to them for a response. These are Civil Investigation of Fraud (CIF), Specialist Investigations (SI) and Anti-Avoidance Group (AAG). For most interventions avoidance and evasion are likely to be finally identified, and escalated as necessary, once an intervention has begun, so it is not possible to identify how many compliance officers we have working solely on the responses to these behaviours.

 For reasons of commercial confidentiality HMRC is unable to say how many cosmetic companies and importers were targeted for checks. However, it has undertaken checks in respect of a range of cosmetic products imported from Israel. So far, two duty demands have been issued in 2010 where the accompanying proof of preferential origin showed that the goods were produced in a settlement. HMRC will continue to make regular checks on imports from Israel which receive preference under the EU-Israel agreement.

 HMRC has examined customs import declarations from all companies mentioned in the research paper. There were no imports from a number of the companies. For some of the companies that did export goods to the UK, the proofs of preferential origin covering goods indicated that the goods were produced in Israel. HMRC is returning the proofs concerned to the Israeli authorities for verification of the origin of the goods. HMRC has already issued duty demands for goods imported from four of the companies in the paper whose goods have been established as originating in a settlements location.</p>

 For reasons of commercial confidentiality, HMRC cannot disclose its dealings with specific UK companies.

HMRC therefore supports the work of DEFRA in encouraging supermarkets, under voluntary labelling arrangements, to ensure that their suppliers correctly mark the origin of the produce originating in the settlements.

 There has been a consistent failure of independent European and American studies to confirm the original American study that described the detection of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), a virus related to rodent viruses, in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, sometimes referred to as myalgic encephomyelitis. An expert subgroup of National Expert Panel for New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) met in May 2010, to consider all available evidence about XMRV and conduct a risk assessment. The subgroup concluded that XMRV can infect humans but there is currently no evidence that it causes human disease and that on the evidence before the group, no public health action is required at this time. Since the subgroup meeting in May there has been no new scientific evidence that would change the conclusions of the subgroup but they are keeping it under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="101018w0006.htm_para4"><a name="10101913000077">The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), on the basis of current evidence does not recommend further measures at present but wishes to continue to monitor the situation. The NHS Blood and Transplant and Health Protection Agency study group concur with the views expressed both by NEPNEI and SaBTO but also recognise the need for further research on the prevalence of XMRV in the United Kingdom. In a recent unpublished pilot study conducted by the group a series of 540 randomly selected English blood donors were screened for XMRV and none were found to be infected.</p>

 The public has the right to expect that their doctor is professionally up to date and fit to practise. Revalidation, which is currently being tested in the national health service, will be built on existing local processes of regular appraisal and effective clinical governance. The intention is that every five years, a revalidation recommendation will be made by a doctor's responsible officer to the General Medical Council. From 1 January 2011, subject to parliamentary approval, general practitioners will relate to a responsible officer in the primary care organisation that holds the performers list on which the individual doctor is included as a practitioner of primary medical services. The arrangements for nominating or appointing responsible officers in primary care following the proposed changes to NHS architecture set out in "Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS" are currently being considered by Ministers and officials.</p>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)-A FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
2. Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure:<br>
The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br>
3. OPCS-4 Codes:<br>
The OPCS-4 codes used to identify the procedures are:<br>
(I). Insertion of pacemaker<br>
K60.1 Implantation of intravenous cardiac pacemaker system NEC<br>
K60.5 Implantation of intravenous single chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K60.6 Implantation of intravenous dual chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K60.7 Implantation of intravenous biventricular cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K60.8 Other specified cardiac pacemaker system introduced through vein<br>
K60.9 Unspecified cardiac pacemaker system introduced through vein<br>
K61.1 Implantation of cardiac pacemaker system NEC<br>
K61.5 Implantation of single chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K61.6 Implantation of dual chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K61.7 Implantation of biventricular cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K61.8 Other specified other cardiac pacemaker system<br>
K61.9 Unspecified other cardiac pacemaker system<br>
4. Assessing growth through time:<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br>
5. SHA/PCT of residence:<br>
The strategic health authority (SHA) or primary care trust (PCT) containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br>
6. Data quality:<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 It is currently the responsibility of strategic health authorities (SHAs) to commission nurse education and training. SHAs base their workforce planning on assessment of their local NHS organisations. It is the local national health service organisations that are best placed to determine workforce needs, including demand and location of approved nurse training programmes.</p>

In the UK in 2009, almost one in five individuals accessing HIV-related care were aged 50 years and older, compared to one in seven individuals in 2005 and one in 10 in 2000. This increase is partly explained by the improved life expectancy of adults infected in their 20s, 30s and 40s, as well as those diagnosed soon after infection in the over 50s.</p>

However, quick access to GUM services is important to reduce the spread of infections and we are seeing more people coming forward for testing. In May 2005, only 45% were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. In July 2010, 99.9% were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. This means that more people are being tested and therefore having infections detected, including those aged over 50. It also means that more people than ever before are getting the information and advice they need.</p>

 Over the summer, Treasury officials undertook an internal review of Government support for debt advice to help support ministerial decisions in the context of the spending review. Officials have actively been seeking views and advice from other Government Departments and the debt advice sector, which includes Citizens Advice and other debt advice agencies to draw together evidence for the review.

As part of our wider reforms, we have already taken action to free local colleges and training organisations from unnecessary central controls and bureaucratic burdens so that they can respond quickly and flexibly to the skills needed in their local communities.</p>

 We recently ran a public consultation on the future of the right to request time to train as part of our review of regulations introduced since January. The consultation closed on 15 September. This consultation was actively promoted to all of the employer representative bodies, including the Federation of Small Business, and the TUC, and 147 consultation responses were received. We are now considering the responses before making our recommendation to the Reducing Regulation Committee (RRC). A summary of the consultation will be published by December.</p>

 Our consultation, Skills for Sustainable Growth, which outlined our vision of building an internationally competitive skills base and ensuring we have a skills system that prepares people for work and then to progress, closed on 14 October. Our priorities are to invest in quality, drive up professional standards and compete on high skills. We will publish a full strategy for skills after the Spending Review on 20 October which will set out how we intend to support these priorities.</p>
