<i>Note:</i><P>

The Commission's research programme is set by financial year. Until October 2002, its financial year ran from 1 November to 31 October. The current plans cover a 17-month period from 1 November 2002 to 31 March 2004 because, subject to parliamentary approval, from 2004 its financial year will run from 1 April to 31 March to coincide with that of central and local government.<P>

<a name="30626w01.html_para0">The subject areas covered by these projects include local government, housing, health and criminal justice. The criteria for selecting each project were tailored to the needs of each particular subject area, including the need for the work to be relevant to policy needs and provide good value for money; the likelihood of improvement resulting from the project; and the need to make best use of local knowledge at the national level.

<a name="30626w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Audit Commission has reached the level of the Commission for Racial Equality Standard for Racial Equality; and what percentage of local authorities in England have reached this level.  [115490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The CRE Standard for Racial Equality is specific to the functions of local authorities and has not therefore been adopted by the Audit Commission. The policy of the Commission is to ensure that neither employees nor applicants for employment are discriminated against on the grounds of race, gender or disability.
<P>

<a name="30626w01.html_para1">For 2001&#150;02 the percentages of English authorities reaching levels 0 to 5 of the Commission for Racial Equality's Standard for local government were: 0&#150;32 per cent.; 1&#150;41 per cent.; 2&#150;21 per cent.; 3&#150;6 per cent.; 4&#150;0.3 per cent.; 5&#150;0 per cent.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many complaints his Department has received in the last year relating to <i>(a)</i> the Audit Commission and <i>(b)</i> the average local authority in England.  [115491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2003 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received about 130 letters (not all of which were complaints) relating to the work of the Audit Commission, the auditors or inspectors it appoints, or the bodies audited or inspected. Information on the volume of correspondence received by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister about individual local authorities is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many subscriptions to <i>(a)</i> digital terrestrial, <i>(b)</i> digital satellite and <i>(c)</i> digital cable television are held by the Audit Commission; and what the (i) cost and (ii) purpose is of each subscription.  [115502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Audit Commission holds four subscriptions to digital satellite television at a cost of &#163;1,128 per year per subscription. Each subscription ensures that the commission is kept in touch with developments in news, business and parliamentary affairs relevant to the commission's work. The commission holds no subscriptions to digital terrestrial or digital cable television.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many voluntary leavers there were as a percentage of staff in <i>(a)</i> the Audit Commission and <i>(b)</i> the average local authority in England in the last year for which figures are available.  [115495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 During the year to 31 October 2002 (the end of the Audit Commission's last complete financial year), the percentage of voluntary leavers from the commission was 9.2 per cent. of staff employed. Between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2002 the average percentage of voluntary leavers from English local authorities was 10.9 per cent. of staff employed.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what percentage of waste was recycled and how many kilogrammes of waste were generated per staff member by <i>(a)</i> the Audit Commission and <i>(b)</i> the average local authority in England in each year since 1997.  [115504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Audit Commission's arrangements for managing and recycling their waste is organised locally. The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The commission has adopted a number of approaches to reduce the impact it makes on the environment, including the recycling of waste and the use of stationery from recycled sources.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the responsibilities are of the Business Co-ordination Unit; and if he will make a statement on its <i>(a)</i> aims and <i>(b)</i> performance since 1997.  [115133]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Business Co-Ordination Unit's primary responsibility is to match ministerial visit requests from the business and wider stakeholder community with suitable Ministers. Its aims are to increase ministerial interaction with key stakeholders and customers, including business, local government, national bodies with regional interests and the voluntary and community sectors. The unit was launched in 2000 and received a Charter Mark Award for excellence last December. It achieved more than 300 ministerial visits between 2000 and 2002 that otherwise would not have taken place.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_wqn7"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what council tax business rates relief is available to homes providing residential or nursing care for the elderly.  [116128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 There is no business rates relief available specifically for homes that provide residential or nursing care for the elderly. However, there are existing mandatory and discretionary rate relief available to ratepayers under the rating system and under certain circumstances homes that provide residential and nursing care for the elderly can qualify for these reliefs.
<P>

<a name="30626w01.html_para3">To qualify for mandatory rate relief, the ratepayer must be a charity or a non-profit making body operating as a charity and use the property they occupy wholly or mainly for charitable purposes. Mandatory relief is available at 80 per cent. of the full rates bill, is fully centrally funded and can be topped up to 100 per cent. at the discretion of the local authority. The discretionary top-up is 25 per cent. centrally funded, and local authorities are required to meet 75 per cent. of any such top-up.
<P>

<a name="30626w01.html_para4">Where the property does not qualify for mandatory relief, local authorities can consider the award of discretionary rate relief. To be eligible for consideration, the ratepayer must be a non-profit making body and the property used for social, philanthropic, educational or religious purposes. Local authorities have the discretionary power to grant up to 100 per cent. rate relief to certain non-profit making bodies. 75 per cent. of the cost of all discretionary reliefs is met centrally, with the local authority, and through them, the council taxpayer meeting the remaining 25 per cent.. However, whether or not a particular ratepayer would qualify for this rate relief would depend on whether it meets the qualifying criteria set by the local authority.
<P>

<a name="30626w01.html_para5">There are no council tax discounts or exemptions available for care homes that provide residential or nursing care for the elderly. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister included provisions in the Local Government Bill currently before Parliament giving local authorities the power to grant their own discounts and exemptions. This could include care homes if the local authority wished.

<a name="30626w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Coal Field Regeneration Trust's current funding agreement for England continues until March 2005. Decisions on funding beyond that date will be taken in the light of it's continued good performance and evidence of the beneficial impact of the Trust on the coalfield communities.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what contingency plans he has for consultation and legislation on transitional relief schemes in the event of a revaluation of properties for council tax purposes.  [114979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services", published in December 2001, said that

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ahead of revaluation we shall devise a transitional scheme in which those who gain from the revaluation will contribute to the costs of the losers".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30626w02.html_para0">The Local Government Bill contains provision for the establishment of such a transition scheme and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consult on proposals for a transitional relief scheme ahead of revaluation. It is still far too early to say what effect the proposed 2007 revaluation will have on council tax bills and therefore what kind of transition scheme there might be.

[114980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 In paragraph 367 of the explanatory notes to the Local Government Bill the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates that the cost of the proposed revaluation of domestic properties is in the region of &#163;200 million including the cost of handling appeals. This is very broad estimate because the cost will be affected by the methods used and decisions on this have not yet been taken.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is pleased that following further discussions between the FBU and the employers the FBU Executive has decided to recommend the employers' final offer to its members. It is for the FBU to decide whether or not to hold a secret ballot of their members on this offer, but we would welcome any decision of theirs to do so. Firefighters should be in no doubt that the employers' final offer of a 16 per cent. pay increase over three years, linked to modernisation, is a generous offer and at the absolute limit of what the employers can afford.

 The Government have always said it hoped that the Golden Jubilee Medals would be given to eligible firefighters by the end of June 2003 as originally planned.

No distinction is being made between those that have, and have not, participated in industrial action.

<a name="30626w02.html_para2">The National Graduate Development Programme (NGDP) is run by the Employers Organisation (EO), one of the LGA's central bodies providing services to local authorities. The scheme was launched in 2002 to fund 50 applicants for that year. It was remarkably oversubscribed with 2,350 applications. The EO has made immediate plans to double the intake for this year, and is considering how best to increase the numbers for the future.
<P>

 A range of issues affects the results of elections, and the performance of a council will be a significant factor for many local people. Comprehensive Performance Assessments (CPAs) are now beginning to provide clear and consistent information to local people, as well as to councils and central Government, on the performance of local government. All county councils and single tier authorities were assessed under the CPA process in the past year. District councils will be assessed in the course of the next 18 months. Half of the councils which have received a CPA were subject to elections in May this year.
<P>

<a name="30626w03.html_para1">The trend between the 2002 CPA categories and 2003 local government election results tends to support the view that the performance of the council has an influence on the outcome of the election. 45 per cent. of weak and poor councils where elections were held changed overall control.

 Low turnout in elections is caused by a number of different factors, and no single solution will solve it. However, one of the most important ways in which we can help is to make voting more straightforward and accessible to all voters. In conjunction with the independent Electoral Commission and Local Government Association, we are promoting a programme of electoral pilots to test new methods of voting, which are aimed at increasing the opportunity for voting. These include various electronic voting techniques (including the use of the internet, telephone, SMS text messaging and interactive digital television), as well as all-postal ballots.

<a name="30626w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is fully engaged in the Cabinet Office-led capabilities programme, and all resilience work is co-ordinated within that programme. The central response capability focuses on mechanisms such as business continuity planning which assure that Government departments can function and respond effectively to a no-notice crisis. The local response capability focuses on mechanisms which allow local authorities and emergency services to plan and respond to serious disruption, while the site clearance capability aims to create an action plan for the handling of rabble and site clearance. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has specific responsibilities as lead Government Department for the regional response and site clearance capabilities, and contributes to the development of other capabilities as necessary. Under the central response capability, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister did not incur any specific additional spend during 2002&#150;03, and has budgeted for &#163;1 million in 2003&#150;04. On the local responses and site clearance capabilities, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister spent &#163;2,072,412 during 2002&#150;03, and has budgeted for &#163;4.5 million in 2003&#150;04. With regard to the other areas the hon. Member has raised, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is either not directly involved in those workstreams or has incurred no spend.
<P>

<a name="30626w04.html_para0">The capabilities that we are working to deliver have been developed to allow the Government to deal with the widest range of scenarios. Should a specific additional urgent operational need arise, at any point of the spending cycle, action would be taken to meet it. The public expenditure framework the Government have put in place provides the flexibility to deal with unexpected pressures.

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) must be completed for all policy proposals that have a potential impact on businesses, charities or the voluntary sector. It includes details of the arrangements for monitoring and evaluating policy proposals and their impact.

<P>

<a name="30626w06.html_para0">Information on the number of RIAs that have been reviewed in respect of the Department in the last year is not held.
<P>

<a name="30626w06.html_para1">From this year the National Audit Office (NAO) has a new role in independently evaluating a selection of RIAs. In their Annual Report, published in February 2003,the Better Regulation Task Force put forward suggestions of RIAs for the NAO to review.
<P>

<a name="30626w06.html_para2">The NAO review will focus on the quality of analysis in the RIAs and the thoroughness with which the RIAs have been undertaken. The findings and recommendations of best practice will be fed back to departments. It will play a valuable part in driving up standards of RIAs.

<P>

<a name="30626w06.html_para3">All those regions which have a Board in place have held initial meetings and made plans for future meetings. Preparation of regional sports strategies will be a priority for all of the regions as well as making strong partnerships with other regional agencies/organisations.

 The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has not received a worked-up application from the National Trust (NT) for what they propose to do at Tyntesfield although at the time of making the NHMF award to Tyntesfield, the Board approved in principle a further grant award from HLF subject to the receipt and favourable assessment of a fully worked-up application which meets HLF's priorities. The NT is currently working-up this application in accordance with standard HLF procedures. As part of this process a series of meetings and discussions have taken place between HLF and NT staff regarding the shape, timetable and content of their bid. HLF expect to receive an application in December this year.

 Since March 2002, the Department has had in place a series of measures designed to tackle the disease risks posed by illegal imports of all types of meat and animal products. The number of illegal imports seized in 2002&#150;03 rose to three times the number made in the previous year, reflecting increased enforcement activity and better evidence-based targeting.
<P>

<a name="30626w06.html_para15">Additional resources for the coming years, together with the improved enforcement and intelligence capability provided by HM Customs and Excise, should ensure that this work is consolidated and built upon. HM Customs are setting up four mobile detection teams to target meat and animal products, and will be increasing the number of detector dog teams to six during the current financial year.

 A decision to bring a prosecution before the Courts is a matter for the enforcement authority. For imports of meat covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES), this is HM Customs and Excise. For other offences regarding illegal imports of meat and animal products, responsibility lay with Local Authorities until 11 April, when this was taken over by HM Customs.
<P>

<a name="30626w06.html_para18">HM Customs and Excise have prosecuted three people in the last four years for CITES offences involving "bushmeat". Two were convicted, and one was acquitted but convicted under a separate animal health charge.

 The Government regard the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety as an important international agreement governing the handling and movement of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Once in force, it will provide a common basis for all countries of the world to take informed decisions about imports and exports of any GMOs that may affect wildlife and natural habitats. Most of the UK's obligations under the Protocol have been, or are being, implemented at European Community level. The Community legal framework for the Protocol is expected to be completed later this month with the adoption of measures governing exports of GMOs. Adoption of these measures will demonstrate that the UK is fully able to meet its obligations under the Protocol and will enable the necessary national ratification procedures to be completed shortly thereafter.

 Public contracting authorities, including local authorities, must comply in full with UK public procurement regulations when awarding contracts for the supply of food. The regulations implement EU Directives on procurement that are designed to ensure that public sector contracts are awarded following transparent competitions that do not unfairly exclude suppliers from outside the UK. Even

<a name="30626w07.html_para4">It is a common misconception that the EU Directives work against local producers and growers. There are legitimate ways and means for public contracting authorities to increase the opportunities that local producers have for competing for public sector contracts. One of the most effective measures is to ensure that the quality of food specified takes into account food production and processing standards that result in safe, healthy nutritious food and ensure that adverse environmental impacts are reduced as much as possible.

 Assaulting a public sector worker in the course of his or her duty is an extremely serious matter, as reflected in guidelines issued by the Magistrates' Association. Magistrates court guidelines already make clear that when an assault is against a "victim serving the public", it should be considered as an aggravating factor. The Criminal Justice Bill contains provisions on sentencing and sets up a new Sentencing Guidelines Council, charged with drafting and distributing a new set of consolidated sentencing guidelines applicable across all criminal courts. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure consistency and to require the courts to take account of all the relevant aggravating or mitigating features. The guidelines could, and we expect will, refer explicitly to the fact that if a victim was at the time of the offence working with the public, it should be treated as an aggravating feature of the crime. We have no current plans to introduce specific offences for attacks on public sector workers.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2003]</i>: For the most recent financial year (2002&#150;03), the Department's expenditure on sponsorships, grants and other financial assistance for the biotechnology industry sector in the UK was approximately &#163;18 million.
<P>

<a name="30626w09.html_para0">The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) spent approximately &#163;81 million on biotechnology in 2001&#150;02. Further information is available in the BBSRC's "Annual Report and Accounts 2001&#150;2002".

<P>

<a name="30626w09.html_para2">It is not possible to give precise information, due to the lack of a generally accepted definition of biotechnology and the differences in the ways individual Research Councils analyse their annual expenditure.

 Subscribers should not have to pay to be removed from fax marketing mailing lists and existing regulations already give subscribers the right to opt out of this form of marketing free of charge. Under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999, no one may send an unsolicited direct marketing fax to any subscriber who has been registered with the Fax Preference Service (the FPS) for at least 28 days, or who has previously instructed the sender not to fax them. There is no fee for registering with the FPS and this can be done by phone, fax, post or e-mail.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25 June 2003]:</i> The GATS process is based on a positive list, bottom up approach. Countries decide for themselves in which sectors and to what extent they wish to liberalise. Therefore, it will be for them to assess if potential costs will outweigh potential benefits. However, HMG recognises that developing countries require support in this assessment, and this is why the Department for International Development is co-ordinating with the World bank and UNCTAD to conduct research in this area, which will help inform the position of developing countries in the negotiations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25 June 2003]:</i> Some existing WTO Agreements, for example, the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, contain rules which may affect the way Governments offer incentives to invest in their country or specific sectors, but these rules do not form a complete set of multilateral rules governing investment. WTO agreements apply only to measures taken by

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of ISO 9000 certified companies have <i>(a)</i> transferred and <i>(b)</i> are in the process of transferring to ISO 9001:2000; and what plans there are to encourage UK companies and their suppliers to do so before the deadline.  [120287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 My Department does not collect information on the numbers of UK businesses certified to the ISO 9000 standards but contacts with certification bodies indicate that approximately 50 per cent. of certified UK businesses have transferred to ISO 9001:2000 and a further 25 per cent. are in the process of transferring. The ISO 9000 standards are voluntary and it is a matter for the companies involved to make any changes to their quality management systems to meet the requirements of ISO 9001:2000. My Department has, however, been providing general advice on the new standard and certification bodies have been encouraging UK businesses to transfer to ISO 9001:2000 since it was adopted in December 2000.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Watson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment her Department has made of the number of companies in the UK which are ISO 9000 certified; how many are certified by UKAS accredited companies in the UK; what reports the Government have received that some have been certified inappropriately; and what percentage her Department estimates have been certified inappropriately.  [120288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 My Department does not collect information on businesses certified to ISO 9000. However, figures produced by the International Standards Organisation indicate that in, December 2001, there were 66,760 ISO 9000 certifications in the UK. Neither my Department nor UKAS collect information on the number of UK businesses certified to ISO 9000 by UKAS accredited companies. My Department is made aware from time to time of certifications which might be deemed inappropriate for various reasons (for example because the certifier is unaccredited and the certificate is not accepted in the market as a result) but keeps no record of the precise numbers of such cases.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Watson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the Government's policy is on change of ISO 9000 certification to the latest version of ISO 9001:2000.  [120289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w09.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 All ISO standards are reviewed at least every five years to ensure they continue to meet the needs of business and industry. ISO 9001:2000 is the 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2003 : Column 927W</I><P>
most recent version of the ISO 9000 series of quality management systems and has been produced by quality and industry experts working under the aegis of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). From 15 December 2003 it is the intention of the certification organisations only to issue certificates against the new standard. It is a matter for individual businesses to decide whether to be certified against the new standard.
<P>

<a name="30626w09.html_para9">However, ISO 9001:2000 is intended to reflect modern management approaches and the experience gained in industry and commerce over the past 25 years, with the focus moving from compliance to achieving results, and as such it is welcomed by the government. We hope that businesses will use the new standard to improve their productivity and competitiveness and that as many as possible will transfer to the new standard.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when BNFL plans to return high level nuclear waste from reprocessing foreign spent fuel back to customer countries; what facilities exist at Sellafield to store on an interim basis treated wastes; and whether she has received commitments from all foreign customers that they are prepared to accept the repatriation of their wastes.  [119489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The arrangements for the return of high level nuclear wastes (HLW) are a commercial matter between BNFL and its overseas customers, subject to meeting the appropriate regulatory requirements. All new reprocessing contracts signed since 1976 have included return of waste provisions and in signing such contracts overseas customers have accepted that wastes can be returned.
<P>

<a name="30626w10.html_para0">The HLW arising from reprocessing is conditioned, by vitrification, into a solid form suitable for safe long term storage and transportation.

 I understand that Oftel looks at any issues of anti-competitive behaviour in the pricing of telecommunications services, such as the use of non-off or repeated special offers, on a case by case basis. Any examination of such issues will be carried out within the framework of relevant legislation such as the Competition Act 1998 or the Telecommunications Act 1984. Oftel will look at issues relating to special offers if specific complaints are made to it or if it believes there is a competition issue which it needs to investigate on its own initiative.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether there is a statutory duty for Oftel to respond to formal complaints from alternative operators regarding uncompetitive practices from competitors; and what is the maximum time permitted for Oftel to deal with a complaint.  [121528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Section 49 of the Telecommunication Act 1984 imposes a duty on the Director General of Telecommunications to consider any non-frivolous representations made to him. Under the provisions of the Competition Act 1998, he has discretion as to whether or not to take action on a complaint brought to him.

 There is a sizeable body of law, which gives consumers protection in respect to both civil and criminal matters. Within this framework, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and Trading Standards services enforce a wide range of legislation aimed at protecting all consumers. Some of this legislation is directed at practices more likely to affect vulnerable consumers. Through the Enterprise Act we have strengthened the enforcement of consumer protection legislation by making it possible for enforcers to seek a Stop Now Order against a trader acting unlawfully in respect of a wide range of legislative infringements, which harm the collective interests of consumers. These provisions came into force on 20 June 2003.
<P>

<a name="30626w10.html_para5">The Enterprise Act empowers the OFT to formally approve and promote voluntary codes of practice that meet its challenging core criteria and, if necessary, withdraw that approval publicly if a code is found to be not operating satisfactorily.

 Low-wave radar is not a term that my Department recognises. Surface wave or surface duct radar may achieve "over the horizon" ranges, but has little application to commercial shipping. There are no discussions with European counterparts on this matter at this time.

 The International Crisis Group report on the constitutional process in Afghanistan highlights a number of important issues that will affect the integrity of the constitutional process, including the importance of ensuring adequate security to allow the Afghan people to participate freely. However, the report contains several factual errors to which the United Nations has drawn attention, and inaccurately portrays both the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the international community as being insufficiently committed to the constitutional process. The British Government continues to support both the Afghan Transitional Administration and UNAMA in their efforts to support the constitution-making process, including by helping to fund the popular consultation on the constitution which is currently under way.

These pilots were in Honduras (electricity reform), Mozambique (fuel tax), Uganda (export promotion), Rwanda (macro policy), Armenia (water policy), Indonesia (rice tariff) and Orissa State India (public finances).

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) must be completed for all policy proposals that have a potential impact on businesses, charities or the voluntary sector. It includes details of the arrangements for monitoring and evaluating policy proposals and their impact.

<a name="30626w16.html_para5">From this year, the National Audit Office (NAO) has a new role in independently evaluating a selection of RIAs. In their Annual Report, published in February 2003, the Better Regulation Task Force put forward suggestions of RIAs for the NAO to review.

<a name="30626w16.html_para6">The NAO review will focus on the quality of analysis in the RIAs and the thoroughness with which the RIAs have been undertaken. The findings and recommendations of best practice will be fed back to departments. It will play a valuable part in driving up standards of RIAs.

 My right hon. Friend has no power to compel a local education authority to increase its actual school budget. His reserve power under the School Standards and Framework Act to set a minimum schools budget for an authority applies where he considers that the authority's proposed schools budget for the following year, as notified to the Secretary of State by 31 January, is inadequate.

<P>
<a name="30626w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills is working in partnership with LEA and school representatives to identify changes that need to be made to the funding system for 2004&#150;05 so that all schools can expect to receive a reasonable per pupil settlement in that year.
<P>

<a name="30626w16.html_para7">Headteachers are represented at these discussions. We will be discussing how best to ensure sufficient funding increases for every LEA; the right balance between support through general grant and through ring-fenced and targeted grant; confidence that schools and pupils will receive the money intended for them; the right balance between school and LEA central provision; that variations in the budget increases received by different schools within each LEA are appropriate and fair; and that workforce reform, in line with the National Agreement, can be sustained. We will aim to ensure that changes are in place in good time to allow LEAs and schools to plan for 2004&#150;05 and so provide increased predictability and stability in school funding.

 Since 1997 we have been supporting schools and Local Education Authorities through funding a range of local and national initiatives to tackle truancy and improve school attendance, including the dissemination of school attendance guidance, a series of practitioner conferences and funding for the introduction of electronic registration systems into over 500 schools to track and manage absence.

<a name="30626w17.html_para0">As part of the three year &#163;470 million Behaviour and Attendance strategy, targeted support is now being provided for schools with some of the greatest challenges to meet in improving behaviour and attendance. 700 schools are currently covered and this will extend to a further 1,900 schools by 2005. In addition the strategy will support all secondary schools with behaviour and attendance training and audits which will be available from September. Local Education Authorities with higher than expected levels of truancy are being provided with additional expert support to impact on school attendance rates.
<P>

<a name="30626w17.html_para1">We have also co-ordinated national truancy sweeps in consultation with schools, Local Education Authorities and the police, and we have issued guidance on the operation of truancy sweeps. The last nationally co-ordinated truancy sweeps took place over three weeks last month involving all police forces in England and a further round is planned for the autumn. At local level truancy sweeps are now a regular feature in most Local Education Authorities and they are planned and conducted in partnership with schools, the police and other bodies such as Connexions and Youth Offending Teams.

<a name="30626w17.html_para5">Formula Spending Shares are not grant, nor are they the Government's assessment of how much an authority should spend on a particular service, they are simply the formula used to calculate an authority's Revenue Support Grant. Funding for social services (as for all other services) is largely funded through redistributed business rates, Revenue Support Grant and council tax. The amount of funding each social service department receives is determined by the local authority taking into account local priorities. Revenue Support Grant is an unhypothecated block grant that may be spent on any service.

<a name="30626w18.html_wqn1"><B> Andrew Selous: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if she will make a statement on her policy on prosecuting offences relating to fly tipping.  [121691]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30626w18.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Environment Agencies and local authorities are responsible for these prosecutions. There is no specific offence of fly tipping and offences are usually prosecuted as illegal disposal of waste contrary to Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<P>

<a name="30626w18.html_para1">There are challenges in prosecuting offences of fly tipping as, for example, it can be difficult to obtain the evidence necessary to prosecute. However, the government positively encourages prosecuting agencies to take strong enforcement action and prosecute offenders because fly-tipping is a serious environmental crime.

<P>
<a name="30626w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Disability Employment Advisers (DEAs) have a key role under Jobcentre Plus, both in providing direct support for those disabled people and employers who need their specialist expertise and in supporting other advisers. To ensure better integration with other services, DEAs are now the responsibility of Jobcentre Plus District Managers.
<P>

<a name="30626w18.html_para5">In addition, our Green Paper "Pathways to Work" (CM 5690) outlined proposals to pilot new teams of specialist advisers to support those on incapacity benefits, building upon best practice within Jobcentre Plus.

 The number of jobs created in the UK in the past 12 months which can be characterised as enduring for longer than one year is not available.

 Recent labour market developments reflect continued steady growth in employment, up by 51,000 in the last three months and 242,000 over the last year. The increase in employment has been matched by a rise in the labour force brought about by population growth and higher activity rates. As a result unemployment has been broadly flat, though it has been fluctuating from month to month around this flat trend.
<P>

<a name="30626w20.html_para1">ILO unemployment currently stands at 1.495 million. The ILO unemployment rate is 5.1 per cent., up 0.1 percentage points in the last three months, but down by the same amount over the last year. The number of

<P>

<a name="30626w20.html_para2">The Government's approach is based on macro-economic stability combined with active labour market measures to help jobless people, particularly the most disadvantaged, get back into work. Steady economic growth and policies such as New Deal have contributed to a rise of 1.5 million in the number of people in work since 1997, while long-term unemployment has fallen by 75 per cent. to a historically low level.

 HSE's operational directorates and divisions deal with a wide range of workplaces, both fixed and transient, across several employment sectors. This requires HSE to adopt different approaches based on understanding of hazards and risks and the performance of duty holders. Higher risk sites and high hazard sites where there is potential for catastrophic events are visited more frequently than lower risk sites which might be visited infrequently. The lowest risk sites might be contacted through other means than visits such as seminars and mailshots.

<a name="30626w20.html_para6">In addition, local authorities have inspection responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 for approximately 1.2 million premises in the retail, finance and leisure sectors.. Intervention strategies are based on assessments of intrinsic hazard and risk and judgments about the competence and willingness of duty holders to control risks and comply with the law. Intervals between visits will vary substantially between sectors and between duty holders within each sector. For these reasons it is not possible to provide a meaningful average for the frequency of visits.
