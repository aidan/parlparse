 The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (AFPS 75) increased the rate of widows&#146; and widowers&#146; pension from one third of the member&#146;s pension to one half, from 31 March 1973. Individuals serving on or after this date were provided with the opportunity to make additional contributions so as to qualify former service for the half rate of widows&#146; pension. On this basis, it would be difficult, in equity, to extend the half rate pension to widows whose husbands had left the service before that date, and who had not, as a result, contributed financially towards the improvement.

 Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most off-track against the water and sanitation targets. The European Union (EU) is addressing this problem and last year disbursed nearly &#163;1 billion to the water sector in Africa. The EU Africa Working Group (AWG) works with the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) to improve the effectiveness of this aid. The European Commission recognises that improvements can be made to the way the AWG is structured and recently carried out an internal evaluation of the group that concluded that its roles, responsibilities and procedures need clarifying. The AWG has responded by agreeing to redesign the Project Logical Framework, so that the roles of all stakeholders are more clearly identified and the activities of the group can be more closely monitored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90316w0005.htm_para5"><a name="09031619000587">The Department for International Development (DFID) is this year co-chairing the AWG with AMCOW. This has led to a strengthened engagement with African partners and donors to ensure that future aid provided to Africa more closely matches the needs of those countries to meet the water and sanitation targets. Other progress has also been made by the AWG, notably the development of the Africa-EU Statement on Sanitation that supports the eTekwini Declaration on Sanitation signed by 32 African Ministers in Durban in February 2008. Strong and clear commitments were given by African leaders to give higher priority to sanitation, make further funds available and take concrete action to meet the MDG target.</p>

 The Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) approach to strengthening health systems seeks to diagnose critical problems and identify needs for strengthening in each country. This enables us to design the best response and set appropriate priorities, including assessing the needs of women and girls, their use of services and any barriers they face. There may be a need for targeted services or approaches to reach specific groups, such as reproductive health services for adolescent girls. DFID also recognises that monitoring the implementation and results of health systems strengthening needs a gender dimension to see if strategies are working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90316w0006.htm_para4"><a name="09031619000613">Progress on strengthening health systems in poor countries is also vital if we are to accelerate progress towards achieving the maternal health millennium development goal. This is why, along with UN health agencies and a wide range of donors and country partners, DFID has championed the International Health Partnership designed to strengthen health systems and improve in-country donor coordination. To help ensure that investments in health systems reach women and children we are working with countries to help remove barriers that stop poor people using health services. This includes support to countries to remove health user fees so that services for children and pregnant women are free at the point of use.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 2 March 2009]: </i>The White Paper, &#145;Raising expectations and increasing support&#146;, announced measures to smooth the transition to employment and support allowance for existing incapacity benefit customers by starting to align their benefit rates with employment and support allowance rates from April 2009. To begin the process of achieving alignment with employment and support allowance, those on contributory incapacity benefit with an age addition, including former invalidity benefit customers, will see their overall benefit increased in April 2009 by half of the Rossi index<sup>(1)</sup>, rather than by the full Rossi index. Customers in receipt of severe disablement allowance with an age addition will receive an increase equivalent to the full Rossi increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90316w0011.htm_para10"><a name="09031635000123">In 2009-10 there will be an estimated 660,000 customers receiving incapacity benefit with age additions<sup>(2)</sup>. As a result of the White Paper changes, from April 2009 the benefit rate for these cases will be on average &#163;3.20 per week higher than in 2008-09, an increase of 3.4 per cent.<sup>(3)</sup> For example, those on incapacity benefit with the higher age addition, and no other additions, will see their benefit increase from &#163;102.25 per week in 2008-09 to &#163;105.45 per week in 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="90316w0011.htm_para11"><a name="09031635000124">Despite the increase in benefit rates for people with age additions, the total expenditure on these cases is expected to fall by nearly &#163;180 million from 2008-09 to 2009-10 due to an expected reduction in the number of people claiming incapacity benefits<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>

 There are Muslim schools in both the independent and maintained sectors. We do not collect information about the sources of direct or indirect funding for independent schools. Maintained faith schools receive recurrent funding from their local authority although this can be topped up from other sources, for example where there are extended school activities. Voluntary aided maintained schools usually receive 90 per cent. of funding for capital work from the Department and provide 10 per cent. themselves. The Department does not record the source of funding for the 10 per cent. contribution, or any other contributions towards voluntary aided capital projects.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 February 2009]:</i> Our guidance &#145;Safe to Learn&#146; provides specific advice to schools on complaints procedures for parents. It recommends that the first contact point to report concerns about bullying should be the class teacher or form teacher. The guidance provides a sample anti-bullying information sheet to be sent to parents, which could include a named contact for reporting concerns about bullying. We introduced legal provisions in the 2006 Education Act which gave school staff new powers to discipline pupils for bad behaviour outside the school gate. We have asked the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to work with local authorities and schools to ensure the &#145;Safe to Learn&#146; guidance is effectively implemented on the ground, and that schools make effective use of the other materials.</p>

 Initiatives to bring empty homes back into use are, rightly, channelled through local authorities who are best placed to assess what measures are appropriate to their local circumstances. In the first instance, we encourage local authorities to work with owners to persuade them of the benefits of bringing their property back into use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="90316w0014.htm_para0"><a name="09031639000214">However, where it is clear that owners are not prepared to co-operate with efforts to get their property occupied through agreement, we have provided enforcement powers to deal with them. Key powers are compulsory purchase and enforced sale which were added to by the Housing Act 2004 which introduced a new power for local authorities to make Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) in respect of long-term empty homes. An EDMO allows a local authority to take over the management of an unoccupied dwelling in certain circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="90316w0014.htm_para1"><a name="09031639000215">We are keen for local authorities to make use of EDMOs, where appropriate, and are supporting the independent Empty Homes Agency&#146;s new guidance on EDMOs, which was launched on 10 March.

1. The East of England SHA was formed in 2006-07 by a merger of Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire; Essex; and Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Figures for 2003-04 to 2005-06 are therefore the combined figures of these three SHAs.<br>
2. Finished admission episodes: a finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
3. Primary diagnosis: the primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
4. The ICD-10 codes used to identify heart attacks are as follows; I21&#151;Acute myocardial infarction and I22&#151;Subsequent myocardial infarction.<br>
5. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: these figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a HES record.<br>
6. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the NHS in England. The NHS Information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

<i> [holding answer 12 March 2009]:</i> This Government have rescued and expanded the apprenticeship programme. We will meet our target of 130,000 completions by 2010/11. Completions have more than trebled since 2001/02, from 39,000 to 113,000 in 2007/08. This means that over the 10-year period from 2001/02, to the end of the CSR period in 2010/11, around 900,000 young people and adults will have successfully completed their apprenticeship. Completion rates also reached an all-time high in 2007/08 of 64 per cent., compared to 48 per cent. in 2005/06. By 2020 we aim to deliver over 250,000 apprenticeship starts and 190,000 successful completions in order to meet the Leitch ambition for apprenticeships in England. We are on track to meet this ambition with a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007/08.</p>

 The Union Learning Fund does not provide funding to trade unions to promote awareness of trade union members' right to opt out of political funds. Its primary objective is to help trade unions and their Union Learning Representatives drive up the demand for learning in the workplace.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Because of rounding, figures may not add up to totals shown.<br>
2. he figures quoted are not provided under National Statistics protocols and have been derived from local management information and are therefore provisional and subject to change.<br>
3. Figures are rounded to nearest 5.<br>
<i> Caveats:</i><br>
The figures do not equate to the number of individual nationals who were granted permits because they include those applications approved to extend or amend an existing permit or where the individual has moved to another job with a different employer. Not all those who were granted a permit took up the job and some may have been refused entry clearance or further leave to remain.<br>

 Government&#146;s spending priorities are not, in general, determined by the way in which the money is raised. Hypothecating revenues to particular spending programmes imparts inflexibility in spending decisions and can lead to a misallocation of resources, with reduced value for money for taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90316w0027.htm_para6"><a name="09031644000166">However, the Government recognise the need for investment in low carbon energy and other technologies, and their policy framework is already driving significant activity in this sector, for example, through the renewables obligation and the Environmental Transformation Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="90316w0027.htm_para8"><a name="09031644000168">In addition to the directive, EU member states have made a non-legally binding commitment to spend at least half of the revenues from auctioning to tackle climate change both in the EU and in developing countries. This will include reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, reducing deforestation and developing renewable technologies. The Government are content with this approach, which we believe will provide a strong signal of the EU&#146;s willingness to invest in a low carbon economy and offer support to the international community ahead of negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90316w0028.htm_para1"><a name="09031644000185">The Government recognise that not all cancer patients will necessarily be fuel poor or entitled to receive assistance aimed at those most vulnerable to fuel poverty. However, where those cancer patients are in receipt of benefits&#151;whether income or pension related, with children under 16 or on disability living allowance, this will qualify them for additional heating and energy efficiency help under the Warm Front Scheme, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90316w0028.htm_para3"><a name="09031644000187">Older people are targeted as they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather during the winter months and of course the winter fuel payment helps older people with cancer to pay their fuel bills. This year the payment is &#163;250 to over 60s and &#163;400 to over 80s.</p>

 The Department publishes data on fuel poverty annually. The data used to calculate fuel poverty estimates for England come from the English House Condition Survey (EHCS), compiled by Communities and Local Government (CLG), and energy price information, published by DECC. The EHCS collects data on features of each dwelling, including fuel sources and efficiency measures, which enable energy required to achieve the adequate standard of warmth to be derived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90316w0028.htm_para4"><a name="09031644000190">The EHCS also collects information on householders, such as their income. Combining required energy consumption with prices and incomes, each dwelling covered in the survey is classified as either fuel poor or not, and the results aggregated to produce data for the whole of England. The EHCS additionally contains a range of other data that allow DECC to split fuel poverty by various other measures, for example, age of householders, type of dwelling, etc.</p>

 The enforcing authorities in respect of the HIPS provisions are local weights and measures authorities, typically trading standards services. The OFT is not an enforcer and has no powers under the Act. The OFT cannot direct local authorities as to the priority they give or level of enforcement activity they take in relation to compliance with the HIP provisions. However, the Act requires that where a penalty charge notice (PCN) is issued the local authority informs the OFT. This is because the OFT has a duty, as the national regulator for estate agents, to consider the fitness of a person to be allowed to work as an estate agent and to take appropriate action, including warning or banning an agent, where their conduct falls short of legal requirements. The OFT would consider the receipt of a PCN as part of that process and a &#147;trigger&#148; to consider fitness under the Estate Agents Act 1979.</p>

 In the 2008 White Paper on Lords reform, the Government confirmed that in a wholly elected second chamber there would be no reserved seats for Church of England Bishops or for any other group. However, the position of the Church of England is that of the Church by law established, with the Sovereign as its Supreme Governor. The presence of Bishops in the House of Lords reflects the relationship between Crown, Parliament and the Church. The Government propose, therefore, that if there is to be an appointed element in a reformed second chamber, then there should be a number of seats reserved for Church of England Bishops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="90316w0032.htm_para1"><a name="09031646000154">The White Paper also proposed that the Appointments Commission should encourage applications from church and faith leaders as it likely that many would be strong candidates for appointment.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 10 March 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> column 249W. Establishments operate a policy that young adult remands (18 to 21-year-olds) do not cell share with adult remands. Remanded young adults are either placed into dedicated young offender institutes or into local &#145;adult&#146; prisons. Where accommodation is within the main adult estate, young adults do not share with adults.</p>

 The consultation on the statutory code of practice governing use of the Youth Conditional Caution (YCC) for 16 and 17-year-olds was launched on 2 March 2009 and will run until 25 May 2009. Subject to parliamentary approval of the secondary legislation required to implement the YCC, we propose to begin pilots for 16 and 17-year-olds later in 2009. The process to identify pilot areas will begin shortly: publication of the draft code of practice gives potential pilot areas a clearer understanding of what piloting the YCC will involve. We will monitor the pilots closely to ensure that the YCC is used only in appropriate circumstances and that persistent offenders and those committing more serious crimes are dealt with by the courts.</p>

 In the Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008, we asked for views on how to increase the engagement of parents in the Youth Justice System, including whether measures of compulsion should be used. The Government response to this consultation is due for publication in the spring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="90316w0034.htm_para2"><a name="09031646000597">Many of the initiatives in the Youth Crime Action Plan ensure increased involvement of parents when young people are at risk of offending or have offended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="90316w0034.htm_para3"><a name="09031646000598">For example, we have committed to ensuring that families with children most likely to become prolific offenders benefit from better targeting of existing services, and to increase the reach of intensive family interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="90316w0034.htm_para4"><a name="09031646000599">We are also working to increase the take up of parenting support when a child is at risk of offending or has offended, by improving training provision for parenting workers, and reminding sentencers of the effectiveness of making parenting orders. We want all parents who would benefit from support to be offered it, and for those who need it but do not engage voluntarily the support should be non-negotiable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="90316w0034.htm_para5"><a name="09031646000600">In addition, under Operation Staysafe (due to take place in 69 areas in 2009-10), child protection legislation is used by police to remove young people on the streets at night who are at risk of offending or becoming a victim. Young people are not simply returned to their homes. Parents are required to collect them from a place of safety, to drive home the message that parents must be engaged in relation to their child&#146;s risk of offending behaviour.</p>
