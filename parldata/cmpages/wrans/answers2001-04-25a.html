To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the average time that people who apply for a national insurance number must wait before <i>(a)</i> being given an appointment with the Benefits Agency and <i>(b)</i> receiving a national insurance number.  [158676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The information on the average time that people who apply for a national insurance number (NINO) must wait before being given an appointment with the Benefits Agency is not held.
<P>

<a name="10425w01.html_para0">After a customer is interviewed by the Benefits Agency, the length of time he/she has to wait to receive their NINO depends on whether the application is for benefit or employment purposes.
<P>

<a name="10425w01.html_para1">With the introduction of the enhanced NINO process in April 2001 the Benefits Agency is responsible for notifying the customer of their NINO by letter after all inquiries have been completed.

 <i>[holding answer 24 April 2001]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 9 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 359W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). The commercial shipbuilding contracts for the two ships to be built by Harland and Wolff have been taken over by the Ministry of Defence. These contracts will be managed on our behalf by AWSR Shipping Ltd.
<P>

<a name="10425w01.html_para3">Negotiations on the Private Finance Initiative contract for the full Strategic Sealift service are proceeding and we expect to place a contract shortly. As a result of the adoption of a parallel build programme in two yards, it is planned that the full Strategic Sealift capability will be available by 2003, some two years ahead of the planned in-service date. Until then, a provisional service is being managed by MOD, providing an enhanced level of sealift compared to that previously available.

<P>
<a name="10425w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Quentin Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the maximum output of fast jet pilots is from RAF Valley per year.  [157721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 April 2001]:</i> Over the next four years RAF Valley is tasked to provide places for 102 fast jet pilot students per year to meet the current RAF Valley output target of 80 pilots per year. The output target is determined by the future front-line manning requirements and is reviewed regularly. The RAF Valley output target has recently been increased as the result of such a review.
<P>

<a name="10425w01.html_para4">Capacity is greater than output as not all students achieve the full range of skills necessary to complete fast jet training. Those that do not are usually restreamed into rotary wing or multi-engine roles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 April 2001]:</i> The location of the final assembly line for the A400M is primarily a matter for Airbus Military Company. The company will be contracted to deliver aircraft on the basis of a "commercial approach" which makes maximum use of existing supply chains and centres of excellence. Just as Airbus UK is the centre of excellence for wing design and will be leading the wing design for the A400M, so European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company of Spain is the centre of excellence for military transport aircraft assembly and this thus influences the choice of Spain to host the final assembly line.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's industrial staff will transfer from weekly to monthly pay during April and May this year as part of the process of harmonising their pay and grading arrangements with those of non-industrial staff, who are paid monthly. The change to monthly pay was negotiated with the industrial trade unions and supported by a majority of industrial staff who voted in favour by ballot. As is normal practice, the 



<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2001 : Column: 273W</I><P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the safety of passenger aircraft approaching Newcastle Airport, following the AAIB report on an incident involving civilian and military aircraft on 20 March 2000; and if he will make a statement.  [158411]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The AAIB report made two recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), both of which the Authority has partially accepted. In its published response to the recommendations, the CAA said that the Directorate of Airspace Policy had conducted a study of operations by scheduled public transport services in all Class G airspace, including those in the vicinity of Newcastle Airport. The study confirmed that provided a Radar Advisory Service or Radar Information Service is used, safety levels in such airspace meet the internationally agreed standard.
<P>

<a name="10425w02.html_para2">It is clear from this incident, however, that not all traffic is availing itself of such air traffic services. Consequently the CAA is working closely with airspace users and Newcastle Airport, as a matter of urgency, on a wide range of initiatives aimed at preventing such conflicts in the future.

 Vehicle Excise Duty for motorcycles over 250cc increased by &#163;5 to &#163;65 from 1 March 2001. My Department has not carried out any formal analysis of the effect of this change on levels or patterns of motorcycle use and hence on congestion and levels of emissions.

 There have been no discussions.

 None. This is a matter for the Mayor of London, Transport for London and the other local highway authorities in London. The Mayor's draft transport strategy shows that Transport for London is taking a proactive approach to encouraging cycling.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The provisions in the Noise Act 1996 relating to the new night noise offence and associated powers of seizure came into force on 23 July 1997. We have issued a consultation paper, following a review of the Noise Act, setting out further options for local authorities to use in tackling noise nuisance. The closing date for comments was 31 March. I will announce the outcome of the consultation to the House. Copies of the report and consultation paper are available in the House Library.

<P>
<a name="10425w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is for the local highway authority to decide, in the context of its local transport objectives, whether other classes of vehicles, such as cycles and taxis, should be permitted to use bus lanes. The highway authority would normally liaise with the local police on the enforcement of the traffic regulations so that only permitted vehicles use the lanes, but where authorities had taken on the powers now available to them to enforce parking restriction, they would be able to target parking offences in bus lanes more effectively.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para0">Following successful trials in London, enforcement systems using bus-mounted and CCTV cameras are being introduced along bus routes in London. This includes local authorities carrying out enforcement using camera evidence.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para1">My Department will be consulting later this year on regulations to allow local authorities outside London to take up powers in section 144 of the Transport Act 2000 to enforce bus lanes using camera evidence. These new powers would be available to authorities which have parking enforcement powers. We would hope to see a wider use of such approaches leading to better compliance with bus lanes restrictions, keeping them clearer for buses to use.

 The Government are keen to promote bus travel as an alternative to using the private car. We have reached an agreement with First Group plc which enables them to offer suitably modified US-style buses for use in pilot schemes. We shall be evaluating the results of these schemes in due course.

<P>
<a name="10425w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Councils and other authorities around the country should be commended for the way they have responded to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. While they have a responsibility to budget for the unexpected, the costs that some authorities have incurred because of this outbreak may be exceptional. The Government are keen to ensure that authorities are reimbursed for any extraordinary emergency expenditure so other key services such as education and social services do not suffer.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para2">That is why I am announcing today an extension of the Bellwin scheme to provide emergency financial assistance to local authorities to help them meet some of the costs of responding to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para3">I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified to help those councils affected by foot and mouth disease. Under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, grant will be paid against valid claims to cover 85 per cent. of the eligible costs above a threshold. These are costs incurred in connection with the taking of immediate action to safeguard life and property or to prevent severe inconvenience following an emergency connected with foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para4">My officials are in correspondence with local authorities about the details of the Bellwin scheme. Information will shortly be posted on the Bellwin website which can be found at www.local.detr.gov.uk/finance/ bellwin/bell0001.htm.

 Project details are listed as follows. All experiments using fish must satisfy the regulations of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Those involving genetic modification are subject to the regulations governing releases to the environment. Marketing of genetically modified fish would also require further approvals, principally as a novel food.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para8">In 1991-92, the then Agriculture and Food Research Council (AFRC) funded three grants to work on transgenic fish. These were on carp, salmon, trout and goldfish (a form of carp). These grants finished in 1995. One was to determine how to undertake transgenesis in fish because techniques for other species did not work well, one was to manipulate the onset of sexual maturity and the third to change the rate of growth of the fish.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para9">In addition, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and Medical Research Council are supporting a good deal of research using the fish genome as a model. However, this research is aimed at understanding genetic function more generally at a fundamental level, not at improved varieties of fish.
<P>

<a name="10425w03.html_para10">The research councils are also supporting a range of wider research on fish genetics and aquaculture, but I understand this does not involve genetic modification (GM). I would be happy to provide my hon. Friend with the details if he so wishes.

<a name="10425w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Government are committed to helping parents to achieve a better balance between their home and work lives, in ways which enhance competitiveness for business. That is why we published the Green Paper "Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice", and have carried out extensive consultation with employers and their representatives, employees and their representatives, and family groups.




<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2001 : Column: 281W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10425w04.html_para0">As part of these consultations we have, among other points, received representations on the existing right to parental leave. In the light of these responses I am today announcing three important decisions.
<P>

<a name="10425w04.html_para1">First, we will increase from 13 to 18 weeks the amount of parental leave available to parents of disabled children. An increase on these lines was almost universally positively received by both parents and employers.
<P>

<a name="10425w04.html_para2">Secondly, parental leave will remain unpaid. Parents gave more priority to other options in the Green Paper, and while paid parental leave was supported by some employee representatives and family groups, employers of all sizes maintained a high level of opposition to its introduction on grounds of cost and the impact of absence levels from the workplace. The cost of paying for parental leave would be excessive for both the state and employers.
<P>

<a name="10425w04.html_para3">Thirdly, we will extend entitlement to parental leave to parents of all children who were under five as at 15 December 1999, when the right was first introduced. Experience since then suggests that parental leave has created fewer practical problems for business than may first have been anticipated, and the time is now right to increase the number of parents who are able to exercise the right.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The powers to detain individuals are set out in paragraph 16 of schedule 2, and in paragraph 2 of schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.

 The Prison Service's principal means of reducing reoffending by sex offenders is the sex offender treatment programme (SOTP), which is based on cognitive-behavioural principles. The service is aware of the value of anti-androgen treatment for some sexual offenders, and will be considering the extent to which it should be used as an adjunct to psychological therapy.

<P>

<a name="10425w05.html_para0">The independent evaluation recently carried out on behalf of Burnley borough council of the "Piloting Neighbourhoods, Burnley" scheme suggests that there has been a reduction in crime of 49 per cent. from the period one year prior to the installation to one year after the installation of CCTV. This residential scheme was funded in 1997 under round 3 of CCTV challenge. The evaluation of Burnley town centre's CCTV scheme, funded in 1996 under round 2 of CCTV challenge, suggested that there had been a reduction in crime of one quarter after the installation of cameras.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> Pre-term infant formulae were originally considered by the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) in 1992. Their conclusion at that time was that prematurity was not a medical condition and that it would not be appropriate for such formulae to be supplied on national health service prescription. In consequence, pre-term infant formulae have been included in Schedule 10 to the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992, and may not therefore be prescribed on the NHS.
<P>

<a name="10425w05.html_para2">An application for an ACBS recommendation for Nutriprem 2 was made on 8 February 1999 which the Committee considered at its meetings on 29 March and 15 June of that year and on 31 January 2000. At its meeting on 31 January 2000, the Committee decided to reverse its earlier view and agreed to recommend Nutriprem 2 as suitable for prescription by GPs at NHS expense for catch-up growth in pre-term infants (ie less than 35 weeks at birth), and small in size for gestational aged infants, until six months post-natal age. Unfortunately, at that time, the fact that Nutriprem 2 was included in schedule 10 was overlooked. At its meeting on 16 May 2000, the Committee recommended that Nutriprem 2 should be removed from schedule 10.
<P>

<a name="10425w05.html_para3">The Department has been considering whether the reasons which the Committee has given for reversing its earlier decision are sufficiently convincing to justify the additional cost to the NHS of removing this product from schedule 10. We expect to announce our decision in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w05.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the average period is between a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances that a product is suitable for prescription and a decision to implement that decision; and what the average period of consideration given by his Department is to recommendations from that Committee in respect of Nutriprem 2.  [158320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w05.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> General practitioners may prescribe any product which they consider to be a drug, unless it is included in schedule 10 to the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations, provided they are prepared to justify their decision to the health authority. The Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances provides advice to the national health service, the effect of which is that prescriptions issued in accordance with the Committee's advice will not normally be investigated. Generally, therefore, there is no decision for the Department to take when the ACBS has recommended that a product is suitable for prescription. Indeed, I know of no case other than pre-term infant formulae where the ACBS has recommended as suitable for prescription products which cannot be prescribed because they are included in schedule 10. There is thus no average time with which to compare the time taken to consider the ACBS's recommendations on these products.

<a name="10425w06.html_para0">There is no specific ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) code for Verocytotoxin-producing E.coli (VTEC) 0157 and therefore it is not possible to obtain data from the Office for National Statistics or the General Register Offices on deaths attributable to VTEC 0157 infection. Furthermore those who die following infection will usually have symptoms of kidney failure or brain damage and these features are more likely to be recorded on death certificates.

<i>Sources:</i><P>

Scotland data are laboratory reports to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) of Salmonella in humans in Scotland, 1970-2000<P>

England and Wales data is from the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). The Salmonella data for 1970 to 1980 differ from 1981 onwards as follows:<P>

1. The pre-1981 data are paper records whereas data for 1981 onwards have been computerised and published on the PHLS website;<P>

2. The pre-1981 data include all human isolates whereas the data from 1981 onwards are for faecal isolates only;<P>

3. The pre-1981 data include more than one report for some patients whereas the data for 1981 onwards have had duplication removed so that there is only one report for each patient.<P>

4. Data for 1981-91 is from Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) (formerly DEP). Data for 1992 onwards is from the PHLS Salmonella datasheet.<P>

Northern Ireland data are from the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Northern Ireland <P>

<P>
<a name="10425w07.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 5 and 27 March 2001]:</i> The Government are continuing to look at ways in which the industry might be helped and recognise the concern of beef producers whose animals are subject to movement restrictions which push them over the 30-month age limit and so leave only the OTMS as an outlet for them. The Government's first priority is the eradication of the disease, but we are keeping the position of the producers affected in these ways under review. In the meantime, cattle of all ages may be entered into the livestock welfare disposal scheme if the circumstances are appropriate.

<P>
<a name="10425w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The general ban on movement of animals susceptible to foot and mouth disease remains in place. Welfare movements are permitted only under licence from areas of low risk to areas of higher risk. This is based on a careful risk assessment, the principles of which we have set out on the MAFF FMD website http://www.maff.gov.uk/.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> The recent European Commission decision (2001/257/EC) authorises the vaccination without slaughter of cattle in specific areas of the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 April 2001]:</i> It has long been recognised that infected meat products might pose a risk if they are not adequately processed in pig swill. The controls in the Animal By-Products Order 1999 are designed to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases such as foot and mouth and classical swine fever by ensuring appropriate treatment of any catering waste which might include meat products.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> Vaccination has always been an option which we have constantly reviewed in the light of veterinary and epidemiological advice.

<P>
<a name="10425w07.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The initiative to set up the Modern Biotechnology Information Transfer Club was taken by Campden and Chorleywood Food Research Association. The objective of the club was to stimulate the information of links between the food industry and the biotechnology sector. The main club activities were to disseminate information via bulletins (10); seminars (six); and visits to research laboratories (seven). MAFF's involvement was to provide partial financial support for the club as a technology awareness raising project, and to monitor the activities to ensure that agreed objectives were met.

<P>
<a name="10425w08.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom already has comprehensive provisions in place to prevent money laundering, irrespective of where the funds originated. Money laundering is a serious criminal offence in the UK and attracts penalties of up to 14 years imprisonment--among the highest in the world. The UK anti-money laundering regime has been praised by the financial action taskforce as a model for other countries. Nevertheless, the Government are committed to implementing further measures to strengthen the laws against money laundering.
<P>

<a name="10425w08.html_para3">The Proceeds of Crime Bill, published in draft for consultation in March, will create a new criminal assets recovery agency, update the criminal laws on money laundering and permit the restraint of realisable property at the beginning of an investigation, an earlier stage than is possible at present. The Bill will also make it an offence for employees in the regulated sector to fail to disclose a transaction to the authorities when they knew or suspected or had reasonable grounds to suspect that it represented the proceeds of crime.
<P>

<a name="10425w08.html_para4">The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 will give the FSA powers both to issue money laundering rules and to prosecute for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 1993.
<P>

<a name="10425w08.html_para5">Furthermore, the UK has taken an active role in updating the EU money laundering directive. The directive will be updated to expand the range of predicate offences giving rise to an obligation to report suspicions and will impose reporting obligations on lawyers and accountants. It will thereby ensure that the minimum standards applicable in other member states are brought close to the tough standards already applied in the UK.

 Although a middle-income country, Peru has a serious poverty problem with 41 per cent. of the population classed as poor and 15 per cent. as extremely poor and unable to meet food needs. The Government of President Fujimori grew increasingly corrupt before it collapsed in late 2000 and in the process undermined and reversed the progress on poverty reduction that they had achieved in the mid 1990s.
<P>

<a name="10425w09.html_para2">After the interim Paniagua Government was formed in November 2000, we concluded that our future strategy should remain focused on the problem of inequality in Peru and would be centred on enabling poor people, especially indigenous groups and women, to realise their social and economic rights, play their full role in society and get out of poverty. Once the Peruvian presidential election (now going to a second round in May or June) is decided and a new elected Government takes office on 28 July, we will open discussions with them on the future shape of our support for poverty elimination. We will seek to work with the Peruvian Government, civil society and the international community to maximise progress towards meeting the international development targets in Peru.

 HIV/AIDS is the single most important development challenge in Africa. The epidemic is undermining economic growth and fundamentally threatens social and economic development. DFID continues to give greatest priority to prevention, but we also support efforts to the personal, social and economic impact of illness and death caused by the disease.
<P>

<a name="10425w09.html_para3">As national strategic plans to tackle the epidemic improve, we have begun to place our support within the framework of those plans. For example, we have recently approved significant HIV/AIDS-related programmes in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe totalling over &#163;60 million, and a &#163;20 million programme is being designed to support Mozambique. A new programme for South Africa is also planned for this year. We have also committed &#163;7.5 million to a regional initiative on HIV/AIDS with the Southern Africa Development Community. Last month, I approved a &#163;25 million programme under the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa to support the efforts of Ethiopia, Rwanda and Burundi and other countries to curtail the spread and reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS.

 The Chancellor and I announced, as part of the global child poverty initiative, several tax measures and purchase fund options, to help increase access to medicines in developing countries. My Department is in discussion with other countries, international organisations, the private sector and civil society, to explore further options to increase international investment to tackle the diseases of poverty in developing countries, including the establishment of a global purchase fund for commodities for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and diseases of childhood. In addition, we continue to encourage the EC to rapidly implement its programme of action for tackling the major communicable diseases.
<P>

<a name="10425w09.html_para4">We are also currently supporting a number of innovative public private partnerships aimed at tackling the diseases of poverty. These include &#163;14 million for the international AIDS vaccine initiative and support for the global alliance for vaccines, the medicines for malaria venture, and LAPDAP to treat drug-resistant malaria. In addition, the UK strongly supports the World Health Organisation-led roll back malaria initiative, which provides the vehicle for concerted action to deliver more widely the benefits of currently available methods of malaria control to the poorest.

<a name="10425w09.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The recent press reports that have suggested that DFID-sponsored research on genetically modified fish is being carried out in secret were false. Results are published and designed to help developing countries to decide for themselves whether they want to use these technologies.

<a name="10425w09.html_para6">The one current project is investigating genetic modification techniques to accelerate the growth rate and confer sterility in tilapia, a freshwater fish widely farmed in Africa and Asia. Each stage in the progression of this research depends on evidence of the balance between risk and potential benefits.

Socio-economic studies will help to provide a better understanding of how poor producers and consumers could benefit.
<P>

<a name="10425w09.html_para7">No genetically modified fish have been released from this project. Any controlled field testing will depend on the outcome of current studies.

 Climate change is a global problem which needs a global agreement. The UK believes that the Kyoto protocol provides the only framework for this. Developing countries are the most affected by climate change. We therefore believe that their best interests would be served by continuing to pursue our aim of ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto protocol by 2002, so as to start to deliver emissions reductions by developed countries. We will of course continue to encourage the US to engage in global efforts to tackle climate change and to take domestic action to reduce its emissions.

Trade unions have traditionally drawn their membership from workers in the formal sector. The challenge for trade unions today is to reach the vast majority of poor people who work outside the formal economy.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment her Department has made of the level of corruption in British Government aid programmes.  [157670]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w10.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department continuously reviews and assesses mechanisms for the delivery of, and accounting for, UK development funds in order to minimise the risk of corruption.
<P>

<a name="10425w10.html_para2">I am confident that our carefully designed programme management systems, supported by Internal Audit and National Audit Office scrutiny, are sufficiently robust to prevent or detect fraud or corruption.
<P>

<a name="10425w10.html_para3">In developing countries, my officials work closely with Governments, civil society and other development agencies to improve the quality of public sector financial management reform. These measures help to reduce the risks. In addition we may call for special programme management, audit and accounting systems in order to satisfy ourselves that funds are used for the intended purpose.

<a name="10425w10.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the value was of her Department's aid to <i>(a)</i> Macedonia, <i>(b)</i> Kosovo and <i>(c)</i> Serbia for the most recent six month period for which figures are available; and if she will make a statement.  [157575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w10.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The most recent period for which bilateral aid figures are published is the financial year 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="10425w10.html_para4">In that year, my Department spent &#163;111 million in emergency assistance for Kosovo refugees in the region including Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and in 



<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2001 : Column: 304W</I><P>
Kosovo itself. The UK's share of EU aid to Kosovo and Kosovo refugees in the calendar year 1999 was &#163;56 million.
<P>

<a name="10425w10.html_para5">Our bilateral spending on non-emergency aid to Macedonia in 1999-2000 was &#163;0.84 million. The UK's share of total multilateral aid to Macedonia in the calendar year 1998, the latest for which figures are available, was &#163;4.7 million.
<P>

<a name="10425w10.html_para6">We did not support a bilateral aid programme to Serbia in 1999-2000, in view of the lack of commitment to reform by the then Serbian Government. Our activities in Montenegro were confined to provision of advice to the Privatisation Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what new proposals she has to reduce fatalities in childbirth in Azerbaijan.  [157644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10425w10.html_spnew11"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Azerbaijan is not a priority for direct assistance, due to poor progress in democratic reform. My Department does, however, provide financial support to international institutions including the WHO and the UNFPA, which operate safe motherhood and reproductive health projects in Azerbaijan.
