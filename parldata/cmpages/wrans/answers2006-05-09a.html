<i>[holding answer 8 May 2006]:</i> We are monitoring the effect of these cases closely but it is too early to say what the wider impacts on industry will be. Our present objective is to manage the situation effectively and to minimise adverse impacts by encouraging wide public understanding of the issues and an evidence-based and proportionate response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">At present the disease is confined to three premises. Unless there is a significant spread of disease we do not expect a significant impact on local economies. Trade from the UK to other member states can carry on as

But the Government seek to minimise that risk by encouraging wide public understanding of the issues and an evidence-based and proportionate response.

<p><a name="qn_3"><a name="60509w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 24 April 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 813&#150;14W, on biological diversity, what contribution she expects the UK to make towards each of the recommendations; what her timetable is for the delivery of such contributions; and if she will make a statement.  [66985]</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60509w01.html_spnew3"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 The Government were closely involved in developing many of the initiatives agreed upon at the Eighth Conference of Parties (COP 8) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), including in its EU presidency role in the latter half of 2006. We will continue to support the EU in forthcoming international negotiations, including on the conservation of marine biodiversity and genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and on the development of an international regime on Access and Benefit Sharing of Genetic Resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Many of the decisions from the conference include a call for regional responses and we expect these to be discussed at the next meeting of the Working Party on International Environmental Issues (Biodiversity) in June.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Once the definitive versions of the decisions taken at COP 8 are available on the website of the Convention on Biological Diversity, my officials will review with other Departments, the devolved administrations and the Nature Conservation Agencies how to ensure that the decisions taken, including the new programme of work on Island Biodiversity, and the decisions on climate change and biodiversity, invasive alien species, business and biodiversity, forest biological diversity and agricultural biodiversity are reflected in our policies, programmes and research for the United Kingdom. This exercise will be completed over the next six months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">One of the key delivery mechanisms for these policies are the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), required under article 6 of the Convention. The COP decision to review the implementation of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 May 2006 : Column 117W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
NBSAPs is opportune in the light of plans already in place within the UK to refresh the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, which is both a delivery mechanism for the CBD and a link from CBD to the devolved country biodiversity strategies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The decision on business and biodiversity arose from a joint UK Brazil initiative in partnership with the Secretariat of the CBD, Insight Investments and ILJCN&#151;the World Conservation Union. We will be discussing with these and new partners how to take forward the elements of the decision requiring international development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">I will be discussing the integration of biodiversity into official development assistance with the DFID parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the next meeting of the Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group on Biodiversity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">We will continue to work closely with colleagues in Europe and the Secretariat to the CBD to support work on indicators and the development of improved outcome focussed reporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Elements of some decisions will be implemented through existing EU measures, for example the recently concluded Regulation on Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade which strengthens efforts to promote sustainable forest management. In addition, existing EU legislation, in particular directive 2001/18/EC, already ensures a precautionary approach to the use of genetically modified organisms (including genetically modified trees and genetic use restriction technologies).We will continue to provide additional financial resources to support countries rich in biodiversity in the implementation of the CBD through the UK&#039;s substantial contribution to the global environment facility (currently &#163;118 million for 2002&#150;2006, of which approximately 30 per cent. goes to biodiversity projects) and through the Darwin Initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">We will also support capacity building efforts over the inter-sessional period leading up to COP 9 in 2008 through DEFRA&#039;s World Summit on Sustainable Development Implementation Fund and through DEFRA&#039;s support for the Convention&#039;s Trust Funds. We will be focussing such efforts particularly on Africa and on support for implementation, particularly through national biodiversity strategies and action plans.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 16 June 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 553W, on game rearing farms, what the reasons are for the difference between the figure for the number of game rearing farms given in that answer and that given in the partial draft regulatory impact assessment on the control of avian influenza.  [65430]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60509w01.html_spnew4"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 Figures provided in the answer of 16 June 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 553W, represent the industry&#039;s own best estimate for the UK as a whole; no specific figures are held. That answer also referred to 200 established game farms, while the partial RIA drew on the Game Conservancy Trust&#039;s estimate that there 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 May 2006 : Column 118W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
are more than 10,000 holdings where pheasants are reared. The use of these different classifications accounts for the difference in the figures quoted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w01.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">More recently, DEFRA has established the Great Britain Poultry Register to gather essential information about certain species of birds only held on commercial premises in Great Britain.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60509w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 May 2006]:</i> If the aggregated net thermal rated input of the appliances on a rendering site exceeds 50 MW, the rendering plant falls under part A(1) of section 1.1 of schedule 1 to the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (PPC Regulations) and thereby is regulated by the Environment Agency. This is the case with the rendering plant operated by John Pointon and Sons near Leek. Rendering plants with less than 50 MW aggregated net thermal rated input falls under part A(2) of section 6.8 of part 1 of schedule 1 of the PPC Regulations and thereby is regulated by the relevant local authority.

<a name="stpa_12">The Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 requires all premises on which animal by-products are handled or processed to be officially approved or authorised. In England the implementing Regulations (the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005) prescribe the Secretary of State as a &#039;competent authority&#039; for the purpose of granting animal by-product approvals. The Secretary of State fulfils this role via the state veterinary service. Approval is only granted or maintained if the competent authority is satisfied that the regulation is complied with.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60509w02.html_spnew1"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 We envisage that the majority of Natural England&#039;s land holding will comprise National Nature Reserves (NNRs). NNRs cover approximately 89,800 hectares, of which 62,300 hectares are managed by English Nature, the remainder being managed by Approved Bodies. Of the land managed by English Nature, 19,641 hectares are owned and hence qualify for owner-dedication under section 16 (s16) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Some 27,935

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions he has had with his EU counterparts on financial support for poultry farmers in other EU countries; and if he will make a statement.  [68543]</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60509w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 May 2006]:</i> A proposal to extend the current provision for exceptional measures in the eggs and poultry market was adopted at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 25 April. This allows exceptional market support measures to be taken where there is serious market disturbance because of concerns about avian influenza. Member states would need to specifically request any individual measures, and these would need to be 50 per cent. co-financed. The Commission has made clear that measures adopted by member states before 25 April may be considered for co-financing on a case-by-case basis, and that serious market disturbance is defined at EU&#151;not member state&#151;level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_13">The UK view is that these kind of measures must be directly linked to exceptional circumstances and must not be used to distort the normal competitive nature of the EU market.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60509w02.html_spnew3"><b> Barry Gardiner  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 3 May 2006]:</i> Village shops are important to rural communities in providing goods and services, as well as crucial social contact. An increasing number of village shops are operating as social enterprises and able to sustain the business through volunteer action and earned income.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w02.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_14">For social enterprises generally, local Business Links are a good source of advice and support. The Business Link website includes a selection of useful sources of information and business support. More specifically, DEFRA&#039; s rural enterprise scheme, which is part of the England rural development programme (ERDP), can provide support to social enterprise projects such as community run shops, where they have strong community backing and a business plan which establishes the need for a grant. The current ERDP ends on 31 December 2006 and the rural enterprise scheme will close to new applications on 30 June 2006. DEFRA is currently consulting on priorities for the new rural development programme for England.

 DFID is committed to tackling corruption. It is a problem in most countries, and is a result of failures in governance and accountability. The best check against corruption is to strengthen governance, supported by regular monitoring. We need to focus on building policies and institutions that prevent and deter corruption before it undermines development. DFID programmes include support for a range of governance reforms which are aimed primarily at improving accountability, transparency and the improved financial management of public resources. DFID is also promoting work internationally to develop better indicators that will help track progress over time.

A key part of DFID&#039;s work with developing country governments is to support the improvement of strategic planning and public financial management. For example, DFID supports public-financial management reform in Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Lesotho and the Gambia. Procurement reform is particularly important and DFID works closely with other bilateral donors and multilateral institutions (especially the World Bank) to improve countries&#039; procurement capacity. Many DFID programmes are also supporting reform of public-service pay, conditions and performance management, in order to reduce the incentives for public officials to act corruptly.

DFID, working with other government departments, has launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to improve the transparency of oil and mineral revenues. The UK also played an important role in negotiations to develop the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), the first global agreement on the action that needs to be taken to combat corruption.

 The Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey of 2003&#150;04 (the latest available figures) found that:

<ul>

 DFID is supporting the objectives set out in the Government of Sierra Leone&#039;s Core Mineral Policy. It has two main aims: to maximise the economic and social benefits of the diamond sector to both the Government and the people of Sierra Leone; and to ensure that the benefits accrued from the sector are divided more equitably among those involved. I refer the hon. Member for Cotswold to the answer I previously gave on 7 March 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1395&#150;6.

<p>
<a name="60509w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_51">DFID is committed to ensuring that the Government of Sierra Leone maximise the revenues it can accrue from its mineral resources, including the diamond sector. As part of this commitment, DFID is recruiting a Director General (DG) for the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR), whose principle task will be to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Ministry. The DG&#039;s responsibilities will include overseeing a work 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 May 2006 : Column 134W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
plan that the MMR will develop in close consultation with the Office of the President. The DG will also liaise closely with other ministries, such as the National Revenue Authority and the Ministry of Finance to ensure that the policies developed maximise the revenue potential available to the Government from its extractive sector.

<a name="60509w06.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_52">DFID officials are currently assessing options for providing support to fisheries policy development and more effective fisheries management by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources. The European Commission (EC) is currently supporting a fisheries stock assessment in Sierra Leone and DFID&#039;s assistance would aim to build on this. At the same time, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has shown an interest in engaging with Sierra Leone on issues relating to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. Our combined objective is to ensure the wealth of this highly prized fishery accrues to Sierra Leone for use by Sierra Leoneans. It is commonly recognised that currently Sierra Leone and neighbouring countries Liberia and Guinea, are together losing $140 million in fish that is stolen by illegal foreign fleets operating beyond the reach of national policing. A recent DFID assessment mission noted that this would have important benefits for the many small-scale fishers and processors and help them access new markets for their produce.

<p>

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="60509w11.html_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 In relation to questions 67115, 67025 and 67026, the Information Sharing Index will contain records of all children in England. Current estimates from the Government Actuary&#039;s Department, giving 2006 projections based on 2003 figures, indicate that there are approximately 9.5 million children in England aged 15 and under, and approximately 11.5 million children in the UK aged 15 and under. We estimate therefore that the England index will contain records of approximately 82 per cent. of children aged 15 and under in the UK. Decisions on whether to establish an index in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are for the devolved Administrations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_88">An index record will be created for each child at birth and maintained until the child&#039;s 18th birthday. To help ensure that the transition from youth to adult services is managed smoothly, it may also be desirable to make provision to retain information on the index on an individual basis for young adults with multiple needs, (for example care leavers and young people with disabilities), beyond their 18th birthday, with their consent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w11.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_89">In line with the Data Protection Act, information will be retained on the index for as long as it is accurate and relevant, for example, practitioner contact details will be available for the period they are involved with the child and for a year beyond the end of that involvement. This will enable contact to be made with those practitioners currently and most recently involved with a child.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_90">In relation to questions 67039, 67044, 67046, 67047, 67048, 67050, 67051 and 67052, the objectives of the index remain as agreed by Parliament when the Children Act 2004 was passed. These are to support the duties on local authorities and other partners to co-operate to promote the well-being of children and to safeguard and improve their welfare. There is, therefore, no provision for a Child Population Register in the funding we have made available for the index.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w11.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_91">We have accepted the recommendation in the final report of the Citizen Information Project that we should consider the scope for a Child Population Register. That consideration will be informed by an assessment of whether there are sufficient additional efficiency and effectiveness benefits. No decision has been taken to establish such a register. A Child Population Register would have wider objectives than the index and would therefore require new primary legislation. A clear case would have to be made for it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w11.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_92">My Department has not undertaken scoping or design work in relation to a Child Population Register. There are therefore no proposals for the ages at which children might be registered and their details removed, when a register might be established, who would be responsible for providing data, whether registration would be compulsory or voluntary, or what proportion of the population aged 15 and under would be included. My Department has so far spent and allocated no funds in relation to a register.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much each local education authority spent on <i>(a)</i> excluded pupils and <i>(b)</i> pupils in (i) pupil referral units, (ii) behaviour support implementation programmes, (iii) inclusion, administration, assessment and co-ordination programmes, (iv) behaviour support plans and (v) other programmes intended to avoid exclusion of pupils in the last period for which figures are available.

 The Government consider the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the framework for nuclear disarmament. The UK has an excellent record in implementing its disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT and, in this regard, continues to press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons. The Government do not support any new process, including a Nuclear Weapons Convention, which could risk cutting across the existing NPT regime.

 Strategic functions, critical decision making and sensitive staff roles connected with the National Identity Register will remain under the direct control of the public sector under the auspices of the Identity and Passport Service. However, where appropriate, it is also planned that where the operations of the National Identity Scheme can be best delivered by the private sector, the Identity and Passport Service will seek to procure these services from the market. The Government have also confirmed that the facilities used for hosting the National Identity Register, as part of the country&#039;s Critical National Infrastructure, as well as those used for the personalisation of identity cards will be located in the United Kingdom.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="60509w22.html_spnew11"><b> Joan Ryan: </b> 
 It is currently intended that the identity card will be a valid travel document for travel within the European Union. In order to meet minimum international standards for travel documents set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the identity card must include a &quot;proximity&quot; or &quot;contactless&quot; chip. Such chips are being introduced into travel documents worldwide to improve their integrity and security, with four of the five largest passport issuing countries, the US, UK, Japan and Germany introducing this chip in passports this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60509w22.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_151">The &quot;proximity&quot; or &quot;contactless&quot; chip is read by actively placing the chip on the reader (at a distance of 0 cm to 2 cm from the reader). The contents of the chip can only be &#039;unlocked&#039; after special characters printed on the card/passport&#039;s Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) are scanned. An attempt to read the chip without using the information printed in the MRZ to &#039;unlock&#039; it will yield no data which can be used to identify the individual. This is known as Basic Access Control protection, which is being implemented internationally in accordance with ICAO standards. It should be noted that this technology differs from that used in RFID tags. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 May 2006 : Column 201W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
While both use radio frequencies, they operate very differently from one another&#151;an RFID tag is just an identity tag that provides information.

<a name="60509w22.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_152">A proximity chip is more advanced&#151;it has processing capability with different operating systems and different security settings. This is reflected in the fact that they are defined by two separate standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="60509w22.html_spnew12"><b> Joan Ryan: </b> 
 The Identity and Passport Service expects to receive 6.9 million applications in the 2006&#150;07 financial year and has recruited sufficient staff for this. We do not anticipate that the number of people choosing to renew early in order to delay enrolment on the National Identity Register will be significant in the context of the overall number of applications.

Ms Hutchinson was the first woman prisoner to apparently take her own life since October 2005. Ms Hutchinson&#039;s death will be thoroughly investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Stephen Shaw, who, since April 2004, has been investigating all deaths in custody.

 The Government have invested considerable extra funds in improving rehabilitation regimes for all adults, including this age group, and we now spend &#163;300 million a year on this in prisons alone.

To address the specific needs of this group, the National Offender Management Service has established a project to develop a strategy and standards for their management both in custody and the community. This is working with key interest groups who have experience of working successfully with this age group. It is due to report its findings to Ministers in the autumn.
