 Little reliable data are available on Burma, but it is clear that poverty levels are very high and getting worse. The most recent overview of poverty across most of the country was an assessment of household living conditions which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) published in June 2007. This assessment found that over a third of the population lived below the poverty line, and 10 per cent. were in extreme poverty. The assessment was not able to cover areas affected by conflict, where poverty levels are likely to be even higher. Since the UNDP assessment, Burma was struck by Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, and the global economic downturn has reduced the income of many households. In addition, many parts of Chin State have experienced severe food shortages as a result of rat infestations; and conflict continues in some other border areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90427w0005.htm_para12"><a name="09042735000100">In response to this deepening poverty, DFID will expand its aid to Burma by &#163;10 million in each of the financial years 2009-10 and 2010-11. These increases are in addition to those agreed under the comprehensive spending review. We now plan to spend &#163;25 million on Burma in 2009-10 and &#163;28 million in 2010-11. About 60 per cent. of the increase will be allocated to cyclone-related assistance, and about 40 per cent. to DFID's regular programme of humanitarian aid across the whole country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90427w0005.htm_para13"><a name="09042735000101">The additional cyclone-related assistance will be focused on health, basic education and the restoration of people's livelihoods in rural areas. Much of the increase for the regular programme will be used to help fill funding gaps faced by the Three Diseases Fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We are at the same time increasing our support to refugees, IDPs and others living in conflict affected areas of Burma. We recently agreed additional funding of up to &#163;280,000 in response to the food shortages in Chin State.</p>

DFID has had no significant funding or other relations with the Caucus&#151;other than some minor support in kind through a DFID funded project, the Forest Governance Facility between March 2007 and the summer of 2008. The FCO, through the British high commission in Yaounde, has provided no funds to the Caucus and has reviewed its portfolio to ensure that no UK funds are being misused by any individuals involved in the Caucus who may also be involved in the work of other related organisations.</p>

 It is not possible to provide an estimate of how much of the UK&#146;s Environmental Transformation Fund (through which we contribute to the Climate Investment Funds) will be used to fund the development of new coal-fired power stations in developing countries. This is because the UK&#146;s funding cannot be separated from that of other donors contributing to the Climate Investment Funds. However, we do not expect the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) (the only one of the Climate Investment Funds which includes criteria for fossil fuel projects) to receive many bids for funding related to new coal plants. If any are received, the agreed CTF criteria stipulate that coal projects have to be highly efficient and must be ready for the future installation of carbon capture and storage technology.

 Suspension forms part of the MoJ's discipline policy. Staff may be suspended during a disciplinary process if initial fact finding shows that the employee's actions might amount to gross misconduct; may impact on the health and safety of the employee or other employees might be at risk; it is suspected that potential witnesses might be influenced by the employee; the working relationship with the employee has broken down; or it is suspected that there is a risk to MoJ's property.

 As I announced at Commons Report stage of the Political Parties and Elections Bill, the phased introduction of individual registration will involve the voluntary collection of personal identifiers (alongside the existing process of household registration) from the autumn 2010 annual canvass until the autumn 2015 canvass. From this point it would be compulsory to provide identifiers for new registrations. By 2017 the provision of identifiers would be compulsory for all entries on the register. The shift to compulsory provision of identifiers in 2015 would be subject to a parliamentary vote on a recommendation by the Electoral Commission as to whether two statutory tests relating to the state of preparation for the change and the robustness of the registration system had been met.</p>

The Offender Assessment System (OASys) is critical to the offender management process in that it enables the recording of static and dynamic risk factors as well as the risk of serious harm that an offender may pose to others. The next release of OASys, due in July 2009, will provide additional functionality for practitioners enabling a more efficient approach to offender assessment. The new OASys release will facilitate a shorter offender assessment depending upon the risks the offender poses. This will enable efficiencies specifically when working with lower risk offenders. The two current OASys applications in prison and probation will be replaced  <br>

Organisations such as PMS, which are registered as industrial and provident societies, are exempt from regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in accepting deposits. Under Industrial and Provident Society legislation, any one member's shareholding is limited to &#163;20,000. Members' deposits are held in the form of withdrawable share capital and societies should make clear to members that their deposits are therefore risk capital. Being outside of FSA regulation, the society and its members do not contribute to, and are therefore not protected by, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 April 2009]:</i> The White Paper, &#147;Raising expectations and increasing support&#148;, stated that existing incapacity benefits recipients will be migrated to employment and support allowance from 2010. This will involve having the work capability assessment rather than the personal capability assessment which is a more accurate and up to date assessment of limited capability for work than its predecessor. It therefore provides a more appropriate means to ensure that individuals are receiving the correct benefit.</p>

 Under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, responsibility for the health and safety of learners rests with the employer, including providers, on whose premises the learning is taking place. To support this, the Learning and Skills Council is required under the Learning and Skills Act 2000 to ensure that the provision which it secures is of a quality adequate to meet the reasonable needs of learners. To fulfil this duty, the LSC seeks, among other things, to ensure that the training environment of employers is both healthy and safe, including where necessary through assessments of the suitability of training facilities, and by making it a condition of funding for providers to satisfy themselves as to the health and safety suitability of employers&#146; premises.</p>

It is therefore not necessary to put separate arrangements in place for the NAS.</p>

 Despite major improvements in oral health during the last 30 years, there remains a strong association between oral health and social disadvantage. The 2003 National Survey of Child Dental Health showed that the probability of five-year old children having decayed primary teeth was about 50 per cent. higher in the poorest social groups than the wealthiest group. Among 15-year-olds from managerial and professional backgrounds, 47 per cent. had obvious decay experience compared with 65 per cent. from routine and manual socio-economic backgrounds.</p>

The Water Act 2003 gives strategic health authorities (SHAs) the power to instruct water companies to fluoridate supplies. Last autumn, South Central strategic health authority consulted the public on fluoridating Southampton and parts of south west Hampshire and, on 26 February, decided to proceed with fluoridation. A number of other SHAs are now actively considering the possibility of new water fluoridation schemes.</p>

In many areas, the programme is delivered in Sure Start Children's Centres. Some 18,000 packs were issued in 2008.</p>

Following this announcement, the Government asked Professor Ian Gilmore, President of the Royal College of Physicians, to undertake a review of prescription charges to consider how this pledge could best be implemented. The review is seeking the views of the public, clinicians and patient representative bodies on how exemption for people with long-term conditions should be phased in and is due to report to departmental Ministers in the summer.</p>

Estimates for 2005 and earlier periods are on a different basis to those from 2006 onwards. A preliminary assessment of changes in survey methodology suggests that the estimated total number of employees (for GB at the whole economy level) was reduced by around 1 per cent. Direct comparisons of employee estimates should therefore be treated with caution.<br>

To ensure that all households are classified, an age group for households where the HRP is aged 80 or over has been included. Households where the HRP is under 20 (of which there are relatively few) are classified in the same group as those where the HRP is aged 20 to 24.</p>
</ul><a name="90427w0022.htm_brev40"><a name="09042746002046"><ul><p class="tabletext">The information in this response is based on the Expenditure and Food Survey, which has a sample size of approximately 6,400 households. When breaking down this sample into age bands the sub-samples become quite small. The estimates for all of the age groups are based on sub-samples of around 370-710 households. With such small sample sizes, caution should be exercised when drawing any conclusions from these estimates. As an indication of sampling variability, the 95 per cent confidence interval for average gross household income for all households is approximately ±2.8 per cent. When disaggregating the information to smaller sub-groups, such as household age groups, the sampling variability will be greater due to a smaller sample size.</p>

 The Department does not collect this information centrally. However making sure that care leavers have access to an appropriate range of accommodation options is a priority for Government.</p>

They have statutory responsibilities for providing care leavers with the support they need until they are 21, or longer if they remain in an approved programme of education or training. Where care leavers are under 18 but have moved on from foster care or a children's home, their responsible local authority has a duty to make sure that they are maintained in suitable accommodation.</p>

Last year we jointly published guidance with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) on how agencies should work together to prevent youth homelessness with a focus on enabling care leavers to have access to the full range of supported accommodation for young people in their area. This combines with our ongoing work on PSA 16 which sets out the Government's aim that the most vulnerable adults are offered the chance to get back on a path to a more successful life by increasing the proportion of socially excluded adults in settled accommodation and in employment, education or training. Care leavers are one of the four groups the PSA specifically focuses on.</p>

Purchasers&#146; household income must not exceed &#163;60,000 and they must be able to demonstrate that they cannot buy without assistance but can sustain home ownership.</p>

 It was announced in the Budget 2009 that the eligibility criteria for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be amended to include eligible households in negative equity, provided that their loan to value ratio is less than 120 per cent. This reflects our commitment to keep the scheme under review to respond flexibly to changing housing market conditions. This is a demand-led scheme, but we estimate that it should help up to 6,000 of the most vulnerable households at risk of repossession remain in their home. This change means that households who borrowed responsibly but have fallen into negative equity because of falling house prices can still be considered for support under the scheme. This does not materially affect the Impact assessment published on 16 September 2008, so we have no plans to update this.</p>

 Commercial leases are a matter of private contract. Leases will set out any arrangements under which the rent may be varied during the course of the tenancy, in order to reflect current market values, and will commonly provide for the rent to be decided by an independent third party where the landlord and tenant cannot agree. When business tenancies protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 are renewed, the rent is restricted to the market value. The Department for Communities and Local Government does not provide direct assistance to small businesses in respect of rent increases, although Small Business Rate Relief is available to those businesses that meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

As a result of Government concern about inflexible leasing practices, the property industry introduced a new voluntary &#145;Code for Leasing Business Premises&#146; in March 2007. The Government look to the code and ancillary documents to promote more flexibility in the commercial property market, and especially to promote greater awareness among small business tenants. Government are monitoring the dissemination, use and impact of the code, and will evaluate the outcome to see if it has made a difference.</p>

The Department for International Development has recently committed &#163;300,000 over a four year period (starting 2008-09) to a major research project being undertaken by the International Institute for Sustainable Development. The project will clarify the scale of fossil fuel subsidies and their impacts on sustainable development, and propose measures to reduce, eliminate or redirect these where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="90427w0029.htm_para0"><a name="09042751001300">At the London Energy Meeting in December, where over 35 countries were represented (including the main consumers and producers of oil, and leading companies and international organisations), participants agreed on the importance of measures to promote stability in the oil market, and the importance of promoting energy efficient, and carbon-reducing technologies. Participants also noted that better-functioning markets would give more consistent price signals to enable producer and consumer countries to have greater confidence in making investment and purchasing decisions.</p>

 Funding to encourage take-up of energy efficiency measures in Great Britain is available primarily through two schemes: the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and Warm Front, but only Warm Front is funded from the public purse. The tables illustrate the investment made by Warm Front in insulation measures to improve the energy efficiency of householders over 60 in <i> (a)</i> Test Valley borough, <i> (b)</i> the ceremonial county of Hampshire and <i> (c) </i>the City of Southampton in each year since 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="90427w0029.htm_para1"><a name="09042751001303">CERT is operated and funded by the six major energy suppliers, which are required to meet targets by encouraging households to take-up energy efficiency measures, including insulation and high-efficiency lights and appliances. Ofgem, the scheme administrator, does not collect data on energy supplier spend. However, based on the costs of the measures promoted by energy suppliers, we estimate that the overall spend by energy suppliers on delivering their CERT obligations across Great Britain will exceed &#163;3 billion over the period 2008-11.</p>

 The central proposal in the CERT amendment consultation of February 2009 is for a 20 per cent. increase to the carbon saving obligation on energy suppliers, to set an enhanced ambition of 185 MtCO2 by March 2011. As a market mechanism, it is at energy suppliers&#146; discretion how they choose to meet this more ambitious target. Insulation remains one of the most cost effective measures at their disposal to promote. Of suppliers&#146; savings towards their current targets in the first nine months of the scheme, 62 per cent. came from insulation.</p>

 The likely effect of offshore wind farms on fish stocks and commercial fisheries is being considered at a strategic level as part of the Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The SEA Environmental Report published on 26 January 2009 for public consultation noted various potential effects on the marine environment including on fish stocks arising from reductions in fishing effort through the presence of wind turbines and other installations. These effects are similar to those found in marine protected areas and are an active area of research, which the Department is monitoring. The SEA consultation period closed on 22 April 2009 and the Government will publish their decision on the draft plan for up to 25 GW of new offshore wind, including any proposals for future research, later in the year. It should also be noted that site-specific studies of such impacts are currently a requirement of the FEPA licence awarded to developers for individual projects and will need to be included in any Environmental Impact Assessments for future wind farm projects.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what entitlement a young person who has left the care of a local authority has to access personal information held on them by that local authority; what guidance is issued by his Department to local authorities in responding to requests for such information; and what redress is available to a young person whose request does not receive a response within a reasonable time.

 Under the Data Protection Act 1998 adults who have been in local authority care as children are entitled to access the personal information held on them. Guidance on the Data Protection Act for social services was issued by the Department of Health in 2000. This highlights the need for local authorities to take a sensitive approach in sharing information with adults about their care history and for authorities to provide them with appropriate support during this process. The planned revision of the Children Act statutory guidance which we will be consulting on later this year provides us with the opportunity to update the existing guidance for local authorities, and to promote examples of good practice.</p>

 The report "Safer Children in a Digital World" of the Byron review into Children and New Technology, published in 2008, identified a need for people who work with children and young people to have greater skills and knowledge in order to promote e-safety. To enhance the levels of workforce knowledge and skills, the Children's Workforce Network has since recommended that promoting e-safety should be part of core skills and knowledge for everyone working with children and young people. We have asked the Children's Workforce Development Council to consider this recommendation as part of the review they are undertaking of the common core of skills and knowledge for the children and young people's workforce.</p>

 As part of its pledge of support for the Learning Outside the Classroom (LOtC) manifesto, the Department, working with representatives from across the full range of organisations providing learning outside the classroom, has developed the LOtC Quality Badge. It is awarded to providers of any size who have pledged to engage in an on-going process to sustain high quality learning outside the classroom. For those organisations that provide activities that are deemed to have a lower requirement in terms of risk management there is a new &#145;Code of Practice'. This route includes an online self assessment and guidance, with a 10 per cent. sampling of Quality Assurance visits. Nine manifesto sectors for example, heritage, natural environment and arts and creativity, have champion trainers whose role is to lead training events for organisations interested in achieving the Quality Badge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="90427w0033.htm_para4"><a name="0904281000171">This is not a compulsory scheme. However, we hope that providers will see the benefit of the Quality Badge in reviewing and improving their own offer. It provides a framework for organisations to work in partnership with schools, youth groups and local authorities, and be confident they are providing inspirational experiences that meet young people's needs.</p>

 Non-maintained special schools have access to certain departmental capital and revenue funding streams. However, most funding for NMSSs is raised through fees for pupil placements paid by either local authorities or individual parents. The criteria used to allocate funding are dependent upon the funding stream. Where the funding stream is available to all NMSSs the most usual criteria used are: the number of pupils in a school, the number of pupils for which a school is approved or, in the case of funding relating specifically to teachers, the number of teachers with particular experience and qualifications. Where an application or bid is required for a funding stream then the application or bid has to meet the specific criteria applicable to that stream. Departmental funding is paid directly to NMSSs by the Department.</p>
