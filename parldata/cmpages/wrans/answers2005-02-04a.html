To help local authorities achieve their own targets Defra&#039;s Waste Minimisation Fund was set up in 2002.

 There have been underlying changes to the provision for and the funding of under fives which mean it is not meaningful to give per pupil funding over time. These include the abolition of flat rate nursery vouchers and changes from a nursery formula based on the number of eligible pupils in an area, to a formula based on the number of nursery places made available in an area. Additionally, authorities have been increasing provision to meet the commitment to universal nursery education for all three and four-year-olds and in recent years LEAs have been funded for extra pupils to allow them to reach universal provision.

 Funding for maintained special schools is provided through local authorities. The majority of local authority funding is provided by government with the rest from council tax.

It is for each authority to devise and revise its own school funding formula taking into account local needs and circumstances.

If the penalty is not paid or a court hearing requested within this time then a fine is registered against the individual. The evaluation of data from the pilots of penalty notices for disorder showed that payment of fines added to the penalties paid on time resulted in an overall payment rate of 70 per cent.

The national payment rate is currently (Q3 2004&#150;05) at 80 per cent., up 9 per cent. on the same period last year, and performance is on trajectory to meet the 78 per cent. national target at the end of the year. The ongoing work of the Programme includes improving the intelligence available to enforcement teams through a variety of information-sharing measures, national implementation of the new legislative framework for enforcement provided by the Courts Act and taking the opportunity offered by the launch of HMCS to introduce more effective and efficient ways of working. The Programme has also devised and supported a series of nationally co-ordinated fine enforcement blitzes, with the most recent&#151;&#039;Operation Payback 2&#039; in November 2004&#151;resulting in a positive impact on the payment rate of &#163;1.7 million.

1. Figures include duplicate encashment and manipulation/counterfeit losses for all benefits, not just the State Pension.<br>

2. We use a methodology assuming a constant proportion of the &quot;at risk&quot; figure being fraudulent and a constant amount of fraud due to counterfeits and manipulations. The &quot;at risk&quot; figure for a 



given period is the estimated value of all books stopped and not recovered in that period. This is the best estimate currently available.<br>

3. Figures exclude War Pensions from 2002&#150;03 onwards because Veterans Agency (War Pensions Agency) Programme Expenditure moved to the Ministry of Defence.<br>

4. Figures exclude Child Benefit from 2003&#150;04 onwards because Child Benefit Programme Expenditure moved to the Inland Revenue.<br>

The Building Regulations Advisory Committee is establishing working parties to consider what advice to give to Government on the use of the new powers relating to sustainability and security, with a view to consultation on draft regulations in late 2005 or 2006. Other Regulations will be consulted upon and finalised in due course.

 The instructions given by the Crown Prosecution Service to the Bar regarding defence applications to cross-examine complainants about previous sexual history in rape trials are provided in the CPS Instructions to Prosecuting Advocates booklet. The booklet is published on the CPS website www.cps.gov.uk. It states:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;Sections 41&#150;43 of the Act (restriction on evidence or questions about a complainant&#039;s sexual history) were brought into effect on 4 December 2000, The House of Lords has considered this aspect of the legislation in the case of R. <i>v.</i> A. (judgment 17 May 2001).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">In that case, the House held that prior consensual relationship between the complainant and the defendant might in some circumstances be relevant to the issue of consent. However, all the Law Lords accepted that the complainant must not be treated unfairly. The judgment emphasises &quot;the presumption of exclusion&quot; under the Act. Consequently, advocates should encourage the court to consider section 41 in the context of the judgment overall To do otherwise may lessen the practical effect of the reforms contained in section 41.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">It is essential that advocates are robust in dealing with applications under section 41 and that the correct procedure is followed to ensure that inappropriate questioning does not take place.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">If the court grants leave to cross-examine a complainant about previous sexual history, it will be essential to review the position relating to special measures. It may be necessary to make an application to the court for one or more of the special measures provided by the Act or to apply to vary a pre-existing direction&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w18.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_113">In addition, the CPS instructs experienced counsel in rape cases ensuring that scrutiny of defence applications, if made at trial, to admit evidence of previous sexual history takes place and inappropriate applications are countered, robustly.

 Under legislation the rules governing meter-readings are the responsibility of the independent regulator, Ofgem. Under their supply licences, gas and electricity suppliers are obliged to ensure that customers&#039; meters are physically read and inspected once every two years, although suppliers will seek to read meters more frequently. Where meter-readers are unable to read the meter, the supplier will estimate usage, and this will be reflected in the bill. Customers may provide their own meter readings instead of accepting an estimated bill. The supplier must accept that reading.

 We welcome the work by the US Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) which is a necessary measure to ensure transparency and accountability in the spending of Iraqi oil revenues. The SIGIR report examines whether the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) established and implemented adequate managerial, financial and contractual controls over disbursements made to Iraqi Ministries. The report states that CPA accounting procedures were insufficient.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w22.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_139">CPA procedures were deficient by the standard of western governments, but the SIGIR report must be considered alongside the following points:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">The difficult operating conditions in Iraq, which meant that procedures were sped up to get Ministries up and running and reconstruction projects off the ground. The alternative would have been to institute a system that could have delayed expenditure for months.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">The progress made by the CPA in improving financial management in the Iraqi Ministries and of the budget process. The CPA introduced a transparent framework for management of the national budget and took measures to improve reporting and recordkeeping. But implementing measures took time, which was inevitable given the total lack of transparency under the former regime.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50204w22.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_140">In addition the SIGIR report does not tally with the report by the UN-mandated International Advisory Board (IAMB) into CPA management of the Development Fund for Iraq (FPI). The IAMB was set up to oversee audits of the DFI and ensure that the objectives set forth in UNSCR 1483 were met.
