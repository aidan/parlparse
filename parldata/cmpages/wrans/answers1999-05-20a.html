<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will take steps to establish a Committee of Privy Counsellors to inquire into the circumstances of British involvement in the conflict in Serbia.  [83832]
<P>

<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1999]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the reply I have given to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) today, column 401.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hague: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will appoint a Committee of Privy Councillors to review the way in which the responsibilities of the Government in relation to British policy towards Kosovo were discharged in the period leading up to the start of the NATO action on 24 March, taking account of all such factors in previous years as are relevant, and to report; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will set up a Cabinet Committee on the provision of cancer treatment in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [84235]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government is firmly committed to improving the provision of cancer treatment in the UK and has made it one of its highest priorities. All people, wherever they live, should have access to high quality cancer services. This was the aim of the Calman/Hine report "A Policy Framework for commissioning Cancer Services". However, when the Calman/Hine principles were adopted in 1995, no machinery to monitor progress was established. We are now rectifying that omission.
<P>

<a name="90520w01.htm_para0">We have established a National Cancer Forum with a remit of acting as the focus for maintaining the strategic oversight of the Calman/Hine cancer services implementation programme, and to advise Ministers on specialised issues related to cancer.
<P>

<a name="90520w01.htm_para1">Other UK countries are represented on the National Cancer Forum and have similar strategies and initiatives to improve cancer services, and Ministers take a keen interest in progress.
<P>

<a name="90520w01.htm_para2">In recognition of the importance of cancer to the Government's agenda, we are also holding a high level cancer seminar today at 10 Downing Street. Those attending will cover the spectrum from prevention, screening, treatment, research, voluntary organisations, patient perspective and NHS implementation. The purpose of the seminar is to review where the UK's 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 1999 : Column: 402</I><P>
performance stands in comparison to other countries, to consider the action we have already taken and are taking, to improve performance and identify further action to be taken in pursuit of our objectives. Our intention is to look across the complete pathway of the disease, from research to hospice care and from prevention to the application of the latest treatments.
<P>

<a name="90520w01.htm_para3">I do not believe a Cabinet Committee would improve the Government's ability to address this important issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if it is his policy to assist in the development of a single economy and a single political unity within the European Union.  [84212]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 No. As I said in my speech in Aachen last week, this Government has made huge strides in improving Britain's relations with Europe. We will engage with Europe to push forward on the economic reform agenda, making ourselves more competitive, developing a European defence capability and a co-ordinated approach to foreign policy issues. I believe we need to integrate when necessary and decentralise where possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) of 7 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>476-77</i>, on the Bilderberg Group, what official (i) transport and (ii) funds have been used to facilitate attendance at Bilderberg meetings of members of his Government; which members have attended meetings; what reports they have made on the meetings; and what subsequent communication they have had with others attending on subjects discussed at the meetings.  [84213]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As far as I am aware, only one member of this Government--the Defence Secretary--has attended a meeting of the Bilderberg Group. He provided a detailed account of his attendance in answers to the hon. Members for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) on 23 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>609</i>, and for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) on 20 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>434</i>.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what methods are used to identify and recruit MI6 personnel; and if he will make a statement.  [84630]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Secret Intelligence Service recruits a wide range of staff, including specialists, graduates and school leavers. Before an offer of appointment is confirmed, candidates are vetted to the highest level of security clearance, known as Developed Vetting. The Service adopts, as far as is practicable, the civil service code of practice on recruitment, to ensure that the procedures used are as open and as fair as possible. Recruitment policies are kept under constant review and a number of improvements have been made over the past three years to ensure that they remain effective and that a wide range of candidates is able to apply.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister how many civilians have been killed as a result of the use of <i>(a)</i> British and <i>(b)</i> NATO weapons in operation Allied Force against Yugoslavia.  [84644]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As I said in the House last week, we do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties and minimise damage to civilian property. The cases of injury and death among civilians which have nevertheless occurred by accident have been acknowledged by NATO and are deeply regretted; they are a regrettable consequence of having to use force to stop the violence which Milosevic has unleashed against the people of Kosovo. They stand in contrast to the deliberate murders and brutalities of the Milosevic regime. Verification of civilian casualties is not possible as access to sites is controlled by the Milosevic regime. Alleged evidence of fatalities claimed to arise from allied action should therefore always be treated with great caution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hayes: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his oral answer of 12 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 315, if he will make a statement on the progress of his review into the way in which war widows pensions relate to housing benefit.  [84665]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin7"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1999]:</i> The mandatory disregards for War Disablement and War Widows' Pensions that already exist in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit recognise the special nature of these pensions, and ensure that the pensioners receive preferential treatment. For example, a war pensioner can have between &#163;10 and &#163;181 a week of his pension disregarded on a statutory basis.
<P>

<a name="90520w01.htm_para4">We will keep this under review, but further extending existing disregards is not a main priority: A full disregard of War Disablement and War Widows' Pension in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit would cost in the region of an additional &#163;70 million a year.

<P>

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his oral answer of 12 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 318, what was the basis for his statement relating to rural representation in the House.  [84666]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w01.htm_spmin8"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1999]:</i> The Boundary Commission defines as county constituencies those that are "primarily rural". 170 county constituencies are held by Labour, compared with 135 by the Conservatives and 32 by the Liberal Democrats.

 The functions of the Secretary of State for Wales which will be transferred to the National Assembly for Wales on 1 July are listed in the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999.

<P>

<a name="90520w03.htm_para2">

<BR>
1. To ensure 100 per cent. security for prisoners in high and top risk categories.
<BR>
2. To ensure at least 99.5 per cent. security for prisoners in medium and low risk categories.
<BR>
3. To ensure that the number of significant breaches of order and control does not exceed 7.1 per 100 prisoners.
<BR>
4. To introduce a system of booked visits to a prison establishment by march 2000.
<BR>
5. To increase the target number of hours of constructive activity undertaken each week by prisoners by 3 per cent. from 22.85 hours to 23.5 hours.
<BR>
6. To offer sentence planning to all eligible prisoners and to achieve a 50 per cent. uptake.
<BR>
7. To achieve an average of 5 days training and development per member of staff.
<BR>
8. To ensure that the average cost per prisoner place does not exceed &#163;83,426 <sup>1</sup> 
<BR>
 <sup>1</sup>  This figure is higher than in 1998-99, as the number of staffed prisoner places has reduced to 1,597 as a result of the closure of 2 Blocks at the Maze. The number may alter again during 1999-2000 in the light of developments. The target net operating costs for 1999-2000 are 3.4 per cent. lower in real terms than the target net operating costs for 1998-99, excluding the exceptional redundancy costs in both years.

<P>
<a name="90520w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has no responsibility for the harassment and nuisance issues arising from fireworks.
<P>

<a name="90520w03.htm_para6">Firework incidents that occur in the street during the November firework season and require treatment by A&E departments are recorded in the DTI's census of firework injuries, which is conducted over a four-week period covering the run-up to 5 November and a few days afterwards. The summary report of firework injuries treated during the 1998 firework season--a copy of which is in the Library of the House--shows that there was a 12 per cent. drop, from 256 in 1997 to 226 in 1998, in hooligan-related injuries.
<P>

<a name="90520w03.htm_para7">The Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997, among other things, introduced controls on the supply of certain fireworks, including some types that are most often misused.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90520w03.htm_para8">It is a requirement in law that any commercial explosive, including fireworks be classified by the Health and Safety Executive before it is imported into the UK. It is also a requirement under section 40(9) of the Explosives Act 1875 for explosives to be authorised. The conditions for authorisation have been published by the HSE. In the case of fireworks, authorisation is conditional on compliance with the requirements of British Standard 7114:1988. This is also a requirement under the Firework (Safety) Regulations 1997 which are enforced by Local Authority Trading Standards officers.
<P>

<a name="90520w03.htm_para9">If satisfied with an application for classification, the HSE issues a Competent Authority Document assigning the fireworks to an appropriate Hazard Classification and United Nations Serial Number. The details of each classified firework are held on a database and published as a list from time to time. The Competent Authority Document also acts to authorise the fireworks but this is subject to the fireworks meeting the relevant conditions for authorisation. Any firework not meeting these conditions would be considered not to be Authorised.
<P>

<a name="90520w03.htm_para10">The HSE has enforcement powers under the applicable classification regulations and will take appropriate action where unclassified or unauthorised fireworks are found in the UK. Checks for compliance are made as part of the normal duties of the explosives inspectorate such as 



<P>

inspection of explosives factories and magazines, checks of transport activity, liaison and support to local authorities and investigation of incidents and complaints.

<P>
<a name="90520w03.htm_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is expected that fireworks will feature in Millennium celebrations, but it is not possible to predict patterns of use. DTI officials are currently working on a publicity strategy to address firework safety issues for the 1999 firework season and the Millennium celebrations. Discussions are also taking place with the fireworks industry about the period when fireworks should be sold and other safety issues associated with the use of fireworks over the Millennium.

 The Director-General of Electricity Supply and my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State have duties under the Electricity Act to protect the public from dangers arising from the generation, transmission or supply of electricity. The Director-General of Gas Supply and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have duties under the Gas Act to protect the public from dangers arising from the conveyance of gas through pipes or the use of such gas. Regulations made under these Acts, including the Electricity Supply Regulations, make further provision for these matters.
<P>

<a name="90520w04.htm_para0">The Department has no specific powers to regulate the plans of gas, electricity or telecommunications companies for asset replacement. Various aspects of the statutory or regulatory framework within which these industries operate may, however, constrain these plans. In general, the regulatory requirements focus on the outcomes which must be achieved; it is for the companies themselves to consider any implications for their asset replacement policies and act accordingly.
<P>

<a name="90520w04.htm_para1">The Gas, Electricity and Telecommunications Acts, other relevant legislation and licence conditions also provide appropriate protection for certain relevant matters for national interest reasons, in particular security of supply and maintenance of supplies or communications in emergencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 15 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>299</i>, what methodology will be used to assess the impact of the fuel duty escalator on transport emissions and when an accurate assessment of impact will be prepared.  [81619]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90520w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We draw on a number of forecasting techniques to estimate the impact of the fuel duty escalator on emissions. These techniques principally focus on the long-term, since the fuel duty escalator is a long-term policy. Our forecasting methods are kept under review, and adjustments are made as and when improved techniques or new data become available.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para8">To some degree all these methods rely on statistical analysis of historic data, and we suspect that we will need a number of further years' traffic and emissions data before we can make a definitive short-term assessment of the impact of fuel duty increases since 1996. Even then, such an assessment will remain reliant on forecasts of what would have happened had the increases not been implemented, and will not pick up the full effects of the policy which will only become apparent over the longer term. Work in this area continues, and we will make available short-term estimates to complement the long- term estimates we have already published, once these can be provided with an acceptable degree of reliability.

<P>
<a name="90520w05.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I am today publishing the first results of the National Land Use Database (NLUD). This shows that there are around 33,000 hectares of previously developed vacant and derelict land in England of which about a third could be recycled for housing. Another 23,000 hectares are currently in productive use but are planned or expected to become available for redevelopment. Together, this is capable of accommodating more than 710,000 dwellings.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para9">The Government's target is that 60 per cent. of additional homes should be built on previously developed land or should utilise existing buildings. We have always said that this target is tough but achievable. Latest figures show that we had reached 56 per cent. by 1996.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para10">The results of NLUD are a snap-shot in time and provide only part of the information about the position in reaching the target. The stock of land and buildings available for recycling is continually being added to, as well as being developed for housing and other purposes, and these changes have to be fully taken into account. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has therefore asked the Urban Task Force to review the future availability of recycled land and buildings, taking account of the NLUD data. The Task Force expects to present its report at the end of next month.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para11">Everybody has to have the opportunity of a decent home in which to live. New houses have to be built but in a sustainable way which helps put new life into our towns and cities, makes best use of land and does not squander the precious resource of our English countryside. Policies to achieve these objectives were set out in our revised Planning Policy Guidance note 3: <i>Housing</i>, which was issued for consultation at the end of March.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para12">Today's publication represents the first step towards a comprehensive National Land Use Database which my Department is developing in partnership with local government, English Partnerships and Ordnance Survey.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para13">The statistical bulletin released today gives national and regional results for different types of land, with information about planned uses and assessments of suitability for housing. Some results are also being made available for individual local planning authorities.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para14">This information will be valuable to all those concerned with planning and urban regeneration, including the regional planning conferences--who will be setting regional targets for the re-use of previously developed land for new housing, English Partnerships--who are doing further work on key sites, and the Regional Development Agencies and local authorities who have a key role in supporting the development of previously used sites.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para15">I want to thank local authorities for their splendid efforts in helping us assembly the new database. The data will be useful to them as well as us in seeking to make the very best use of recycled land. The intention now is to build on this work by working with them to develop a system to keep the information up to date, and to expand the scope of the database to encompass all land uses.

In particular, my Department participates in an International Energy Agency technology procurement agreement which includes a project to bring forward semi-conductor (Light Emitting Diode) traffic light technology. The first UK site trial was started last summer. Savings in both energy and replacement costs of as much as 60 per cent. are predicted but no firm figures are yet available. The trial was actively encouraged by the Highways Agency who formed a partnership, to promote this technology, with Bristol City Council and the manufacturer.
<P>

<a name="90520w05.htm_para17">Since then the traffic light developed from that trial has been approved against the national specification. Several local authorities have already installed the new signals.

 Plastic wastes are usually regarded as non-hazardous waste under Council Regulation (EEC) No.259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community. Imports of such waste for recovery is subject to commercial controls only, and information is not therefore collated by the competent authorities. Nor is the information available on the imports/exports database held by the Department of Trade and Industry, since the entry that covers plastic "waste" also includes a large number of substances which are not waste.
<P>

Based on evolving experience with the operation of Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committees, and the relationship between their work and that of Local Research Ethics Committees, the Department of Health is currently conducting a review of policy and practice with the intention of issuing revised guidance later this year.

 Some primary care pilots include a National Health Service trust as a provider of patient services. Otherwise, general medical services and general dental services are provided by independent, self- employed contractors to the NHS. General ophthalmic services and pharmaceutical services are also provided by independent contractors, including single-handed practices, and local and national chains of opticians and chemists.

 National Health Service trusts may wish to set up telephone inquiry numbers for a variety of reasons and it is up to them to decide whether to use freephone numbers. An individual inquiry line will be set up to meet the needs of a particular set of local circumstances that may be relatively short-lived; the numbers will therefore fluctuate. NHS trusts are not required to notify the Department when they set up (or discontinue) such a line.

 The information requested is not available centrally. The New Deal on Junior Doctors' Hours monitors working hours compliance on a six-monthly basis according to whether or not junior doctors comply with a range of hours controls, including rest periods. Since 31 December 1994, there has been a requirement that no junior doctor should exceed a maximum average of 56 hours a week actual work. Data collated from regional task forces' reports is as follows:

 In 1996, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) evaluated an epidemiological study by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit. This study, undertaken on behalf of this and five other Government Departments, investigated the incidence of leukaemia near 20 high power TV/FM radio transmitters in Great Britain. The study found that living close to a transmitter was not associated with an increased risk of leukaemia. In their statement (copies of which are available in the Library) COMARE reiterated their previous advice that there is no firm evidence of a carcinogenic hazard from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from television and radio mast emissions.
<P>

<a name="90520w08.htm_para4">The Department is currently contributing to the World Health Organisation International Electromagnetic Fields Project, which includes health effects of electromagnetic fields and is funding studies investigating possible biological effects from EMF generally. A three-year study in the United Kingdom of occupational exposure to radiofrequency fields, including those from TV and radio transmitters, was launched in November 1998. The Department is supporting this study.

<P>

<a name="90520w10.htm_para1">

<BR>
As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question on total expenditure on gas and electricity by the public sector.
<BR>
The ONS does not publish information for Public Sector expenditure on gas and electricity. It does however publish information for such expenditure by General Government, which is the Public Sector excluding Public Corporations.
<BR>
This information is published in 'United Kingdom Input-Output supply and Use Balances, 1992-96', and is on each year's table 5. The product numbers are 85 for Electricity Production and Distribution and 86 for Gas Distribution. General Government expenditure on these products is shown in the 'Total Intermediate' column.
<BR>
The data are consistent with the 1998 edition of 'United Kingdom National Accounts' (The Blue Book).

Both publications are available in the House of Commons Library.

 The Treasury Solicitor has ensured the availability of extensive training in the Civil Procedure Reforms, both to case officers involved in litigation and to those in his client departments responsible for pre-litigation conduct and for provision of instructions. The culture introduced by the reforms is wholly consistent with the aims of the Government Legal Service for litigation to be resolved speedily wherever possible and for Alternative Dispute Resolution techniques to be used in appropriate cases. The Treasury Solicitor and his staff welcome the opportunity provided by the new Rules to devote to litigation resources proportionate to the importance of the issues raised.

 This is an operational matter for the Police Service. There is a nationally agreed Association of Chief Police Officer's (ACPO) Pursuit Code of Practice and work is going forward to implement recommendations from the recent ACPO report on police pursuit driver training. It is already policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off. Operational measures to avoid pursuits or curtail them include the use of helicopters, the early deployment of tyre deflation devices across the carriageway and tactical containment in which a number of police vehicles box in the target vehicle and bring it safely to a halt.

 Article 15 of The European Convention on Human Rights enables any High Contracting Party in the circumstances laid down in the Article to take measures derogating from its obligations under the Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. Under Article 15, the Government have derogated from Article 5(3) of the Convention in respect of powers of detention under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. Before coming to a decision in 1999 on renewal of that Act, I took into account all related matters, including the recommendation of the Act's Reviewer, John Rowe QC, who concluded in his report on the operation of the Act in 1998 that there is a continuing need for the statute for a further year. There is no record of any communication either to or from the United Nations special rapporteur with responsibility for human rights and states of emergency since I became Home Secretary in 1997.

 I understand that, at the end of April, 1,176 cases were awaiting review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and 444 cases were under active review. I also understand that for cases completed in April (other than those which the Commission determined did not meet the eligibility criteria laid down by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995), the average length of time taken, from receipt of the application to reaching a decision on the case, was 332 working days. The Commission has 14 members, some of whom work part-time, and it currently employs 60 staff.
