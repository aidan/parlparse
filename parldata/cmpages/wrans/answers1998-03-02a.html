<P>
<a name="80302w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 February 1998]:</i> The City of London Corporation asked my office informally last autumn whether we would be content for Chancellor Kohl to be presented with the Freedom of the City of London. I did not initiate this process, but I was delighted that they wished to do this. Following confirmation from my office that I was content and Chancellor Kohl's own agreement, the Corporation formally agreed a recommendation to this effect on 4 December 1997. Since 1 January this year, my office has been in contact with the Corporation authorities on the practical arrangements, including my own involvement.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his oral answer of 24 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 182-83, on Iraq, which of the Arab ambassadors whom he met on 23 February expressed the gratitude of their Government for the British and American stance on the threat of military action against Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Ambassadors acknowledged the key role which the UK had played in the success of the UN Secretary-General's mission which, we hope, marks the resumption of full Iraqi co-operation with UNSCOM. It is also widely recognised, in the region and elsewhere, that this would not have been possible without the threat of force.

Negotiations continue with some contractors on their final accounts and it is not possible to estimate the final building costs until all these accounts have been settled. Nor is it possible, for this reason, to estimate the value of the contracts by the specific geographical areas set out in the question.

 The Government recognise the seriousness of the offence of clocking. A voluntary mileage recording system, administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, was introduced in 1992. Recent changes to the vehicle registration system have brought about a welcome increase in compliance. A review to consider whether this system should become mandatory has concluded that there should be no change at present. The subject will be kept under review in the light of further experience of the voluntary system.

 No. The Directive does not change the rights of insulin-dependent diabetics to drive the large majority of vehicles in the private and light goods category. We do not believe that a concessionary rate of Vehicle Excise Duty would be appropriate in these circumstances, especially since the keeper--who is responsible for paying VED--and the driver of a vehicle are not necessarily the same person.

 Under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, it is unlawful to deposit, recover or dispose of controlled waste without a waste management licence, contrary to the conditions of a licence or in a way which causes pollution of the environment or harm to human health. Where someone purports to be carrying out an activity which is exempt from waste management licensing but fails to comply with the conditions of the exemption, that person may be prosecuted under section 33 of the 1990 Act for carrying out a licensable activity without a licence. The Environment Agency is responsible in England and Wales for the enforcement of these provisions.
<P>

<a name="80302w02.html_para6">The conditions of the current exemption for the landspreading of specified wastes are set out in paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. The Water Research Centre and the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) have been commissioned to develop further the criteria that determine in what circumstances the spreading of particular wastes benefits agriculture or result in ecological improvement. The original research project has been extended by the Environment Agency and is now expected to be completed by the end of April 1998.

<a name="80302w02.html_para7">We intend to review the scope and conditions of the current exemption in the light of the results of the research project with the aim of ensuring that the objectives of protecting the environment and human health continue to be fulfilled. The Environment Agency has made no recommendations to the Department on the revision of the current exemption; and we have been advised that no such recommendations will be made until the research project has been completed and the Agency has considered its findings. For these reasons, no decisions have yet been taken on matters such as pre-notification or the submission of information.
<P>

<a name="80302w02.html_para8">Most landspreading of waste is carried out under the terms of the exemption from waste management licensing to which I have referred.

The Coastguard Agency and the Marine Safety Agency (MSA) have been consulted about the project's development and have given support, with the proviso that they can offer no financial assistance and only limited resource assistance, other than the occasional meeting. MSA also express an initial reservation about the value of the Vessel Traffic Management Information System (VTMIS) aspect of the project. This is because an information service such as this could give a wrong perception that all shipping movements in the area were under observation and that this could relieve participants of some of their obligations for their own safety.

 The resources my Department makes available to local authorities for housing purposes are generally not hypothecated for expenditure on particular policies. It is for local authorities to determine their own priorities in targeting the resources available to make the best use of the housing stock in their areas. To assist local authorities and increase investment in housing, we have made additional resources available through the Capital Receipts Initiative for housing and housing related regeneration.
<P>

<a name="80302w05.html_para2">My Department has provided a grant of &#163;102,000 to the Empty Homes Agency for the period 1995/96-1997/98 to work with local authorities to develop and implement empty property strategies. By April 1998, we expect some 200 authorities to have strategies in place. Subject to Parliamentary approval of my Department's estimates, we have agreed to provide a further three-year grant to the Agency to work with authorities to bring more redundant commercial property into residential use and to make better use of empty properties in rural areas. We are also considering how economic instruments could be developed to help meet sustainable development objectives, including maximising use of existing buildings.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his policy in respect of the use of leaded petrol by vintage and veteran vehicles; and if he will make a statement. [32033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w05.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Despite concerns raised by owners of vintage and veteran vehicles about an EU proposal to ban leaded petrol from 1 January 2000, in practice very few old vehicles are unable to operate on unleaded petrol. Lead was not added to petrol until the 1920s and came into widespread use only after the second world war; it is not, therefore, a prerequisite for earlier vehicles. Nevertheless, the oil industry is developing a special grade of petrol for these and later vehicles which does not have the disadvantages to health that are attributable to lead. This grade of petrol is expected to be widely available from 1 January 2000.
<P>

<a name="80302w05.html_para5">To supplement this, the Government have negotiated a derogation for an on-going supply of leaded petrol, to a limit of 0.5 per cent. of total petrol sales, to be distributed through specialist interest groups. The Government will be liaising with organisations representing the interests of classic/historic vehicle owners and with the oil industry to ensure a smooth implementation of this provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment his Department has made of the level of pollution caused by leaded petrol relative to that caused by diesel.  [32031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w05.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government regularly assess pollution caused by road transport, having regard to the composition of the vehicle fleet and the emission standards which apply to vehicles of different types and ages. It is clear that the combustion of leaded petrol is still the largest source of airborne lead in most parts of the country, although emissions are declining as sales of leaded petrol decrease. There are no significant emissions of lead from diesel vehicles. Emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from petrol vehicles are also higher than those from diesel equivalents. On the other hand diesel vehicles give rise to larger quantities of nitrogen oxides and particulates.

 My Department played an active role in an EC expert group on microfinance in the latter half of last year. My officials made a significant contribution towards the preparation of a Commission paper "Microfinance and Poverty Reduction" which was discussed by this group. This resulted in a Resolution on microfinance that was adopted by the Development Council last November.
<P>

<a name="80302w07.html_para2">During the UK Presidency, the Commission is charged to produce additional guidelines to assist the Commission in the design and implementation of microfinance projects. My officials will be in consultation with the Commission once these guidelines have been drafted. The key objective is to ensure that EC funds used to support microfinance projects are deployed to maximum effect to assist the poor on a sustainable basis.

 Health and population is a major priority for the Department for International Development (DFID) programme in India. In the current financial year we are spending about &#163;20 million on projects to help improve the effectiveness of Indian health services; to control tuberculosis, HIV and malaria; to improve access to reproductive health care; and to eradicate polio. We are also supporting smaller scale projects through NGOs. In addition, we make a substantial contribution in this field through the European Union and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank.

 Since 1 May I have approved two ATP projects which were under consideration in my Department at the time of the Election. They are: a project to supply Land Rovers to the Zimbabwe Police and a project to improve coal handling at the Port of Tianjin in China (though that project was subsequently ruled out under the OECD's tied aid eligibility criteria). There have been no new applications since 1 May.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has funded a collaborative research project involving the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Russian Federation Academy of Sciences Centre for Demography and Human Ecology. The project, which ran from June 1996 to October 1997, investigated the rapid increase in mortality in Russia between 1990 and 1994. Male life expectancy at birth fell in this period by 6.2 years to 57.6.
<P>

<a name="80302w07.html_para4">The project has provided useful findings regarding the influence of alcohol on mortality. There is emerging evidence that binge drinking in the Russian tradition has specific effects on the heart and may be causing the very large number of cardiovascular deaths among men of working age. A <i>Lancet</i> article, outlining the project's findings in August 1997, attracted considerable interest and comment and is to be summarised in the 1998 WHO World Health Report.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1998 : Column: 443</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80302w07.html_para5">The results of the research project have been widely disseminated in Russia. A conference was organised in Moscow in the autumn of 1997, which involved senior health policy and decision makers from federal and regional bodies. The conference, which took note of the social and economic stress that people in Russia are under, identified alcohol as a key priority for Ministry of Health action.
<P>

<a name="80302w07.html_para6">Following on from this work, DFID has recently approved funding for a 2 year collaborative study to examine the determinants of mortality in the Former Soviet Union.

<a name="80302w08.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Most developing countries are on track to implement their obligations under the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) by the year 2000. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are likely to request an extension of their implementation period beyond the agreed time frame up to 2006. The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) has primary responsibility for providing technical assistance to developing countries in the implementation of TRIPs, supported in some areas by WTO and UNCTAD. My officials are planning to visit WIPO, UNCTAD and WTO in April to discuss their programmes and to identify possible areas for collaboration. We will focus in particular on how TRIPs should be implemented and monitored with a view to maximising the beneficial impact on poor people.

[31538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w08.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK believes that the implementing agencies of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) could do more to integrate biodiversity and other global environmental issues into their mainstream operations. We have supported calls to this end made at past Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The UK, in co-ordination with other donors, will continue to push for better integration at the Fourth Conference of the Parties. Decisions on how to take the issue forward subsequently will be a matter for the Conference of the Parties itself.
<P>

<a name="80302w08.html_para2">The UK will also continue to press for better integration of biodiversity by the GEF's implementing agencies at the governing Council of the GEF and in the respective governing bodies of the agencies concerned. Detailed decisions on how best to integrate biodiversity into mainstream operations rest with the agencies' governing bodies.

It is impossible to identify what expenditure the Community Legal Service will involve before proposals have been fully developed and decisions taken in the light of the response to consultation on these proposals.

<a name="80302w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The information is given in tables, copies of which have been placed in the Library. For most of the departments and agencies covered, the costs shown are the costs of the contracts placed for the systems concerned, using estimates for any variable elements. Costs which are spread over several years have been aggregated. The costs cover externally-provided hardware, software and implementation costs and may, in addition, cover other costs such as training where this was purchased as part of the initial contract. The costs of in-house project development are not included. Support and on-going maintenance costs are excluded. For the Inland Revenue, special factors have required the use of different conventions, most notably the inclusion of in-house development costs. Such differences have been footnoted.
<P>

<a name="80302w10.html_para0">A major computer system has been taken to be one whose costs, on the basis described above, exceed &#163;1 million. On this definition, the Royal Mint, the Registry of Friendly Societies, the National Investment Loans Office and the Debt Management Office (which will be formally established on 1 April 1998) have not purchased any major computer systems and do not expect to do so in 1998-99.

 The UK is a major source and recipient of international investment. A successful Agreement will provide investors with extra confidence in making investment decisions.

 ECGD's role is to encourage UK capital goods and project exports by providing insurance against the risks of not being paid by overseas customers.

Any exports which need an export licence, but do not have one, are not eligible for ECGD cover.

<P>
<a name="80302w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Coal use for electricity generation in the UK was 54.9 million tonnes in 1996 and 47.0 million tonnes in 1997. Power station emissions of sulphur dioxide in 1996 were 1,371,000 tonnes. 1997 figures for emissions are not yet available.

<a name="80302w11.html_para4">The sulphur content of coal used in power stations varies widely, from below 1 per cent. to more than 2 per cent. but figures for the average sulphur content are not available. Sulphur dioxide emissions depend on the use of flue gas desulphurisation equipment as well as on the sulphur content of the fuel used. A small proportion of the 1996 emissions was from oil fired power stations.
<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After wide consultation throughout the UK, the Government Statistical Service submitted proposals for a revised NUTS structure to Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, in July 1997. A copy of the proposals was deposited in the House of Commons library. Those proposals included the classification of Staffordshire as a single NUTS-2 area.</FONT></UL>

These figures include expenditure on both coast protection and sea defence.

 Avon and Somerset Police Authority will have a total spending power of &#163;167.4 million in 1998-99, an increase of &#163;6.1 million or 3.8 per cent. over 1997-98.

<a name="80302w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Bill places duties rather than powers on youth offending teams. Stopping young people offending usually involves challenging several aspects of their lives. That is why the youth offenders teams will co-ordinate the provision of youth justice services in their area in accordance with the local youth justice plan. Team members will supervise and enforce community penalties. Staff of the relevant local agencies will work together as an integrated team to challenge young people's offending behaviour.

 A new duty on local authorities to provide bail support for juveniles awaiting trial or sentence, together with measures to speed up the youth justice process, should help to reduce the pressures on existing secure accommodation. The Government's review of all forms of juvenile secure accommodation, which will be completed shortly, will inform decisions about the best use of that accommodation and whether there should be any further expansion in local authority secure accommodation, which is expected to reach 460 places by the end of 1998.

<P>

<a name="80302w14.html_para0">We also encourage other non-statutory schemes which are designed to protect young people from unsuitable material such as the working group of representatives from the Internet Watch Foundation and Internet Service Providers which is devising a common ratings system for United Kingdom internet Users, the voluntary Code of Practice which requires newsagents to refuse to sell 'adult' magazines to persons under the age of 18, and the Teenage Magazine Arbitration Panel (TMAP) which seeks to regulate the contents of teenage magazines.

 As part of our radical reform of the youth justice system, we will introduce a new Parenting Order which will encourage parents to accept their responsibilities for the behaviour of their children.

 The public, police officers and local councillors have all indicated that alcohol-related crime and disorder including that involving underage drinkers, is a significant problem. We have implemented the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 and will be legislating to clarify the law relating to adults buying alcohol for children and the use of children in test purchases. The Anti-Social Behaviour Order and other provisions in the Crime and Disorder Bill will also help with specific local problems.

<P><I>2 Mar 1998 : Column: 474</I><P>

The Prison Service has a well developed and well respected strategy for caring for prisoners who are at risk of suicide or self-injury. This applies equally to contractually managed prisons as well as directly managed prisons. The suicide awareness strategy involves the identification and support of those prisoners who are considered to be at risk. Every prison has a multi-disciplinary suicide awareness team which meets regularly and oversees the implementation of the strategy in their establishment. The suicide awareness strategy in

all establishments is audited by the Prison Service standards audit team and the Inspectorate of Prisons consider the strategy in their inspections of establishments.
<P>

<a name="80302w16.html_para5">Staff in establishments work closely with the Samaritans, who befriend prisoners in distress through visits to prisons and by telephone. The Samaritans are also actively involved in setting up listener/befriender schemes in prisons where selected prisoners are trained to provide peer group support for fellow prisoners in distress. Listener schemes provide a valuable contribution in reducing the likelihood of suicide and self-injury. The Samaritans' involvement in contractually managed prisons varies from full involvement in the listener scheme to visiting prisoners in distress.
<P>

<a name="80302w16.html_para6">The Suicide Awareness Support Unit (SASU), in Prison Service headquarters, examines each death in prison custody to see whether lessons can be learned. They also provide advice and support to establishments, particularly those which are experiencing a cluster of deaths.

<a name="80302w16.html_para7">I recently convened a meeting with a range of representatives from interest groups concerned about suicides in prisons.

<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> Employment is at the top of our priorities for the UK presidency. It fits in well with the key elements of the Conclusions at the Luxembourg Special Summit on Employment which included agreement on the 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1998 : Column: 476</I><P>
Employment Guidelines and a funding package to support employment initiatives. Our task is to convert the Conclusions into action.
<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para0">The Employment Guidelines provide a more focused approach to tackling unemployment and form the basis of National Action Plans. As Presidency we are encouraging Member States to produce national action plans by mid-April, both to ensure that the Guidelines are given practical effect and so that there can be early discussion and analysis of their content. We intend that there should be a discussion of the Action Plans at the Cardiff European Council in June. We intend to produce and publish the UK Employment Action Plan considerably in advance of the deadline.
<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para1">We also aim to make rapid progress in agreeing and implementing the employment related European Parliament financial package and welcome the opportunity to take forward work on demonstration projects, for which the European Parliament has provided 12 mecu in 1998. These projects will promote the exchange of experience and good practice to show which employment policies and initiatives work best.
<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para2">In addition, we are developing employability as the overarching theme in the Social Affairs/Education arenas. The Joint Informal in March aims to develop a better understanding of the concept of employability and the issues that affect Member States in making a reality of the idea, as well as exchanging information and good practice.

[25121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 There is no minimum sum of units of employment which have to be created or saved for the European Commission to make grants from its Regional Development Fund or its European Social Fund to the Community or the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para3">The European Commission negotiates programme plans with each Member State showing targets for the volume of outcomes expected (e.g. jobs created or saved, number of people going into self-employment or further training or further and higher education). Progress towards targets is monitored and evaluated as appropriate.

<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para4">Although past programme or project performance may have a bearing on the likelihood of future funding from Europe, there is no "minimum requirement" in terms of jobs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what proportion of young people within the Gateway period for the New Deal have criminal records.  [29296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Each New Deal programme is designed to offer help to all those who become eligible. The claimant unemployment statistics do not provide information on previous criminal records.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what percentage of <i>(a)</i> young unemployed and <i>(b)</i> long-term unemployed participants in the New Deal are expected to lack basic literacy and numeracy skills.  [30487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Adult Literacy in Britain Survey, published last year, suggested that around a third of unemployed people have serious difficulty with literacy and numeracy. The claimant unemployment statistics do not provide information on the literacy or numeracy skills of claimants. All participants on the New Deal for 18-24 year olds will have access to help to enhance basic skills if they need it. The New deal for long term unemployed people aged 25 or over will focus on helping people who have been unemployed for two years or more to find work. The programme also contains provision for people to enhance their skills to help their return to work, which may include help with basic skills.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much expenditure on the New Deal for <i>(a)</i> young and <i>(b)</i> long-term unemployed people in 1998-99 is expected to be directed to raising basic literacy and numeracy skills; and how many participants are expected to benefit from such assistance, at what average cost per participant.  [30488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Help to raise basic skills will be available to young people on the New Deal for 18-24 year olds during the Gateway and in each of the options, according to individual circumstances and needs. Help to enhance basic skills will be available to every New Deal participant who needs it, as we intend to tailor provision to meet individual needs. We do not have numerical targets for the numbers who will benefit from basic skills related provision.
<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para5">The New Deal for long term unemployed people aged 25 or over will focus on helping people who have been unemployed for two years or more to find work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Since April 1997, the jobmatch programme has been available to 18-24 year olds who have been unemployed for two years or more. Within the New Deal for 18-24 year olds, jobmatch will be available during the Gateway to help young people who have been

In addition, local New Deal partnerships will be able if they choose to provide jobmatch opportunities through the New Deal follow- through strategies for young people who, having completed New Deal options, continue to need additional help to find work.
<P>

<a name="80302w17.html_para6">Jobfinder's grants will continue to be available to those aged 25 and over who have been unemployed for two years or more. Each local New Deal partnership has the discretion to provide grants to very long-term unemployed people aged 18-24.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Sawford) on 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>507</i>. Young people are already being helped to take up work in the voluntary sector in the New Deal Pathfinder areas. Examples of work that participants are currently doing include working at a local Citizens Advice Bureau in Swansea; working in a local charity shop in Cornwall; working on a Prince's Trust Volunteers' project in Lambeth; and conservation work in Tayside with the Scottish Wildlife Trust. All are receiving training towards approved qualifications.

<P>
<P>

 From the start of the advertising in mid February until June, it is planned to spend: &#163;5 million on TV advertising; &#163;500,000 on national press advertising; &#163;340,000 on local radio; and &#163;100,000 on local press advertising in June.

 It is not possible to predict exactly the number of lone parents who will participate in the New Deal for Lone Parents, since participation is voluntary.

 Bids from organisations to provide work placements for 18-24 year olds on the Environment Task Force (ETF) option of the New Deal for young unemployed people are assessed against a national scoring system. The scoring system covers the quality of the proposed work placements, training and job-search activities for participants, as well as assessing projects against a set of environmental objectives developed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). Organisations which provide ETF placements must produce a quality plan which includes specific employability and environmental objectives and measurable outcomes, as well as details of the organisation's proposed method of assessing and measuring quality. The Employment Service will monitor these arrangements, with advice from DETR and Government Offices for the Regions, as part of their annual review of the performance of contractors. An element of the organisation's placement fee will also be related to employability and environmental outcomes.

 In 1997-98, all children are eligible for nursery education grant for the three terms before they reach compulsory school age. The dates used to distinguish when children came into scope for the grant were set at 1 September, 1 January and 1 April because many local education authorities already use similar dates for their own purposes. We have since consulted on the dates which should be used to define compulsory school age, and hence the end of the period of eligibility. Seventy-six per cent. of respondents thought that the proposed dates of 1 September, 1 January and 1 April were appropriate. These eligibility dates, which come into effect from September 1998, do not affect providers' ability to admit children earlier.

 The Government have accepted the Dearing Committee's recommendation that student loan repayments should be made on an income-contingent basis and collected, where possible, through the tax system. New arrangements are being introduced for students entering higher education in Autumn 1998 and after. Students with loans under the current scheme will continue to repay them on the existing basis.

<a name="80302w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We shall shortly lay before the House regulations to increase National Health Service charges in England and Wales from 1 April 1998. The prescription charge will increase by 15p, from &#163;5.65 to &#163;5.80 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed. This represents a reduction of 0.1 per cent. in real terms.

<a name="80302w19.html_para7">The charges for prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &#163;30.10 for a 4 month certificate and &#163;82.70 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than 5 items in four months or 14 in one year.

<P>

<a name="80302w19.html_para11">Optical voucher values and supplements will increase by 2.8 per cent. This will maintain the purchasing power of the vouchers given to children and those adults eligible for help with the cost of spectacles and contact lenses.

infection following the immunisation. We are not aware of any concerns about the toxicity of the vaccine which is subject to batch testing prior to release by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. Recognised serious adverse reactions are very rare and occur much less frequently than those that occur after natural rubella infection.
<P>

<a name="80302w19.html_para15">It is recognised that joint pains are among the most common side-effects of natural rubella infection, particularly in women. Joint symptoms are also reported 10 to 28 days after immunisation against rubella but usually last only a few days. Such reactions are actually very rare in children and ongoing arthritis is not a recognised side effect. A number of recent studies have looked at the association between rubella vaccine and arthritis and there is increasing evidence becoming available that there is no increased risk of new onset chronic arthropathies or neurological conditions in women receiving rubella vaccine.

 Current regulations do not require mandatory clinical testing of all new joint replacements. They require that all medical devices placed on the market after 14 June 1998 should bear the CE marking demonstrating that the device in question complies with the essential requirements for safety. For all joint replacement implants, clinical data will be part of the evidence required to demonstrate compliance. This information may be generated from a clinical trial of appropriate duration or from existing data on an equivalent product.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w20.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> The Government Car Service provides my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State with a dedicated car and driver under the terms of a contract. Junior Ministers are provided with cars from 20 Squadron Royal Logistics Corps. Their costs reflect the amortised rate, including capital costs, fuel, lubricants and repairs.
<P>

<a name="80302w20.html_para0">On this basis the estimated costs of Ministerial cars and drivers is as follows:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) 1997-98 (full year): &#163;194,797.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80302w20.html_para1">The 1997-98 (full year) costs are a projected estimate. The larger increase in costs between 1996-97 and 1997-98 essentially reflects pay awards, the replacement of aging and unreliable cars with leased vehicles and additional costs related to the fact that ministerial constituencies are now situated further from London.
<P>

<a name="80302w20.html_para2">The costs of taxis used during the corresponding years are not held separately and information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Staff are aware, however, that the most effective and economical form of travel should be used. Taxis should therefore be used only in the most exceptional circumstances, and only if the expenditure can be justified.

An assessment of those requirements was therefore taken into account in the evaluation of the proposals and offers for the site.

 The undeclared landing of fish subject to quota is an illegal activity and it is not possible to make a meaningful estimate of the extent to which it occurs. The UK Fisheries Departments are, however, determined to prevent such landings which undermine the measures taken to conserve fish stocks and threaten the long-term future of the fishing industry.

 Long-term trends in net farm income are normally presented as indices because of the changing sample of the Farm Business Survey. However, set out in the table are the equivalent monetary values. Owing to a change in the definition of farm types, data for years before 1987 are not wholly comparable with the more recent data. Data for 1987-88 are given on both farm type definitions to give an indication of the degree of change.

<P>
<a name="80302w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Rules on the labelling of farm produce are harmonised in the EC. Generally, the place of origin of any food must be given if omitting it could mislead the purchaser about the true place of origin of that food. More specifically, regulated fresh fruit and vegetables are required to be marked with the country of origin at all points of sale by EC marketing standards regulations. In October last year we launched the Beef Labelling Scheme which provides for the accurate labelling of beef. With effect from 1 April any beef labelled with country of origin information must have derived from animals born, reared and slaughtered in that country. It is envisaged that national origin labelling of beef will become compulsory by the year 2000.

 The Government's policy is to seek the decoupling and eventual phasing out of production linked subsidies; some of the savings could then be used for specific targeted rural development and agri- environmental measures. The proposed integration of rural and agri-environmental policies within the EAGGF guarantee section, as put forward under the Agenda 2000 paper on CAP reform, will lay the basis for an eventual

<P>
<a name="80302w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The White Paper "The Food Standards Agency: A Force for Change" (Cm 3830) explains in some detail the Government's proposals for ensuring that the Agency will operate at arm's length from Government and independently of any sectoral interests while remaining accountable to Parliament through Health Ministers. In particular, the Agency's guiding principles will be set out in legislation, and Ministers' powers of direction over the Agency will be exercisable only if it appears to be acting outside the terms of its specific legal framework. The Agency will have the right to publish the advice it gives to Ministers, whether or not the Government agree with that advice.
<P>

<a name="80302w23.html_para0">The Agency will be led by an independent Chairperson and up to 12 Commissioners who will be appointed on the basis of their proven track records and a majority of whom will come from a wider public interest background. The Commission will act collegiately to further the aims and objectives of the Agency in accordance with its guiding principles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w23.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Diseased or unsightly fish are not likely to be landed because they are not marketable. Information on landings of diseased fish is not therefore collected. The Department does, however, undertake a regular programme of surveillance of fish stocks for disease.
<P>

<a name="80302w23.html_para3">The percentage of plaice, cod, flounder, herring, haddock and skate with obvious disease signs is very low, usually less than 1 per cent. Information on huss is not recorded. Dab are unusually susceptible to disease and in localised areas the prevalence may be up to 10-15 per cent., although in the majority of these fish the signs of disease would not be apparent to the untrained eye. In some areas of the North Sea such as the Western Dogger Bank, up to approximately 20 per cent. of dab exhibit varying degrees of abnormal pigmentation but it is not known whether this constitutes disease and no causative agent has been found.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80302w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government do not classify disabilities in the manner described. Social security benefits are awarded because a person satisfies the entitlement conditions; these vary depending on the benefit claimed. Disability Living Allowance, one of the main benefits available to help disabled people with the extra costs incurred because of the effects of their disability, is based not on specific disabilities, but on their need for help with personal care and/or mobility.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many representations she has received from <i>(a)</i> hon. Members and <i>(b)</i> others, since 1 May in support of re-establishing the link between pensions and average earnings; and if she will make a statement.  [27479]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Department does not maintain statistics in the form requested. Since 1 May, we have received 827 written representations from hon. Members enclosing letters from their constituents about Retirement Pension. A good number of the constituents' letters supported the restoration of the link between State pensions and average earnings.

<a name="80302w25.html_para0">Over 2,000 written responses were received by the Pensions Review as part of its public consultation exercise. 652 of these responses, of which 6 came from hon. Members, supported the uprating of State pensions in line with the rise in earnings. We also received two petitions in support, with 199 and 48 names respectively.
<P>

<a name="80302w25.html_para1">We recently announced that, from April, the basic pension will rise to &#163;103.40 a week for a couple and &#163;64.70 for a single pensioner. This is in keeping with our manifesto commitment to uprate the basic pension at least in line with prices. For the first time, the basic pension for couples goes up to over &#163;100. This was in line with the 3.6 per cent increase in prices in September which was higher than expected and the cost will be greater than was included in the previous Government's expenditure plans.
<P>

<a name="80302w25.html_para2">The Government are determined that pensioners will stay warm in their homes this winter. On 25 November last year, the Government announced additional help of &#163;400 million over this winter and next to provide extra help to pensioners towards their fuel bills. Full details were announced on 5 January. This announcement will enable pensioners to heat their homes confident in the knowledge that they will receive extra help with their heaviest fuel bills. Pensioners receiving Income Support, or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance where the award includes one of the pensioner premiums, will receive &#163;50. Other pensioner households, where someone is receiving a qualifying benefit, will receive at least &#163;20. Where there is only one eligible person in a household, they will receive &#163;20, otherwise each will receive &#163;10.

 We are committed to retaining SERPS as an option for those who wish to remain in it.

<P>

<a name="80302w25.html_para5">The extra safeguard, introduced from 9 February, has been designed to provide adjudication officers, making decisions about entitlement as part of the Benefit Integrity Project, with a wider range of information about a claimant's current need for help with personal care and getting around than that provided by the claimant's statement alone. We want to ensure that people do not, unnecessarily, have to go through the review and appeal system to secure their proper entitlement. The extra safeguard will not be retrospective.
