<a name="20326w01.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Saville Inquiry</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Blunt:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the cost of the Saville Inquiry to his Department has been to date; and what his current estimate is of the final cost of the whole inquiry. [46024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne:  </B> 
The cost of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry to the Northern Ireland Office, as at 22 March 2002, is #56.8 million. The current estimated cost of the Inquiry to the Northern Ireland Office is #120 million.
<P>

<a name="20326w01.html_para0">The #20 million increase as compared with the figure given on 17 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 40W, is accounted for by two factors. First, an estimated #15 million of net additional costs arises from the transfer of the hearings to London this September. Secondly, the Senior Costs Judge's judgment of 21 March implies additional expenditure of, on best current estimates, around #5 million on solicitors for the families; expenditure on costs arising from this case is expected to run into several hundreds of thousands of pounds.
<P>

<a name="20326w01.html_para1">If my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's challenge to the Senior Costs Judge's ruling on payments to counsel for the families is unsuccessful, that will add an estimated sum of at least #6 million to the estimated #120 million cost.
<P>

<a name="20326w01.html_para2">These figures do not include costs to other Departments such as the Ministry of Defence.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Blunt:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he expects Lord Saville to report his findings. [46023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne:  </B> 
Publication of the report is a matter for the independent Tribunal. Based on my current understanding of the Inquiry's future timetable, I do not expect the Tribunal to publish its report before 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McNamara:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland further to his answer of 26 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 757W, on the Saville Inquiry, how much public funding has been provided to the legal representatives of other parties represented at the Saville Inquiry, broken down by each <i>(a)</i> barrister and <i>(b)</i> firm of solicitors involved. [41239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Browne:  </B> 
The answer of 26 February set out the amount of public funding that has been provided to the legal representatives of the families and the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The majority of the other parties represented at the Inquiry have their legal costs met through the Ministry of 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 788W</I><P>
Defence. The public funding made available to these parties is therefore a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence.
<P>

<a name="20326w01.html_para3">The Tribunal has allowed certain persons limited legal representation during the course of the hearings. The costs of this representation are paid by the Inquiry. In addition a large number of witnesses have received legal assistance at the statement-taking stage and have had the costs of this met by the Inquiry. The cost of this assistance and representation therefore falls to my Department.
<P>

<a name="20326w01.html_para4">Much of the assistance to witnesses has been provided by solicitors to the families: insofar as it has been, the costs are included in the payments to the solicitors concerned shown in the parliamentary answer of 26 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 757W. However, a large number of other lawyers from across the United Kingdom and beyond have also been involved in providing assistance to individual witnesses or representing those additional persons referred to above. Given the numbers of lawyers involved it is taking a little time to compute the amounts paid to the individual teams. I will undertake to write to my hon. Friend with this information as soon as possible. A copy of the letter will be placed in the House Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much work from her Department has been given to Andersen Consulting formally known as Arthur Andersen in each year since 1992. [46221]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt:  </B> 
Contracts agreed with Andersen Consulting were listed in my reply to my Friend the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) on 11 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 61W. Information on contracts for the five years prior to May 1997 is not centrally available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<i>(e)</i> press conferences which have been sponsored by her Department and which took place on non-departmental premises in each of the last four years giving the title, purpose, date and cost of each. [34300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt:  </B> 
My Department uses the mechanisms that are the most appropriate and effective in communicating with specific audiences, including all those listed in the question. Some of these events are held on Departmental premises and others at different venues. But no central records are kept that would enable the information requested to be supplied, and it could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the total real terms expenditure of her Department, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies on publicity in each of the years <i>(a)</i> 1997&#150;98, <i>(b)</i> 1998&#150;99, <i>(c)</i> 1999&#150;2000, <i>(d)</i> 2000&#150;01 and <i>(e)</i> 2001&#150;02 (i) to date and (ii) as estimated for the whole of the present year; and if she will break these figures down to indicate expenditure on (A) advertising and (B) press and public relations.

<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Waterson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many warning letters were issued as a result of investigations by the Insolvency Service in each year since 1997. [42071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
The number of warning letters issued were as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997: 582
<BR>
1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998: 549
<BR>
1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999: 385
<BR>
1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000: 287
<BR>
1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001: 228.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20326w01.html_para5">The numbers reflect better policy guidance provided to Official Receivers in 1997&#150;98, who have focused investigatory resources on the more serious offences and director disqualification, both of which lead to court hearings and convictions rather than resulting in warning letters.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Waterson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what checks are in place to ensure an agreed high standard of correspondence is achieved when the Insolvency Service communicates with customers. [42068]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many rogue directors have been reported on the Insolvency Service hotline since its inception; and how many of these <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> as a percentage of total calls have resulted in successful prosecutions. [42076]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w01.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
By 28 February 2002, 2,978 calls had been received which generated 1,167 substantive complaints. The remaining complainants failed to provide the information requested in support of their complaints.
<P>

<a name="20326w01.html_para6">By that date, 31 related convictions had been obtained and a further 27 written warnings had been issued. 563 remain under investigation and 450 were not proceeded with due to insufficient evidence.

There are several reasons why a letter may not receive an answer within my Department's target of 10 days.

Management of the B30 facility is an operational matter for BNFL subject to regulations by the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (HSE's NII). The effective management of the facility and the historic legacy wastes it contains is a high priority for both the Government and BNFL. BNFL is taking forward a range of work programmes at B30. These are aimed at improving the way the building itself is cared for as well as characterising the contents of the building and retrieving these and converting them into a more stable form.

<a name="20326w02.html_para2">The Department's selective assistance database shows that in the last five financial years to 31 March 2001, 242 offers of Regional Selective Assistance or Enterprise Grant were made in England to firms in the textile sector. Of those which received payments of grant and were subject to conditions of the grant offer letter, 10 firms ceased trading. Eight of these firms went into liquidation. In the other two cases, one closed without notice after receiving #8,000 grant. The second, involving grant of #825,000 was subject to a Management Buy Out and remains active in the UK.

None. BNFL has a minority investment in the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) project, the feasibility of which is currently being studied. I look forward to seeing the results in due course.

<P>
<a name="20326w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Wilson:  </B> 
CISWO collaborates with Sport England in many areas in preparing bids for National Lottery money for projects that will develop or enhance local sporting facilities. Such activity is not formalised as a partnership and does not have job creation as an objective although extra employment opportunities may be created. CISWO is associated with seven RDA projects and, as before, although job creation is not a central feature, there has been, for example, an education project in Yorkshire has created five jobs and a similar number at a project in the West Midlands.

CISWO has not received any Government funding in any of the last five years. CISWO was given a cash endowment from the Bristol Coal Corporation upon the Corporation's privatisation in 1994 and, in addition, between 1994 and 1999 received under covenant #1 million per annum from the successor mining companies to the Corporation.

In October of last year the Chair of the Trustees of CISWO wrote to me seeking a meeting to discuss funding. In January of this year I attended a presentation given by the Chief Executive and a number of the organisation's trustees and at that presentation I undertook to give careful consideration to CISWO's concerns over their future funding requirements.

Asteroid 2002 EM7 was first observed on 12 March 2002, four days after it had passed within 500,000 km of the Earth, a distance greater than that between the Earth and the Moon. The object had not been detected previously because its approach had been from the direction of the Sun. Observations have determined that the object takes 323 days to orbit the Sun, and that its next close approach to the Earth will occur on 1 July 2011, at a minimum distance more than eight times greater than that of 8 March 2002. The size of 2002 EM7 is estimated to be between 50 and 100 m.

The Working Group, which includes representatives from the Coal Authority, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the Association of British Insurers, the Law Society and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, met for the first time last month.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of Postcomm proposals for Consignia and the introduction of competition into postal markets ahead of European proposals. [46230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Alexander  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]: </i>The Government's priority is to ensure the universal postal service and this is Postcomm's primary statutory duty. In exercising its functions Postcomm must act in accordance with its primary and other statutory duties including compliance with EU obligations.
<P>

<a name="20326w03.html_para4">Currently EU legislation allows member states to reserve certain mail services to universal service providers but only to the extent necessary to maintain the universal service. There are maximum limits to the services that may be reserved; but there is no minimum and some EU countries have determined either that they no longer need to reserve services or that the level of service they need to reserve is lower than the maximum limits.
<P>

<a name="20326w03.html_para5">Discussions are in progress to amend the current European Postal Directive with regard to the further opening to competition of Community postal services and when the new Directive is adopted the Government will consider with interested parties what action is necessary for its transposition in the United Kingdom.

<i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]: </i>Postcomm was the first body to have a collegiate approach to regulation in the UK. This approach aims to de-personalise regulation and bring a greater range of expertise to bear on regulatory decisions. The experience of the Commissioners was outlined in a press release by this Department on 6 November 2000, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

The costs to business of the implementation of the Directive were assessed in a Regulatory Impact Assessment published in 1999 when the Maternity and Parental leave etc. Regulations 1999 were introduced in the UK. At this time, the total costs to business were estimated to be #42 million per year. A further Regulatory Impact Assessment was made when the parental leave regulations were extended in January 2002 to include parents of children aged under five on 15 December 1999. The costs to business of this extension were estimated to be between #7 million and #41 million. Copies of both Regulatory Impact Assessments were placed in the Libraries of the House on publication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w04.html_spnew9"><B> Alan Johnson:  </B> 
When the Working Time Directive was implemented in October 1998 the broad immediate cost to business was estimated at #1.9 billion. This was increased by #0.4 billion when the paid annual leave entitlement rose from three to four weeks in 1999, and by #30 million with the removal of the 13 week paid annual leave qualifying period in October 2001. The reduction in the record keeping requirements resulting from the 199 amendments to the Working Time Regulations reduced these costs by #13 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w04.html_spnew10"><B> Alan Johnson:  </B> 
The Pregnant Workers Directive was adopted in October 1992, and included measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding. It included, in particular, provisions entitling workers to minimum periods of maternity leave and setting minimum standards for pay or allowances during maternity leave.
<P>

<a name="20326w04.html_para8">The UK already had in place various statutory provisions for maternity leave and pay prior to the Directive. Some changes were subsequently made as a result of the Directive, and other changes have been made, for unrelated reasons, in the intervening years. The Government has therefore made no recent assessment of the costs of the Directive on its own.

An assessment of the costs of implementing this Directive was made in the Regulatory Impact Assessment which the Government published alongside the Part Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000. A copy was placed in the Libraries of the House on publication, and is available on the DTI website at www.dti.gov.uk/er/review.htm.

The Department commissioned an independent report into the costs associated with introducing the European Works Council Directive based on a survey of companies with experience of operating such Councils. The results of this study were incorporated into a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), a copy of which is available in the Library and on the DTI website.

The benefits in terms of improving industrial relations, boosting

<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 803W</I><P>
productivity and facilitating change would be felt in the longer term and could not be separately quantified. The costs to individual firms of organising European Works Council meetings were expected to range from #47,000 per year to #175,000 depending on the size of the undertaking. This represents a very small proportion of their turnover, and a valuable investment in improved employer-employee relations.

The Department for Trade and Industry implemented the rest periods and health assessment provisions of the European Directive on Young Workers in respect of those aged from minimum school leaving age to 18th birthday, through the Working Time Regulations 1998. Around 18,000 young workers were estimated to be affected by the implementation of health assessments for adolescent night workers; the costs are estimated to be minimal.

I have reviewed the provisions in place for BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce and have decided to agree to the following changes. In the case of BAE Systems, we have agreed to remove the provision allowing the appointment of a Government Director; to change the current requirements that all Executive Directors are British to a requirement that a simple majority of the Board, including the Chief Executive and any Executive Chairman, are British; and to remove the aggregate foreign shareholding limit. In the case of Rolls-Royce, we have agreed to change the current requirement that 75 per cent. of the Board are British to a requirement that a simple majority, including the Chief Executive and any Executive Chairman, are British; to allow the appointment of a non-British non-Executive Chairman; and to remove the aggregate foreign shareholding limit. There will be no change in the requirements that no individual foreign shareholder, or group of foreign shareholders acting in concert, can hold more than 15 per cent. of the shares in either company. These provisions ensure that neither company can fall under foreign control.

<P>

<a name="20326w07.html_para6">The following formula has been adopted to determine these allocations. First, each authority receives #53,000. Second, each county council receives #12,000 in respect of each shire district within the authority's boundaries. These flat-rate payments account for some 65 per cent. of the aggregate grant in recognition of the fact that every authority, regardless of size and population, must incur similar unavoidable costs in conducting the basic emergency planning function. The remainder of the total grant (approximately 35 per cent.) is then distributed according to the Bellwin threshold in recognition of the fact that population size provides a rough proxy for the scale of the emergency planning that authorities need to undertake.

<a name="20326w09.html_spmin3"><B>The Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State: </B> 
Cabinet Office does not employ staff full-time on Bloody Sunday Inquiry work. Since 28 January a few staff have spent a small amount of time dealing with issues relating to the Inquiry, but they absorb this task into their normal duties, so staff time costs are not separately calculated. It is not possible to forecast the final cost to the Cabinet Office because of the uncertainties.

Guidance on inspection under the Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC) system was issued by the Department of the Environment in 1995 in additional guidance note reference (AQ4(95)). In 2000 local authorities were publicly listed which undertook an average of less than 0.5 inspections per process in a year. In 2001 the threshold was raised to one inspection. Letters were sent on 8 November 2001 to the chief environmental health officer of most of the relevant local authorities; a further four authorities were written to on 28 February 2002. I am placing a copy in the Library of the House. All except two of the local authorities written to on 8 November have responded with improvements they intend to make to their inspection performance. My Department is in contact with the remaining two authorities over their responses. I expect the letter to local authority chief executives to focus the minds of local authorities on the importance of carrying out sufficient process inspection in undertaking their LAPC regulatory functions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley:  </B> 
The interim rules for livestock movements, which we announced on 5 February, allow greater flexibility for farmers to move their animals. The 20 day standstill rule has been waived for some types of movement, subject to conditions and we will continue to keep these arrangements under review. However, veterinary advice is that the 20 day standstill needs to remain in place for the time being as a disease control measure. A copy of a document explaining the Veterinary basis for the Interim movement rules has been placed in the Library of the House and is available on the DEFRA website.

<i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]: </i>Movements of farmed livestock within the European Community are subject to harmonised animal health rules which are implemented into national legislation. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 831W</I><P>
These rules set down the animal health conditions that must be met before such animals can be certified for export and they provide for checks to be made on the animals at their premises of destination. The Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health keeps the rules under constant review and introduces safeguard measures as necessary to address animal health problems across the Community. Imports into Great Britain of animals susceptible to foot and mouth disease resumed in November 2001 and since then we have been carrying out 100 per cent. post import checks on all such consignments.
<P>

<a name="20326w12.html_para0">Imports of livestock from non-EU countries are also covered by EU rules. Imports are prohibited from countries where there is a known animal health risk. Imports from approved countries must enter the Community via an approved border inspection post where the consignments are subjected to physical, identity and documentary checks.

<P>
<a name="20326w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher:  </B> 
The Government's strategy, as set out in <i>Waste Strategy 2000,</i> is based on minimising the production of waste and maximising the levels of re-use, recycling and composting of the waste that is produced.
<P>

<a name="20326w12.html_para2">The Regulatory Impact Assessment in Annex C of Part 2 of <i>Waste Strategy 2000</i> (Cm 4693&#150;2) outlines a wide variety of different waste management scenarios. Variables include different mixes of waste management facilities, different levels of participation in kerbside recycling schemes, and different projections for the increase in municipal waste arisings. There are therefore no single estimates for the level of incineration in these years.

I have been asked to reply. The Millennium Declaration endorsed the Millennium Development Goals, a set of 2015 targets for poverty reduction. We worked hard to get UN agreement to these goals and all of the work of my Department is aimed at reaching these Goals. The Millennium Declaration also called on industrialised countries to reduce trade barriers for least developed countries, debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries, and increased development assistance, particularly for countries with large numbers of people in poverty and effective pro-poor policies.
<P>

<a name="20326w12.html_para3">My Department has also worked hard with others in the Government to achieve agreement at Doha to a trade round which creates significant opportunities for developing countries and poor people. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative has led to over $50 billion in debt relief being granted to qualifying countries. This Government has increased UK Official Development Assistance by a third in real terms since 1997. We are committed to making substantial further progress towards the UN 0.7 per cent. target in the next spending round. At the UN conference on Financing for Development in Mexico last week, the European Union announced a commitment to increase average Official Development Assistance as a proportion of gross national income to 0.39 per cent. by 2006, an increase of $7 billion.

Charges to cover the costs of local enforcing authorities in regulating processes which are subject to Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 were introduced in April 1991. Interim charges for processes which are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 were introduced in August 2000.
<P>

<a name="20326w13.html_para0">With the approval of the Treasury, and following consultation with local authority associations and industry, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has made revised schemes for England in respect of Environmental Protection Act and England and Wales in respect of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act. The schemes specify the scale of fees and charges to take effect from 1 April 2002.

<P>

<a name="20326w13.html_para1">The fees and charges in both schemes have been increased by 1.8 per cent., broadly in line with inflation. However, my Department is writing to local authorities to advise them that if there is not much more widespread adoption of cost accounting practices for LAPC over the next six months this increase may be rescinded at the next review of the charging schemes later this year.
<P>

<a name="20326w13.html_para2">The schemes will be laid before both Houses and copies placed in the Libraries.

As Head of the Judiciary, the Lord Chancellor investigates complaints about the personal conduct of both full-time and part-time judicial office holders. He does not, however, investigate complaints against solicitors who are part-time Judges when the complaints relate to their work as solicitors, as this is a matter for the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors and ultimately for the Law Society. The Lord Chancellor has no disciplinary powers in relation to solicitors. If a solicitor who is a part-time judicial office holder is subject to such a complaint, he or she is required to inform the Lord Chancellor's Department of the outcome. The Department is aware of four such complaints in the past 12 months.

The Investment Approvals Board (IAB) will have a broadly similar role to that of the Equipment Approvals Committee (EAC), which it will replace on 2 April. Its membership will consist of the Chief Scientific Advisor (Chair), the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, the Second Permanent Under Secretary of State, the Chief of Defence Procurement and the Chief of Defence Logistics. The IAB, like the EAC, will advise Ministers on major equipment and other investment projects. It will also have responsibility for the scrutiny and approvals processes for investment decisions on all non-equipment investment projects as well as equipment projects, including those considered by delegated approving authorities. It will be a major part of the IAB's task to ensure that proposals for Defence investment are soundly based and deliverable through robust project management and Smart Acquisition processes. There are no changes to the existing arrangements under which Ministers take and announce decisions on major projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon:  </B> 
It remains the case that we believe it is as yet premature to decide on acquiring ballistic missile defences to deploy either for defence of the UK or of deployed forces. But we have carried out a range of studies focused on assessing the threat and the feasibility of the technology available to counter it, and continue to do so. A Pre-Feasibility Study was completed in June 1996, and an extension to it was carried out during 1997 and 1998 at a cost of #300K. The Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme (TRRAP) was carried out between 1998 and 2001 at a total cost of #12.5 million. A further programme of work beyond TRRAP to look further at the main technical risk areas it identified, and at the feasibility of defending against more complex and longer range threats, is underway. Studies are also assessing the significance of any capability gap in defence against theatre ballistic missiles, including the role that active theatre missile defence systems might play. The total cost of the current work in this financial year is #3.6 million. This work is due to continue until March 2003 with a similar level of financial provision.

<a name="20326w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon:  </B> 
The United Kingdom regards the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. We remain firmly committed to the Treaty and also to the Final Document agreed at the Non Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2000. We are recognised as the most forward-leaning of the Nuclear Weapon States.
<P>

<a name="20326w15.html_para8">This Government has taken a large number of actions to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Since 1997, we have reduced our operationally available stockpile to fewer than 200 warheads. We have reduced the readiness of our nuclear forces with only a single Trident submarine on deterrent patrol, carrying 48 warheads against a previously planned ceiling of 96 warheads per submarine. We have signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and continue to promote its entry into force, and we are still pressing for negotiations to begin at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty.
<P>

<a name="20326w15.html_para9">In addition to the measures set out above, we have signed and ratified the relevant protocols to both the Treaty of Raratonga (South Pacific Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone) and the treaty of Pelindaba (African Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone). We have placed fissile material no longer required for defence purposes under international safeguards, have been more transparent about nuclear and fissile material stockpiles and begun a national accounting for fissile material produced. We have also begun a programme to develop UK expertise in verifying the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons internationally.

We do not collect central records of all cases in which the Human Rights Act 1998 is relied on. Human rights are now integrated in the general law and are rarely the sole basis for a challenge.

<P>

<a name="20326w16.html_para0">We do not collect separate information centrally about the cost to public funds, legal fees or compensation payments in case which include a human rights issue. In most cases it will be difficult to single out associated costs relating to the human rights element.

To ensure that Apache contributes fully to air manoeuvre, the capability of this formidable weapon is kept under continuous review. Changes to the programme are recommended should any capability gaps be identified.

The contents of United States legislation are of course a matter for the United States Government. However, I understand that the primary purpose of the draft legislation is not the control of exports; in that respect it does not, in its current form, change the contents or the scope of the US Munitions List, though it does refer to it. It includes some policy recommendations relating to the administration of the United States' export control process but is more concerned with the funding of the United State security assistance programmes with various countries, including non-proliferation work.

A small number of British military strategic planners are providing advice to the Macedonian Ministry of Defence. These planners are led by a United Kingdom Defence Adviser to the Macedonian government, whose role is to advise on Macedonia's NATO Membership Action Plan and on improvements in the Macedonian government's ability to carry out defence planning. The UK provides similar Defence Advisors to the Ministry of Defences of other NATO aspirant nations.
<P>

<a name="20326w17.html_para0">We have a well-established outreach programme of bilateral defence assistance with Macedonia, designed to help establish democratically accountable, cost-effective armed forces that are capable of contributing to national, regional and international security.

The Armed Forces strive to provide an environment in which every individual is respected and valued and given the opportunity to realise their potential without fear of harassment or unlawful discrimination. All three Services have in place complaints procedures, issue guidance on behaviour, undertake training, and appoint Equal Opportunities advisers in every unit. They monitor results through attitude surveys, focus groups, and longer-term studies. Although the number of complaints of sexual harassment and discrimination are small the Services see no room for complacency and aim to confront unacceptable behaviour at every opportunity.

The press advertising campaign for the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) started on 2 March 2002 and is due to run until 4 April 2002. Hence no money was spent on press advertising in January and February.

The Government's latest estimate of the United Kingdom's net contribution to the European Union budget in the financial year 2002&#150;03 can be found in footnote two, table B13 (page 182) of the Pre-Budget Report (Cm5318).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w18.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
I have been asked to reply. The UK's pledge to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative Trust Fund is US$221 million; in addition, our share of the EC contribution is a further US$85 million. So far, we have paid half of our contribution (US$110 million) into the Trust Fund to help the Regional Development Banks meet their share of HIPC costs. The UK contribution is paid on an as-needed basis, on request by the International Development Association (IDA), which is administering the Fund. As more countries complete the HIPC process in the coming year, we would expect to see further disbursement of our funds.

<i>[holding answers 25 March 2002]:</i> It is not Customs law enforcement policy to disclose information on operational deployments of staff or the level or nature of checks at specific locations. However, the deployment, activities and working patterns of Customs staff at Newhaven and other locations are kept under constant review to ensure the most effective and efficient targeting of resources. Since January 2001, Customs officers operating at Newhaven have seized smuggled tobacco products with a total revenue value of around #215,500. Full details of Customs' seizures are published on a routine basis in their Departmental annual reports.

The production and sale of commodities is very important to the livelihoods of people in developing countries. For a significant number of the least developed countries commodities account for more than 50 per cent. of merchandise exports.

The situation in Zimbabwe highlights the damage caused by abusive economic and political governance to economic development in Africa. The decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth demonstrates that the leaders involved in developing NEPAD understand the damage the Mugabe regime has done to the people of Zimbabwe and to African development.

None at present. Our co-operation with southern African countries will continue to be based on our understanding of their needs and policies. We will continue to provide humanitarian and HIV/AIDS related assistance in Zimbabwe. A further decline in the Zimbabwe economy, and the food shortages there which are likely to persist into next year, will have an impact on the economies of its neighbours which all development agencies will take into account.

<P>
<a name="20326w22.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
The United Kingdom played a leading role in the preparatory process leading up to the Monterrey Conference in helping to formulate the EU position for the Conference. The EU worked hard during the negotiations of the text of the outcomes document: the XMonterrey Consensus". This is a good document, in which developing countries commit to set in place the pro-poor economic policies and good governance that is required to attract foreign direct investment and mobilise domestic resources; and donor countries commit to provide enhanced support to developing countries through providing more and better quality oda, through opening up markets to trade access in the context of the Doha process, and through ensuring that the HIPC process provides sustainable debt relief. The UK also played a leading role in developing the package of commitments announced by the EU at Monterrey, which includes a commitment to increase EU aid volume from an average of 0.33 per cent. to an average of 0.39 per cent. by 2006&#151;which represents an additional 7 billion dollars per annum. Baroness Amos and I represented the UK at the Conference itself. I chaired a round table on financing sustainable development and participated in a round table on partnerships. Baroness Amos held a press conference to publicise the DFID/HTM paper on the case for aid and participated in a round table on coherence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w22.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
In the XMonterrey Consensus" document which was agreed at the Financing for Development Conference, the nations of the world agreed that developing countries need to set in place pro-poor economic policies and good governance in order to attract foreign direct investment and mobilise domestic resources. Donor countries need to provide more and better oda; provide better market access for developing country products through the Doha negotiations; ensure that the HIPC process provides heavily indebted poor countries with a sustainable exit from debt, and take concrete steps to give developing countries a stronger voice in the international financial architecture. The UK Government, throughout the Financing for Development process, has promoted the view that development assistance should be untied and should be targeted on poor countries with large numbers of poor people and good policies; and that donors should harmonise their procedures to reduce the burden on developing country governments; should move away from stand-alone projects towards direct support through government budgets where possible; should strengthen government accounting and audit capacity

so as to enable a greater use of budget support by donors; and should provide aid in support of country-owned poverty reduction strategies.
<P>

<a name="20326w22.html_para2">The Government believes that the Monterrey Consensus, alongside the WTO Doha Declaration, provides an excellent basis for a new global partnership to tackle poverty eradication and manage globalisation so that it works for all the world's people, including the poorest. We hope that the World Summit on Sustainable Development, at Johannesburg in September, will build on these outcomes, and help to identify means of implementation.
<P>

Since the death of Jonas Savimbi we have made a contribution of #200,000 to help expand the services of Radio Ecclesia beyond Luanda to the Angolan provinces. Radio Ecclesia is the only fully independent radio broadcaster in Angola able to operate nationwide. It is well known as a key source of objective news reporting and political analysis within Angola, essential to the building of a lasting peace settlement. I plan to visit Angola next week to discuss with the Government the opportunities to achieve peace in Angola and the wider region. I had a very useful preliminary meeting with the Angolan Foreign Minister on these issues last week.

To date DFID has provided #525,000 in support of the direct costs of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue. This is supplemented by a contribution of #650,000 to the Radio Okapi project which is disseminating information on the peace process to the Congolese people, and #160,000 to assist peace and reconciliation in the Kivus. We continue to press all signatories to the Lusaka Peace Agreement to honour their commitments and work constructively towards a full peace settlement in the region. It is paramount that the delegates currently engaged in the Sun City talks avoid further prevarication and commit themselves to the critical task of reaching agreement on arrangements for a transitional government and timetable for free

<a name="20326w24.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
Between 1997 to 2001 the UK provided #89 million in development assistance to Rwanda. In 1999 the UK made a 10-year commitment with the Government of Rwanda to help their post-conflict recovery and enable them to meet the International Development Targets. We have provided around #30 million in development assistance this financial year and expect our support to continue at least at this level over the next few years.

<P>
<a name="20326w24.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
The Gaza Midwifery project was established in 1999 to improve safe motherhood by developing the capacity of the midwifery profession in Gaza. The project will have trained 27 midwives by June 2002, and plans to train a total of 89 by June 2004. The current crisis has adversely affected the implementation of training, but enrolment and graduate numbers remain over 80 per cent. of that originally envisaged.

I have not had any involvement in this case. My department worked closely with ECGD to agree a new set of business principles, including the incorporation of sustainable development criteria. My department is involved in the productive expenditure screening process for applications relating to those countries receiving International Development Association (IDA) funding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w24.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
The project in Jabalia has led to improvements in both the quality and quantity of water for household consumption. Sanitary standards have also increased as the majority of households are now connected to a new sewage network. To ensure these gains are sustained a programme of hygiene and sanitary education is being implemented.
<P>

<a name="20326w24.html_para0">The quality of the water network in Anabta has improved by 90 per cent. At least 75 per cent. of households are connected to the new sewage network. However, the current crisis is affecting the implementation of the project with equipment embargoed by the Israeli Port Authorities, and access for project staff becoming increasingly difficult.

The Palestinian Authority is responsible for planning teacher training, school development and teaching English. Between 1995&#150;2000 we have provided technical assistance in these areas. Nearly all schools in the Palestinian Authority have benefited in some way from this.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will amend poverty reduction strategy papers&#151;PRSPs&#151;so that at decision point there is scope for greater financial flexibility to take into account changing factors and amendments to the plan can be made before completion point. [45191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w24.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are country-owned documents produced by Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC), setting out how they intend to use the resources available to them&#151;including from debt relief&#151;to tackle poverty more effectively. We place great importance on this process, which involves consultation with civil society and the international donor community.
<P>

<a name="20326w24.html_para3">Under the HIPC Debt Initiative, countries receive interim debt relief once they reach Decision Point, at which stage they are required to produce an interim PRSP&#151;a road map setting out what action needs to be taken to produce a full PRSP by Completion Point. Clearly, their circumstances may have changed by the time they reach Completion Point when the relief becomes irrevocable. The UK has worked to encourage agreement that the debt sustainability of countries will be reviewed at Completion Point, and that additional relief will be provided, in exceptional cases, where there has been fundamental changes in a country's circumstances due to external adverse factors.

We and other donors are advising the Malawi Government on the necessary conditions for higher growth.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w25.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
My Department provides support to both UK-based and overseas non-governmental organisations through a number of sources, including through the Civil Society Challenge Fund and through our geographical programmes. We also have Partnership Programme Agreements (PPAs) with 11 UK-based 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 879W</I><P>
NGOs and PPAs with a further four NGOs are under discussion. Expenditure under these PPAs in the 2002&#150;03 financial year is expected to total #56,300,000. A substantial proportion of these agencies are working in localities which are either in conflict or have recently experienced conflict: peacemaking, peacebuilding and conflict resolution activities are therefore a key part of the challenge of promoting sustainable development and reducing violent conflict.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps she is taking to develop her Department's work in the field of conflict and humanitarian affairs. [44733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w25.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
Violent conflict remains one of the most important obstacles to reducing poverty. My Department is developing its work in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding both directly through our work in developing countries and with two conflict prevention pools jointly managed by DFID, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
<P>

<a name="20326w25.html_para0">More than 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are currently devastated by or are recovering from violent conflict and 20 per cent. of the continent's population live in countries affected by armed conflicts. Through the Africa Pool, an inter-Departmental strategy has been developed for conflict prevention and peace-keeping in Africa, which focuses on geographic and thematic priorities. The Strategy involves working with international partners to support African Governments and institutions to prevent and resolve conflict at country and regional level.
<P>

<a name="20326w25.html_para1"><P>

<a name="20326w25.html_para2">We have focused particular attention on securing peace and stability in Sierra Leone and contributing to the establishment of durable and lasting solutions to the conflicts in the Great Lakes and Sudan. More broadly, my Department will continue to work on building inclusive and accountable governance structures, including security sector reform, strengthening state institutions and improving people's livelihoods, all of which contribute directly to conflict prevention and peacebuilding in Africa. With regard to Security Sector Reform, working with other donors and with international organisations and institutions, my Department has been active in developing policy as well as in implementing practical reform measures.
<P>

<a name="20326w25.html_para3">We also continue to address the issues raised by the Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations, better known as the Brahimi Report, to help improve the ability of the UN to deal with complex peace operations.

<a name="20326w25.html_para5">We have also developed a methodology to help development agencies assess possible development interventions in countries at risk of violent conflict. This methodology has been endorsed and picked up by other donor agencies in their conflict prevention work.
<P>

<a name="20326w25.html_para6">DFID is also active in its support of conflict prevention work at regional and international levels and through contributions to multilateral agencies, including the United Nations and the EU. We provide core support for the strengthening of the key humanitarian agencies&#151;UNHCR, OCHA, WFP and the Red Cross family, as well as UNDP, UNICEF and the OHCHR&#151;in addition to contributing to specific appeals during emergencies. We continue to be heavily involved with humanitarian mine action, primarily through the UN Mine Action Service.

In the Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations published in August 2000 (better known as the Brahimi Report), emphasis was placed on the importance of equipping UN personnel with the necessary skills in peacebuilding and conflict prevention.

<a name="20326w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett:  </B> 
A contract has been awarded to Annes Gate Property plc, for a new development on the site of the former Department of Environment offices at Marsham Street. The contract is for a period of 29 years and involves the construction of new office accommodation, its long-term maintenance, and provision of facility management and business support services. The net present cost of the contract is around #311 million at current prices. The demolition of the existing building at Marsham Street will start as soon as possible. On current plans, completion of the new development is expected to be Spring 2005. Westminster City Council have already given planning consent for the re-development of the site which includes mixed office, residential and commercial development. The Department plans to vacate five of its existing office buildings in central London after the move to Marsham Street.

This is why the United Kingdom (UK) government has committed itself to helping establish a common European asylum system, which can respond effectively to the challenge that global movements of people present and help limit unwarranted secondary movement of asylum seekers between European Union (EU) states.
<P>

<a name="20326w28.html_para5">The Government has opted in to all the European asylum proposals to date and in doing so continues to exert maximum influence during negotiations. Of particular significance in reaching consensus on a common application of the Geneva Convention is the proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of refugees, presented by the European Commission in November 2001. One of the key aims of this draft directive is to establish a common interpretation of Article 1A of the Geneva Convention, the grounds for refugee status.

This is an increase of 1 per cent. and 0.4 per cent. respectively on the previous year. The position in the Home Office was better than the average: on 31 March 2001 women held 40 per cent. of all appointments to Home Office sponsored NDPBs, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds held 9.1 per cent.<P>

The Home Office has included the following in its objectives to be achieved by March 2005:<P>

1. XTo increase the number of women applicants for appointments to public bodies so as to achieve an interim target of 45 per cent. women appointees by 31 March 2005."<P>

2. XTo ensure that women, people from ethnic minority backgrounds and disabled people are each represented in line with these targets on the different types of bodies, and in responsibility, including the Chair and Vice-Chair."<P>

To achieve these objectives the Department will, amongst other measures:<P>

1. Employ targeted advertising to encourage under-represented groups to apply.<P>

2. Seek possible candidates using candidate lists held by other government departments.<P>

3. Continue to monitor the composition of the different types of bodies sponsored by the Home Office and the proportion of women, people from ethnic minority backgrounds and disabled people in positions of Chair and Vice-Chair.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr Ivan Lewis:  </B> 
The evaluation of the Connexions Service will build on the experience of the pilot studies using a combination of opinion surveys, impact studies and a programme identifying effective practice.
<P>

<a name="20326w29.html_para4">Opinion surveys. These will cover the views of young people including non-users of the Connexions Service and the opinions of the key stakeholders involved with each Connexions Partnership. Run annually, using a standard set of questions, these surveys will make it possible to monitor changes in views towards the Service over time as Connexions is rolled out nationally.
<P>

<a name="20326w29.html_para5">Impact studies. This component of the evaluation strategy will look in detail at Partnership activity to assess how effective the service has been in helping young people. The focus will be on the range of interventions made by a personal adviser and the intention is to track a selected cohort of young people over time to assess outcomes.
<P>

<a name="20326w29.html_para6">Identifying effective practice. The third component of the strategy is to secure prompt feedback about what works operationally and what constitutes effective practice. A rolling programme of studies will be commissioned covering specific issues relevant to the key delivery areas of the Service.

There are approximately 5,000 voluntary schools maintained by Local Education Authorities (LEAs) in England with either a religious or church-related character. LEAs' Section 52 budget statements do not identify these schools separately; it is therefore not possible to provide the information requested without incurring disproportionate costs. All LEA maintained schools are funded on a similar basis, via a local formula methodology, which is based predominately on pupil numbers, along with other specific factors which relate to individual schools' needs.

<P>

<a name="20326w30.html_para0">It is not possible, however, to identify either the total number of NVQ Level 2 students helped or the average value of financial assistance received by individuals. Information held by the Department does not differentiate between those individuals studying towards NVQ Level 2 and those aiming for other types and levels of qualification.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what her policy is on surplus places in schools; and if she will publish the numbers and percentages of surplus places for each local education authority in England [46933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms:  </B> 
Our policies are focused on raising educational standards. It is wasteful for resources to be locked into maintaining surplus places in schools. Wherever possible these should be freed up and directed towards improving standards. In planning school provision, local education authorities should look for opportunities for removing surplus capacity, with a view to bringing supply and demand for school places into better balance. Their initial focus should be on those schools with 25 per cent. or more of their places unfilled, having particular regard to standards at those schools. The overall aim should be to maximise parental preference and to provide good quality education in the most cost-effective way. The Department's annual survey of surplus places allows us to monitor how local education authorities are meeting this challenge. The Audit Commission has again drawn attention to this issue and, with District Auditors, is promoting good practice.




<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 898W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20326w30.html_para1">Local education authorities have again made progress in the removal of surplus places. The survey returns indicate that there were 699,770 surplus school places in January 2001, representing 9 per cent. of the total capacity of 7.8 million places. This is an overall reduction of 10,219 places on the 2000 figures. Since 1998 a total of 74,050 surplus places have been removed. This reduction means that more money will be spent raising school standards rather than maintaining empty buildings.
<P>

<a name="20326w30.html_para2">The following tables are based on the returns made by the local education authorities in respect of all maintained primary and secondary schools in their area. They set out the numbers of surplus places as at January 2001 for each local authority area, listing primary and secondary separately, together with the proportion that these represent of total capacity. They also highlight the numbers of schools which at that date had surplus of 25 per cent. or more, and at least 30 surplus places, together with the proportion that these represent of the total number of schools.
<P>

<a name="20326w30.html_para3">The number of schools with 25 per cent. or more surplus places has again risen for the second successive year, to 2,441 compared with 2,406 in 2000. As with the 2000 survey, the number of primary schools in this category has risen (2,139 in 2001 which represents 12 per cent. of all primary schools, compared to 2,013 (11 per cent.) in 2000) while the number of secondary schools has declined (302 in 2001, which represents 9 per cent. of all secondary schools, compared with 393 (11 per cent.) in 2000).
<P>

<a name="20326w30.html_para4">The returns also provide the Department with details of the action authorities propose to take on schools with 25 per cent. or more surplus. The returns indicate that in many cases action is being taken, or is planned. Where planning strategies are unclear in areas with particularly high levels of surplus, the Department will be following up with the authorities concerned.

Fifty-three Local Education Authorities have recently submitted proposals to the Department, seeking funding support through PFI credits for school based projects aiming to sign in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w31.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells:  </B> 
The transfer of responsibilities in respect of underwater archaeology to English Heritage is dependent on legislation to extend English Heritage's remit out to the limit of the territorial waters of the UK adjacent to England. Provision for this was included in the Government's Culture and Recreation Bill which fell before the last election, thus preventing us meeting this element of the PSA target. Similar provisions are included in Baroness Anelay's National Heritage Bill which is currently before Parliament and is receiving Government support. We are hopeful that the transfer will take place in the near future.

The Hidden Britain campaign, launched last year, highlights 14 routes through less well-known parts of Britain, including Blair Atholl and Pitlochry. In addition, the BTA's Bollywood Movie Map identifies locations throughout Britain, including Scone Palace and Brechin, which have been used in over 20 Indian films.

The White Paper XTime for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of Our Licensing Laws (Cm 4696)", published on 10 April 2000, set out our views on the problem of binge drinking and our plans for reforming the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws in England and Wales, including the hours during which alcohol may be sold or supplied to the public at public houses and other premises. The existing law establishes permitted licensing hours outside of which licensed premises may not sell or serve alcohol without the special permission of licensing justices; and their consent may only be granted in particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20326w31.html_para4">The existing fixed closing times are artificially early. They actively contribute to binge drinking at the end of normal opening time, and result in significant numbers of intoxicated people on our streets simultaneously. This in turn leads to peaks of disorder around closing times. To counter and minimise public disorder resulting from fixed closing times, we intend to introduce flexible opening hours as a condition of the 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 905W</I><P>
licences of each venue, with the potential for some to operate up to 24 hour opening on each day of the week, subject to consideration of the impact on local residents. These changes require the amendment of primary legislation and we intend to introduce a Bill to that end as soon as Parliamentary time permits.

<a name="20326w32.html_spnew12"><B> Yvette Cooper:  </B> 
The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer than one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice. There is a series of staged milestones towards this goal: new targets introduced for 2001 were a maximum one month from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer and a maximum one month from urgent GP referral to treatment for acute leukaemia and children's and testicular cancer. By 2005 there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers. Achievement of these targets will be supported by investment in workforce and equipment, and by service redesign through the Cancer Services Collaborative.

The NHS Cancer Plan sets out a series of staged milestones towards the goal that no one should wait longer than one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice. A two week outpatient waiting time standard was introduced in December 2000 and in the last quarter 95.1 per cent. of urgent referrals for suspected cancer were seen within two weeks. Standards of a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to first definitive treatment for breast cancer and a maximum one month from urgent GP referral to treatment for children's and testicular cancers and acute leukaemia came into effect at the end of 2001.

The Government have made good progress. An interim health inequalities adjustment of #130 million was introduced for 2001&#150;02 allocations. This has been extended to #148 million for 2002&#150;03, to be shared between 54 Health Authorities. The Government are also reviewing the existing weighted capitation formula used to distribute NHS funding. By 2003 reducing inequalities will be a key criterion for allocating NHS resources to different parts of the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what categories of products that are currently on sale in the UK will be left outside of the scope of the proposed European directive on traditional medicines; and if he will make a statement. [43746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w34.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears:  </B> 
There are many categories of products currently on sale in the UK which the European Commission's proposals for a Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products are not intended to cover. However, specifically in relation to products which are currently sold legally as unlicensed herbal remedies under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, 1968, there are a number of reasons why a proportion of existing products might not satisfy the terms of the proposed Directive. The most likely reasons might be: failure to meet safety or quality standards, or failure to demonstrate that the remedy or corresponding products (that is, comparable herbal medicines) had traditional use. In many such cases in should be possible for companies to make changes&#151;for example improving 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 915W</I><P>
quality standards or making adjustments to the ingredients or strength of specific products&#151;in order to comply with the terms of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="20326w34.html_para0">Subject to a successful outcome to European negotiations, the introduction of a systematic regulatory framework for traditional herbal medicines should result in improved public health protection, enhanced public confidence in herbal medicine and the continuing availability of a very wide range of remedies.

We are continuing to support the work of the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy, to improve understanding of how these deaths can be reduced. The tragedy of perinatal mortality has links with poverty, deprivation and exclusion. We are addressing these underlying causes through the XSure Start" initiative, including pilot programmes to provide personal co-ordinated support for pregnant teenagers, and parents under the age of 18. We are also investing more in the provision of maternity and neonatal intensive care and seeking to ensure the most effective configuration of these essential services.

An accurate figure for the number of websites based in the United Kingdom offering medicines for sale is not known because websites are opened and closed often with very short timespans, which makes quantification extremely difficult. Furthermore sites are often routed through many Internet Service Providers to disguise their origins. Therefore it would be disproportionate to investigate the origin of all sites.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will <i>(a)</i> collate, <i>(b)</i> evaluate and <i>(c)</i> disseminate best practice found in NHS trusts offering services for ME sufferers. [41816]<P>

<P>

The Chief Medical Officer commissioned a report from the CFS/ME independent working group, which was published on the 11 January. Copies of the report and its annexes are available at the following website: www.doh.gov.uk/cmo/publications.htm. The report recommended the development of service networks to increase knowledge and understanding of the condition, and this is something we would support.
<P>

<a name="20326w35.html_para0">Although there are currently no specific plans to collate, evaluate and disseminate best practice in NHS trusts offering services for ME sufferers, we are committed to take other action which will help spread best practice. A referral to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) to provide guidance on management and treatment is something we will consider.
<P>

<a name="20326w35.html_para1">We are also ensuring that the External Reference Groups who will be developing the two National Service Frameworks (NSF) for both children's services and adults with long term conditions, consider this report and its recommendations for improving treatment and care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w35.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith:  </B> 
We have established the General Social Care Council (GSCC) to raise the standard of social care and increase the protection of the public. The GSCC will do this by promoting high standards in the training of social workers and other social care staff, publishing codes of practice, setting out the standard of conduct expected of social care workers and by registering the workforce, starting with qualified social workers in 2003. In order to maintain registration with the GSCC individuals will be expected to keep their practice and training up to date. We have also announced a change to the social work qualification from a two-year diploma in social work to a three-year degree level qualification.
<P>

<a name="20326w35.html_para2">The term <i>Social Worker</i> is often used by people working in social care who do not hold a social work qualification. When sufficient numbers of qualified social workers have been registered by the GSCC we shall take steps to protect the use of the title social worker to those who have a social work qualification and who are registered as such with the GSCC. It will be an offence under the Care Standards Act 2000 for anyone to misrepresent his/her self with the intention of deceiving.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w35.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith:  </B> 
The Audit Commission's report XThe coming of age", published in 1997 and subsequent work by the Department of Health, confirmed that better assessment and the development of preventative and rehabilitative services, could lead to more appropriate and effective permanent placements of state-funded individuals in residential care and nursing homes.
<P>

<a name="20326w35.html_para4">Since then through the NHS Plan and the National Service Framework for Older People, the Department has introduced a single assessment process to ensure that individual's needs are assessed in the round, and funded the development of a range of preventive and intermediate care services. These developments will help to ensure that older people and other adults, wherever possible, are only admitted to residential accommodation when necessary.

<a name="20326w35.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith:  </B> 
The only cost incurred in provisionally locating and establishing the Strategic Health Authority (StHA) HQ for North and East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire is for the rent of two offices in the York Science Park for February and March 2002. This will be approximately #3,500. This is the Project Office for the Strategic Health Authority pending a discussion about its permanent location.
<P>

<a name="20326w35.html_para5">On 20 March 2002, the StHA shadow Board discussed the option appraisal and work in progress to produce an outline business case. It was unanimously agreed that appropriate criteria had been used to inform the option appraisal on the location of the StHA and that the decision made by the Chairman and Chief Executive (Designate) to accept the recommendation of the York Science Park was supported. Formal consideration of the outline business case will be part of the first StHA Board Meeting on 18 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20326w35.html_para6">All the existing NHS accommodation, including the accommodation currently occupied by the East Riding and Hull Health Authority at Willerby, is proposed for future use in each locality and will largely accommodate primary care trust staff including shared services to support these organisations. For this reason, no estimate was made of the cost of establishing the North and East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire StHA HQ at Willberby.

A consultation document on whether or not to fortify wheat flour with folic acid was issued in July 2000 jointly by the Department and the Food Standards Agency (FSA). This was based on the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (2000) conclusion that fortification of wheat flour with folic acid would help reduce the number of births affected by neural tube defects. The consultation responses have been analysed and a summary is posted on the DH website.
<P>

<a name="20326w36.html_para0">Following the consultation, the Department and FSA undertook or commissioned further work to address concerns raised. This work included a preliminary cost-benefit analyses. However, there are considerable uncertainties on key costs and effectiveness variables. The analyses took account of the increased risk of neuropathy in the elderly as well as the benefits of reduced risks of birth defects.
<P>

<a name="20326w36.html_para1">The policy options will need to be considered by the FSA Board as well as Health Ministers. The UK Health Departments and the FSA held a stakeholders meeting on 18 March 2002 to discuss the issue and inform policy decisions.

<i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> The NHS Plan set out our commitment to increasing the workforce and the NHS Cancer Plan confirmed our commitment to investment in the cancer workforce. Cancer networks (including those in the North West) nationally have recently been completing a number of toolkits which have looked at both clinician and nursing posts. Cancer networks are expected to audit their workforce requirements as part of the national standards for cancer. This is monitored through the peer review appraisal process. This information will continue to be used so that appropriate workforce development programmes are in place, which will help ensure that sufficient numbers of breast cancer consultants, surgeons and nurses are in place for future years.

Expenditure on the mental health review tribunal in 2000&#150;01 is likely to be just under #12 million, the cost of running the administrative function is just under #2 million. Figures for actual expenditure will not be available until after the end of the financial year.
<P>

<a name="20326w36.html_para3">The Department currently has no plans to commission new research for the mental health review tribunal but does, as part of its normal activity, collect and analyse data to support both the judicial and administrative functions of the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20326w36.html_para4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not had occasion to meet any of the four regional chairmen for the tribunal in England.

<i>[holding answer 12 March 2002]: </i>The information requested is shown in the table. The table identifies all General Practitioner partnerships (but not individual GP surgeries) including those Xpartnerships of one", by region and health authority.

This Department is not currently planning to inspect local councils for compliance with the XNo Secrets" guidance.

<a name="20326w39.html_para0">At present there are no plans to include a specific adult protection indicator in the Personal Social Services Performance Assessment Framework. There are however several existing indicators of relevance to adult protection (for example emergency admissions, avoidable harm from falls and hypothermia, clients receiving reviews and inspections of residential care). A decision on including a specific adult protection indicator will be made once the Centre for Policy on Ageing have concluded their analysis.

<P>

<a name="20326w42.html_para4">I was, however, unable at that stage to grant the necessary approvals for the railway works.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of the ability of London Underground rolling stock to operate on main lines beyond the terminal points of the tube network. [45880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w42.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]: </i>This is a matter for London underground (LU). LU's rolling stock is purpose-designed and the Underground uses a four-rail system and operates to different rules from the main line. These differences make it difficult for LU rolling stock to operate beyond the existing network. However, there are short sections of the main line over which LU has long standing running rights and which have been specially adapted for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="20326w42.html_para6">LU has carried out an assessment of a section where they plan to extend the Metropolitan line to Watford Junction (the Croxley Link). This involves a short section of new line and then a connection to the Euston/Watford Junction main lines.

[45660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w42.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson:  </B> 
London Underground, as the operator of trains, stations and infrastructure, is responsible for preparing a safety case. The Health and Safety Executive considers whether the safety arrangements made out in the case, if implemented, are capable of delivering safety.
<P>

<a name="20326w42.html_para7">HSE is currently considering London Underground's revision of its existing case, which sets out safety arrangements with its infrastructure companies in the private sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w42.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson:  </B> 
The Government do not have powers to set specific requirements in relation to London Underground's plans for the modernisation of the Tube. London Underground shares the Government's objectives of improving the Tube and ensuring that there should be no privatisation, that safety be maintained or improved and that the contracts should only go ahead if they represent value for money.

Under the plans for the modernisation of the Underground, three infrastructure companies will carry out work to maintain and modernise the Tube's infrastructure under contract to London Underground. The contracts provide powers for London Underground to take over the work of the infrastructure companies if necessary for safety or other reasons.
<P>

<a name="20326w42.html_para8">As referred to in my answer of 4 March 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 85W, the Greater London Authority Act 1999 provides statutory powers for an infrastructure company to be managed under a PPP administration order.

Provided that the vehicles have not been deleted from the Library list of rolling stock permitted to run on the network, and they have not been modified, they are covered by Xgrandfather" rights and do not require further approval under the Railway and Other Transport System (Approval of Works, Plan and Equipment) Regulations.

<P>
<a name="20326w43.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson:  </B> 
The original 10-year Plan, published in July 2000, assumed that Railtrack's income in Control Period 3 would be based upon our projections for the fixed element of Railtrack's track access charges. This involved a 2 per cent. increase in real terms for fixed track access charges in 2001&#150;02 and a 2 per cent. reduction in real terms for each of the subsequent nine years.

The Strategic Rail Authority have indicated in their Strategic Plan that the total amount of private sector investment envisaged will be very similar to that envisaged in the 10-year Plan.

<P>

<a name="20326w44.html_para0">Infrastructure renewals, which are the replacement or updating of railway assets to make them fit for use on the railway network, create assets that have a useful life over more than one accounting period. Under accounting rules, they can therefore be properly accounted for as investment to be amortised over the expected accounting life of the assets. Railtrack's current accounting policies reflect this, as did British Rail's when that organisation still existed.

The Government's 10 Year Transport Plan sets out clear targets for Rail focusing on increasing the number of passengers and volume of freight using the railways, and on tackling overcrowding. We do not intend to introduce yet further targets, but rather to have a set of benchmarks against which progress and improvements can be judged.

The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) requires franchised train operators to continue to offer the Young Person's, Disabled Person's and Senior Citizen's railcards on the same terms as applied before privatisation. Train operators also operate commercial railcard schemes such as the Network Railcard (for travel in the South East) and the Family Railcard, whose terms are a matter for the train operators, and which are not subject to regulation by the SRA.

The broad thrust of the Rail Summits&#151;improving both the rail network and its performance&#151;is the fundamental goal of the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) and its Strategic Plan. That improvement will only come, as the Plan has made clear, through action to stabilise the industry and get back to basics now and through significant investment in renewal and enhancement of the network, in order to provide increased capacity for passenger and freight services. The SRA is currently engaged in delivering both of these.

The effectiveness of diesel particulate filters has been the subject of a number of studies in recent years. All show that these filters can effectively remove more than 90 per cent. of particulate matter including all particulates that would contribute to the PM2.5 value.
<P>

<a name="20326w46.html_para0">Controls of oxides of nitrogen is not the objective of a particulate filter, but depending upon the specific system design, reductions can be achieved.

Proposals were issued last year to strengthen the objectives for PM10, benzene, carbon monoxide and introduce a new objective for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

My Department is currently involved in a joint initiative by the Commission for Integrated Transport and the Freight Transport Association to explore the scope for Local Authorities to consider flexibility in delivery restrictions in exchange for better environmental performance by the distribution industry resulting in less disturbance to local residents. The aim is to develop a Code of Practice which would result in a significant reduction in the noise and other nuisance commonly associated with urban deliveries. This would enable deliveries to be carried out outside peak congestion hours, more flexibly and efficiently with fewer vehicles. Improved distribution would also help to ensure that products are available on the shelves at the times people want to buy them. The use of gas-powered vehicles might be amongst the appropriate Xbest practice" measures considered by local authorities in determining whether to ease delivery restrictions.

We intend to consult on the scope of this power in due course. The consultation paper will clarify the circumstances in which authorities will be allowed to indemnify their members and officers against costs that they might incur.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proposals he has to require debt-free local authorities to pay into a central fund. [46037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w47.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble:  </B> 
Our proposals for local government funding are set out in the recent Local Government White Paper&#151;XStrong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services". They include the introduction of an arrangement for pooling a proportion of housing capital receipts arising in debt-free authorities to fund new housing investment where the need is greatest. This will mirror the arrangements that apply to non debt-free authorities. We are not proposing that this pooling should apply to receipts already realised.

The sound insulation between dwellings is controlled under Part E of the Building Regulations. Building Regulations 5 and 6 deal with Material change of use and sub-paragraphs 5(g) and 6(e) make it clear that Part E applies when a building which contains at least one dwelling undergoes a change of use such that it contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously.

The South West Regional Assembly (SWRA) is a voluntary body funded by local authorities and others in the region. Last year the Government announced #500,000 worth of funding for the SWRA as part of the #15 million fund for regional chambers over three years. The SWRA have recently submitted their plans for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 amounting to a bid for #1.2 million from the fund.

The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 allowed for the Secretary of State to designate a voluntary grouping of stakeholders in the region as the regional chamber for the regional development agency (RDA), and each region now has a designated chamber (or assembly).

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Minister of State has asked me to reply direct to your letter of 12 December 2001, enclosing one from Ms Yvonne Allen of 23 Round Berry Drive, Salcombe, Devon, concerning the funding of her course. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Operating Officer of the Agency.
<BR>
I was naturally concerned to learn of the difficulties Ms Allen is facing. To enable me to respond fully to the issues raised, I contacted Diana Ross, the Regional Director for the South West, and asked her to look into this matter for me.
<BR>
It may be helpful if I first provide some background information. As you may be aware, Ms Allen undertook the Education and Training Opportunity option which is available to clients taking part in the New Deal for 25plus initiative. To be eligible for the provision clients must be over the age of 25, unemployed and at the time Ms Allen commenced New Deal 25plus, claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for two years or more.
<BR>
Ms Ross tells me that prior to starting her training Ms Allen agreed an Individual Training Plan with her New Deal Personal Adviser. This states that her objective was to complete the Advanced Certificate in Therapeutic Counselling and gives the dates of the funding, which are from September 2000 to June 2001.

I understand that after completing this funded opportunity, Ms Allen was then invited to discuss her next steps towards finding work with her New Deal Personal Adviser, Fiona Cardrick. At this point, Ms Allen expressed a wish to pursue further training to gain the Diploma in Therapeutic Counselling. Fiona explained that as Ms Allen had already received a year's funding under the Education and Training Opportunity option, she was not eligible for further funding through New Deal. I should add that since New Deal began, it has always been the clearly stated policy to offer funding under the Education and Training Opportunity option for a maximum of one year. I can confirm that Ms Allen has received the maximum amount of funding allowed for participants on this option and that she was made aware of the limitations on funding at the outset.
<BR>
I understand that Ms Allen is currently considering other sources of funding and has had further discussions with Fiona Cardrick, her Personal Adviser about her next steps.



<BR>
I am sorry to send what I know will be a disappointing reply, but I hope it is helpful in clarifying the situation.

<a name="20326w53.html_para0">From 1 April 2002, we will extend entitlement to GA to those caring for children with a surviving parent who has been ordered by a court to be detained in a hospital, or sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years or more. This will help to allow more children to remain within their extended family.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, (1) what considerations led to the figure of #14.50 allocated to those in long-stay hospitals who are in receipt of a state benefit; [45144]
<P>
<UL>(2) when the last review was carried out into benefit receipt for patients in long-stay hospitals; and whether there are plans to review the system in the near future. [45145]<P></UL>

<i>[holding reply 21 March 2002]: </i>We have considered carefully the impact of the current rules which reduce certain benefits paid to pensioners and people of working age after six weeks of hospitalisation. The down rating of benefits preserves the principle that the State should not make double provision. It also recognises that a substantial number of people leave hospital before six weeks.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para1">We consider the six week rule strikes a fair balance between what the state should provide financially and the provision individuals should make for themselves, 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 987W</I><P>
however, we also recognise that people have on-going financial commitments whilst in hospital. We therefore announed on 5 March 2002 that we have decided to extend the period before benefits are downrated by a further seven weeks to the 13 week stage. This will mean that people previously affected by the six week rule will be able to keep their benefits untouched if their period of stay in hospital is under 13 weeks. This will account for the majority of stays.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para2">We will introduce this change to coincide with the introduction of Pension Credit.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para3">The hospital personal allowance, currently #14.50 per week, is intended to provide for small personal items not provided by the hospital and is set by legislation. The amount is currently set as a percentage of Retirement Pension, which is reviewed every year. Benefit is restricted to this amount because, generally speaking, the National Health Service can be said to have assumed, to a large degree, the responsibility of providing for patients who have spent more than 52 weeks in hospital. There are no plans to change the amount by which benefits are reduced for hospital inpatients who have been in hospital for more than 52 weeks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps have been taken by his Department to ensure that the tapers determining the amount of housing and council tax benefit to which the recipients of working families tax credit are entitled do not result in a lower income in work after rent and council tax than out of work after receiving 100 per cent. housing benefit and council tax benefit. [29534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w53.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks  </B> 
<i>[holding reply 25 January 2002]: </i>We are transforming the welfare system from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para7">In support of these aims we are ensuring that work pays. The Working Families Tax Credit and the National Minimum Wage have for the first time guaranteed a minimum income for working families with children. These measures together guarantee that every family with children where at least one person is working 35 hours a week will receive a minimum income of #225 a week, or almost #12,000 a year.




<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 989W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para8">Entitlement to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit is assessed by comparing a person's net income, less income disregards, with the amount they would receive on Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. For each pound that their income exceeds this level, the amount of benefit payable is reduced by fixed tapers. For people moving from welfare into work these tapers ensure they are better off.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para9">For people in work, who receive a pay rise, the combined effect of the tapers in Working Families Tax Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit means they remain better off. If Working Families Tax Credit was not taken into account in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit families who worked longer hours or took better paid jobs would be worse off as they would face high marginal deduction rates.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the Department's policy towards providing incentives for local authority procedures for reducing housing benefit fraud. [34423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w53.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks:  </B> 
Our immediate priority for Housing Benefit is to work with local authorities to drive up standards across the board, tackle fraud and error and promote work incentives. We have introduced a wide range of measures providing incentives for local authorities to tackle housing benefit fraud.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para10">In November 1997 we launched the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate to help raise standards in secure housing benefit administration. The BFI has so far published 116 reports helping local authorities to tackle weaknesses in their services and identifying and spreading good practice.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para11">In April 1998 we tightened the criteria for establishing fraud to prevent abuse of the Weekly Benefit Savings scheme which was originally introduced in 1993.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para12">In May 1998 we introduced the Verification Framework to help prevent fraud and error from entering the housing benefit system and help to detect it when it occurs. #160 million has been made available from April 2001 to fund local authorities which sign up to the Verification Framework, and over 75 per cent. of authorities have now done so.
<P>

<a name="20326w53.html_para13">In April 2001 we introduced a comprehensive new anti-fraud scheme for local authorities that provides a broader range of financial incentives to prevent, detect, punish and prosecute fraud than did the old Weekly Benefit Savings scheme. To fund these two schemes we have made #180 million available since April 2001. Sixty-three authorities adopted the new scheme in April 2001 and the remaining authorities will do so in April this year.

<a name="20326w54.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks:  </B> 
No such assessment has been made. We do not accept that any non-resident parent who can afford to support their children has the right to deny children such support.
<P>

<a name="20326w54.html_para5">Despite continued improvement in the rate of compliance over the last few years, at the moment, only around half of non-resident parents pay all the maintenance due or the support of their children. The aim of the Government's reforms is to see a marked increase in those numbers. The new scheme will be rigorously enforced; the simplicity of the new rules will enable the Agency to devote substantially more resources to enforcement. In the meantime, pending the start of the new scheme, I continue to look to the Agency to secure the best possible rate of compliance achievable under the current scheme.
<P>

<a name="20326w54.html_para6"><P>

<a name="20326w54.html_para7">It is important to remember the effect of regular payments of child maintenance. It can transform the lives of lone mothers and their children; where the families are dependent on income support, providing a stable income can help lone parents into work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what factors underlay the decision to reform the child support system; and on what date the reforms will be brought into effect. [44439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w55.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks:  </B> 
Research commissioned for the White Paper of July 1999, XA new contract for welfare" found that the child support system was failing the children it was set up to help. A major part of the problem is that the existing formula for assessing maintenance is too complex. As a result too few resources have been available for enforcement. Consequently currently only around half of those Non-Resident Parents with an assessment pay all of the maintenance that is due. The Government therefore decided to simplify the child support system basing it on a simple percentage of the non-resident parents net income. It will be transparent and easier to understand so allowing a more customer focused Child Support Agency to spend less time calculating maintenance and more time chasing payments.
<P>

[44440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w55.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks:  </B> 
The Government has made clear that existing cases will be brought onto the new system only after it is clear that the new scheme is operating effectively. Parents will be given advance notice of the new liability.

Under the current Child Support provisions, the maximum percentage of net income that a non-resident parent can be expected to pay is 30 per cent. regardless of the number of children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for what reason housing benefit statistics produced by his Department exclude extended payment cases. [41786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w56.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks:  </B> 
Extended payments of Housing Benefit were introduced in 1996 and are available when an Income Support or an income-based Jobseeker's Allowance claim ends due to a person starting work (or increasing their hours and/or earnings) which is expected to last at least five weeks. They can be paid for four weeks and remove the uncertainty faced by many people about whether they will be able to pay their rent and council tax between the last payment of benefit and receipt of their first wages.
<P>

<a name="20326w56.html_para2">As these claims are a fixed period award of Housing Benefit for up to four weeks they were originally excluded from all Housing Benefit statistics to make sure they did not inflate or distort the figures. They were, however, collected for internal use and they have been included in a footnote to tables in the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Quarterly Summary Statistics since November 1999.

The Lord Chancellor's Department has responsibility for the Social Security Commissioners.

A further appeal against the decision of these tribunals can be made to the Social Security Commissioners.

Approximately four months before reaching State Pension age (60 for a woman, age 65 for a man) an automatic claims package is issued to prospective pensioners provided the customer's current address is held on the computer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what guidance he issues to companies that offer an occupational pension scheme on including pension surpluses in payments to former employees; and if he will make a statement. [43961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w57.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown:  </B> 
Since 1986 the Inland Revenue has required pension funds which are funded in excess of 105 per cent of their liabilities to reduce their surplus. This may be done in a variety of ways, including improved benefits to scheme members, employer or employee contribution holidays and taxable refunds to the employer sponsoring the scheme. The Pensions Act 1995 requires that, before any refund is made to an employer, all current and future pensions in payment should be increased annually in line with the Retail Prices Index up to a maximum of 5 per cent., that trustees should satisfy themselves that the use of the surplus is in the interest of the members, and that members should be notified of the proposal in the manner set out in law.
<P>

<a name="20326w57.html_para10">The trust deed for each pension scheme may also regulate the way that surpluses can be reduced. If the trustees propose to make a payment to the employer, and this is permitted by the trust deed, members can challenge their decision through the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) if they believe that the statutory procedures have not been followed. If the trust deed does not permit payments to the employer, the trustees may apply to Opra to change the scheme rules in order to allow payment.
<P>

<a name="20326w57.html_para11">My right hon. Friend has not issued formal guidance on the operation of the Pensions Act 1995. Opra issues guidance on a variety of topics. Note 3, published in 1998, deals with Opra's role in the payment of surplus.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w57.html_spnew5"><B> Mr Nicholas Brown:  </B> 
The Government is currently in the process of strengthening the law relating to the nomination and selection of trustees to ensure that every occupational pension scheme has member-nominated trustees. We do not think it was right to force schemes to have member trustees from particular categories of membership, because that would erroneously give credence to the idea that trustees have a representative role, which they do not. The duties and responsibilities of all the trustees are the same, regardless of how they come to the post.
<P>

<a name="20326w57.html_para12">The timing of this work will depend on the outcome of the broader simplification review being undertaken by Alan Pickering which is due to report in June, but we remain firmly committed to increasing the number of member trustees generally.

We recognise the importance of tackling age discrimination in the workplace. We have already provided voluntary guidance to help employers adopt age positive employment practices.

<P>

The Departmental retirement age for all staff below Senior Civil Service level was increased from 60 to 65 with effect from 1 April 2000 and staff have the choice to retire at any time between these ages. All staff are positively encouraged to take appropriate development opportunities regardless of age including promotion and change of duties.

The introduction of the employment related age discrimination legislation, and the consultations on its development, are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="20326w58.html_para4">The Department for Work and Pensions leads in challenging ageism in employment with its Age Positive campaign that is vigorously promoting the business benefits of employing an age diverse workforce. The campaign focuses on the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment and a wide range of research

and development activities with both public and private organisations to help employers develop non-ageist employment practices that will help them prepare for the future legislation. Integral to this is the Age Positive Website (www.agepositive.gov.uk) that was launched in December.

<a name="20326w58.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Willetts:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the National Audit Office's comments in the Appropriation Accounts, HC335, on the fall in WBS subsidies during 2000&#150;01; and whether the Department intends to revise the weekly benefits savings rules. [42512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w58.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks:  </B> 
The Weekly Benefit Savings (WBS) scheme was introduced in April 1993 to encourage Local Authorities to undertake activity to combat benefit fraud. It is based on a system of rewards and penalties for the amount of fraud detected.
<P>

<a name="20326w58.html_para5">Changes were made to the scheme in 1998 following concerns from the National Audit Office and Audit Commission that WBS was being inappropriately claimed in cases where fraud had not been established or a fraud investigation had not been properly undertaken. It was therefore decided to tighten the WBS claiming criteria and limit the amount of WBS claimed in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20326w58.html_para6">This tightening of the criteria was followed by a large reduction in the WBS savings scored by Local Authorities in 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000. To address this, increased rates of additional subsidy were made payable to Local Authorities and a reduced level of penalty was introduced in April 1999.
<P>

<a name="20326w58.html_para7">In January 2000 the Department announced that it would replace WBS with a new anti-fraud incentive scheme over two years from April 2001. Sixty three Local Authorities took up the new scheme in 2001&#150;02 with the remainder joining in April 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his Answer of 6 November 2000 to the hon. Member for Havant, <i>Official Report, </i>column 92W, if he will estimate the same data for each region and nation of the UK; and if he will also express the estimates as a percentage of the total numbers of pensioners and children the figures represent.

<P>
<a name="20326w58.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nick Brown:  </B> 
Such information as is available is in the tables. However, estimates of year on year change at regional level should be viewed with caution, as sampling error may be large in relation to the change itself.

<i>Notes:<P>

</i>1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland.<P>

2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

3. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are also provided including and excluding the self-employed, as research suggests that, for self-employed people, income as reported in surveys is often a poor indicator of living standards.<P>

4. Estimates for the numbers of pensioners and children living in households below 60 per cent. median income by region have not been provided as the FRS grossing regime does not permit the provision of reliable estimates of numbers, as distinct from percentages. This issue does not affect either GB level estimates of numbers nor regional estimates of percentages. The grossing methodology in the FRS is currently being reviewed with one aim being to resolve this issue.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will change the practice of starting a pension from the Monday following a person's 60th or 65th birthday. [37423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20326w59.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Entitlement to Retirement Pension begins with the pay-day on or following the pensioner's 60th or 65th birthday. Changes in entitlement, for example a decrease because of a prolonged stay in hospital, also takes effect from the pay-day following the change in circumstances. The same rule applies with the termination of the award. The principle of paying Retirement Pension in whole weeks stems from the fact that the benefit is traditionally paid in advance.
<P>

<a name="20326w59.html_para0">There are no plans to change the present arrangements for paying Retirement Pension.

The information requested for the percentage, number and average cost of first class journeys is not available. As part of their terms and conditions of employment, first class tickets are available for senior staff undertaking long business journeys or working en route. The department has a contract with an external agent for the provision of rail tickets over #15. Over each of the last three calendar years (1999&#150;2001) the department has purchased an average of #7.2 million worth of tickets.

<P>
<a name="20326w59.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks </B> 
<i> [holding answer 27 February 2002]:</i> FRS17 is an accounting standard introduced by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) which is entirely independent of Government. Financial reporting standards are introduced after a long period of public consultation which offers an opportunity for those with an interest to make representations to the ASB.




<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2002 : Column 1014W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20326w59.html_para1">The Department has been aware of FRS17 throughout its development, a process that has taken several years.
<P>

<a name="20326w59.html_para2">Ministers and officials hold regular consultations with those involved with the pensions industry. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met representatives from the ASB on 27 February.
<P>

<a name="20326w59.html_para3">There are many factors tending to increase the costs and risks faced by employers who choose to offer defined benefit occupational pension schemes including longer life expectancy and lower expected future investment returns. It is not possible to isolate the effects of FRS17 from these other factors.
