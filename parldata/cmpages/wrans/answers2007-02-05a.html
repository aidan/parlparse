Delays may also be caused by one of a number of IT related problems such as the agreement being under amendment, data integrity issues or invalid agreement holder details.

Measles control activities have also been effectively implemented, with 91 per cent. reduction in reported cases in 2005 and the first seven months of 2006 compared with 2004.

It has been decided that the provision of parking on the estate for non-passholders is not currently compatible with maintaining a secure perimeter. Further discussions have taken place regarding the provision of additional bicycle parking outside in the vicinity of the estate encouraged by the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group. It is hoped that additional bicycle racks will be provided during the current financial year.</p>

1. Estimates of additional expenditure are consistent with the policy detail set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment accompanying the Pensions Bill. Net costs include savings seen from reduced expenditure on other income related benefits (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit). They do not include any change in income tax revenue or national insurance.<br>
2. Net costs assume the pension credit standard minimum guarantee is uprated by earnings from 2008. Net costs do not include the effect of direct reforms to the savings credit.<br>
3. Costs assume contracting-out of DC schemes is abolished in 2012. Column (b) assumes the state second pension has already been flat-rated and simplified. Applying the changes in a different order would alter the gross and net cost of each individual policy, but not the total additional cost of reform.<br>
4. Abolition of contracting-out for DC schemes from 2012 decreases the cost of the contracted-out rebate. This is not included in the figures above.<br>
5. Costs or savings presented in the table are based on long-term projections of United Kingdom benefit spend, consistent with the pre-Budget report 2006.<br>
6. Figures exclude savings resulting from raising state pension age.<br>
7. Figures exclude the effect of personal accounts.<br>

We will be refining our estimate working with the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, and firm estimates will not be available until later in the procurement process. In order to reduce costs and delivery risk we expect suppliers to re-use existing systems, where practicable, in delivering the Personal Accounts service; therefore their engagement in the cost estimating process is essential.</p>

Analyses of such small groups using the FRS sample are not robust enough for publication, but can be used to provide broad indications of the characteristics of individuals within the group. Further analysis using the main longitudinal surveys is not possible as sample size are smaller than for the Family Resources Survey, increasing the risk that individuals within the sample will be unrepresentative of the overall group.</p>

Although these figures do not provide firm evidence of the employment patterns of a group of individuals over the course of their working lives, they show considerable variation across different age groups, providing some indicative evidence that the characteristics of the group vary at different points of the working life, and suggesting that the majority of individuals currently in multiple jobs are unlikely to remain in multiple jobs throughout their working life.</p>

That assessment was intended to enable the board, to decide whether the building could, with or without modification, meet minimum requirements. These include minimum health and safety standards to ensure the safety and security of court users, judiciary and other visitors to the building; compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act; and separate rooms to enable solicitors to take instructions from their clients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="70205w0021.htm_para2"><a name="07020559000046">In addition to this, each of these buildings is used by many other organisations including crèches, youth groups and as meeting places for older people. The board therefore recognises that even after identifying a building which has some potential for use as a court, the community users must be engaged in discussion before any final decision is made. If this involves alteration of the building, such alterations must be carried out in a way which does not adversely affect the other uses of these amenities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="70205w0021.htm_para3"><a name="07020559000047">Accordingly, the board is making careful assessments of all the premises identified for consideration and being sensitive to the needs of existing users.

In the meantime, these cases will commence being heard at the magistrates court in May.</p>

Due to rounding, the sum of the components may not equal the totals. Children are defined as 0 to 15-year-olds, and as 16 to 18-year-olds in full-time education. <i> PCA Data</i> Prescription information is taken from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, supplied by the Prescription Pricing Division (PPD) of the Business Services Authority (BSA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions. <i> Prescription</i><i> Items</i> Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item. <i> Exemption Category Estimates</i> The exemption data are identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and rely on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case. Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a one in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. The information we have is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. To reflect this we have rounded the exemption figures appropriately&#151;figures less than 1,000 are shown as " * "; figures between 1,000 and 100,000 have been rounded to the nearest 1,000; figures between 100,000 and one million have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 and figures between one million and 10 million have been rounded to the nearest 100,000. Data for total of all ages have not been rounded since they are not exemption data.<br>

Tax thresholds are the point at which income exceeds personal allowances. Individual spouses and civil partners are taxed separately and not as a household. The additional tax relief that is available for older pensioner married or civil partner couples reduces the tax liability of the spouse or civil partner who claims it. The amount depends on the age of the older partner and income of the claimant.</p>

We will want to ensure that where Local Area Agreements can contribute to the delivery of the Government's and local areas' response to alcohol misuse, including alcohol harm reduction strategies, they do so. Many local areas have already chosen to include targets including stretch targets relating to alcohol misuse in their Local Area Agreements. Local Area Agreements have also facilitated enhanced partnership working between local bodies of the type that is necessary to ensure that there is comprehensive response to alcohol misuse. The duties on local authorities and their local partners proposed in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill will further facilitate such joint working, including by making Local Area Agreements the single mechanism for central and local government to agree targets to reflect the key priorities for improvement in each local area.</p>

Ministers accepted the panel&#146;s recommendations. Bids were unsuccessful for a variety of reasons and the panel has offered to provide feedback to unsuccessful bidders whom they met. Other unsuccessful bidders are receiving feedback from Government offices. The feedback is aimed at giving authorities a clear idea about any gaps in their analysis, strategy or delivery plans with the aim of helping them to prepare for any future bidding round.</p>

In addition, the Government's &#145;Rural Strategy&#146;, published in 2004, sets a clear vision for bringing about sustainable rural communities. It aims to achieve social justice, economic and social regeneration and an enhanced rural environment in the English countryside. It describes how we will place communities and their needs at the heart of rural regeneration, with services delivered in a way that is responsive to local people and focused on need.
