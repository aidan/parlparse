<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41207w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) is now in its initial Assessment Phase. A contract has now been awarded to Atkins who, under the strategic direction of the Ministry of Defence, will be leading a number of key activities designed to inform MOD&#039;s major programme decisions. Part of this Assessment Phase work will be to identify and reduce risk in the programme to enable us to define an appropriate In-Service Date (ISD) in both capability and programme terms for endorsement at Main Gate. The ISD will not be formally endorsed until then, but our initial planning assumption is to introduce the early variants of FRES around the end of the decade, with a phased approach to achieving full operational capability thereafter.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what training Army units deploying to Iraq receive <i>(a)</i> before deployment and <i>(b)</i> in-theatre in Iraq. [199568]</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41207w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 British armed forces deploying to Iraq receive one of two comprehensive pre-deployment training packages, covering a wide variety of mandatory briefings, skills training and theatre acclimatisation, dependent upon whether they are deployed on an individual basis or as part of a group deployment. Once in theatre they receive refresher and specific-to-theatre training designed to prepare them for their respective jobs, and allow them to be deployed acclimatised, and trained in the tasks that they are to perform.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what large scale co-operative exercises organised by EU Military Staff he expects will take place in the next five years; and from what budgets UK participation will be funded. [200380]</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41207w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The EU Military Staff currently have no plans for a large-scale co-operative exercise involving the field deployment of troops. However, EU and/or joint EU-NATO crisis management exercises, involving command structures and headquarters, are envisaged in each of the years 2006 to 2009, and will involve exercising arrangements for the augmentation of the relevant HQ. They will focus on how the EU responds to crises using both civilian and military instruments in an EU-led operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41207w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The majority of costs for EU exercises are funded on a &quot;costs lie where they fall&quot; basis. In practice, therefore, the cost to the UK of hosting an exercise would be met by the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), as it was for this year&#039;s exercise; and the cost of providing staff for an exercise hosted by another member state would be met by the Top Level Budget Holder providing the staff. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Dec 2004 : Column 407W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
There are also a few additional costs, such as costs incurred by EU recourse to NATO common assets, that are shared by member states on a Gross National Income key. This is the same approach as for other exercises involving comparable international institutions.

 The Government do not expect that significant numbers of people will find themselves out of work as a result of the Act and many will be able to divert into other activities. Lord Burns estimated that around 700 jobs were directly dependent on hunting and that, overall, between 6,000 and 8,000 jobs could be affected by a ban, although evidence given to the Portcullis House hearings suggested that this may be an overstatement. The Government have not made any further assessment of the economic impact of the Act.

<a name="stpa_31">Some research was undertaken in 1997, following which a guidance leaflet was issued. More investigation is currently in hand with findings expected shortly, and further research to look at wheel fixings and methods of tightening is under consideration for next year. The Department has not commissioned research into locking wheel nuts, but work on behalf of the British Standards Institution indicated that a loss of clamp force&#151;due to settlement between the interfaces of the wheel-fixing assembly&#151;can take place without rotation of the nut. Thus, although use of locking devices can prevent loss of wheel nuts the devices cannot counteract a loss of clamp force, and excessive wear as a consequence of this could result in the loss of a wheel while nuts were still attached. Nonetheless there might be benefit in some cases, with such equipment preventing or delaying total loss of a wheel.

Some research was undertaken in the late 1990s and further research is currently under way with more under consideration. While research has concentrated on the extent, rather than the causes, of wheel loss the results have shown that a major factor is lack of regular and effective maintenance. In the Department&#039;s view, while locking wheel nuts can prevent loss of wheel nuts and might in some cases prevent total loss of a wheel, they cannot prevent the loss of clamp force as a result of which it would be possible for wheel loss to occur, through excessive wear, while wheel nuts were still attached.

 The annual budget of the Highways Agency is agreed by Ministers taking account of the resources available for transport and competing priorities from the different programmes. Within that budget, priority is given to maintaining the strategic network, reducing congestion and improving safety, in accordance with the key targets set the Highways Agency. A ring-fenced annual budget of &#163;5 million is allocated to treating noise problems at identified sites. Priorities for resurfacing of concrete roads ahead of maintenance need, subject to the availability of funding, were set out in the Secretary of State&#039;s announcement of 1 April 2003. The Highways Agency&#039;s budget and programme will be set out in its Business Plan, due to be published in the new year.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="41207w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 December 2004]:</i> We have looked at the position for registered members&#039; clubs (sports and others) of which there are 20,000. The cost of a premises licence or club premises certificate represents a saving for most sports clubs over a period of 10 years depending on the scope and regularity of the club&#039;s activities. The fee of &#163;16 currently paid for registered members&#039; clubs is only one of the fees that they currently pay. If they have music and dancing after normal opening hours they require certificates of suitability (ranging from &#163;50 to &#163;500); special hours certificates (&#163;25); and special orders of exemption (&#163;10 a time). Each of these is charged individually and some are required on multiple occasions in a year. Under the Licensing Act 2003 they would all be included in the fee for a single club premises certificate. Any percentage increase or decrease in fees for a club will therefore depend on the range of certificates currently held. The Government&#039;s policy is that licensing fees must be set at a level that allows full recovery of the administration, inspection and enforcement costs falling on licensing authorities. It would be wholly wrong for central or local taxation to subsidise the consumption of alcohol, and it would be difficult to argue that the best way to promote sport is through Government subsidising sports club bars.

 Possession Claims Online (PCOL) will be a public facing service for the issue of county court claims for repossession of property due to arrears of rent or mortgage. Development of the new service started in October 2004. National Rollout is planned in two phases: the first will commence in early 2006, the second in mid 2006.

The forms will have built-in validation and navigation together with online help to assist customers and provide real-time feedback, ensuring &quot;right first time&quot; submission of forms.

 The DTI has been working with the Laboratory of Government Chemist Limited (LGC) to establish a scientific test which can readily determine between different species of fur.

Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms) in a written statement to the House on 28 January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 11&#150;12WS, the first test trialled was unsatisfactory because industrial processing of fur tends to destroy its DNA. LGC Limited went on to test a technology which requires less DNA. Initial tests were disappointing but suggested that this method should not be discounted. During the course of this year, we understand the methodology has been refined and I have commissioned work to test the method again to establish whether its reliability has improved. I will report on the results of these tests in a written statement to the House in the new year.

The Inland Revenue also use their own information, together with information from other Government Departments and other sources, for risk assessment purposes and make proactive visits to employers to help improve compliance with the minimum wage. In the Low Pay Commission&#039;s last full report (March 2003) they concluded that most employers continue to comply with the minimum wage and the evidence they received welcomed the Inland Revenue&#039;s work in enforcing it.

Independent research commissioned after the 2002 campaign showed that awareness of the minimum wage by employers and low-paid workers was at almost universal levels.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Dec 2004 : Column 475W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="st_192"><a name="41207w20.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 December 2004]:</i> The Energy Act 2004 laid the foundation for the creation of a single GB market for wholesale electricity trading and transmission. Charges to connect to and use the GB transmission system, and therefore access the GB market, are still being developed by National Grid. Ofgem considered NGC&#039;s proposals last month, and concluded that further work was required in respect of use of system charges. It did, however, approve National Grid&#039;s proposed connection charges, i.e. the charges that relate to the specific assets provided at each site to connect to the network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41207w20.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_123">NGC&#039;s proposal for the use of system charges will be revised and resubmitted to Ofgem for approval in February 2005. The transmission charging methodology is planned to take effect when BETTA is implemented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41207w20.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_124">Ofgem also recently announced that, following approval of a use of system charging methodology, it is minded to implement a discount against transmission charges of approximately &#163;4 per kilowatt for smaller generators connected to the transmission system at 132KV. This is expected to encompass a number of larger wind-farm developments, particularly in the north of Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41207w20.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_125">Further, the Government took a legislative power in the Energy Act 2004 to allow the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to introduce a dispensation regime in order to limit the transmission charges to renewable generators in a specified area of Great Britain, if the transmission charges would otherwise materially hinder renewable development in that area. DTI recently commissioned an independent study to examine the likely impact of GB transmission charges on renewable development, in particular Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41207w20.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_126">The establishment of the GB market will also remove charges for using the Anglo-Scottish interconnector currently paid by Scottish generators including windfarms, exporting to England and Wales. It will also give Scottish generators including renewables access to the GB market as a whole rather than their development being constrained by the limited size of the electricity market in Scotland.

 We commissioned an evaluation of the Personal Dental Service schemes, which was published in 2002 in advance of planning of the new contractual arrangements for NHS dentistry to come into force from October 2005. The report supported the general principles of PDS and identified some changes in activity, including an indication that dentists may prescribe proportionately fewer intricate dental appliances under PDS than dentists working to the current General Dental Services contract. However, the sample was small and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions.
