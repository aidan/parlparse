<P>
<a name="90514w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 April 1999]:</i> Depending on the requirement for reservists in any particular operation, Personnel and Record Offices trawl the records of members of the ex-regular reserve forces. Those who are identified as qualified, and, in the case of a voluntary call out, who have also indicated their willingness to be called out, are served a call-out notice. This notice requires them to report to a mobilisation centre where they are accepted into service on completion of various administrative procedures. The call-out order made on 31 March 1999 under section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 allows the further call out of members of the ex-regular reserve forces as well as members of the volunteer reserve forces to support operations in the former republic of Yugoslavia and in the region of Iraq. During the year 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999 some 30 per cent. (155) of the Army's reservists who were called out and accepted into service came from the Army's ex-Regular Reserve Force.

 I am keen to improve public transport links between North and South Wales, including air services. Work is currently under way on an air services study for Wales, in line with the commitment which I gave in the Welsh transport policy statement 'Transporting Wales into the Future'. This study is focusing on the scope for new and enhanced services as well as the role of airports in economic development. It will be for the National Assembly, in collaboration with the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to decide how to take forward the findings of the study.

<a name="90514w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1999]:</i> The draft EU Directive on copyright and related rights in the Information Society is still under discussion in a working group of the Council of Ministers. The Opinion of the European Parliament was given in February but the common position of the member states is not expected for some time owing to the complex and controversial nature of some of the proposals. Only when the Directive is finally adopted will we prepare the necessary implementing legislation for approval by Parliament, and we shall wish to consult widely before doing so.
<P>

<a name="90514w01.htm_para5">The electronic environment necessitates international harmonisation of copyright laws and the Government have welcomed the broad thrust of the draft Directive. We are pressing for rapid adoption of the proposal, which will also enable the UK and the rest of the EU to ratify two new international treaties. However, there are concerns about certain aspects of the draft Directive including the treatment of temporary copies, the approach on exceptions to rights for a broad range of users, and provisions on technical measures. We are actively pursuing these issues in the Council and, in particular, continuing to press for more flexibility for member states in the area of exceptions. We are seeking to maintain a fair and reasonable balance between the interests of all the key players.

 I have today granted consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Michelin Tyre plc for construction of a 58 MW gas-fired Combined Heat and Power station at its tyre factory in Stoke-on-Trent Council. The station has also today been given clearance as a gas-fired station under Section 14 of the Energy Act 1976 and planning permission has been deemed to be granted, subject to 50 planning conditions agreed with the City of Stoke-on-Trent Council. The decisions have been taken in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled 'Conclusions of the Review of Energy sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee' (Cm 4071).

 I have decided not to issue a direction under section 14(3) of the Energy Act 1976 to stop Rolls-Royce Power Ventures Ltd. building a new 49MW gas-fired power station at Croydon. In taking my decision I concluded that the contribution to providing future diversity of technology by allowing the commercial demonstration of this innovative development is such that it would have been inappropriate to issue such a direction.
<P>

<a name="90514w02.htm_para1">Although new natural gas-fired generation would normally be inconsistent with the Government's energy policy concerns relating to diversity and security of supply, the Energy White Paper indicated that there may be a few exceptional examples which might merit support so as to help provide future diversity of technology. The White Paper also emphasises the importance of long term diversity of technology (together with diversity of fuels and sources of supply) in promoting flexibility and an ability to adapt to an uncertain future. I have concluded that the need for Rolls-Royce's Industrial Trent turbine to be commercially demonstrated, and so ensure the future diversity of technology, is such that it is appropriate for the proposal to be carried out.

 "A better quality of life--a Strategy for sustainable development for the UK" will be published on Monday 17 May. Copies will be placed in the House Libraries. It will also be available on my Department's website at www.detr.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="90514w02.htm_para3">The aim of sustainable development is to deliver a better quality of life for everyone, now and for generations to come. That means building economic prosperity in a way that protects our environment and shares that prosperity more widely. It means creating "livability"--towns, cities and rural areas which are based on sustainable communities, offering a better quality of life for all. The Sustainable Development Strategy will provide the framework for meeting those objectives, by tackling problems in a co-ordinated way and by linking local, national and international action. The Strategy will look at the overlapping themes of a sustainable economy, sustainable communities and managing the environment and resources, with the challenges and opportunities each represents. It will include indicators as a means to measure progress, including a set of headline indicators.
<P>

<a name="90514w02.htm_para4">The Government will lead in putting the Strategy into practice. But it will be important for each sector--and all of us as individuals--to pull in the same direction. The Strategy is therefore being supported by the launch of the next phase of the "Are you doing your bit?" advertising campaign, to communicate key elements of sustainable development to everyone.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 1999]:</i> Currently Police, Fire and other public service pensions awarded on injury grounds are abated to take account of benefits. The Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill made it clear that there may be some additional costs for such schemes from the proposal to take pension income over &#163;50 a week into account for future Incapacity Benefit claims. But until the schemes consider the implications in detail, the scale of these costs cannot be assessed.

<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para0">When the project was let in May 1996, it was assumed that all post offices would be automated by the end of 1998. To date, 204 post offices have been automated in the North East and South West of England. On current plans, automation will be completed int he next two years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90514w03.htm_wqn5"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what changes are to take place in the treatment for stamp duty purposes of leases under which the rent is to be adjusted in the light of changes in the retail prices index; and if he will make a statement.  [84623]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90514w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In the light of recent legal advice given to the Inland Revenue, the treatment of these leases for Stamp Duty is to be changed.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para3">When a new lease is taken out, Stamp Duty is charged by reference to both the premium and the rent under the lease. The premium attracts duty at the same rates as the selling price on the sale of a freehold interest. The premium gets the benefit of the &#163;60,000 nil rate band provided that the rent does not exceed a ceiling, currently &#163;600 per annum. The average annual rent is charged at rates of between one per cent. and 24 per cent., depending on the length of the lease.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para4">Many leases provide that the rent is to increase by a fixed percentage at annual or other intervals--or they lay down the actual amounts of the increases. The average annual rent, and therefore the Stamp Duty, is straightforward to calculate in these cases. But if future rent levels are expressed in terms of future movements in an index, like the RPI, it is less clear how a figure for the average annual rent can be calculated at the time the lease is taken out. In the light of representations, the then 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1999 : Column: 224</I><P>
Economic Secretary made a statement to this House by way of Written Answer on 6 November 1996, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>541-43</i>, setting out how the Stamp Office would apply Stamp Duty in such cases for the future, on the basis of legal advice. Broadly, where the rent under a lease was to be adjusted by reference to future changes in an index, Stamp Duty would be calculated by reference to changes in that index during the year ending with the date of execution of the lease.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para5">However, the legal validity of this approach has been challenged. Further legal advice given to the Inland Revenue is that the current system of applying a formula to allow for increases in an index number after the date of execution of a lease is not appropriate. So this practice will cease.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para6">In future, where there is a formula expressed in the lease for rent reviews based on the RPI, only any change in the RPI up to the date of its execution will be taken into account for Stamp Duty purposes. This is expected to result, in most cases, in the average rent being little more than the initial rent.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para7">This change means that people who have paid Stamp Duty on this type of lease may have paid more duty than they should have done. The Inland Revenue will invite those who paid duty on a lease of this kind to contact the Stamp Office and claim any repayment due to them. Details of the arrangements for repayments are set out in an Inland Revenue Press Release and on the Inland Revenue website.

 The UK is actively involved in the European Commission's new twinning programme under which experts from Member States are seconded to Central European Candidate Country Ministries to help them prepare for accession to the EU.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para8">The role of Pre-Accession Advisers (PAAs) is to help Central European (CE) Ministries adopt the legislative and administrative changes that are necessary in order to 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1999 : Column: 225</I><P>
join the EU. PAAs work full-time for at least one year within a CE Ministry to implement a twinning project. This includes the support and co-ordination of any short-term expert missions and training activities within the project.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para9">Funding for PAAs is set as part of the individual budget for each twinning project. The Commission estimates an approximate budget of 200,000 euro per year for each PAA.
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para10">The Pre-Accession Adviser continues to be paid his/her normal civil service salary throughout the project. The Commission then reimburses the cost of the salary to the Member State Department concerned. The PAA receives a per diem allowance, as well as housing, removal costs and school fees, where appropriate. The remuneration of PAAs is similar to that of other Commission funded secondees such as Detached National Experts (DNEs).
<P>

<a name="90514w03.htm_para11">PAAs are selected by the Member State Ministry or mandated body when preparing a bid to meet the requirements of a specific twinning project. The qualifications of the proposed PAA are an important factor in the final decision of the Central European Candidate Countries when they consider twinning bids from Member States. PAAs must therefore have the relevant skills to carry out the project. For example, the DTI have seconded the Deputy Head of their State Aid Policy Unit to help the Czechs on a State Aids project; and the Home Office are seconding the Head of International Section in Policing Organised Crime Unit to help Poland with an organised crime and border management project.

A number of measures have been taken to alert applicants. Letters, warning of possible delays, together with an explanatory leaflet, are now enclosed with all application forms. Leaflets have also been distributed widely among representatives, user groups and agencies in order to publicise the changes in IND as widely as possible.

Those that are approved must then comply with the labelling requirements contained in this regulation and, where appropriate, the EC Regulation on the labelling of GM Soya and Maize (1139/98). The Government took steps in March to ensure that the provisions in the latter Regulation also applied to foods sold in catering establishments and similar premises. The UK is the only country in Europe to have done this so far.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to change the funding mechanisms for remand fostering schemes;  [83896]
<P>
<UL>(2) what studies he has commissioned into the relative cost and efficacy of <i>(a)</i> remand fostering schemes for juveniles and <i>(b)</i> remand in (i) secure units, (ii) young offender institutions and (iii) prisons;  [83897]
<P>
(3) what plans he has to encourage wider use of remand fostering for juveniles.  [83898]

<a name="90514w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Every local authority determines its own need for remand fostering schemes. Funding for this and other special fostering schemes is found from within existing annual budgets. There are no plans to change this.
<P>

<a name="90514w07.htm_para0">In 1994, the National Foster Care Association (NFCA) published a report "On Remand: Foster Care and the Youth Justice Service". This national survey of remand fostering provision identified 29 local authorities operating such schemes. A 1998 NFCA report "Focus on Teenage Fostering" found that provision for remand fostering has since increased.
<P>

<a name="90514w07.htm_para1">The Government have not commissioned any relative cost and efficacy studies into the areas referred to. However, one of the objectives of the Quality Protects programme launched in September 1998 is to increase placement choice for all children in local authority care. This will include provision for remand fostering.

<a name="90514w07.htm_para2">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) for England and Wales has a development fund of &#163;85 million over the next three years. The YJB will make grants to local authorities and other agencies for the development of good practice in the provision of youth justice services and in other work to help prevent youth offending. &#163;35 million has been earmarked for bail support and supervision schemes and for other remand-related initiatives, which could include the development of good practice in remand fostering work. The YJB would be interested to receive bids in this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) when he expects the funding for Berkshire Health Authority to be fully on the basis of the weighted capitation formula for the first time;  [84178]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate the accumulated difference between the funds which would have been provided to Berkshire Health Authority under the weighted capitation formula when the formula was introduced and the amount actually provided.  [84179]

<P>
<a name="90514w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Allocations have been made directly to health authorities since 1996-97.
<P>

<a name="90514w07.htm_para3">We remain committed to the principle of achieving equity in resource allocation based on weighted capitation as soon as practicable. Health authorities are brought closer to their target fair share by a process of levelling up. Under target health authorities such as Berkshire will therefore be brought to target over time. In 1999-2000 Berkshire Health Authority's allocation was &#163;15.62 million or 3.50 per cent. below target.
<P>

<a name="90514w07.htm_para4">It is possible hypothetically to calculate the additional resources Berkshire Health Authority would have received if they had been funded to target. This can be done by aggregating the health authority's distances from target of each of the years since 1996-97 which gives a cumulative total of &#163;58 million.
