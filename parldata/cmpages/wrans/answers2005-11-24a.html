The CPS has recently concluded a pilot of the use of independent advisers to help victims of domestic violence through the prosecution process, and I am looking at ways of building on its success by piloting a similar project in rape cases.

 The Department is currently consulting on a number of proposals for changes to the higher education applications process, including the option of introducing a system of &quot;post-qualification applications&quot; (PQA). The consultation offers two possible PQA models and welcomes the idea that new approaches may appear as a result of the discussion the consultation will stimulate. The consultation ends on 5 December after which there will be a period to analyse the responses.

 The White Paper sets out an enhanced role for local authorities as the champions of parents and pupils, rather than the direct provider of school places. Local authorities will have new powers to commission school places and to intervene where provision is poor.

Notes:<br>

1. Price base: real terms at 2004&#150;05 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 28 September 2005.<br>

2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education SSA/EFS settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and LSC.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;19 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>

4. Where responsibility for funding a school has transferred from an LEA, related funding no longer appears in the series.<br>

5. Rounding: figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;0.1 million.<br>

6. Status: 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

7. 1997&#150;98 figures for LEAs subject to local government re-organisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

In 2001&#150;02 the Learning and Skills Council spent &#163;2,236 million on adult programmes including FE, Work Based Learning, Adult and Community Learning and other programmes. This increased to &#163;2,427 million in 2002&#150;03 and to &#163;2,866 million in 2003&#150;04. These figures are available in the LSC&#039;s published accounts. Figures for adult education for the years prior to 2001 are not comparable as the budget was split between a range of different organisations.

 Section 8 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 refers to the design of, and access to, the buildings of educational institutions. Although this Act is still in force, Section 8 has since been superseded by other legislation including the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (SENDA), The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 and the Building Regulations 2000. The provisions in these later Acts and Regulations are more comprehensive than those in Section 8 of the 1970 Act.

<a name="stpa_17">Schools now have a planning duty under Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to prepare accessibility plans for increasing over time the accessibility of schools for disabled pupils and prospective pupils. This planning duty covers: improving access to the curriculum, the physical environment of schools and provision of written materials in alternative formats, and will lead to access improvements that will have a positive impact on all aspects of school life.

<a name="stpa_18">The Learning and Skills Council monitor the extent to which further education college premises are accessible to disabled learners and, since SENDA was introduced in 2001, it has approved funding to enable colleges to undertake adaptations that will help them comply with the Act. So far over &#163;160 million has been made available. All colleges have made, or are making, adaptations or have plans in hand. Higher education institutions are also subject to the legislation and regulations mentioned above (apart from the School Premises Regulations), but as autonomous organisations are responsible for ensuring that they comply.

We have explained the rights of parents in the SRE and Parents leaflet and on the DfES Parents Centre website.

Notes:<br>

1. Price Base: Cash<br>

Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education SSA/EFS settlements. Figures from 2003&#150;04 include the pensions transfer to EPS and LSC, the figures prior to 2003&#150;04 have not been adjusted.<br>

Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;19 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>

Where responsibility for funding a school has transferred from an LEA, related funding no longer appears in the series.<br>

2. Capital Grants: 2002&#150;03 includes &#163;7.5 million for basic need additional provision; 2003&#150;04 includes &#163;9.8 million for basic need additional provision and a PFI allocation of &#163;62.8 million; 2004&#150;05 includes &#163;1.6 million targeted capital fund; 2005&#150;06 includes &#163;2.4 million targeted capital fund.<br>

3. Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;0.1 million.<br>

4. Status: 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

1. The large increase is due to a rise in Basic Need funding.<br>

2. The large amount of funding this year is due to a &#163;62.3 million Private Finance Initiative, and a high Basic Need allocation.<br>

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51124w07.html_spnew9"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The White Paper makes clear that it will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to become self-governing foundation schools and to acquire trusts, taking account of the views of parents and other stakeholders. The Government have already introduced a fast-track route for community and voluntary controlled secondary schools to acquire self-governing foundation status and have consulted on extending this to primary schools. Schools wishing to acquire trusts will follow similar procedures, with added safeguards where parents have concerns about the acquisition of a particular trust. In particular, the local authority will be able to refer a school&#039;s proposals to acquire a trust to the Schools adjudicator for determination, if it is clear that the school has failed to take proper account of the views of a majority of parents or if there are serious concerns about the impact of the proposals on school standards. The White Paper envisages the appointment of a Schools commissioner who will support the development of trust schools and work with potential trusts.

<a name="stpa_72">The figures drawn from these reports are not an accurate estimate of Iraqi casualties caused by UK forces, and should not be taken as such. It is not always possible to make an accurate count of Iraqi casualties following hostile contacts. The figures reported are the subjective impression of troops involved in the incidents. There is no way of checking these impressions since UK forces do not risk their own lives to ascertain how many casualties they have caused hostile forces and Iraqi casualties are frequently withdrawn from the area. It is also not always possible to determine who caused the casualties. Sometimes insurgents are killed or injured by the fire of other insurgents, although this number is likely to be small.

Figures from 1997&#150;98 to 2004&#150;05 are not directly comparable because the basis of government accounting was changed in 2001&#150;02 with the switch from cash accounting to resource accounting and budgeting.

Friend the Prime Minister set out at the European Parliament on 26 October 2005, a common EU energy policy should focus not on new regulatory barriers but on obtaining a genuinely open energy market, on dialogue at a European level with key suppliers and on clean technologies, energy efficiency, and source diversification to meet the challenges of global warming. Work in several of these areas is already under way and will be discussed at the Energy council on 1 December 2005. The Commission will provide an interim report on follow-up to Hampton Court at the December European council with further discussion on the basis of full reports in 2006.

1. Caseload is defined as the number of cases that are &quot;open&quot; and at any stage in the process.<br>

2. There is currently no robust management information relating to new scheme cases and old scheme cases operating on the new computer system for the years 2003 and 2004.<br>

3. There are currently 15,000 cases being administered clerically (September 2005). It is not possible to say if these cases are included in the above figures.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> The statutory role of the BPC is to cause to be published the British Pharmacopoeia. This is not published for Government but for sale to the public and industry.<br>

2 This has not specifically been decided yet, and the answer provided is based on precedent with other advisory committees.<br>

3 The Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee Order establishing HMAC came into force on 30 October 2005. The answer provided refers to planned future activity.<br>

Note:<br>

ANDPBs may have a statutory base either by provision being made for their existence in law, or by the law putting an obligation on the Secretary of State which is then partly undertaken by an ANDPB set up by the Secretary of State for the purpose.<br>

[27529]</p>




<p><a name="st_267"><a name="51124w29.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11 November 2005]:</i> The Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) total charge to a general practitioner registrar for a certificate of completion of training (CCT) is &#163;250. This is a single, once-and-for-all payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w29.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_172">Since PMETB assumed the responsibility for award of CCTs on 30 September 2005, the board had obviously not issued any CCTs by Saturday 1 October.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w29.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_173">Looking at the number of CCTs in general practice issued by PMETB since that date, the maximum length of time taken to award a CCT, once all the required documentary evidence had been submitted, was 12 working days. The average for this activity is 11 working days.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w29.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_174">If PMETB&#039;s award is based on a previous joint committee for postgraduate training for general practice (JCPTGP) assessment there is no additional cost. However, I understand that the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) has decided to charge an enrolment fee of &#163;350 for doctors now entering GP training so that it can advise and monitor doctors&#039; progress through training and carry out the necessary work to make recommendations to PMETB on the issue of a certificate. This is consistent with the practices of other medical Royal Colleges for this activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w29.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_175">The CCT was not awarded before 30 September 2005 when PMETB took up its legal functions. The CCT replaced the certificate of prescribed experience previously awarded by the JCPTGP. Although we do not know the maximum length of time the JCPTGP took to award its certificate, we understand that the average length of time was 10 working days from receipt of all the documentary evidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w29.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_176">The change from the JCPTGP to the PMETB has had absolutely no impact on the recruitment of general practitioners. There were some initial problems when functions were transferred to PMETB at the beginning of October but these are being resolved and at the present time there are no complete applications over 11 days old awaiting the award of a CCT.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.<br>

2. Figures have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning health care or other services.<br>

3. The majority of expenditure of the SHAs is for education, training and research.<br>

4. Reductions in expenditure between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are caused by the further transfer of commissioning from strategic health authorities to primary care trusts.<br>

5. Cumbria and Lancashire SHA. In 2004&#150;05, the student grants unit expenditure (&#163;369 million in 003&#150;04) was transferred to the NHS Pensions Agency.<br>

<p><a name="st_341"><a name="51124w37.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 Revenue allocations are made directly to primary care trusts (PCTs), not by strategic health authorities. These allocations are made on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each PCTs target share of available resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w37.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_207">The components of the formula are used to weight each PCTs crude population according to their relative need (age, and additional need) for health care and the unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing health care (market forces factor).

<p><a name="st_342"><a name="51124w37.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 It is too early to make an assessment of the impact that changes to primary care trusts will have on community hospitals. Policy work is in progress on the range of services that a modern community hospital could offer and the outcomes of the &quot;Your Health, Your Care, Your Say&quot; consultation will influence this.

<p><a name="st_343"><a name="51124w37.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> 
 [<i>holding answer 19 October 2005</i>]: As part of the proposals for primary care trust (PCT) reconfiguration, one strategic health authority (SHA) has proposed to procure an external management team to run one of their newly proposed PCTs. However, this proposal will not be considered during the forthcoming public consultation as we believe it is the new PCTs, not the current SHAs, who should decide how best to manage their responsibilities after reconfiguration.

<p><a name="qn_344"><a name="51124w37.html_wqn4"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason Agenda for Change arrangements place both junior radiographers and senior II radiographers in the same salary band; and what assessment she has made of the implications of this policy on recruitment and retention in the profession.  [25535]</p>




<p><a name="st_344"><a name="51124w37.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 Under Agenda for Change, the basic pay that staff receives reflects the knowledge, responsibility, skills and effort required for their job as measured by the new national health service job evaluation scheme, rather than their previous job title. Agenda for Change also has generally fewer pay bands than the Whitley system it replaces. For these reasons, there is no guarantee that staff in different Whitley grades in the past will be in different pay bands under Agenda for Change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w37.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_208">In the case of radiography, there have been concerns about the wording in some national job profiles which assist trusts in assimilating radiographers to the new pay system. The job evaluation group, a sub-group of the NHS Staff Council, is currently working with the Society of Radiographers to revise the band five and band six national profiles.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Nov 2005 : Column 2296W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w37.html_para2">
This work cannot guarantee that senior II radiographers will be in a higher pay band than basic grade radiographers. It will however help ensure that assimilation decisions are appropriate. In addition, where trusts consider that pay levels are insufficient to recruit or retain staff, they are allowed to pay recruitment and retention premia of up to 30 per cent. of basic pay. For these reasons, it is not anticipated that the move to the new system will result in recruitment problems in the profession.

 The national health service is founded on the principles of equal access and equal treatment for all. Providing communications support to service users is not an optional extra; this is driven by the requirement to comply with legislation and supporting guidance. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 and the Human Rights Act 1998 make it imperative for public organisations, including primary care trusts, other NHS bodies and local councils, to provide language and other communications support to individuals seeking help. Various pieces of guidance and advice issued to the NHS and social care in recent years have emphasised this point. In addition, since October 2004, NHS Direct has ensured that all callers who have difficulty in speaking English, and prefer to speak in other languages, can have a telephone interpreter on the line during a consultation. The service is available 24 hours a day seven days a week.

 The Government take underage drinking extremely seriously. That is why we are taking forward work through the Alcohol Harm Reduction Programme to tackle it. Recent activities in the Programme have included the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns in which the police have clamped down on underage drinking&#151;through fixed penalty notices for both buying alcohol while underage and those who buy alcohol on behalf of children, test-purchase operations on licensed premises and confiscating alcohol from young people.

<a name="stpa_213">We have also been working closely with the alcohol industry to develop a Principles and Standards document which includes a commitment to prevent sales to under-18s through a &quot;Challenge 21&quot; approach and better staff training. The Licensing Act 2003, which comes into force on 24 November 2005, will make it an offence to sell alcohol to minors anywhere in England and Wales, and introduces tougher penalties for those who do. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill builds on this through new powers for the police to close premises for up to 48-hours where alcohol is persistently sold to under-18s.

 The UKPS biometric enrolment trial was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale biometric enrolment and provide data on perceptions and attitudes, and on the timing of enrolment processes. It was not a trial of technology and the technical solution used was not optimised to give maximum enrolment performance. Failure to enrol in the UKPS trial should not be taken as an absolute indication that a participant is unable to enrol a specific biometric rather that enrolment was not successful using the range of equipment available during the trial, in the limited time available and within the context of the trial. The trial report, with this data can be found at http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/publications.html

<p><a name="st_367"><a name="51124w40.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Street Crime Initiative, launched in 2002, was aimed at improving the safety of individuals on the streets. The initiative succeeded in reversing the sharp upward trend in robbery levels and, over three years, reduced robbery by 32 per cent. in the ten street crime areas. The lessons learned from the initiative form the basis of good practice guidance which has been disseminated to all police forces by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w40.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_222">Throughout the course of the initiative, a range of preventative and intervention schemes aimed at young people were introduced, for example &quot;Positive Activities for Young People and Safer School Partnerships&quot;, which now play a key part in the delivery of the cross departmental programme to tackle youth crime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51124w40.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_223">Another example is the &quot;SAFE&quot; campaign. In January 2005, in conjunction with Crime stoppers, we ran &quot;SAFE&quot;-a national anti-robbery week in schools. The campaign, which included assembly and lesson plans, provided young people with the knowledge and skills to avoid situations that increase their vulnerability to street crime. It supported and reinforced messages and information provided by local schemes, such as the &quot;Street Wise&quot; project in Havering, which raises young people&#039;s awareness and assists in increasing their personal safety. The campaign was delivered to 11&#150;14 year olds in secondary schools throughout England and Wales. We are currently updating the materials with a view to running the campaign again in January 2006.

 At Newhaven, the immigration control is usually operated between 0500 hours to 2300 hours seven days a week. The operating hours are dependent on the number, and times, of the ferry arrivals at Newhaven.

The immigration controls operating on the Eurotunnel site in France are staffed by immigration officers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
