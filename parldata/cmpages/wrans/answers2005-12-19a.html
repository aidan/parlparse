CCIS is an in-depth study that involves specialist teams examining over 1,300 cars per year after they have been involved in police reported injury crashes and correlating the injuries suffered by the vehicle occupants to their causes. The vehicle investigation involves a thorough evaluation of all the cars&#039; safety features, including seat belts and airbag systems.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51219w02.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Buck </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 December 2005]:</i> Not all foreign operated flights into the UK require prior permission from the Secretary of State for Transport. Those stopping for non-traffic purposes (e.g. to refuel) and privately operated flights do not require prior permission. Where operators of foreign registered aircraft are required to seek permission to land from the Secretary of State in order to comply with Article 138 of the Air Navigation Order 2005, it is apparent from their applications whether the purpose of the flight is to carry passengers or cargo. Flights carrying dangerous goods or munitions of war are required to seek specific authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority.

 The &quot;Future Air Transport&quot; White Paper published in December 2003 sets out a 30-year strategic framework for the development of airport capacity in the UK.

Monitoring of progress against the action plan is included in the annual report, with additional monitoring of the high level factors which influence levels of over-indebtedness reviewed on a quarterly basis (and published on the DTI website: http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topicsl/overindebtedness.htmmonitorql05). The results of these exercises are set out in the documents referred to and enclosed references.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reasons the Postal Services Act 2000 does not require the Post Office to compensate for the cost of the postage when a package is lost.  [38110]</p>




<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51219w11.html_spnew10"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 Section 89 of the Postal Services Act 2000 enables universal service providers (currently only Royal Mail) to make schemes setting out the terms and conditions for their provision of universal postal services. These schemes include provision for compensation payments for loss etc. Postcomm, the independent regulator, is responsible for enforcing such schemes (including on compensation) through the licensing regime also created by the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51219w11.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_59">The powers required for Royal Mail to make such schemes were already in place under previous postal services legislation before the creation of the 2000 Act. Rather than introduce new arrangements, when adequate mechanisms already existed, the Postal Services Act 2000 merely mirrored previous arrangements updating them only to take into account the new framework and references for postal services envisaged by the 2000 Act (i.e. the potential for more universal service providers in addition to Royal Mail and the licensing regime).

<p><a name="qn_136"><a name="51219w12.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Binley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make representations to British Telecom on not holding consumers responsible for telephone charges due to rogue dialling; if he will introduce legislation to protect consumers from the effects of rogue dialling; and if he will ask the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information to re-open an investigation of the role of premium media communication and other companies in rogue dialling.  [33181]</p>




<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51219w12.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) has put in place a prior permission scheme for Premium Rate diallers. This makes it possible to assess the dialler software to be used for proposed services, and if appropriate to prohibit their release. The independent regulator for electronic communications, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), is currently consulting on extending this scheme to enable ICSTIS to take action against any rogue dialler irrespective of the telephone number or call charge used. Implementing a recommendation from Ofcom&#039;s Report into the Regulation of Premium Rate Services, this Department has just increased the maximum fine for breaches of the ICSTIS Code, and ICSTIS intends to review its sanctions policy early in 2006. ICSTIS has also put in place a key recommendation from the report to slow the money-flow to those that abuse the premium rate services charging mechanism. This obliges telecoms companies not to make payments to premium rate service providers for at least 30 days after calls have been made. This gives ICSTIS more time to identify breaches of its Code and enables ICSTIS to direct telecoms companies to withhold funds pending the outcome of investigations.

As ICSTIS has not had any complaints since May, Premium Media Communications may have withdrawn from the UK dialler market. However ICSTIS plans to write to this company shortly to give it notice of the withdrawal of its licence to operate diallers. This means that no phone company can give Premium Media Communications premium rate numbers for dialler services.
