<a name="00619w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Greenway: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what guidance has been issued to Crown prosecutors about securing international football banning orders in respect of persons convicted of violence associated with football matches.  [126869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Detailed internal guidance on the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999, which widened the circumstances in which the courts can prevent those convicted of football-related offences from attending matches abroad, was issued to all Crown Prosecutors on 14 September 1999. This guidance stressed the importance of the legislation in relation to the Euro 2000 tournament, and advised prosecutors that the courts should be reminded of their duty to impose international football banning orders, whenever appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00619w01.html_para0">Further guidance was circulated on 16 June 2000 informing all Crown Prosecutors of two statutory instruments which now allow criminal offences committed by English and Welsh football supporters in Belgium and the Netherlands to be used as the subject of international football banning orders imposed in our domestic courts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the dates on which the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment has met to discuss the contamination by GMOs of rape seed.  [123833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> Advanta were unable to give sufficient information at the meeting with officials on 17 April for ACRE to be consulted at that stage. Advanta were initially unable to state for certain what type of GMs were found, the level of GM presence (and how reliable the information was) or which seed batches were involved.
<P>

<a name="00619w01.html_para1">When this information was available the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment were consulted through correspondence with the DETR on 10 May. This is normal procedure for seeking their views on issues outside their normal meeting schedule. The advice was clear on 17 May, prior to the Government's announcement, and ratified at their meeting on 25 May.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2000 : Column: 2W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00619w01.html_para2">ACRE's advice is that there is no risk to human health or the environment.

<a name="00619w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the percentage changes in grants to local authorities, including revenue support grant, in each of the last three years, broken down by <i>(a)</i> London boroughs, <i>(b)</i> Metropolitan councils, <i>(c)</i> counties, <i>(d)</i> unitary authorities and <i>(e)</i> shire districts. [124989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The table sets out the percentage change in the amounts of grants made by my Department to local authorities in each of the last three financial years. It has not been possible to provide the requested breakdown by local authority class, because information is not held in that form for all the grants concerned. In addition, local government reorganisation during this period means that any data provided on a local authority class basis would not be comparable year on year.

 The policies we are pursuing generally to improve air quality are set out in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that

<P><I>19 Jun 2000 : Column: 4W</I><P>
we published in January. The Strategy sets objectives for driving down levels of the most common air pollutants. This is an important step in protecting health, particularly of those most vulnerable to air pollution, such as children with asthma.
<P>

<a name="00619w01.html_para3">My Department set up the School Travel Advisory Group in 1998 with colleagues in DfEE and DH, to advise on work to reduce car use, improve air quality and develop safer journeys to school.
<P>

<a name="00619w01.html_para4">In addition in October 1999 colleagues in DH and DfEE launched a National Healthy School Standard as part of the Government's Healthy Schools Programme. Many activities related to this programme will help make the school environment safer for children with asthma.

[125869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 On 10 February the Secretary of State announced his decision to hold a public inquiry into the application under the Transport and Works Act 1992 by Rover Group Ltd. for an Order to authorise a rail link from Land Rover's Solihull factory to the West Coast Main Line. At that time, Rover Group Ltd. owned the Land Rover business.
<P>

<a name="00619w02.html_para0">Following the disclosure in March that BMW intended to dispose of the Rover Group and to sell the Land Rover business in a separate transaction, the application has been held in abeyance pending the outcome of the proposed sale. I understand that BMW and Ford have now signed an agreement for the sale of the Land Rover business.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2000 : Column: 5W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00619w02.html_para1">Once the completion of the disposal has been confirmed, it will be for the new owners of Land Rover to decide whether they wish to proceed with the proposed rail link. If they do, we will need to consider with them whether the Order applied for by the Rover Group can properly be taken forward, or whether that application should be withdrawn and a new one submitted. I shall keep the hon. Member informed of progress.

 I understand that the former Ditherington Flax Mill and attached former malt kiln were designated Grade 1 listed buildings on 10 January 1953. The cast iron framed building dates from 1797. The mill also includes several Grade II buildings at risk. All buildings appear on the English Heritage register as Grade A--buildings at risk of further rapid deterioration or loss of fabric with no solution agreed.

<a name="00619w02.html_para3">This precautionary advice is expected to remain in force until further investigations have been undertaken to enable proper assessment as to whether or not there has been any exposure to the dioxins and heavy metals, and therefore a potential risk to health. This will include further testing on eggs, soil and vegetables.

Specific legislation which may be relevant includes the state aid rules, the EC Merger Regulation and the Utilities Directive. Ultimately, it would, of course, be for the European Court of Justice to rule on the applicability of treaty provisions and associated legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 June 2000]:</i> Local authorities have powers under section 21 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 to close roads for the purposes of local carnivals and fairs. Additional powers in the Road Traffic Regulation (Special Events) Act 1994 enable authorities to make orders to close roads for any sporting event, social event or entertainment which is held on a road. The police's powers to close roads are to enable them to deal promptly and safely with emergencies and public order matters.
<P>

<a name="00619w02.html_para4">It is a matter for the local authority to decide whether to support a request to close a road for a carnival or parade organised by a charity and, if so, whether use of their powers under the 1847 Act or 1994 Act would be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00619w02.html_para5">We have no plans to amend the requirement on local authorities to make orders before they close roads. There are no Regulations governing the procedures local authorities must follow under these Acts. It is therefore entirely for the local authority to decide, in the light of the likely impact of the event on the community, the procedures to follow, including the level of publicity and notices in the press.
<P>

<a name="00619w02.html_para6">We have no information on the numbers of parades and carnivals held every year on the road and consequently cannot estimate the cost to charities if local authorities charge, as they can do, for orders under the 1994 Act.

The Local Government Bill [<i>Lords</i>] provides a framework tailor made for executive arrangements, including cabinet governance and directly elected mayors. There is considerable international experience of the benefits that these forms of governance can bring, particularly of the benefits directly elected mayors can bring for their local communities.

 The New Deal for Communities (NDC) fosters the intensive regeneration of some of our poorest neighbourhoods, supporting projects that tackle such problems as poor job prospects, high levels of crime, educational underachievement, and poor health. To get funding, community based partnerships in eligible areas must first develop a long-term strategy for delivering sustainable change. Since November 1999, 16 pathfinder partnerships have received offers of long-term support and made a start on implementing their strategies. As at April 2000, spending under the NDC had reached &#163;4.9 million.

[125781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w04.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We welcome the action by the World Bank to investigate cases of alleged corruption. We have asked the Bank to make available to national authorities the information on which they have taken a decision to debar firms from procurement. We understand that the Bank is in discussion with other multilateral development agencies about corruption cases. It is up to the Board of each agency to reach its own conclusions based on the evidence, but we would support a robust line against corruption within their programmes. There are no procedures to limit access to ECGD facilities by any company debarred by the World Bank from receiving funds, but ECGD are looking at how to tighten up their anti-corruption procedures.

 Our programme of bilateral assistance to Uganda is set at &#163;57 million in the current financial year. Of this we anticipate that &#163;38 million will be disbursed as budget support, flowing directly through the Government of Uganda consolidated fund. Over the next two financial years the programme is expected to increase to &#163;60 million and &#163;70 million respectively. Of these amounts, &#163;42 million and &#163;53 million respectively will be channelled through the Government of Uganda's budget. Thus the proportion flowing through the budget will rise from 67 per cent. in 2000-01 to 76 per cent. in 2002-03.

 We rigorously assess all arms export license applications against UK and EU criteria. These include the need to consider the risk that exported arms might be diverted to undesirable end-users, such as child soldiers. Similar considerations apply to exports of arms by the Government. The FCO and our posts overseas consult a wide range of contacts--both official and non-governmental--in order to inform the decision making process and thus reduce the risk of exports from the UK being diverted to undesirable end-users.

 We are totally opposed to the use of child soldiers wherever they may be employed. During my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's visit to Sierra Leone on 8 June, President Kabbah reaffirmed his assurances that children would not be used by the Sierra Leone armed forces. The leaders of the two main factions loyal to President Kabbah gave similar assurances to the Foreign Secretary.
<P>

<a name="00619w05.html_para10">Thousands of children have been forcibly recruited by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) during the conflict in Sierra Leone, and forced to fight. Several thousand children are believed to remain in RUF hands.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w05.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Since January 1999, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has met President Kabbah on six occasions: in Abuja, in London, in New York, in Durban, in Cairo, and, most recently, in Freetown.
<P>

<a name="00619w05.html_para11">Discussion at these meetings centred on the prevailing situation in Sierra Leone, and on Britain's efforts to help the Government of Sierra Leone build lasting peace and stability.

<a name="00619w05.html_wqn22"><B> Mr. Maude: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w05.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The international community and the region have long pursued a military/diplomatic twin track policy for achieving lasting peace in Sierra Leone. The ECOWAS Summit of 1998 endorsed the recommendations of ECOWAS Ministers of Foreign Affairs to combine the strengthening of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) with efforts at dialogue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w06.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00619w06.html_para1">I am informed that at the Lancaster House Constitutional Conference in October 1979, the UK Government undertook to assist with land resettlement alongside other donors--noting that scale of assistance required was beyond the scope of any individual donor. No specific figure was pledged. &#163;20 million was offered through the 1981 Land Resettlement Grant; though this grant closed in 1996 with &#163;3 million unused by the Zimbabwe Government. A further &#163;27 million was provided during the 1980s as budgetary support to help the Zimbabwe Government meet their share of resettlement costs.
<P>

<a name="00619w06.html_para2">Since taking office in May 1997, we made it very clear that we were willing to support land reform and resettlement in Zimbabwe, because Zimbabwe needs land reform to reduce poverty. We are willing to fund schemes which are focused on helping the poor. We also made it clear that we will only support a programme that is fair, transparent, cost effective, within the rule of law, and which will genuinely benefit the poor. Because these principles are not being fulfilled we cannot support the Zimbabwean Government's Land Reform and Resettlement Programme.

 The responsibility for flying the Union Flag rests with the department which has the main occupancy of each building and where that building has a flagpole. The Union Flag was flown on 2 June at Hillsborough Castle, Maghaberry, the Prison Service College, Maze and Magilligan. It was not practical to fly the flag at the YOC on that date due to defective equipment which has since been replaced. Following restoration of the political institutions on 30 May, the provision of details concerning the flying of flags on other public buildings on 2 June is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar) of 25 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 612W, on shipbuilding, what progress has been made on placing the contract for the survey vessels. [127003]<P>

 I am pleased to be able to announce that the prime contract for the procurement of two new specialist warships, known as Multi-Role Hydrographic and Oceanographic Survey Vessels, has today been awarded to Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd. The contract includes the provision of 25 years contractor support for the vessels and is worth some &#163;130 million in total over the life of the ships.
<P>

<a name="00619w07.html_para2">Following a competition run by Vosper Thornycroft, the sub-contract to build the ships has been awarded to Appledore Shipbuilders in Devon. The ships, which are due to enter service in 2002 and 2003, will be named HMS Echo and HMS Enterprise.
<P>

<a name="00619w07.html_para3">These important new warships demonstrate our commitment to the modern force structure that emerged from the Strategic Defence Review. They will be equipped with the latest survey systems, and provide a significantly enhanced surveying capability and much improved sea-keeping capability over the vessels which they will replace, which are old and increasingly costly to maintain. They will be part of the Fleet's front-line in a variety of world-wide operational roles, as well as undertaking specialist surveying tasks necessary to the long-term effectiveness of the Royal Navy.
<P>

<a name="00619w07.html_para4">Construction of the new ships will sustain some 500 jobs directly in the shipyard and some 300 in other suppliers, mainly in the local area.

The programme is proceeding to schedule and both participating Governments are pleased with progress to date. In parallel, studies are being conducted to examine the potential use of unmanned air vehicles. The outcome of these studies will be used to inform the UK decision on the optimum mix of platforms, technology and sensors and the role that TRACER would play in the Army's future battlefield information gathering system.

We are in regular contact with the US DoD on this and their FCS programme. It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the prospect of UK involvement in the FCS programme.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many depleted uranium shells have been fired at hard targets in the Solway Firth from DERA's Kirkcudbright ranges; and what quantity of depleted uranium was used in each of the last five years; [125717]

 Although the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) conducts the depleted uranium (DU) firings at Kirkcudbright, ownership of the range, since 1 April 1997, has rested with the Army.
<P>

<a name="00619w07.html_para8">There have been no deliberate firings of DU at hard targets at Kirkcudbright and, therefore, in the normal course of events there is no release of particulate dust. However, there have been three occasions in the last five years when shells have misfired and hit either the ground or the target gantry. A small amount of DU dust will have entered the atmosphere as a result of these events. Remedial action has been taken in each case and the contamination removed to the satisfaction of the regulatory bodies, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency(SEPA) and Dumfries and Galloway Council. Air samplers which have been running since 1997 have not detected any particulate DU in the atmosphere above background levels.

 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2000]:</i> Internet e-mail access has been available to Ministers Outer Offices and senior MOD officials since 22 March 1999 via a dedicated MOD Main Building network.

Currently, this network has 104 accounts. This is an interim solution while the Department 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2000 : Column: 28W</I><P>
works to connect its main headquarters IT system, CHOtS, to the GSI and the internet, allowing e-mail only access to the internet for unclassified material.
<P>

<a name="00619w08.html_para0">Work is also in hand to provide web browsing of the internet, using separate workstations on a dedicated RESTRICTED only version of CHOtS, CSV8 Open.

<a name="00619w08.html_para2">In addition to these initiatives, internet access, where needed and backed by an approved business case, has been provided by stand-alone PCs purchased through an MOD catalogue.

It is intended that the DMN will be provided when staff move out of Main Building into the decant buildings during its redevelopment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w08.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2000]:</i> There are no married quarters sited at RAF Neatishead. Personnel serving at that unit are housed in Service Family Accommodation (SFA) at either nearby Coltishall or Norwich, which has 644 properties available to accommodate families serving at RAF Coltishall, RAF Neatishead and other Service establishments in the area.
<P>

<a name="00619w08.html_para3">The majority of the Married Quarters Estate (some 57,000 properties or 95 per cent. of the total married quarter estate) in England and Wales was sold to Annington Homes in November 1996 on a 999 year lease. The Ministry of Defence retained the freehold. The properties were sold as a package with the receipt of some &#163;1.6 billion going direct to the Exchequer rather than the Ministry of Defence; properties were not individually priced, so no unit cost is available.
<P>

<a name="00619w08.html_para4">Prior to 1996, SFA was managed by the three Services individually, and the costs of maintaining them was included in the wider provision for maintenance of Defence Establishments as a whole. It is not possible therefore to separate the costs incurred in maintaining SFA serving RAF Neatishead prior to the leasehold sale to Annington Homes.

 I will assume my hon. Friend is referring to the research undertaken by Dr. Abou-Donia of Duke University, North Carolina, which was mentioned in a recent BBC radio programme. Dr. Abou-Donia examined the interaction of Pyridostigmine Bromide (PB), (the active ingredient of Nerve Agent Pre-treatment Sets tablets) with permethrin and DEET (N-Diethyl-m-toluamide), two non-organophasphate pesticides used during the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict. Dr. Abou-Donia published his findings in an article entitled, "Neurotoxicity Resulting from Coexposure to Pyridostigmine Bromide, DEET and Permethrin: Implications of Gulf War Chemical Exposures" in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health in April 1996. The research had a number of significant limitations: the doses administered to the animal subjects were in quantities and in a manner very different from that which Service personnel may have experienced; there were no data to support the suggestion that PB inhibits the metabolism of DEET and permethrin; the dosage route and schedule of administration of chemicals were different to those Service personnel may have experienced; and the toxicities experienced by animals were acute in nature whereas many veterans' health concerns have emerged months, or more, after their service in the Gulf.
<P>

<a name="00619w09.html_para0">A further study addressing the interaction of PB and DEET entitled "Acute effects of an Insect Repellent, N, N-Diethal-m-toluamide, on Cholinesterase Inhibition Induced by Pryidostigmine Bromide in Rats" by Chaney et al from the University of Mississippi Medical Center was published on 1 June 2000. I will write to my hon. Friend once my Department has reached a considered view of this work and a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.

No anti-malaria tablet guarantees 100 per cent. protection: mefloquine, the preferred anti-malaria drug for the Sierra Leone region, is estimated to afford only 90-95 per cent. protection against malaria. In West Africa, where rates of transmission for malaria are far higher than in any other region, some cases of malaria are to be expected. Therefore the number of cases confirmed are within the medically expected numbers.

 The most recent study funded by MAFF was conducted by the Medical Research Council Institute for Environment and Health (IEH), University of Leicester. This took stock of UK and foreign research and was held in conjunction with medical experts to review the epidemiological studies and consider what, if any, further research was needed.
<P>

<a name="00619w11.html_para0">The study concluded from the available evidence that sensitisation to oilseed rape pollen alone, in the absence of sensitisation to other pollens or other common allergens, appeared to be rare.
<P>

<a name="00619w11.html_para1">There are no legal restrictions on the growing of oilseed rape. Oilseed rape is widely grown in the UK and in other member states. It forms part of a cereals rotation and is a valuable crop in its own right.

 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> None. Farmers do not need permission to grow conventional crops and the GM rapeseed involved in the recent incident was planted inadvertently. The Government could act in relation to the growing of the affected rapeseed crops or others only if there were a risk to public health or the environment. The Government have been advised that this is not the case.

<a name="00619w12.html_para2">This Government are committed to ensuring that everyone who is capable of benefiting from higher education will have the opportunity to do so. Widening participation on a sound basis requires policies across a broad front, from improving school performance through to funding formulae that target help on those students that need it most. This is a complex area and the results will not be immediate. We will of course continue to monitor applications in order to evaluate the longer term impact of our action.

These arrangements will, in part, be informed by provisions in the Learning and Skills Bill, which should receive Royal Assent in July.
<P>

<a name="00619w12.html_para3">The Bill includes a range of provisions to improve the learning opportunities available for people with learning difficulties and disabilities, including their transition from school to other learning. In addition, the Government are committed to legislate as soon as Parliamentary time allows, in response to the Disability Rights Task Force's recommendations in respect of further and higher education, which featured in its report published in December 1999.
<P>

We have started work on developing the new profession for personal advisers and this week we aim to publish the consultation document, "Connexions Service: Professional Framework for Personal Advisers--proposals for consultation" asking for views on the profession<i>.</i> This document outlines proposals for a comprehensive training programme which aims to ensure that personal advisers have the appropriate skills and knowledge for the role and meet agreed standards for the profession.
<P>

<a name="00619w12.html_para5">Learning mentors work alongside teaching staff and are responsible for helping pupils to overcome barriers to learning both inside and outside the school. They are employed in schools covered by the Government's Excellence in Cities initiative and report to the headteacher or a member of the senior management team. Learning mentors are available to all secondary age pupils who need them and they devote the majority of their time to those individuals needing extra support in order to realise their full potential.
<P>

<a name="00619w12.html_para6">We will be asking for Connexions Partnership to include in their proposals information about which organisations will employ personal advisers. We expect some personal advisers will be employed directly by the Connexions Service, some will be seconded from partner organisations and some will be employed by organisations which hold a subcontract or franchise for the delivery of some Connexions services.

 The Department has commissioned the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, at the University of York, to conduct a systematic review of the evidence on the safety and efficacy of fluoride in drinking water. The review will cover studies on hip fractures, including studies undertaken in the United Kingdom. It is expected to report in July. We will review policy on fluoridation including any need for further research and advice on the use of topical fluoride in the light of the report's conclusions.

 The fluoride concentration of drinking water, whether occurring naturally at levels up to the maximum permitted concentration of 1.5 milligrams per litre, or artificially supplemented to a concentration of 1 milligram per litre, principally affects dietary intake of fluoride through consumption of tapwater, and of domestically-prepared soft drinks, beverages and meals. The intake of fluoride from retail food is estimated from the UK Total Diet Study. The estimate from data gathered between 1978 and 1980 is included in Chapter 36 of Department of Health Report on Health and Social Subjects 41 "Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom" (sixth impression and later revisions, 1994 onwards). Copies are available in the Library. The Food Standards Agency has recently completed a survey of fluoride levels in the 1997 Total Diet Study and will report the results in full once they have been assessed.

 The British Medical Association Herefordshire Division held a meeting on 31 May at which I understand it was agreed they would write to me asking me to review the provision of hospital beds in Herefordshire.
<P>

<a name="00619w14.html_para9">The important issue for the health service in Herefordshire is the number of patients who need to be treated and the appropriateness of their care.

<P>

<a name="00619w14.html_para10">The agreed plan for Herefordshire has two key elements: consolidating split site acute services and investing in intermediate care in rural and city locations. Intermediate care investment includes provision of modern community hospitals at Ledbury and Kington, additional community health staff, fast response hospital-at-home teams and joint use of re-ablement beds with the local authority.

 Before 24 weeks gestation, there are no specific legal requirements but we recommend that full account be taken of any personal wishes that have been expressed about disposal of foetal tissue.

 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> The average cost per hospital admission for a patient with meningococcal Group C disease is estimated at &#163;3,200. However, information on the full cost of National Health Service treatment, including post- and pre-hospital admission costs and the cost of caring for those patients with long term sequelae arising from meningococcal Group C disease, is not available.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para0">In the year July 1998 to June 1999 there were an estimated 1,500 cases of meningococcal Group C disease in England and Wales; about 150 of these patients died.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para1">The cost of meningococcal Group C vaccine is commercially confidential. However, at the end of the current meningococcal Group C immunisation programme we hope to be able to give an aggregate cost for the whole programme including vaccine purchase, distribution, implementation, information and publicity.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para2">The new meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine is already having a welcome effect on this deadly disease. Early reports show that the number of cases of meningococcal infection in those groups who have been immunised has been dramatically reduced, with a reduction on the expected number of cases of around 75 per cent. The United Kingdom is the first country in the world to benefit from this new vaccine, putting the UK in the forefront of tackling this devastating disease and signalling a great success for the NHS.

 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> It is not possible to give an exact cost to the National Health Service of treating someone with influenza, as the information recorded relates solely to the cost of a hospital episode for respiratory illness, not just influenza. The latest data available, which are for 1997-98, average that cost at &#163;1,900.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para3">The number of admissions to NHS hospitals in England coded as influenza for the financial year 1998-99 was 2,281. This will not include all admissions due to influenza which may be categorised as, for example, respiratory illness.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para4">There is no breakdown of costs to distinguish between flu and other respiratory illnesses and therefore cost of influenza on the NHS cannot accurately be identified.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para5">General practitioners order their own vaccines direct from manufacturers. The cost of giving an influenza vaccination would vary from practice to practice. There are five vaccines to choose from varying in price from &#163;3.99 to &#163;5.70 for winter 1999-2000. On top of the vaccine price, under the personal administration scheme a GP will also receive 10.5 per cent. of the list price and around &#163;1 for each vaccine given. Information on the costs of publicity for influenza vaccine across the NHS is not collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what consultations prior to his recent consultation exercise he has had with <i>(a)</i> the Grimsby and Community Health Council and <i>(b)</i> the National Association of Community Health Councils concerning the future policies and operation of the National Health Service; and what part he expects them to play in his current consultation process. [125384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w15.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Community health councils have the statutory right to be consulted about major services changes planned for their districts. Since we took office, the North East Lincolnshire Community Health Council, which is based in Grimsby, has been consulted about two proposed trust mergers, a review of acute services in the district and the proposed closure of a hospital in a neighbouring district. In common with the rest of the population the Council has had the opportunity to provide comments on the National Health Service for consideration as we work towards our National Plan.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para7">We are in regular contact with the National Association of Community Health Councils in England and Wales and there have been many opportunities for them to contribute to the development of policy for the National Health Service. They have submitted their views as part of the national consultation exercise.

 Bed data for individual hospitals are not collected centrally. The data are collected annually at NHS trust level, rather than by individual hospitals or site. NHS trusts provide healthcare but may provide it at more than one site.

<P>
<a name="00619w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2000]:</i> From the outset primary care groups (PCGs) have recognised the importance of working together both formally and informally.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para9">The East Midlands is not recognised as a designated health region. However, in the West Midlands PCG chief officers and chairs, as well as board members, contribute to local working groups on clinical governance, health improvement, and commissioning as well as other functional areas. A local forum for chief executives and chairs of PCGs meet on a regular basis in Coventry.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para10">In addition, PCG officers attend quarterly network meetings and PCG nurse board members hold bi-monthly network meetings across the West Midlands depending on availability of appropriate venues.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para11">There are currently no formal channels of communication for PCGs at national level, but a number of networking developments have been well received. PCGs moving to primary care trust status this year have had the benefit of a national development network and I understand that PCGs in the West Midlands were part of the Northern network.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para12">Many PCGs took up the opportunity to participate in the national primary care collaborative and one of the successful applicants from the West Midlands was Coventry East.
<P>

<a name="00619w15.html_para13">The National Health Service at all levels is making increasing use of e-mail and websites to facilitate communications.

 Primary care groups are expected to work with other local health and partner organisations to tackle local and national health priorities identified in the Health Improvement Programme. In doing so, they will need to play a full and appropriate role in local campaigns to inform and educate their local populations about health and health services.

 Personal genetic information held in confidence, as with other confidential information, is protected by law. Health professionals also have ethical duties imposed by their regulatory bodies and the majority of National Health Service staff have equivalent contractual obligations. The Human Genetics Commission has indicated that it will be examining the protection of genetic data as a priority in its work programme.

<a name="00619w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Guidance on patient confidentiality, issued by the Department to trusts in March 1996, remains relevant and in force.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The need for helicopter air ambulance services is a matter for local health economies as the case for supporting these from public funds has not been made. Professor Jon Nicholls' report "The costs and effectiveness of helicopter emergency ambulance services", commissioned by the Department of Health, did not show benefits to justify National Health Service investment. The position will be reviewed if any further evidence is presented. A copy of this report has already been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There are no centrally held statistics on deaths caused by hospital acquired infections (HAIs). The role which any HAI might play in a patient's death is a matter for the clinical judgment of the doctor concerned.

<P>

<a name="00619w16.html_para0">The Department does not collect data on the cost of missed outpatient appointments, but the number of appointments missed suggests that the cost to the NHS is significant.
<P>

<a name="00619w16.html_para1">We are committed to improving the reliability and convenience of care for all patients. This is why we are investing &#163;40 million this year to extend the national booked admissions programme. The programme allows patients to book hospital appointments or admission dates in advance at times that are convenient to them. Pre-booking in this way leads to demonstrable improvements in the numbers of hospital appointments missed by patients and the numbers of appointments cancelled by both the patient and the hospital.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department meets the additional costs to hospitals and general practices of supporting the clinical training of medical students from the Service Increment for Teaching (SIFT) levy. In 2000-01 the average SIFT cost per student for each of the three years of clinical training is &#163;46,157 in London and &#163;37,202 outside London. In allocating funding to universities, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) assumes a total resource of &#163;5,462 per year for each full-time equivalent student studying pre-clinical medicine and &#163;12,290 per year for each full-time equivalent student studying clinical medicine. The HEFCE's assumptions on total resource include the statutory &#163;1,050 full-time undergraduate fee which is usually paid by the student, but may be paid by the local education authority after means-testing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally but an indicative capital cost of creating a new hospital bed place in a new hospital is approximately &#163;325,000 (excluding Value Added Tax) at current prices. The cost includes the capital construction cost, equipment costs and professional fees incurred as well as a proportion of the costs of the supporting services within the new hospital such as operating theatres, outpatient departments, accident and emergency services, catering, office accommodation, public areas, pharmacy, pathology and radiology. It does not include the running costs necessary to make the bed operational, such as staffing, linen or cleaning.

<P>

<a name="00619w17.html_para0">Every hospital is designed to meet specific local needs, so no two will be the same, and future hospitals may have different functions and departments. It is not therefore possible from available information to give the average capital cost of providing a new bed in an existing hospital. The cost of upgrading or adapting an inpatient ward within an existing hospital should not exceed a maximum of 70 per cent. of the cost of new provision and would generally be a much lower percentage.
<P>

<a name="00619w17.html_para1">Under private finance initiative rules it is the responsibility of consortium bidders to cost an overall design, construction and service solution. One element of this will be the number, type and layout of hospital beds. Because costing and pricing factors will vary between PFI projects to reflect factors like design innovation, greenfield build or refurbishment and competitive pressures in the private sectors supply chain, it is not possible to provide a unit cost for a hospital bed built under PFI.

 There is nothing in the Protection of Children Act 1999 which would preclude a child care worker from being referred to the Secretary of State for possible inclusion in the list to be maintained under that Act in circumstances where he has been dismissed, or has otherwise left his position, related to a conviction for sexual abuse against children committed abroad.

<a name="00619w17.html_para4">If a decision is taken to include a person on the list to be kept under the Protection of Children Act 1999 the name will remain on the list irrespective of where the person lives or travels.

<a name="00619w17.html_para5">As regards the wider question of British sex offenders convicted abroad, Part I of the Sex Offender Act 1997 does not at present require such offenders to register with the police on their return to this country. The Home Office will shortly be starting a major policy review of the Act and this question will be looked at very carefully as part of that review.

 No CCTV cameras are, or ever have been, installed in hon. Members' offices. Installation of such cameras in an hon. Member's office would be done only with the consent of the hon. Member concerned, and with the personal authorisation of the Serjeant at Arms.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list the predicted weighted case load and cash limit allocation for 2000-01 for each magistrates courts committee ranked by cost per case on the weighted case load used in the grant formula. [126465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w17.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The formula for distributing revenue grant is currently under review. The cash allocation for 2000-01 and 1999-2000 was distributed using the same proportion of the available funds as allocated for 1998-99. The weighted case load was therefore based on 1997-98 figures. Additional payments were made in cases of hardship. Weighted case load accounts for 35 per cent. of the cash allocation. The cash limit allocations by MCC are in table A, the latest cost per case information is in table B. Cash allocations are not based on cost per case. We aim to complete the review of the grant formula so that a new formula is applied to the 2001-02 allocation. We will be consulting stakeholders on the elements that should constitute the formula.

[125426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There have been no such consultations; and, while we are aware of the Jersey legislation on limited liability partnerships, this has not provided a model for the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the proposals referred to, the restrictions currently imposed on bankrupts will apply for the duration of the restriction order. As a consequence those subject to restriction orders will not be able to act in the management of a limited company or as a member of a limited liability partnership.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Section 7(3) of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 requires insolvency practitioners to report unfit conduct by directors to the Secretary of State. That requirement will exist where insolvency practitioners find misconduct by members of limited liability partnerships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the assets of an insolvent business will be eligible for re-use by its former management trading on the basis of a limited liability partnership.  [126037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Provided an insolvent business enters formal insolvency proceedings, then those assets will fall within the estate of the insolvent business, subject to any security held by creditors over those assets. The office holder has a duty to realise those assets in such a way that returns to creditors are maximised. If the failure of the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2000 : Column: 68W</I><P>
business is not the directors' fault, there was no misconduct and they pay the best possible price for the assets, then they should not be prevented from running a successor business utilising those assets.
<P>

<a name="00619w18.html_para1">Where assets have been transferred with the intention of putting them out of reach of its creditors then the "claw-back" provisions currently found in the Insolvency Act 1986 will apply.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry by what means he will prevent individuals under the individual voluntary arrangements as envisaged in his White Paper "Bankruptcy: A Fresh Start", from being allowed to become partners in limited liability partnerships.  [126039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Undischarged bankrupts are disqualified from acting in the management of a limited company by virtue of section 11 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. It is intended that this disqualification be extended to include acting as a member of a limited liability partnership.
<P>

<a name="00619w18.html_para2">The majority of persons subject to individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) are not bankrupt and are not therefore subject to this restriction.
<P>

<a name="00619w18.html_para3">The proposals in the White Paper to which the question refers are for the automatic annulment of the bankruptcy on the agreement to the IVA proposal by the creditors. This would then leave the member in the same position as if the bankruptcy order had not been made and they would therefore not be precluded from acting as a member of a limited liability partnership. However, it is likely that there would be a requirement for measures to deal with anyone failing to stick to the terms of his/her IVA. This might include the reinstatement of the bankruptcy order against them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if Company Voluntary Arrangements as provided for in his Insolvency Bill will apply to limited liability partnerships; and what measures he proposes to stop companies operating under a Company Voluntary Arrangements transferring to limited liability partnership status.  [126041]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w18.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Insolvency Bill does not specifically refer to limited liability partnerships. However, limited liability partnerships will be able to enter company voluntary arrangements (CVAs).
<P>

<a name="00619w18.html_para4">A company that is subject to a CVA is subject to a court procedure. It is likely that the conversion to a limited liability partnership would require the revocation of the CVA prior to any conversion. In considering this application the court would consider whether the aims of the CVA were best served by the company being able to convert.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 June 2000]:</i> The Small Business Service (SBS) has a particular duty on behalf of small businesses to examine regulatory proposals put forward by Government Departments to ensure that they do not impose an unnecessary or disproportionate burden on small businesses. This will be achieved by promoting the "think small first" principle. The SBS will also ensure that compliance is made easier through the provision of comprehensible and accessible guidance and that the enforcement regime is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00619w19.html_para6">By 2001, the SBS will establish a Regulation Index of the impact of regulation on small business. This will measure the cumulative burden of regulation on small businesses, will inform priorities for simplification and will determine the future criteria for minimising the burden of red tape.

 My Department receives occasional representations about workplace bullying, which I strongly deplore. Existing legislation can address it in a number of ways. For instance, the Public Order Act 1986 and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provide remedies against harassment, while the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 places a duty on all employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees. In addition, we would always encourage employers to put in place disciplinary and grievance procedures which allow employees to raise concerns and employers to address them. The Employment Relations Act 1999 contains a provision giving workers the right to be accompanied at disciplinary and grievance hearings by a fellow worker or trade union official of their choice, and workers who choose to exercise their right will be protected against victimisation by their employer, as will those who accompany or seek to accompany a worker. Our intention is to bring the new right into force on 4 September.

Only one use per business is recorded during each quarter. The first repeat use by a business of Business Link Services in a later quarter is also recorded.

 Lone parents will benefit from a raft of measures to be introduced during 2001 through the New Deal for Lone Parents and Working Families Tax Credit. These include a &#163;15 training premium, an increase in the Income Support earnings disregard, and help with funding for child care costs for a lone parent moving into part-time work. And all lone parents working 16 hours a week or more will get at least &#163;155, and &#163;214 if they work 35 hours or more.

In the Budget we announced a guaranteed minimum income of &#163;155 a week from next April for lone parents working 16 hours a week or more; &#163;214 a week for lone parents working 35 hours or more. We also announced an increase in the earnings disregard in Income Support for lone parents from &#163;15 to &#163;20, funding for child care costs for the first year that lone parents move into part-time work and a &#163;15 premium to help lone parents train for work.

 Previous estimates have shown that &#163;2 billion a year has definitely been lost through fraud. A further &#163;2 to &#163;3 billion may have been lost in cases where fraud is strongly suspected.
<P>

<a name="00619w21.html_para3">We are now measuring the level of fraud and error, in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance, the two most vulnerable benefits, on a continuous monthly basis. The last figures published by the Government Statistical Service for the 12 months ending March 1999 show the level of fraud and error in these benefits was &#163;1.37 billion or 8.9 per cent. of the total benefit paid.
<P>

<a name="00619w21.html_para4">We have set a target for reducing this fraud and error by 10 per cent. by 2002 and 30 per cent. by 2007.

<a name="00619w21.html_para5">We have a comprehensive strategy, to safeguard the system from the first to the final payment.

 The CSA cannot require non-resident parents to take a blood test. In cases of disputed paternity, the CSA will offer a DNA test as a means of resolving the issue, but the alleged parent is not required to take the test. Under our child support reforms, alleged parents who refuse to take a DNA test will be presumed to be the parent of the child in question and child support action will follow.

 Hardship payments will be available for people in vulnerable groups and others at risk of hardship who have had their Jobseeker's Allowance or Training Allowance withdrawn. Similar arrangements already exist for making hardship payments where Jobseeker's Allowance is withdrawn as a result of employment sanctions. Income Support will not be withdrawn altogether, but will be reduced by 40 per cent. or 20 per cent. of the single person's adult rate, subject to their circumstances; premiums for children, other members of the family, disability etc. are not affected. JSA hardship payments are calculated in a similar manner. All claimants entitled to Housing Benefit when sanctioned would continue to receive it.

 Up to 15 June, 2,177 Kosovans had returned permanently from the United Kingdom, of whom 1,731 had arrived under the United Nations High Commission for Refugees Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. According to a Refugee Council survey of permanent returnees on the point of departure up to 9 June, 59 per cent. would be staying in their own house, 36 per cent. would be staying with relatives or friends and 5 per cent. did not specify where they were staying.

 "Winning Consent", the Report of an Inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), was published on 10 January. I refer to the reply I gave my hon. Friend the Member 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2000 : Column: 89W</I><P>
for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan) on 10 January 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 21W. I have today arranged for a copy of the Commissioner's formal response to the Report, submitted to me in my capacity as Police Authority for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), to be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00619w24.html_para3">The Inspection was carried out as a direct response to a recommendation of the Report of the Inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence.
<P>

<a name="00619w24.html_para4">It was one of the most detailed and thorough Inspections ever carried out by HMIC into specific aspects of policing in one police force, and examined community and race relations policies, and the handling of murder inquiries, in the MPS.
<P>

<a name="00619w24.html_para5">"Winning Consent" contains 41 recommendations. 29 relate to diversity issues, and 12 are concerned with the content of murder investigations.
<P>

<a name="00619w24.html_para6">I welcome the Commissioner's candid and very positive response. When the Report was published, I said that I expected senior management in the MPS to address the issues in it urgently and with vigour. This response confirms that they have done so. It demonstrates how much has already been achieved by the Metropolitan police in implementing the Report and reflects the Commissioner's total commitment to meet the challenges laid down and to continue the process of improvement.
<P>

<a name="00619w24.html_para7">The Report makes 41 recommendations. The Commissioner has accepted all of them (except one, which concerns a matter of professional, operational judgment, in the allocation of murder investigations within the Metropolitan police). Many of the recommendations are for action to be implemented over time. The Commissioner explains that there is a specific plan of action in place for each such recommendation; and some recommendations have already been implemented in full.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00619w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There are no statutory limitations on the period within which proceedings may be instituted for indictable offences (including those triable either way); but under section 127 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, proceedings for summary offences must be commenced within six months of the day when the offence was committed, except where there is specific statutory provision for a different time limit to apply to a particular offence. The summary offences in the Road Traffic Act 1988 which are most commonly charged following a road accident, such as careless driving or driving with excess alcohol (sections 3 and 5 respectively), are covered by the general limit in section 127. The position is the same whether the prosecutor is the Crown Prosecution Service (or other public authority) or a private individual.
<P>

<a name="00619w25.html_para0">The purpose of these time limits is to ensure that summary offences are charged and tried as soon as reasonably possible after their alleged commission, so that the recollection of witnesses is still reasonably clear, and so that there is no unnecessary delay in the disposal by magistrates' courts of the summary offences brought before them.

The Deregulation Committees of both Houses have indicated their readiness, subject to certain changes being made, to recommend approval of the Order. We have considered their comments carefully and have invited further comments from the Committees on changes to the proposals before formally re-laying the Order.

with 3,594, 4,157 and 5,617 staff trained in each year. A new local race relations training pack was launched earlier this year which will further encourage the delivery of this training. The Prison Service Order 2800 Race Relations was strengthened in February 2000 to require the Governing Governor or Deputy Governor to chair the Race Relations Management Team. To enable this, a training course is being provided in partnership with the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. These courses will be completed in July 2000. A consultation phase has begun as part of a review of the basic training provided to Prison Officers with a view to introducing a new course. In the 1999-2000 financial year, 1,122 new Prison Officers undertook basic training. It is anticipated that during the 2000-01 financial year 1,400 new Prison Officers will require basic training.

 I am responsible only for the police service in England and Wales. The available information on police officers has been placed in the Library, and is in the form of population per police officer. Information on civilian support staffing numbers in 1979 and 1987 is not available in a format that would allow comparisons to be made with population on a force by force basis at reasonable cost. However, the aggregate totals for civilian support staff numbers for 1979 and 1987 show that there was one civilian to 1,441 of the population in March 1979 and one civilian to 1,234 of the population in March 1987. Data on the number of special constables have only been collected with regularity since September 1995.

<P>
<a name="00619w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As far as I am aware, the answer to all these questions is none. But the road haulage industry has nothing to fear from the civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, provided that the driver of the vehicle checks his load before embarking for the United Kingdom to ensure that there are no clandestine illegal entrants on board.

 Between 3 April, when the civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 were introduced, and 11 June, penalties were imposed in respect of 189 separate incidents where vehicles were found to contain clandestine illegal entrants. The vehicles comprised 177 heavy lorries, four vans and eight private motor cars.
<P>

<a name="00619w27.html_para8">In 56 cases, the driver of the vehicle was British. The 131 other cases involved four drivers who were Austrian, five Belgians, two Bosnians, four Bulgarians, five Czechs, four Dutch, 27 French, 15 Germans, four Hungarians, two Irish, 12 Italians, five Lithuanians, one Luxembourgeois, ten Poles, three Portuguese, one Romanian, five Slovaks, six Slovenians, ten Spaniards, one Tunisian and five Turkish. In two cases, the driver was a stateless person.

<a name="00619w27.html_para9">In all but 26 cases, the nationality of the driver was the same as that of the company which owned the vehicle. Where there were differences they were as follows. Two British drivers were driving Irish-owned vehicles; and in one case each, British drivers were driving vehicles owned in France and Italy. Two Belgian drivers were driving vehicles owned in Italy. Two Lithuanian drivers were driving vehicles owned in Austria. In one case each, French drivers were driving vehicles owned in Belgium, Germany, Spain and Austria. In one case each, Turkish drivers were driving vehicles owned in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In one case, each Slovak drivers were driving vehicles owned in Germany and the Czech Republic. One driver from Luxembourg was driving a vehicle owned in Austria; one driver from Croatia was driving a vehicle owned in Italy; one driver from Hungary was driving a vehicle owned in Austria, one driver from Bulgaria was driving a vehicle owned in Germany; one driver from Tunisia was driving a vehicle owned in Italy; one driver from Spain was driving a vehicle owned in

<P>

<a name="00619w27.html_para10">In every case, the driver of the vehicle was served with a penalty notice. In addition, in all but 11 of the cases cited, penalty notices were also served on the owners or hirers of the vehicle. In 26 cases this involved the serving of penalty notices on more than two persons or companies in respect of a single incident.
<P>

<a name="00619w27.html_para11">In each case, the level of the penalty was &#163;2,000 per clandestine illegal entrant detected. The penalties imposed ranged from &#163;2,000 (one illegal entrant detected) to &#163;100,000 (50 illegal entrants detected).

 The Integrated Child Credit will bring together the different strands of support for children in the Working Families Tax Credit, Income Support/Jobseeker's Allowance and the Children's Tax Credit, to create a seamless system of financial support for children to be paid to the main carer. The adult credit element of WFTC will, along with the Disabled Person's Tax Credit and the Employment Credit component of the New Deal 50 plus, form the foundation of a new employment tax credit which will extend the principle of WFTC to people without children. Paid through the wage packet the employment tax credit will form a single visible instrument, underpinned by the national minimum wage, to make work pay. The new credits will begin to be introduced from 2003.
