<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to respond to your 3 recently tabled Parliamentary Questions about the Department's proposals to restrict vehicular access to Belfast city centre.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>First, you asked what steps the Secretary of State is taking to ensure that the standards with regard to vehicular access for disabled people to the centre of Belfast match those recommended by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). Whilst the DETR has not published standards with regard to vehicular access, guidelines are contained in its Local Transport Note 1/87, "Getting the Right Balance". I can confirm that the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland has taken these guidelines into account when formulating its proposals for Belfast city centre.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Secondly, you asked what directions the Secretary of State has given to Roads Service officials to comply with the best practice with regard to the needs of disabled people in implementing the Department's proposals for restricting vehicular access to the city centre. The Secretary of State has not given any directions to officials on this matter. However, 2 Departmental Ministers were involved in the consultations between the Department and groups representing the disabled prior to the formal publication of the proposals.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thirdly, you asked what representations the Secretary of State has received from The Disabled Drivers' Association regarding the Department's proposals and what plans she has to meet representatives of the Association. The Disabled Drivers' Association wrote to the Secretary of State on 13 January 1999 asking her to examine the Department's proposals and to meet representatives of the Association to discuss the matter. In her reply, the Secretary of State advised that she was aware of the Department's proposals and indicated that the forthcoming public inquiry (to be held on 23 February 1999) will provide an ideal opportunity for all interested parties to air their views about the Department's proposals. The Secretary of State has no plans to meet representatives of the Association.</FONT></UL>

<a name="90225w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government are committed to developing the UK as the best place in the world for trading electronically and to helping many more small businesses exploit the opportunities of electronic commerce, with the goal of tripling the number of SMEs wired up to the digital market place from 350,000 to 1 million by 2002. The White Paper "Our Competitive Future: Building the Knowledge Drive Economy" set out a wide range of actions to help achieve these goals. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be publishing an implementation plan for the White Paper shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w04.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Impact assessments for all these measures have been presented to Parliament. European Works Councils were estimated to cost &#163;18 million per year. Measures to implement the Parental Leave Directive are estimated to cost &#163;36 million per year. The costs of the Part Time Work Directive are likely to be small. We expect the benefits of all these and other social partnership measures to far outweigh any costs by combating unregulated absenteeism. For example, survey evidence from the CBI suggests that the annual cost of sick absence in the UK could be as much as &#163;25 billion.

In addition the Direct Marketing Association is working on an email preference scheme, to operate in a similar way to the conventional mail preference service but with global rather than national coverage.

<a name="90225w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Clearly it is essential that special care should be taken to ensure that vulnerable groups of customers have access to reliable, affordable, water and energy supplies. That is why this Government have vigorously taken forward work on modernising the framework for utility regulation. The Government's review of water charging in England and Wales raised concerns about the effect of high standing charges on low income, low water users such as pensioners living alone. The Government will consider further how these effects can best be mitigated within the new framework proposed in the Water Industry Bill now before Parliament. Also, we are encouraging the regulator for gas and electricity to review the Social Dimension in his Action Plan, with a view to determining what further initiatives can provide effective help to the fuel poor.
<P>

<a name="90225w06.htm_para0">Standing charges have been the usual means of utility companies making a charge for the fixed costs of providing a service which do not vary according to the level of usage. Such costs generally include meter reading, accounting and billing, maintenance of infrastructure, and provision of emergency services, although there is no requirement for these costs to be recovered by means of a standing charge.
<P>

<a name="90225w06.htm_para1">With the spread of competition in the gas and electricity markets, many customers already have a choice of who should supply them with these important utility services. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1999 : Column: 377</I><P>
Soon, that choice will extend to all such customers. Some gas and electricity suppliers recognise that standing charges are either not popular or appropriate for every individual customer, and have decided to offer different terms which exclude any standing charge. Customers will be able to choose what is best for their own particular needs.
<P>

<a name="90225w06.htm_para2">It is our objective that all groups of customers should benefit from increasing efficiency by receiving quality service at the best possible prices.

In the calendar years 1994 to 1998, 21 applications for Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and one application for an Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL) were refused covering the export to consignees or end-users in Indonesia of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, the so-called Military List. The entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. Applications for individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings. Where this is so, the application is included in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if articles of the 10 carat gold standard hallmarked in Ireland may be placed on the market in the United Kingdom; and what assessment he has made of the consequences for British competitiveness of such marketing.  [72589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Following the amendments to the Hallmarking Act 1973 which came into effect on 1 January, the United Kingdom, in accordance with Article 30 of the EC Treaty and European case law concerning the free circulation of goods, has permitted articles of precious metal hallmarked in Ireland to be marketed here without further hallmarking by a UK assay office. I can confirm that this would include articles of 10 carat gold.




<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1999 : Column: 380</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90225w06.htm_para15">Manufacturers can have articles of gold hallmarked by UK Assay Offices to standards of fineness including 9, 14, 18 and 22 carat (375, 585, 750 and 916.6 parts per thousand respectively) as well as new "pure" standards of 990 and 999 parts per thousand. Given that there is no reason to believe that UK consumers are likely to prefer the 10 carat standard over any of the standards of fineness available here, I do not believe that UK manufactures are likely to be placed at a competitive disadvantage as a result. It is generally agreed that a proliferation of standards is not in the interests of consumers and the United Kingdom seeks to give a lead in this matter by not introducing further standards into the UK hallmarking system. However, DTI will look very carefully at the position in the light of future experience.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w06.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Only those EEA States which have a mandatory requirement for hallmarking under their law and have in the past required imported articles to be re-hallmarked in their country before being placed on the market they would need to amend their laws to permit articles hallmarked in the United Kingdom to be placed on their markets without further marking. The DTI is obtaining up-to-date information from the Commission about which countries have now made the necessary changes to their legislation. I will write to the hon. Member as soon as the information is available and will place a copy of the reply in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="90225w06.htm_para16">In any event, it should be noted that the legal position concerning the free circulation of goods in the EU Member States is set out in Article 30 of the EC Treaty and European caselaw. Notwithstanding whether a Member State has amended its national legislation the Treaty and caselaw will have effect and under these provisions I understand that UK hallmarks should be accepted throughout the European Community. The other EEA States (i.e. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are governed by the EEA Agreement (1992).

 Shops may choose their opening hours, except on Sundays if they are over 280 square metres in area. The restrictions affect Christmas Day but only when it falls on a Sunday. We have no plans to change the present law.

 The information requested for the female prison population and certified normal accommodation (CAN or uncrowded female prison capacity) is for the last day of the month and is given for the appropriate month ends in the table. The available information on the projected female prison population by alternative scenarios is given in table 1 of Home Office Statistical Bulletin 1/99 "Projections of long term trends in the prison population to 2006" published on 20 January 1999, a copy of which is in the Library, and on the Home Office Web Site: http://www. homeoffice. gov. uk/rds/index. htm.

<P>
<a name="90225w09.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what advice has been issued to prison governors concerning the arrangements for probation supervision of persons released on home detention curfew.  [72357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Prison governors have been advised that, where a prisoner is due to be subject to supervision by the Probation Service upon his or her discharge from custody, supervision will commence on the date that the prisoner is placed on home detention curfew. The duration of the supervision is unaffected by the home detention curfew, as the date that the supervision ends is set at the three quarter point of sentence less the period spent on home detention curfew, in accordance with the requirements of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

<a name="90225w09.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what home circumstances reports have been requested in respect of potential release on home detention curfew where prisoners have convictions for <i>(a)</i> sexual offences, <i>(b)</i> arson and <i>(c)</i> offences of violence.  [72369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 No prisoner can be placed on home detention curfew without a home circumstances report from the Probation Service, whatever the prisoner's convictions. The Prison Service may also ask the Probation Service to comment on other issues of concern as appropriate, for instance due to the nature of the offence. The only cases where it is not necessary to obtain a home circumstances report are where it is apparent at an early stage in the assessment process that the prisoner is clearly unsuitable for home detention curfew.
<P>

<a name="90225w09.htm_para0">No offender required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 will be assessed for home detention curfew other than in exceptional circumstances. If the offender is considered for home detention curfew, a rigorous enhanced risk assessment will be undertaken, including consideration of the proposed curfew address. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1999 : Column: 391</I><P>
In addition, such an offender would be placed on home detention curfew only following authorisation by the Director General of the Prison Service.

<a name="90225w09.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what prison risk assessment on inmates eligible for release on home detention curfew is carried out prior to a request for a probation home circumstances report; and if any advice has been given to clarify procedures.  [72358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Advice on the risk assessment of inmates eligible for the home detention curfew scheme is given in Prison Service Order 6700, a copy of which is in the Library. Before comments from the home probation service are requested, (a) the prisoner will have been asked to provide details of his or her home address, (b) information on the prisoner's suitability will have been sought from a member of prison staff in daily contact with the prisoner, and (c) the member of staff conducting the initial risk assessment will have reviewed the documentation available to determine whether there are any particular issues on which the Probation Service should be invited to comment.
<P>

<a name="90225w09.htm_para1">If it is decided from this review of the documentation that the prisoner is clearly unsuitable for home detention curfew and that information from the home probation service would add nothing to the assessment, the reviewing officer can forward the assessment to the governor for confirmation of this decision without the involvement of the home probation service. The decision not to seek input from the home probation service must be confirmed by the governor.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many of those people convicted of crimes in England and Wales in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> each of the previous two years had previously been admitted to National Health Service mental illness hospitals and units with a main diagnosis of schizophrenia psychoses.  [72290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The information requested is not available centrally. National Statistics about convicted offenders do not categorise in terms of the past mental and psychological problems of offenders.
<P>

<a name="90225w09.htm_para10">Information is available on offenders who are admitted to hospital under the provisions of mental health legislation. In 1997, the number of mentally disordered offenders admitted to hospital under a court order, or by direction of the Home Secretary restricting their discharge, was 1,074. Most of these admissions related to patients with a diagnosis of mental illness or mental illness with another disorder (986 in total). Schizophrenia psychosis is a form of mental illness, but the statistics do not record diagnoses to this level of detail.
<P>

<a name="90225w09.htm_para11">Reconviction rates for restricted patients are available. The reconviction rate for standard list offences within two years of discharge for patients discharged between 1977 and 1993 was 12 per cent., with the rate for those with a diagnosis of mental illness being 7 per cent. Standard list offences consist of all indictable offences and some of the more serious summary offences.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made it clear in his statement to the House on 15 February 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 601-13, that a consultation document will be published later in the spring on the options for the new framework within which indeterminate reviewable detention powers for dangerous severely personality disordered individuals will operate. The powers will be available whether or not someone was before the courts for an offence. Sexual deviancy alone does not constitute a mental disorder. However, assessments of both dangerousness and severe personality disorder would certainly take account of previous known criminal behaviour whether of a paedophiliac, hebephiliac or any other nature.

Other forces have also been inspected on this matter as part of the regular inspection process. All inspection reports are published.
<P>

<a name="90225w10.htm_para4">Following the tragic events at Dunblane and subsequent legislation, HMIC have concluded that recommendations in the 1993 report have been largely overtaken by events. HMIC do not therefore intend to pursue the recommendations of the report further but will continue to look at all aspects of police administration, including firearms licensing, during their inspections. The Government have made clear that they intend to keep the issue of firearms controls under close scrutiny to see what further measures, if any, might be needed to protect public safety.

 <i>[holding answer 24 February 1999]:</i> The normal management of the Scottish Office's wide- ranging responsibilities ensures a corporate approach to crime reduction. This is demonstrated in the report "A Safer Scotland: Tackling Crime and its Causes", published on 9 February 1999, which brings together the Scottish Office's policies on health, education, employment, housing criminal justice and other matters which have an impact on community safety and crime reduction. Internal Scottish office Groups on Crime Prevention and other relevant policies ensure that the opportunities for criminal acts are minimised.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many cases of infant leukaemia (ICD(9)) 204 to 208 in children aged 0 to one year) <i>(a)</i> were reported in Scotland in each six-month period from 1974 to the latest available date and <i>(b)</i> would have been predicted during that period on the basis of average rates; and what assessment he has made of the reasons for discrepancies between the two.  [72331]<P>

<P>
<a name="90225w11.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The table sets out the information sought. Geographical variations and time trends in the incidence of cancer are monitored continuously by the Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit (SCIU). Trends in the incidence of infant and childhood leukaemia in Scotland and other European countries are being evaluated in the European Childhood Leukaemia-Lymphoma Incidence Study (ECLIS), which is co-ordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and in which SCIU is participating. As will be seen, the total number of observed cases over the period is consistent with the number expected.

<a name="90225w12.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will list for each year between 1974 and the latest available date, the incidence of brain cancer ICD(9) 191 in children aged 0 to four years in Dumfries and Galloway (i) in total, (ii) by electoral ward and (iii) by sex; and how many cases would have been predicted in Dumfries and Galloway during that period on the basis of national rates for these diseases.  [72330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w12.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The tables show numbers of incident cases of malignant tumours of the brain in children aged 0-4 years resident in the Dumfries and Galloway Health Board area in each of the years 1974-96, and the number of cases which would be expected on the basis of incidence rates for Scotland as a whole. Because of the small number of cases overall it is not possible to provide figures broken down by electoral ward without jeopardising the confidentiality of individuals.

<a name="90225w13.htm_para0">The information available on education expenditure by local government area relates to expenditure by local authorities. The changes in responsibility of local education authorities, reorganisation and concomitant boundary changes, means that expenditure by local authorities on education may not be directly comparable across the years in question. In particular, net current expenditure on education in 1997-98 did not include expenditure on the under five's education which was financed by the nursery voucher scheme. This produces, for most authorities, an apparent 'trough' in expenditure in that year. In addition, the level of expenditure on education by an authority across the years will be affected by changing pupil numbers.

 The Eurostar trains were designed and built to be fully wheelchair accessible. Each train provides accommodation for two people to travel in their own wheelchairs.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts and I have today issued a consultation paper proposing a number of changes in the current handling of listing building consent applications in London. Since the abolition of the Greater London Council, English Heritage has been working with the London Boroughs to build up their expertise in handling these applications. As a result, we now feel able to propose a significant reduction in the number which will in future need to be notified to English Heritage. This will enable decisions to be issued more quickly. However, certain changes, for example those to Grade I and II* buildings, will still need to be sent to English Heritage. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="90225w13.htm_para6">This consultation is the first stage in a wider review of heritage notifications promised in the Modernising Planning policy statement by my hon.

My officials are now talking to English Heritage about the notification arrangements outside London with a view to drawing up further consultation proposals for speeding up this aspect of the planning process.

 Subject to the passage of the Greater London Authority Bill, the Greater London Authority will assume its responsibilities on 3 July 2000. Special arrangements will be needed to cater for this start part way through the financial year. We shall therefore begin discussions with interested parties on the broad framework of transitional arrangements. Under these, the Secretary of State would set a budget and precept for the GLA, including the functional bodies, as if they were in existence for the full financial year 2000-01. He would receive precept income from the London Boroughs. That income, together with redistributed business rates, revenue support grant and other grants would be paid to the predecessor organisations in respect of the period up to 3 July, and to the GLA in respect of the remainder of the year. Following consideration of the broad framework, there will then be further discussions on the detailed application of the transitional arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> The main instrument governing the release into the environment of GMOs is the EC Directive 90-220. This is currently undergoing revision following the publication of a Commission proposal in February 1998. The proposal seeks to make a number of significant changes to the Directive such as strengthening provisions on environmental risk assessment and monitoring, streamlining some procedures, ensuring greater transparency and better labelling requirements, and providing for the consultation of EU ethics and scientific committees.
<P>

<a name="90225w13.htm_para7">The UK is taking a leading role in negotiations in the Council on the revision, though progress depends on the priority given to the dossier by the EU Presidency. The European Parliament adopted its Opinion on the revision of the Directive on 11 February, which also proposes tougher controls on the release of GMOs.

 There is no central record of the health of UK Gulf veterans, either for those still serving or for those who have left the Armed Forces. However, just under 3,000 of some 53,000 UK Service personnel who deployed to the Gulf in 1990-91 have so far sought a referral to the Ministry of Defence's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP), which was established in 1993 to provide as full a diagnosis as possible to veterans who are concerned about their health. A paper describing the clinical findings from the first 1,000 patients examined at the MAP was published in the British Medical Journal on 30 January this year. A copy of the paper is available in the Library of the House. The latest scientific evidence suggest that UK Gulf veterans report more illness than other comparable groups, but does not support the existence of a unique illness or syndrome.

A second phial was found on 23 February and this will be subjected to the same analysis and review.

 A common system of tax reliefs for different types of pension schemes already exists. Where schemes are tax approved, contributions qualify for tax reliefs (within limits), the investment build-up is tax free, and part of the benefits may be paid as a tax free lump sum while pensions are taxable. We propose extending the same system of reliefs to stakeholder pension schemes.

 The new transfer pricing legislation (Schedule 28AA to the Taxes Act 1988) is specifically allied to the advice on transfer pricing in the <i>Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations</i> published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. These Guidelines establish internationally accepted rules for transfer pricing and provide multinational taxpayers with considerable assistance in making an accurate return in relation to arrangements with affiliates around the world.

<a name="90225w16.htm_para12">Additional guidance has been provided by the Inland Revenue in two articles in its <i>Tax Bulletin</i>. The first, dated October 1998, gave advice on funding arrangements and confirmed that existing clearance procedures (as described in an article in <i>Tax Bulletin</i> in June 1995) would continue.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question on the number of people who will benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage (NMW).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The precise information you requested is unavailable. However, estimates of the proportion of people who are currently earning below the proposed NMW for <i>(a)</i> North East Region and <i>(b)</i> Teesside TEC area and <i>(c)</i> Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland Parliamentary Constituency are provided in the attached tables. It should be noted that the tables are based on the latest available information from the 1998 New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS). It provides an historical position against 1998 values of the proposed NMW and makes no judgment on whether its introduction will have any effect on the number of jobs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The preferred method for assessing the coverage of the proposed NMW is to present adjusted NES and LFS data for the number of employees earning less than the proposed NMW rates. This method adjusts for the fact that the NES is based on a one per cent sample of employees in the PAYE system and is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold, in particular those who work part-time. It is not possible to use this method for small areas, and information solely from the NES, has therefore been provided for Teesside and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The extent of the bias in the NES data may be estimated for the North East by using the adjusted NES and LFS data for all employees. This suggests that the estimate of the overall proportion of full-time employees aged over 21 years earning below &#163;3.50 could understate the true position by as much as 5 percentage points. However, it is unlikely that the occurrence of lower paid jobs is uniform across the region, and so it would be wise to treat this figure as broadly indicative rather than as a precise estimate. I am unable to provide the bias for employees aged 18 to 21 years because the sample size is too small for a reliable estimate to be produced.</FONT></UL>

 Despite the abatement, the UK remains a significantly larger net contributor to the EC than a number of other member states whose capacity to pay is greater.

<a name="90225w18.htm_para3">The primary source of IMF resources is subscriptions (quotas) from member countries. The UK quota is equivalent to 5 per cent. of the total quotas. This subscription is not public expenditure, but constitutes part of the UK's foreign exchange reserves.
<P>

<a name="90225w18.htm_para4">In the case of Russia and Brazil, the UK and other major shareholders also provided bilateral loans to the IMF, respectively through the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) and the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). The NAB and GAB are mechanisms that enable the Fund to borrow from selected members when supplementary resources are needed to deal with an impairment of the international monetary system, or an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of the system. To date, the UK has lent the IMF &#163;117,248,801 under the GAB for Russia, and &#163;200,465,904 under the NAB for Brazil. These loans are not public expenditure, but constitute part of the UK's foreign exchange reserves.

<a name="90225w18.htm_para5">The World Bank, the EBRD, and the IADB finance their loans principally from borrowings on the international capital markets.

The UK shareholding at the World Bank is 4.5 per cent., at the EBRD 8.5 per cent., at the IADB 1.0 per cent. and 17.8 per cent. at the EIB (through the Loan Guarantee Reserve). A certain share of BIS moneys is underwritten by the UK treasury. This is not public expenditure, but we do hold contingent liability. Currently, we are underwriting &#163;240,310,674.

<a name="90225w19.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are no comprehensive data on the number of children with asthma. On the basis of all the information available, it has been estimated that "the prevalence of asthma sufficiently severe to require regular medical supervision is from 4-6 per cent. in children". This estimate is quoted in "Asthma: An Epidemiological Overview" (Central Health Monitoring Unit, 1995), which brought together a broad range of the best statistics on asthma in England. Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90225w19.htm_para0">According to the report of the Health Survey for England 1997, 23 per cent. of boys and 18 per cent. of girls aged 2 to 15 years had been diagnosed at some time in the past as suffering from asthma. Copies of this report are also available in the Library.

They will also benefit from wider developments such as the proposals in our National Health Service White Paper and Public Health Green Paper, and the Welfare to Work strategy. We have recently completed a review of learning disability hospital reprovisioning plans, are currently carrying out a survey in 24 local authorities and their matching health authorities and are awaiting the results of an evaluation of different types of residential provision for people with learning disabilities. We will then consider what, if any, further action needs to be taken in the light of this work and advice from the Learning Disability Advisory Group set up last November.

 We shall shortly lay before the House regulations to increase National Health Service Charges in England and Wales from 1 April 1999. There will be a cash increase in the charge of 10p, (1.72 per cent.) from &#163;5.80 to &#163;5.90 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed. This means that prescription charges will fall in real terms.
<P>

<a name="90225w19.htm_para3">The cost of prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &#163;30.80 for a 4 month certificate and &#163;84.60 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than 5 items in four months or 14 in one year.
<P>

<a name="90225w19.htm_para4">Prescription charges are expected to raise some &#163;377 million for the NHS in 1999-2000.

 Since the election, we have regularly published Command Papers listing all the regulations which have been introduced within the previous six months.

and the costs cannot be added together so as to produce a figure which, on its own, has any real meaning. The Government do not therefore publish cumulative figures.

Notes:
<BR>
1. Information on current Widows' Benefits recipients is not available by income decile because the sample sizes involved are too small to allow a robust analysis. Moreover, estimating the position of Bereavement Benefits recipients would require estimates of the future distribution of income.
<BR>
2. In modelling income-related benefit effects, it is necessary to make broad assumptions about take up levels (which differ for each of Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit). Consequently, these assumptions do not directly relate back to individuals in different parts of the income distribution.

<P>
<a name="90225w21.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 TECs contract with a variety of training providers for the delivery of youth and adult training programmes. In so doing, they must ensure that the training delivered meets the specifications for the various programmes that are set out in the TEC Contract and Operating Manual and the related planning guidance. They must also ensure that it complies with their contractual obligations in respect of accuracy of payments claimed for programme delivery, quality assurance and Health and Safety provisions. TEC performance in all of these respects is closely monitored by the Welsh Office 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1999 : Column: 436</I><P>
and subject to the annual performance review; and, when cases of non-compliance with contract have arisen, appropriate remedial action has been taken.
<P>

<a name="90225w21.htm_para7">The content of the training provided is specified by the various industry lead bodies and the qualifications awarded on the completion of training are routinely subject to audit by ACCAC, the qualifications assessment body for Wales.
<P>

<a name="90225w21.htm_para8">The effectiveness of the training programmes in achieving their objectives is also subject to evaluation. Such evaluations are usually undertaken by the Department for Education and Employment on an England and Wales basis and the reports are routinely published. They influence both the subsequent design of programmes and the way in which they are delivered locally via the TECs through the identification of best practice.
<P>

<a name="90225w21.htm_para9">However, whilst these arrangements have provided reasonable assurance that the training delivered has accorded with its intentions, they have not provided any clear indication of the relative standards of training offered by different training providers. Evidence of compliance with training course requirements does not necessarily represent evidence of a good learning experience for the trainee. The quality assurance arrangements provide a limited assurance in this respect, but they are insufficiently independent of the parties involved in training delivery to provide an objective assessment of the standard of training achieved.
<P>

<a name="90225w21.htm_para10">It is for this reason that the Government have enacted legislation to enable the Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector to inspect the quality of training provision in Wales. The Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector will use a framework for inspection which is similar to that used by the Training Standards Council in England and which has been subject to consultation with TECs, training providers and ACCAC in Wales. Inspections will begin in the next financial year and it is intended to cover all providers of Government-sponsored training within a five year cycle. The Inspectorate's reports will provide the first independent assessment of training standards in Wales; and I will expect both the TECs and the training providers concerned to use these reports constructively in the interests of continuous improvement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what estimate he has made of the number of occasions on which member states of the European Union have made use of their non-Treaty veto, established by the Luxembourg Compromise.  [72287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w22.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 No formal records are kept by the Government or the Council Secretariat of the occasions when Member States have invoked the Luxembourg Compromise.

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> I replied on 28 January to a letter of 27 January 1999 to me from the Chief Minister of Gibraltar. Official Ministerial correspondence of this sort is confidential and not normally published. But I can say that I underlined that our commitment under the 1969 Constitution, that we will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes, remained steadfast.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions have been held with the Chilean Government concerning the continuation of flights to the Falklands by Lan Chile after 31 March.  [73247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w24.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 This is a commercial matter for discussion between Lan Chile and the Falkland Islands Development Corporation. We have, however, expressed our regret to the Chilean Government over their decision 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 1999 : Column: 452</I><P>
to ask Lan Chile to suspend flights to the Falklands and said we do not believe this to be justified. We welcome assurances by Lan Chile that they will honour their contract with the Falkland Islands Development Corporation, which expires on 31 March. We hope that they will continue to fly to the Falklands thereafter.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations Her Majesty's Government have made to Chile concerning its formal recognition of the Argentine claim to the Falklands.  [73248]

<a name="90225w24.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We are aware of Chilean statements of support for the Argentine position on the Falklands in recent years. We have made clear to the Chilean Government that we have no doubt abut British sovereignty over the Falklands and have called on them to recognise the right of the Falkland Islanders to determine their own future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of reports that Russians are working on Iran's nuclear, chemical and biological programmes.  [73250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w24.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Russia has extensive commercial relations with Iran, including in the nuclear energy field. Russia's obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) forbid her to assist any other country's nuclear weapons programme. Its commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (BTWC) would prevent assistance to the development of chemical or biological weapons. Iran is also a party to the NPT, CWC and BTWC. We have detailed contact with both Russia and Iran on non-proliferation issues. As with other countries, we take up with them directly concerns we have of non-compliance with their obligations under such conventions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list the dates on which Ministers have <i>(a)</i> contacted and <i>(b)</i> been contacted by the Russian Foreign Minister since 1 November 1998.  [73249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w24.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Contacts between Ministers and Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov are frequent. This continues the pattern established when Mr. Primakov was Foreign Minister. Over the last two weeks alone, the Foreign Secretary has been in contact with Ivanov or Deputy Foreign Minister Avdeev on an almost daily basis concerning the Rambouillet peace process and other international issues. Our contacts since 1 November 1998 are therefore far too numerous to itemise case by case.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many British Embassy staff remain in Belgrade.  [73275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Eleven British Embassy staff remained in Belgrade following the withdrawal of non-essential staff and dependants on 19-20 February. Staff were withdrawn due to concern about security in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) as the deadline for the conclusion of the Rambouillet Peace Talks approached.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90225w24.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The safety of British nationals is of paramount importance to the Government. We monitor closely all potential threats to British interests in the UK and overseas.
<P>

<a name="90225w24.htm_para0">Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice is updated regularly. Currently, we advise against all travel to Yemen. British nationals resident in Yemen are advised to consider whether their presence in Yemen is absolutely necessary, and if not, to leave. If they choose to stay, they should review their security arrangements; be extra vigilant; and stay in close touch with the British Embassy in Sana'a or the Consulate General in Aden.
