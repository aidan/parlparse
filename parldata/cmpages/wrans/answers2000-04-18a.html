<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_wqn0"><B> Kali Mountford: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what progress has been made with the proposed Regulatory Reform Bill.  [119824]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 The Regulatory Reform Bill has today been published in draft, in order to allow the two Parliamentary Deregulation Committees to report on it prior to its formal introduction to Parliament. The House of Commons Deregulation Committee and its counterpart in the House of Lords have great expertise on the existing deregulation order-making power under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. Their views on the proposed extension of this power will clearly be of great interest to the House when it comes to consider the Bill. 'Publication of the draft Regulatory Reform Bill' (Cm 4713) contains the draft Bill, Explanatory Notes and other supporting material, and I have placed copies in the Libraries of the House, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.
<P>

<a name="00418w01.html_para0">In addition to the changes to the deregulation order-making power, the draft Bill includes provisions to replace section 5 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, which deals with enforcement of regulations. This policy was the subject of a public consultation exercise in Autumn 1999. The majority of those responding to the consultation document were supportive of the Government's proposals. I am today placing copies of the Government's response to that consultation exercise in the Libraries of the House, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. Copies of the Government's response to the earlier consultation exercise on the proposed changes to the deregulation order-making power, published in September 1999, are already in the Libraries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what <i>(a)</i> number and <i>(b)</i> percentage of properties in her charge are empty; and what steps are being taken by her Department to reduce the number of such properties.  [116909]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 The Cabinet Office had 168 properties in its charge on 1 April 1999, of which 30.4 per cent. were empty on 1 April 2000. The majority of the empty properties were office buildings held by the Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (PACE), a key responsibility of which has been to dispose of surplus occupied and empty office accommodation on the Government Estate. In many cases tenants have been found for previously empty properties to reduce the burden on the Exchequer and to make them more attractive for disposal to investors. The principal determinant for disposal is value for money 



<P>
<P><I>18 Apr 2000 : Column: 408W</I><P>
to the Exchequer. PACE and another two of the Cabinet Office's agencies transferred to HM Treasury on 1 April 2000. The figures include three office buildings on the Cabinet Office estate undergoing refurbishment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the result of the Government's latest discussions with the Spanish Government on the subject of Gibraltar.  [117396]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Discussions between Spain and the United Kingdom, in consultation with the Government of Gibraltar, to overcome difficulties which have arisen on a number of issues within the European Union concerning Gibraltar have been continuing for several months. I hope that it will be possible to bring them to a successful conclusion.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make it his policy to consult the Gibraltar Government before making decisions on matters affecting the people of Gibraltar.  [119610]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We regularly consult the Government of Gibraltar on a wide range of matters affecting the people of Gibraltar. We do this routinely via the office of the Governor of Gibraltar and through meetings with Ministers and officials when the Chief Minister is in London.

<a name="00418w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how much has been spent on <i>(a)</i> the upkeep and <i>(b)</i> the purchase of works of art in his Department for each financial year since 1992.  [117481]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by the Minister for the Arts, 4 April 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 392-93W.
<P>

<a name="00418w01.html_para1">Most of the works of art on display in our missions abroad are on loan from the Government Art Collection. Some are purchased, as part of large capital projects, such as new Embassies. A comprehensive breakdown of expenditure on artwork purchased could be provided only at disproportionate cost as it has been recorded only as part of the overall capital project cost.
<P>

<a name="00418w01.html_para2">We have no readily available information on the years prior to 1994. The best figures we have for the years 1994-95 to 1998-99 indicate that under &#163;1 million was spent on artwork over that period, less than 0.5 per cent. of the overall programme of capital expenditure on the estate of &#163;215.7 million for the same period.
<P>

<a name="00418w01.html_para3">Upkeep costs are low, and not separately recorded. Expenditure on artworks will be separately identified in future under Resource Accounting and Budgeting.

<P>

<a name="00418w01.html_para12"><i>Zimbabwe</i>
<P>

<a name="00418w01.html_para13">6. The GAC discussed the situation in Zimbabwe.

<i>IGC</i>

It noted the recent decision by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to suspend the voting rights of the Russian Delegation and its recommendation to the Council of Ministers to move towards suspension of Russia's membership of the Council of Europe. The GAC observed that this reflected the deep concern of European public opinion about the continuing conflict in Chechnya. The GAC expressed its support for the Council of Europe's continuing co-operation with, and assistance to, Russia, provided Russia abides by its commitments. At the same time, the GAC acknowledged Russian co-operation in establishing a Council of Europe presence in the region and in agreeing to make public a report on Chechnya prepared by the Council of European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the impact of the construction of the planned bypass roads in the West Bank on the future economic viability of a Palestinian state.  [118949]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Territory, and other issues which may have an impact on the viability of any future Palestinian state, should be determined in negotiation between the two parties, rather than predetermined by the unilateral acts of either.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We consider all settlement activity in the West Bank to be illegal and unhelpful to the peace process. We frequently make this view clear to the Israeli Government, and will continue to do so.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 EU member states recognise the importance of human rights in their Counter-Terrorism Assistance Programme with the Palestinian Authority. Under Phase I of the programme, there was a dedicated human rights project run by the Wallenberg Institute of Sweden. This will continue under Phase II, although the EU member state(s) has/have not yet been chosen.
<P>

<a name="00418w02.html_para0">The UK, along with all EU member states, regards human rights as an important and integral part of the programme and takes every opportunity to convey this message to the Palestinian Authority. Human rights aspects of all projects under the programme are carefully monitored.

 In 1999, 429 applications involving the United Kingdom were registered before the European Court of Human Rights. Of these, 32 have been declared admissible.

<P>
<a name="00418w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Several hundred cases involving the United Kingdom have been brought before the European Court of Human Rights in the last four years. It would not be feasible to list how long each stage of the proceedings took in each of these cases. The procedure for each case is determined individually by the Court taking into account the particular facts and circumstances of the case. A proper assessment of the impact of the new procedures in Strasbourg will not be possible until a sufficient number of cases have been determined exclusively by the new Court. The European Commission on Human Rights ceased to consider cases only on 31 October 1999. It is still too early, therefore, to attempt such an assessment.

 This is an operational matter for the police service, the ambulance service and the fire service. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) reviewed training arrangements in their Police Pursuit Driving Training report of September 1998. The report has been accepted in principle by all of the 43 police forces in England and Wales and its recommendations are being taken forward on a national basis.

 The role of the Sentencing Advisory Panel is to provide views to the Court of Appeal on particular offences or categories of offence to assist the Court in framing or revising guidelines.

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me, as Chief Executive of the Compensation Agency in Northern Ireland, to reply to your recent Question about compensation paid to Crossmaglen Gaelic Athletic Association in respect of use of part of their land by the security forces.
<BR>
Land belonging to the Association was first requisitioned by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under the Emergency Provisions Act in 1974. In 1985 a sum of &#163;150,000 was paid by way of compensation in respect of the period 1974 to February 1985. This compensation was a composite amount and covered both physical damage to the property and the requisitioning of land. For

The value of long-range all-weather precision weapons was confirmed during Kosovo and they are a key capability in the NATO Defence Capabilities Initiative. Long-range weapons allow the UK armed forces to strike with less risk to UK personnel and equipment, and precision guidance reduces the risk of civilian casualties.

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the social and economic impact on remote and island communities of the automation of meteorological stations. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of The Met Office.
<BR>
The Met Office is looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs in the delivery of weather services. The automation of meteorological stations is not a new initiative but an important part of this strategy.
<BR>
Trials are to commence shortly to assess the feasibility of extending the automation process into areas where, up to now, manual observations have been seen as necessary for our operations. Assuming a satisfactory outcome from the trials, we plan to automate the observing functions at several locations around the United Kingdom, including Tiree Airport.
<BR>
We recognise that the withdrawal of Met Office observers from Tiree, should this be the outcome, could have an adverse impact on the local community, and this I would very much regret. In particular, the services delivered by the Highlands and Islands Airport Ltd are likely to be affected. We are, therefore, discussing options with them to examine how they could continue to provide the Aerodrome Meteorological reports which are necessary for airport operations, in the absence of our observers.

 The Government have given a commitment that all benefit recipients who wish to access their benefits in cash at post offices will continue to be able to do so, both before and after the migration of benefit payments to automated credit transfer from 2003. By equipping the whole of the post office network with Horizon, a modern, automated IT platform towards the capital costs of which the Government are contributing &#163;480 million, from spring 2001 the Post office will be able to improve its services to existing clients and take advantage of new business opportunities.

 <i>[holding answer 14 April 2000]:</i> I have now received an outline of the proposed changes from the BNFL Chairman and Chief Executive, following their initial review of BNFL management. It will be for the company to implement the proposed changes, which will be achieved over a period of time. Where relevant, these will need to be fully consistent with the company's site licence obligations and agreed by the Government as shareholder.

 So that the Cabinet Office can publish the Spring 2000 report monitoring progress towards delivery of all Government services electronically by 2005, we are currently collecting data which will include our progress on delivering 25 per cent. of Government services electronically by 2002. I do not wish to pre-empt that report but I can say that we currently provide a range of services electronically which includes information and advice to small and medium enterprises via the Small Business Service Internet 'gateway', and other websites covering science and technology, information on 1.4 million companies (and facilities to register changes to company status), plus the award winning consumer gateway. By 2002, we shall be providing and contributing to more services in these areas and others such as trade promotion, company formations, oil well consents and applications for research grants.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many pensioners in the UK (a) received their pension every four weeks, (b) received 12 pension payments and (c) received 13 pension payments in 1999-2000.
<BR>
At March 2000, a total of 3,873,606 pensioners were receiving their retirement pension by four weekly payments. The payments were made four weeks in arrears and paid by Automated Credit Transfer (ACT) direct into the pensioners bank or building society accounts. All customers who were paid retirement pension by four weekly payments throughout the year would receive 13 four weekly pension payments.

<a name="00418w09.html_para4">The basic pension and linked benefits could be increased by 11.8 per cent. in April 2000 without reducing the National Insurance Fund below the minimum level recommended by the Government Actuary in 2001-02. However, funding this level of increase even in that year only and with a return to uprating in line with prices thereafter would lead to a large shortfall in the next year and in subsequent years. This would lead to an increase in rates of National Insurance Contributions. Thus it can be seen that allocation of a surplus to an immediate increase has consequences for future years by wiping out this surplus.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to the survey conducted by his Department into SEMA Medical Services' doctors, concerning incorrect awards of Incapacity Benefit, how many awards have been <i>(a)</i> disallowed and <i>(b)</i> increased.  [119141]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Department's Medical Policy Group recently conducted a survey of a sample of 200 claims for Incapacity Benefit which had been subjected to scrutiny by SEMA Medical Services' doctors to determine whether medical examination of claimants should be undertaken. The survey revealed that some Medical Services doctors had not followed the new scrutiny guidelines introduced in February 1999. Had the guidelines been followed claimants in the sample who may have continued in receipt of Incapacity Benefit would have been further assessed by medical examination. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the Benefits Agency's decision- maker's determination of eligibility for Incapacity Benefit in an individual case if evidence provided in the form of an examining doctor's report had been made available.
<P>

<a name="00418w10.html_para1">A report of a medical examination by a Medical Services doctor is but one piece of evidence alongside other information provided by the claimant and from other sources, which may include other medical evidence from the claimant's General Practitioner, that the decision- maker will consider in determining eligibility for an award of benefit.

be excessive, the amount allowed in the assessment may be restricted. Where a non-resident parent moves house, his new housing costs will be taken into account, although the existing assessment will be changed only if the effect of the new housing costs is to increase or reduce the liability by more than a fixed minimum amount.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer to my hon.

[118883]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> The take-up statistics are published annually; the last edition, covering the period 1997-98, was published on 24 September 1999 and showed that there were between 530,000 and 870,000 pensioner entitled non-recipients (ENRs) of Income Support. The statistics are drawn from around 8,500 pensioner benefit units interviewed in the annual Family Resources Survey (FRS), which collects information on incomes and benefit receipt, and details of all income and savings.
<P>

<a name="00418w10.html_para7">As part of the programme of poorer pensioner research a sample of pensioners who appeared to be ENRs in the FRS were visited with a view to asking about barriers to claiming Income Support and about ways of encouraging them to claim. Respondents were first asked about changes in their financial circumstances since their original FRS interview. This suggests that the allowance for misreporting, made by the Department's statisticians when producing take-up statistics, merits review. Statisticians are reviewing this evidence and will incorporate it in the next set of statistics on take-up of income related benefits which are due to be published in the summer.

 In addition to Heathrow, ACL has been appointed as co-ordinator under the EC Regulation for Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester airports. The company also acts on a non-statutory basis for Aberdeen, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey, London City, London Luton, and Newcastle airports.
<P>

<a name="00418w12.html_para0">ACL's contract is with the airport operators; it is therefore in the first instance accountable to the airport. At the four fully co-ordinated airports, grievances could also be taken to the airport co-ordination committee, on which the airport operators, air carriers and air traffic control providers are represented. In addition, the Airport Slots Allocation Regulations 1993 place a statutory duty on airport co-ordinators to operate in accordance with the EC Regulation; their actions are challengeable in court. The Secretary of State has the power to withdraw his approval of the appointment of a co-ordinator if satisfied that the co-ordinator has acted other than in an independent manner.
<P>

<a name="00418w12.html_para1">75 per cent. of ACL's income comes from the fees that it charges to the airports where it acts as co-ordinator. About 21 per cent. comes from the 11 UK airlines that own the company, and the remainder from data sales, training and consultancy, and similar activity.
<P>

<a name="00418w12.html_para2">ACL's contracts are commercially sensitive and not available for public inspection. Its Annual Report and Accounts are available for inspection at Companies House.

 My Department supports the UK Climate Impacts Programme at the University of Oxford to help organisations assess vulnerability to climate change. Three national projects concerning climate change impacts on biodiversity are currently in progress within the Programme, two of which are supported by my Department and MAFF. The first study is a general review of implications of climate change for nature conservation policies in the UK. The second is a project involving integrated assessments in two regions, NW England and East Anglia. The third is a modelling assessment of impacts on species and habitats in Britain and Ireland, including wildfowl in river estuaries. All three projects are in progress and the results have not yet been assessed. This is wider than, and would be applicable to, the Ribble Estuary, but no specific assessment has been made in the Ribble Estuary.

 The Ribble Estuary has been monitored since 1970 through the Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS).

 The Government have put strict controls in place to ensure that waste is disposed of without danger to the public. The Environment Agency is responsible for their enforcement. It is a criminal offence to contravene these controls and there are severe penalties for anyone convicted of doing so. We have asked the Environment Agency to continue a vigorous policy of prosecuting, where it has the evidence, anyone who illegally disposes of waste on sites which have neither a waste management licence nor a licensing exemption registered with the Agency.

The allegations of abuse centre on two of the current licensing exemptions and we are reviewing these exemptions in the light of the report's findings.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will assess the benefits of reducing vehicle excise duty to zero for motorcycles under 125cc.  [119598]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In November 1998, the Government consulted on a range of options for the environmental reform of Vehicle Excise Duty, including the creation of a new low VED band for motorcycles with engines up to 125cc. The benefits of motorcycle use are currently being examined in support of the work of the DETR's Advisory Group on Motorcycles. The outcome of those considerations will inform future decisions on Vehicle Excise Duty, which are a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As London is shortly to have a Mayor, this issue will be for his or her consideration in drawing up an integrated transport strategy. Section 142 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 makes it clear that the Mayor's integrated transport strategy should encompass all forms of transport.
<P>

<a name="00418w14.html_para0">The Government's policy on transport was set in the White Paper "A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone" which, among other things, included a commitment to establish an advisory group on motorcycling. My noble Friend the Minister of State set up this group in May 1999.
<P>

<a name="00418w14.html_para1">The Government have also published guidance, which encourages local authorities to take account of motorcyclists when preparing their local transport plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will issue guidance to local authorities on developing their own motorcycle strategy.  [119600]

<P>
<a name="00418w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Local authorities are due to submit five-year local transport plans (LTPs) to Government by 31 July 2000. LTPs will give local authorities the discretion to devise integrated transport strategies at the local level in partnership with the local community. Last month my Department issued local authorities with guidance on producing LTPs. This encouraged local authorities to take account of the contribution that powered two-wheelers can make in delivering integrated transport--for example their use in congested traffic conditions or as an alternative to the car in remote areas--and the needs of motorcyclists, including parking, interchange facilities and appropriate road maintenance. A copy of the guidance--"Guidance on Full Local Transport Plans"--has been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="00418w14.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many road accidents <i>(a)</i> involving motorcyclists and <i>(b)</i> in total were caused by spilled diesel fuel in each of the last three years; and if he will revise construction and use Regulations for goods vehicles and PSVs to ensure that spillage from diesel fuel tanks is prevented by tamper-proof physical measures within the tank itself.  [119599]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In 1999 information on the presence of oil or diesel on the road surface at the site of road accidents was collected for the first time and the data are not yet available. However, early indications are that accidents involving oil or diesel are 0.2 per cent. of all accidents; of which, 30 per cent. involved motorcycles (less than 1 per cent. of motorcycle accidents). Vehicle construction standards are agreed at a European level. A recently agreed amendment to the European fuel tank Directive includes measures to minimise fuel spillage due to missing or insecure fuel caps. We will be implementing all the mandatory provisions of the Directive, and will be considering whether the optional provisions are likely to strengthen our current construction and use requirements.

<a name="00418w14.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will encourage local authorities to exempt motorcycles from road user and workplace levy charging schemes.  [119601]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Our response to our consultation paper, "Breaking the Logjam", which we published on 22 February, set out our policy on exemptions for motorcycles from road user charges and the workplace parking levy.
<P>

<a name="00418w14.html_para2">We intend to leave decisions on exemptions from road user charges to local discretion. Including motorcycles in a road user charging scheme would require practical difficulties to be overcome. We will explore these further with those local authorities that are actively considering a charging scheme as part of our Charging Development Partnership.
<P>

<a name="00418w14.html_para3">As to workplace parking levies, we propose that motorcycles should generally be exempt from counting towards a workplace parking licence total, but we will consider proposals from local authorities on their merits.

 Genetic data provided in confidence should not normally be disclosed to third parties without the consent of the individual to whom they relate. However, the Court of Appeal ruled in December 1999--the Source Informatics judgment--that once data have been effectively anonymised they are no longer confidential. Although we have no plans to introduce legislation in this area at the present time, the Department is considering whether patient interests and the broader public interest are adequately protected.

 Food aid for Britain is provided through NGOs and the World Food Programme.

<P>
<a name="00418w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Ethiopia's military expenditure has steadily increased since war broke out with Eritrea in May 1998. This has led to macro-economic strains and a breakdown in relations with the IFIs. In common with other donors, we are meeting existing commitments under our bilateral development programme, but not taking on any new activities, with the exception of food security. Humanitarian assistance is not affected.
<P>

<a name="00418w17.html_para2">We have not decided to reduce aid to Mozambique. This year's Departmental Report estimates spending on the country programme at &#163;21.41 million in 1999-2000. This does not include &#163;15 million provided to help Mozambique to reach Heavily Indebted Poor Countries completion point, or humanitarian aid in response to the floods, for which &#163;20 million has been committed. We expect to increase our spending on the country programme in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="00418w17.html_para3">

<BR>
<i>Background</i>
<BR>
<i>Ethiopia</i>
<BR>
Britain's bilateral development programme is currently running at about &#163;4 million-&#163;5 million a year. We are supporting activities in food security; the roads sector; revenue-raising; preparation of the interim PRSP; and the police. Before the war with Eritrea, we had been ready to deepen our development partnership with the Government of Ethiopia because of their commitment to poverty eradication. Our aim was to provide direct budgetary support to the Government to implement their own plans in the social sectors. We intended to start this with a new contribution of &#163;25 million to help the improvement and extension of primary education throughout the country.
<BR>
However, since May 1998 when the hostilities broke out and military expenditure increased we have, in common with other donors, not taken on any new activities, with the exception of work on food security. Our planning figures have been adjusted to reflect this: &#163;6 million in each of 2000-01 and 2001-02. Actual expenditure will vary in line with Ethiopia's capacity to end the war and return to the reform agenda it has pursued so strongly in the past. Humanitarian assistance is not affected by this decision. It is provided in response to need and reflects the opportunity to reach those in need and to monitor interventions.

 The Lord Chancellor, as Head of the Judiciary, is responsible for dealing with all matters of judicial conduct.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w18.html_spnew9"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Procedures for investigating complaints about the personal conduct of Judges are well established. The Lord Chancellor will ask the Judge to comment on the complaint and will study those comments very carefully before sending a full reply. He may also obtain the tape recording or transcript of proceedings or seek the views of others who were present. The Lord Chancellor expects all Judges to uphold the standards of courtesy and consideration which generally exist in British public life. He therefore takes the handling of complaints very seriously.
<P>

<a name="00418w18.html_para5">Given the independence of the judiciary the Lord Chancellor cannot investigate complaints about judicial decisions. If a litigant is dissatisfied with the outcome of a hearing, the remedy is to take legal advice and appeal to a superior court if so advised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00418w19.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Docks provide security for those in the courtroom as well as adding a degree of formality to the hearing. They provide a practical system that has worked over the years. There are no plans to make any changes to the existing arrangements for adult cases. In the youth court a more informal style may be appropriate such as that in the Inner London Youth Courts where there is no dock. The defendant normally sits with his parent or youth justice worker and lawyer. All parties are at the same level. This can help communication and engage the defendant in the proceedings. That is why my Department and the Home Office have sponsored the youth demonstration projects in Leicestershire with Rutland and in Rotherham. They are independently evaluated programmes that investigate ways in which young offenders, and those responsible for them--parents and family--can be engaged more effectively in the court process. The programmes are also exploring the potential benefits of greater transparency in the youth justice process, physical and environmental changes, and more feedback to justices on the effect of their sentencing. The projects are being evaluated by Sheffield University, and the findings will be used to inform good practice advice for all youth courts later this year.

 Enforcement of the national minimum wage has been a success. Since the introduction of the national minimum wage on 1 April last year, minimum wage inspectors in Scotland have received 279 complaints and issued 12 enforcement notices. The Inland Revenue's national minimum wage inspectors have recovered some &#163;1.25 million of underpayments for low-paid workers across the UK. The message is getting across that inspectors will use their powers to pursue non-complying employers. However, I am pleased that the majority of employers have responded well to the introduction of the minimum wage which benefits some 100,000 workers in Scotland.
