<P>
<a name="10718w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Guidelines for those preparing bids for the European Capital of Culture 2008 were published in September last year, and I have no plans to review them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what will happen to moneys not used in the latest round of applications for sports and arts facilities in schools;  [2870]
<P>

<a name="10718w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As announced in March 2001, around 300 schools have been invited to develop detailed applications under the Space for Sport and Arts programme, which are due by the end of October. All 65 of the local education authorities (LEAs) participating in the programme have been given an indicative funding allocation for planning purposes with a ceiling on each project of &#163;0.5 million. LEAs are currently in the process of designing the spaces and applying for planning permission. Only once this has been done will it be possible to confirm the final allocations for each individual project. It is expected that the full &#163;130 million allocated to this programme will be spent on those projects identified by the LEAs involved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to review how the Arts Council ensures that Lottery funding is distributed to the regions of England on an equal basis.  [3203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government are keen to see a fair distribution of funding throughout the country and have directed distributors to ensure that all parts of the UK have access to Lottery funds. The Arts Council of England undertook substantial consultation last year when devising the Arts Capital Programme, the first tranche of prioritised projects being announced in June 2001. Geographical inequity was one of a number of considerations in the programme, together with investment in Black, Asian and Chinese Arts associations.

 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2001]:</i> The parts of Osborne House used formerly as the King Edward VII Convalescent Home for Officers which closed on 31 October 2000 will not be available for alternative use until repair and refurbishment of the exterior of the accommodation is completed. This is currently estimated to be in January 2002. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be considering how to meet from that date the obligations under the Osborne Estate Act 1902 to devote part of Osborne House for the benefit of members of the armed forces and the civil service until such time as the statutory requirement is repealed. English Heritage, which is responsible for the maintenance and management of the Osborne Estate, have sent my right hon.

 The broadcasting of party political broadcasts is ultimately the responsibility of the broadcasters and the broadcasting regulatory authorities. It is the broadcasters' responsibility to ensure that all the material they broadcast complies with their obligations to maintain programme standards, such as those relating to taste and decency. They may reject any material submitted, including party political broadcasts, unless or until it so complies.

 Information on incidences of contamination of transport flasks and railway wagons is published annually in the report on events involving the transport of radioactive material in the UK. The reports covering events in 1998 and 1999 have been placed in the House Library. The report for events during 2000 will be published in October this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many new housing developments in Chorley have been built on brownfield sites since 1997; and how many are planned in each of the next five years.  [4392]<P>

<P>
<a name="10718w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Detailed figures are not available centrally. Under Best Value, Chorley Borough Council is required to report on the percentage of new homes built on previously developed land. The Audit Commission is currently collecting data from all authorities and the Government expect to be able to publish estimated outturn for 2000&#150;2001 shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what steps he has taken to ensure disabled people can access Chorley railway station.  [4393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w02.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Access to railway stations for disabled people is covered by Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Since October 1999, service providers have been required to take reasonable steps to change practices, policies or procedures which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service. From 2004, service providers will have to take reasonable steps to remove, alter or provide reasonable means of avoiding physical features that make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service.
<P>

<a name="10718w02.html_para2">In addition, the Strategic Rail Authority is currently revising its Code of Practice, "Meeting the needs of Disabled Passengers", which is aimed at helping protect the interests of disabled users of railway passenger services and station services.
<P>

<a name="10718w02.html_para3">Railtrack are also committed to ensuring that disabled people have access to the railway network. I understand they are currently exploring a framework for achieving accessibility so that a detailed programme can be developed in consultation with train operators and other interested parties.

 There is no longer a separate ring- fenced element for private sector renewal within the support provided for local authorities' housing capital programmes; this was merged into the general support for housing investment from 2001&#150;02 to provide authorities with greater flexibility and reduce administrative burdens. The overall resources allocated to Hyndburn and Rossendale for housing investment in the last four years were as follows:

Tribunals (LVTs) have decided that the insurance available from an insurer was unsatisfactory or that the premiums payable were excessive.

<a name="10718w03.html_para0">The majority of applications made under these provisions were later withdrawn, were deemed to be outside the jurisdiction of the LVTs, or still await a decision. At the end of May 2001, only 10 cases had been determined. Of these, the insurance arrangements were deemed to be satisfactory in six cases. In the other four cases, the premiums were deemed to be excessive, or the arrangements unsatisfactory in other ways, or both.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment of the relative priority in respect of the London underground he has made of <i>(a)</i> refurbishing stations to incorporate shopping malls and <i>(b)</i> maintenance of rolling stock, track and signals; to what extent Transport for London's chosen priority in this regard will apply and how the infrastructure companies will influence such decisions; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="10718w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The plans for the modernisation of the underground will deliver around &#163;13 billion to improve the underground's infrastructure over the next 15 years. The relative priorities for rolling stock, track, signals and stations have been set by the public sector, not the infrastructure companies. The requirements have been designed to improve the capacity, reliability and quality of the underground as quickly and efficiently as possible, while maintaining high safety standards.
<P>

<a name="10718w03.html_para1">Within this balanced programme, expenditure on stations will account for less than a quarter of the total investment over the next 15 years. The priority at stations will not be to incorporate shopping malls, but to address those other issues passengers consider important: making sure the lifts and escalators work; installing CCTV to improve passenger security; tackling congestion at the busiest stations; providing step-free access; and improving the quality and cleanliness of stations.

<P>
<a name="10718w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Contracts for the modernisation of the tube have been developed by London Underground Limited. I understand that London Underground has set the priorities to ensure the private companies provide improved infrastructure so that London Underground can operate a safe and reliable service for passengers. Infrastructure companies will be rewarded for improving the capacity, reliability and quality of the underground infrastructure, and penalised for poor performance. Penalties in the contract will reflect the full impact of any delay or disruption to passengers and not be limited by a cap. I understand that London Underground intends to publish the contracts once negotiations have been completed and will make available information on performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how he expects new investment in the London Underground to be spent.  [4721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The plans for the modernisation of the tube provide a comprehensive package to renew the whole of the underground's infrastructure and are designed to ensure that the money is spent efficiently, with improvements specified by the public sector delivered on time and on budget. Around &#163;13 billion of investment will be made over the next 15 years, with some &#163;8.7 billion spent on enhancements and &#163;4.3 billion on maintenance&#151;a higher level of sustained investment than ever before.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jul 2001 : Column: 197W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10718w03.html_para2">As a result of this investment, services will be faster and more frequent with, for example, a 20 per cent. increase in capacity on the Victoria line. Fewer breakdowns and delays will result in a more reliable service. Every train on the underground will be replaced or refurbished over the lifetime of the contracts, and every station will be upgraded in the first seven and a half years.

 We have made clear that our plans for the London Underground will go ahead only if they represent value for money. We will make this judgment guided by the results of the robust public sector comparator that London Underground has constructed. This explicitly allows for the possibility of public sector bond financing, in line with the scheme suggested by Transport for London.
<P>

<a name="10718w03.html_para4">A note outlining the methodology used to develop the comparator was placed in the Libraries of the House in March 2000. The results of the comparator will also be published once negotiations with bidders have been completed. To release the comparator any earlier would risk undermining London Underground's negotiating position and jeopardise its ability to achieve value for money for the taxpayer.

 The Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) was a vast and complex undertaking, managed by London Transport/London Underground Limited. It was one of the largest engineering projects in this country for many years. This Government inherited a project already under way, and poorly planned. Various studies of the JLE have been carried out and others are still under way. The current forecast total cost is &#163;3.5 billion, including commissioning costs. Actual final cost will not be known until all contracts and claims are settled. When it was given the go-ahead, the JLE was expected to cost &#163;2.1 billion (at 1993 cash prices, excluding commissioning costs).
<P>

<a name="10718w03.html_para5">The causes of JLE cost overruns included the omission from the original figure of estimates for commissioning the line and turning it into a working railway; amendments to the programme and opening strategy

which had associated acceleration and prolongation costs; changes to specifications such as the addition of CCTV, not originally specified but later required in line with improvements elsewhere on the Tube; 'descoping' of systems such as signalling and communications; and other factors entirely outside the control of the project or its contractors, such as the new Austrian tunnelling method collapse on the Heathrow Express Project which caused all NATM JLE tunnelling to be suspended causing delays of around six months. Industrial action and vandalism contributed to increased costs.

 The Government ruled out privatisation of the Underground, but carefully considered all other options for modernising the Underground, including the use of bond financing, a public trust, joint ventures, vertically integrated business and the status quo. We firmly believe that our plans are the best way to achieve a 21st Century Tube, and to ensure safety and value for money. The Underground will remain publicly owned and run, and the massive programme of investment will be carried out in partnership with the private sector as quickly and efficiently as possible.

 The plans for the modernisation of the Underground will deliver around &#163;13 billion of investment to improve the underground's infrastructure over the next 15 years. It is estimated that some 20 per cent. of finance for these plans will be provided by the private sector, with the remainder coming from London Underground fares and Government grant.
<P>

<a name="10718w03.html_para10">The rate of the return for the private sector will be determined by the outcome of London Underground's negotiations with bidders. The agreed rate of return will be achieved only if the private companies meet their obligations to provide track, trains, signals and stations with increased capacity, better reliability and higher quality.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2001]:</i> Various (public and private) estimates have been made of the value of the land on the Greenwich peninsula which English Partnerships acquired from British Gas (Lattice Properties plc) in 1997, and consequently of the British Gas interest in such land. However, any valuations are confidential and it would be against the public interest to reveal these figures.

<a name="10718w04.html_para0">These national figures cannot meaningfully be broken down into the areas covered by each franchise because the services of many franchisees overlap. Individual speed restrictions will often affect the trains of several operators all using that line. Railtrack does however ensure close dialogue on outstanding speed restrictions with each operator in order to maintain safety and service reliability.
<P>

<a name="10718w04.html_para1">Railtrack is working with train operators and contractors to return to a sustainable level of speed restrictions across the network as soon as possible, but the precise number of restrictions which will be in place over the coming months cannot be accurately predicted.
<P>

<a name="10718w04.html_para2">At any one time there is always a large number, typically 300 to 500, of speed restrictions in force on the network; these are needed to maintain safe operation in adverse operating conditions and to enable normal maintenance activities to be completed. Allowances are made for such speed restrictions within timetables.

 When the Swanwick Centre enters operational service in January next year, the capacity of the unit will be constrained while ATC staff gain confidence and familiarity with the new equipment and procedures. As this confidence and competence improves, capacity will be slowly increased to match the capacity of the equivalent LATCC sectors.

 The overall performance of our PFI contracts is good. There have however been instances when it has been necessary to award penalty points for failure to achieve the required level of performance. The use of the penalty point system has been successful in improving poor performance as contractors have been anxious to avoid contractual warning letters and to face the risk of termination. The contracts are subject to confidentiality agreements and so the information cannot

 Outside London, the setting of bus fares is a matter for individual bus operators and they have a commercial incentive to keep fares at an affordable level, in order to attract passengers. In general, bus fares have tended to rise in line with the growth in average earnings. Local authorities have powers to arrange travel concessions for specified groups. But as part of our commitment to ensuring that elderly and disabled people have access to affordable transport, we have guaranteed them half fares on local bus services under the Transport Act 2000. The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill, which is currently being debated in the other place, will go further and equalise at 60 the age at which both men and women become entitled to concessionary travel.
<P>

<a name="10718w05.html_para0">Buses have a vital role to play in our transport system. We have brought forward a range of policies to make bus travel more reliable and attractive for the passenger, and are supporting this with substantially increased capital funding. We are confident that this will lead to increased patronage, which in turn should help to keep fares down.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w05.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 We are aware of and deplore this practice. Leaseholders do already have rights which allow them to address such abuses. They are able to purchase their landlord's interests under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, thereby removing his control over the insurance of the property. They can also apply to a leasehold valuation tribunal to challenge the landlord's choice of nominated insurer under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Measures to improve the operation of these rights form part of our work on leasehold reform and improving the tribunals. We are also looking separately at further ways in which this practice might be addressed.

<a name="10718w06.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Palmer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the latest figures are for deaths of Gulf veterans, and among the control group.  [5608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Peer reviewed scientific data comparing the mortality of UK Gulf veterans with an era group of service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf were published for the first time in <i>The Lancet</i> on 1 July 2000. Updates to these figures were provided by the Ministry of Defence to the House on 20 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 247&#150;49W, and 22 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 414&#150;16W. The MOD has undertaken to continue to monitor the mortality of both Gulf veterans and the era group and will publish updated figures on a regular basis. The figures as at 30 June 2001 are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="10718w06.html_para0">Overall, in the period 1 April 1991 to 30 June 2001 the mortality of UK Gulf veterans was no different from that of the control group. The number of Gulf veterans dying from disease related causes is rather less than the control group, whereas the number of Gulf veterans dying of external causes is rather higher than for the control group. The MOD will conduct a more detailed analysis of accidental deaths, to establish where there are any underlying trends that might help explain this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the use of animals in defence research.  [5609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w06.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (AWAC), chaired by Dr. Robert C. Hubrecht, has recently published its fifth annual report. The committee was set up in 1996 in response to public and parliamentary concern over the use of animals in defence research. Its purpose is to consult, inspect and make all necessary inquiries into all aspects of animal care and their use in establishments of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), part of the former Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).
<P>

<a name="10718w06.html_para1">The committee's report gives assurances that animals used in defence research programmes in the UK are regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and that no special exemptions apply to MOD. The committee's report emphasises the work that DERA have done to ensure the welfare of all animals used for defence research purposes. The committee was satisfied that all possible efforts were being made to ensure animal welfare and care.
<P>

<a name="10718w06.html_para2">Animal research is essential in order to protect our troops from hazards encountered during their duties. However, the Ministry of Defence continues to place emphasis on seeking alternatives to animal use. Although the numbers of animals used have reduced from past years, the technologies which will allow further reduction are still immature. The MOD welcomes the scrutiny by the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee in this area and will continue to support AWAC's review into the care and welfare arrangements for animals used in defence research.
<P>

<a name="10718w06.html_para3">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish his forthcoming study into the Government's subsidisation of the military export and defence sector; when this study is expected to be completed; and when Parliament will be able to review the findings of the study.  [4739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w06.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We expect the study into the costs and economic benefits of defence exports being undertaken by the Ministry of Defence's Senior Economic Adviser, with contributions from leading, independent, academic defence economists, to be completed shortly. It will be published and made available as soon as possible for review by the House of Commons Defence Committee, which originally proposed the study.
<P>

<a name="10718w06.html_para4">I do not expect the analysis to show that there is Government subsidisation of defence exports, but rather to reflect the fact that there is a significant net benefit to the Defence budget&#151;and thus the taxpayer&#151;from defence exports. These benefits include a reduction in costs for UK procurement as a result of export orders, receipts from Commercial Exploitation Levy and disposal of surplus MOD equipment. In addition to economic benefits, responsible and legitimate defence exports, together with our own defence efforts, contribute to international stability by strengthening collective defence relationships.

The Ministry of Defence, together with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, continues to consult closely with Allies on the implications of possible further enlargement for Euro-Atlantic security. We are assisting aspirants with their preparations through the Membership Action Plan, launched at the 1999 Washington Summit. We will continue to work with the Secretary General and Allies to ensure that the Alliance has the capabilities, force and command structures, planning and decision-making processes it needs to maintain its efficiency and effectiveness.

The second is a proposal to amend the Financial Market and Insolvency (Settlement Finality) Regulations 1999. The purpose of the amendment is to apply a common choice of law rule in respect of securities provided as collateral. We consider these measures will produce benefits in terms of simplicity, risk reduction and enhanced efficiency in financial markets.

 Discussions with the Police Federation of Northern Ireland on the application of the severance arrangements, retraining etc. are on-going. The next implementation step in the process of phasing out the Full Time Reserve will be notification of the non-renewal of contracts. Subsequent to the first recruits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland completing their training early in 2002, the prevailing security situation and policing requirements will be reviewed. Subject to that review, the notification of the non-renewal of contracts will begin.

 The Environment Agency issued guidelines on 26 March advising that no cattle over five years of age, which are at greater risk of BSE, should be buried. But before these guidelines took effect, it is estimated that up to 10,000 cattle aged over five years may have been buried. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), the Government's advisory body on BSE and CJD, has considered disposal issues arising from foot and mouth on a number of occasions, including at a special meeting on 24 May 2001. A news release summarising the outcome of that meeting states:

<a name="10718w09.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The sites where over five year cattle may have been buried would need to be examined on a case by case basis, and appropriate risk assessments carried out. It was likely that most body fluids would already have leaked out of the carcases which would no longer be intact. Digging up the remains would itself create significant risks&#151;for example of bringing deep soil to the surface&#151;that would need to be taken into account in any assessment. Overall, the number of BSE infected carcases across all sites&#151;let alone any particular site&#151;would be small. The risk from any individual site would, normally, be small and should be kept in perspective."

The Health Development Agency is currently examining what measures are most effective for improving men's health in different areas, and preventing men from becoming ill in the first place. The findings of this work will inform the decisions that we make on how best to achieve better health for men in the future.

 There are no figures available on the numbers of pregnant women who are asylum seekers and not receiving milk tokens. A major part of the cost of extending milk tokens to this group would be the administrative cost of devising and managing a system to do so, since none exists currently. We are currently reviewing separately the operation of both the asylum voucher scheme and the milk token scheme and will announce our conclusions in due course.

 To ensure there are sufficient staff to provide the treatment and care that patients need in a modern and improved national health service, funds have been made available to employ up to 20,000 more nurses, midwives and health visitors, 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals, 7,500 more consultants and 2,000 more general practitioners between now and 2004. To do this we are increasing the number of training places; improving retention of staff throughout the NHS; attracting former staff back to the NHS and international recruitment.
<P>

<a name="10718w11.html_para4">A national recruitment campaign was launched in February this year covering all staff groups in the NHS. Local initiatives continue to build successfully on the momentum of the national campaign and are again supported by NHS Careers.
<P>

<a name="10718w11.html_para5">In order to attract former staff back to the national health service, a package has been developed to encourage them to return. From 1 April 2001, healthcare professionals returning to the NHS will receive at least &#163;1,000 income to support them while they are retraining (&#163;1,500 for midwives). In addition we have also standardised the amount of child care assistance that can be offered to returners while they retrain. This means that a returner will now receive free refresher training; a minimum of &#163;1,000 financial support while retraining; assistance with child care support of up to &#163;135 per week for one child and &#163;200 for two or more children; and assistance with travel and books.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w12.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Evidence as to the effect of tobacco advertising on tobacco consumption was reviewed by the Department's Chief Economic Adviser in the Smee Report, published in 1992. The evidence has since been reviewed from time to time. The advice is that the likely eventual net effect of an advertising ban would be to decrease tobacco consumption, and the size of the decrease could lie in a range up to about 5 per cent. It is reasonable to use the mid-point of this range to indicate the likely effects of a ban.
<P>

<a name="10718w12.html_para1">Other recent work supports the view that comprehensive advertising bans are likely to reduce tobacco consumption. A report from the World Bank <sup>1</sup>  suggests that implementation of Directive 98/43/EC could have reduced cigarette consumption within the European Union by nearly 7 per cent.

<P>

<a name="10718w13.html_para8">It has been estimated that there are approximately 300,000 "front line" social care staff.

<a name="10718w14.html_para17">We fully accept that missed appointments can result in wasted resources and patients waiting longer than they need to. It is not possible to estimate the financial cost of this to the national health service because trusts usually have systems in place to minimise the impact of patients failing to turn up.
<P>

<a name="10718w14.html_para18">We do not plan to penalise patients who fail to attend. Instead we are introducing booking systems that give patients the opportunity to choose a date and time for their appointment that is convenient for them. By knowing their dates well in advance patients are able to make work, child care or any other arrangements in good time. These systems also make it easier for patients to change their appointments if they find they cannot make the date they originally agreed. Booking systems have been proved to reduce DNA rates significantly.
<P>

<a name="10718w14.html_para19">Under our NHS Plan two thirds of out-patient appointments with consultants and elective admissions to hospital will be pre-booked by March 2004 and all will be pre-booked by the end of 2005.

Where a parent's absence is not of a temporary nature and the student has remained in the UK throughout the period of the employment abroad, not wholly for the purpose of education, it may be possible for the student to establish ordinary residence in their own right. We urge LEAs to be as flexible as possible in their use of their discretion in interpreting the temporary absence provisions.

This exception does not include MOD employees or other staff who are abroad catering for or serving the armed forces (i.e. teachers at forces schools overseas or reservists), nor does it include Government employees working abroad as they are not under the same degree of compulsion to work abroad as a member of the armed forces.

 Since September 1998 all four-year-olds have been able to access a free, part-time nursery education place. This Government are committed to providing all three-year-olds with a free place by September 2004. We are currently on target to provide 66 per cent. of all three-year-olds with a part-time place by March 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships have only provided details of the new child care places that have opened by constituency since April 1999. Between April 1999 and March 2001 Lancashire Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership has reported the creation of 322 new out of school hours places <sup>1</sup>  in Chorley.
<P>

<a name="10718w16.html_para0">We are not able to identify the exact amount of funding made available to support these out of school places. Since April 1999 the New Opportunities Fund has made four awards totalling over &#163;947,000 in response to applications for funding from the Chorley area for out of school child care projects. However, two of these were consortium bids covering the whole of Lancashire. In addition since April 1999, Lancashire Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership has spent around &#163;404,000 of Childcare Grant to fund new out of school hours childcare places across the county.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has for ensuring that the skill-mix of school governing bodies is sufficient for the proper discharge of their responsibilities.  [4428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Code of Practice on Local Education Authority-School Relations advises local education authorities to appoint as governors those who are best qualified to help schools improve and to have regard to the skills and experience of which particular schools have the greatest need. The Department's advice to governing bodies is to consider, when co-opting governors, what skills are needed to enable the full discharge of their responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="10718w17.html_para0">The Department will make available to governor trainers in local education authorities from September 2001 a package for governors to help ensure that they have the information to develop the skills to do the job.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has for improving the recruitment of school governors.  [4427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills is funding the School Governors' One-Stop Shop (SGOSS) to recruit people with business and management skills to become school governors in areas covered by all phases of the Government's Excellence in Cities programme. SGOSS is a private company limited by guarantee and registered as a charity. Since its inception in January 2000, SGOSS has found 1,098 candidates of whom 291 are serving governors and 181 are matched with schools and awaiting final placement.
<P>

<a name="10718w17.html_para1">The Department's strategy for supporting the recruitment of governors by schools and LEAs also includes the production of publicity materials. A national school governor advertising campaign took place last autumn and funding is available for a campaign extension to support the election and appointment of governors at the beginning of the autumn term this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the level of Government funding awarded per sixth form student in <i>(a)</i> a sixth form further education college and <i>(b)</i> a sixth form situated in a secondary school in the 2000&#150;01 academic year.  [4463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 In the 2000&#150;01 financial year the range of funding delegated to schools across LEAs for their school sixth form pupils was &#163;2,600 to &#163;4,100. Funding for each further education college depends on the size of each individual student's programme of study, but the average for all full-time equivalent students in 2000&#150;01 was some &#163;3,300. Figures for funding comparisons on an academic year basis are not currently available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to enable schools in Bedfordshire to fund more programmes to tackle drug abuse.  [4711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Funding to support drug, alcohol and tobacco education will rise from &#163;14.5 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;15.5 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;17.5 million in 2003&#150;04. This funding will improve the quality and coverage of drug education programmes in schools, provide funding for every school to have access to an LEA drug adviser and will fund drug education training for teachers and Connexions advisers. Bedfordshire LEA will receive &#163;98,600 in 2001&#150;02 as part of this funding. No specific figures are available beyond 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="10718w17.html_para2">In addition to this specific funding, schools will receive &#163;15 million in 2001&#150;02 to support Personal Social and Health Education and Citizenship, which they can choose to spend on programmes to tackle drug misuse if they wish. Bedfordshire LEA have been allocated &#163;87,300 from this fund.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2001]:</i> A wide range of organisations disseminate resources and information which can be used to support the delivery of the school curriculum. The Department for Education and Skills does not approve or quality assure such resources for use in schools in England. Teachers use their professional judgment to decide which resources will best meet the educational needs of their pupils.

 The Financial Memorandum between the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and each institution it funds requires institutions to have sound systems of internal control and to demonstrate they are securing good value for money. The HEFCE Audit Code of Practice states that these systems should be audited by the institution's internal and external auditors, and that the institution's audit committee should report annually on their effectiveness. In addition, the HEFCE Audit Service reviews high-level

 It is for the independent awarding bodies to determine their own procedures with regard to notifying examination centres about examination fees.

Awarding bodies also post details of fees on their websites.

 Funding for post-16 transport is distributed via local education authorities as part of the Education Standard Spending Assessment (SSA). LEAs will continue to receive recognition in SSAs for this after the responsibility for funding post 16-school provision passes to the Learning and Skills Council in 2002&#150;03. LEAs also receive School Access Funds to help students meet the costs of their learning, including travel. Education Maintenance Allowances, which are means tested payments to the student, are being piloted in 56 LEAs and this money is frequently used to cover transport costs. Five of the pilots are specifically designed to address transport costs.

<a name="10718w18.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) how many low income families have so far obtained access to computers under the Computers Within Reach initiative launched in December 1999; and at what cost to public funds;  [4759]
<P>
<UL><P>
(2) if she will make a statement on the progress of the scheme announced on 28 October 1999 to extend access to computers to low income families within three years and the date by which she expects the 100,000 families to gain access to a computer;  [4760]
<P>
(3) how many people have so far applied for computers under the Computers Within Reach initiative; and what the average length of time between application and delivery is.  [4766]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w18.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The first phase of the Computers Within Reach scheme became operational with the launch of a number of locally based pilots in England in October 2000. The proposed subsidy for the scheme was that&#151;in addition to the &#163;60 paid by the customer&#151;the contractor would receive funding of &#163;150 per computer and printer package delivered&#151;with extra subsidy available if the customer was disabled. We have made a number of changes to the proposed approach in terms of enhanced software and specification and purchased a suite of office applications software to be used on each PC and in certain circumstances increased the funding available to contractors in respect of increases in the specification of the computers supplied.
<P>

<a name="10718w18.html_para1">Phase 1 of the scheme will be closed by the end of August 2001 and 24,051 PCs will have been delivered by this time. This will ensure that everyone on the waiting list will have received a computer. We do not hold data on the average length of time between application and delivery of computers but became aware of issues which were causing delays. These problems have now been resolved and all outstanding applicants will receive a computer before the end of phase 1.
<P>

<a name="10718w18.html_para2">The scheme is subject to an external research evaluation contract and we will be using this and our internal evaluation to learn the lessons from the first phase. We are currently considering how to take the scheme forward.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w18.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many computers have been installed in homes and schools under the Wired up Communities initiative; and how many will be installed by 31 December.  [4762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w18.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 So far under the Wired up Communities initiative, 1,840 recycled computers have been installed into homes in the phase one project in Kensington, Liverpool. No computers have yet been installed in schools. There is no target for installation of computers by 31 December 2001.
<P>

<a name="10718w18.html_para3">However, by 31 March 2002, the seven Wired up Communities projects aim to connect 14,000 homes to the Internet using a variety of devices, including new and recycled computers and television set-top boxes.
<P>

<a name="10718w18.html_para4">Also, through the national e-Learning Foundation, 33 schools in the Wired up Communities areas will be wired up using technology such as electronic whiteboards and laptops. Some 12,000 schoolchildren will benefit from this new technology.

 A revised Draft Code of Practice will be placed before Parliament for approval following the summer recess. The revised Code will contain revised wording on quantifying provision in statements of special educational needs. The Code is planned to take effect from January 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Following an extensive procurement exercise conducted under the European Union Procurement Directive's Negotiated Procedure, the Government have selected Capita as their private sector partner to develop and deliver the Connexions Card.
<P>

<a name="10718w19.html_para0">The Connexions Card is an exciting and innovative development, which will provide a powerful incentive to young people to stay in learning.
<P>

<a name="10718w19.html_para1">The Connexions Card will be rolled out initially in one region (the North East) from autumn of this year and then progressively so that it will be available across England from autumn 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what criteria he uses in balancing trade relations with the human rights records of trading partners; and if he will make a statement.  [2102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w19.html_spnew2"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The Government are committed to developing and maintaining open relationships with trading partners across the world, in order both to support British business and to promote human rights internationally. We continue to believe that human rights in countries with which we trade are better protected by a UK and EU-wide policy of engagement in all but the most extreme circumstances. Maintaining trade agreements, and a full political dialogue, preserves UK leverage in such countries.
<P>

<a name="10718w19.html_para2">The Government raise the profile of human rights in relation to trade in a number of ways. Examples include the introduction of the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) Business Principles under which ECGD now screens applications for support to assess the environmental and social impact of projects and, more generally, the promotion of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to UK companies operating overseas.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jul 2001 : Column: 257W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10718w19.html_para3">Our advice to UK business on market conditions overseas also reflects the Government's position on human rights, for example on the desirability of trade with certain countries. It is however for UK companies to judge whether to bid for projects or invest in particular markets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The discussion was wide-ranging. It included the current situation in Zimbabwe, international support for free and fair elections, progress of the EU/Zimbabwe dialogue and sustainable land reform.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10718w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As I stated during FCO questions on 10 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 657, the ministerial statement should be viewed in the context of the OAU's desire to maintain unity. In order to attract international donor support, including from the UK, land reform in Zimbabwe must be carried out in line with the principles agreed, by donors and the Government of Zimbabwe, at the 1998 Land Conference.

We are deeply concerned about the misuse of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan and about the thousands of Pakistani citizens imprisoned under these laws, including many from the religious minorities.

Representations were made to the Pakistani authorities concerning the allegations of violence against and kidnapping of Naira Nadia, a Christian girl. We regularly raise the treatment of religious minorities and the treatment of women with the Pakistani authorities.

 We are, of course, interested in the human rights of all in Egypt regardless of their religious background.

While some Copts talk of persecution, others tell us there is no Government policy of discrimination against Christians, nor do they talk of persecution. Our embassy in Cairo assesses that there is no general policy of discrimination against Christians, a view shared by many leading Copts. We do, however, raise individual cases of concern.

<a name="10718w21.html_para12">The DTI published, in Energy Paper 68 (EP68), energy demand projections for the period 2000 to 2020 in November 2000. The projections cover the whole of the UK and no assessment was made of energy demand or supply prospects by region. Projections of the amount of electricity generated by the various types of plant are shown in Annexe D of Energy Paper 68. Annual projections of energy demand and supply are not available. In terms of the major producers of power, in the year 2005 nuclear is projected to account for around 24 per cent., renewables around 6 per cent. and other fossil sources around 67 per cent. of electricity supply. The remaining supply is in the form of pumped storage output or imports of electricity through the electricity link with France.

 Under the Confiscated Assets Fund (CAF), which the Government established on a non-statutory basis in April 1999, a proportion of receipts from confiscation orders made against persons convicted of drug trafficking is recycled into projects in support of the Anti-Drugs Strategy. Projects funded by the CAF cover all four strands of the strategy including law enforcement projects.
<P>

<a name="10718w25.html_para0">The Government intend to replace the CAF with a new Recovered Assets Fund. This is to be financed by up to 50 per cent. of all confiscation, cash forfeiture and (assuming enactment of the Proceeds of Crime Bill) civil recovery receipts. Both drug trafficking and non-drug trafficking receipts will be included. The fund, which will again operate on a non-statutory basis, will be used primarily to support the Anti-Drugs and Asset Recovery Strategies. It will also provide additional funding for community regeneration and local crime reduction projects.

<a name="10718w25.html_para1">The problem of crime affecting small retailers, particularly in deprived areas, is one which was highlighted in the report of the Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team 13, which considered access to decent shopping facilities. The Retail Crime Reduction Action Team has also been examining this issue in conjunction with organisations which represent small retailers, with a view to developing schemes which may be able to assist those businesses.
<P>

<a name="10718w25.html_para2">We are providing funding of &#163;15 million over three years for a project to improve security of small retailers in the most deprived areas throughout England and Wales, with &#163;3 million to be spent this financial year and &#163;6 million for each of the years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. We will be working with local communities to identify specific sites which can most benefit from the scheme. This may include shopping parades, individual shops or a combination of both. The money will be used to help small retailers to enhance security of their premises by installing additional locks or shutters, or may be used to make improvements to their immediate environments. We aim to maximise the value and effectiveness of these schemes by ensuring, wherever possible, that they complement other existing schemes designed to improve the quality of life of a neighbourhood.

The table records the number of officers who are predominately assigned to foot, car and beat patrol duties for each year from 1995&#150;96 to 1999&#150;2000.

<P>
<a name="10718w27.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I am not aware of any report from the Board of Visitors at Norwich prison to the Prison Reform Trust. Norwich prison was not named as causing particular concern in the Prison Reform Trust's recent press release on overcrowding. The Board of Visitors at Norwich did however refer to the issue of overcrowding in their annual report to the Secretary of State for the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="10718w27.html_para0">The Certified Normal Accommodation (that is, the uncrowded capacity) of Norwich prison is 561 and the operational (that is, maximum) capacity 794. The operational capacity was increased by 50 places in October 2000, for which the prison received additional funding of &#163;397,000. The average population during 2000 was 631, a reduction from 1999 (681). On average 35 per cent. of the population at Norwich prison share a cell, which is less than the establishment's target of 45 per cent.

<a name="10718w29.html_para0">The Environment Agency has a legal duty to inspect all licensed sites and section 42 of the 1990 Act requires the Agency to take the steps needed to ensure that (a) the activities authorised by a licence do not cause environmental pollution, harm to human health or serious detriment to local amenities; and (b) the conditions of a licence are complied with. It is the responsibility of the Environment Agency to assess whether any steps are needed to ensure compliance with these provisions.
<P>

<a name="10718w29.html_para1">The Environment Agency may suspend or revoke a licence in the circumstances set out in section 38 of the 1990 Act. I understand that, on the basis of the evidence currently available to it, the Agency has no plans to serve a notice of suspension or revocation in relation to the licence for the Crich site.
<P>

<a name="10718w29.html_para2">However, I understand that the Environment Agency has initiated a review of the licence for the Crich site under regulation 15 of the 1994 Regulations. The aim of this review is to assess the impact, if any, of the disposal of waste on groundwater and to ensure its protection by the use, so far as may be necessary, of the Agency's powers under sections 37 and 38 of the 1990 Act (variation, suspension or revocation of licences). I am also advised that the current licence conditions for the Crich site require the licence holder to provide and maintain sites gates and boundary fencing in a manner which prohibits unauthorised access; and that the gates must be securely locked when the site is unmanned.

<P>
<a name="10718w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> The Environment Agency and its predecessor bodies has carried out assessments of the impact of emissions from the landfill site at Hilts Quarry, Crich, since the first authorisation was granted to Rolls Royce to dispose of very low level radioactive waste there in the 1960s. In the context of applications that Rolls Royce Marine Power Operations Ltd. made last year for the disposal of limited quantities of very low level radioactive waste, the Environment Agency is examining the continued suitability of the Crich site for this purpose. The Agency's assessment will include impacts in the vicinity of the site.

<a name="10718w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 16 July 2001]:</i> Under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 (HECA), energy conservation authorities are obliged to prepare a report identifying practicable and cost effective measures to improve significantly the energy efficiency of all residential accommodation in their area and to report on progress made in implementing those measures. There is no statutory target, but "significant" has been defined as 30 per cent. and strategies are expected to make at least substantial progress towards 30 per cent. improvement over 10 years.
<P>

<a name="10718w29.html_para3">Details of the reported percentage improvements in the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 2000 have been placed in the Libraries of the House in my reply to my reply to my hon.

<P>

<a name="10718w29.html_para4">The Government assist local authorities with their work on energy efficiency by providing financial support for the Energy Saving Trust's local authority programme. Over the last six years, the HECAction initiative has awarded grants to 339 local authorities, totalling &#163;23 million.

<a name="10718w29.html_para5">I recently announced a review of the policy framework within which local authorities carry out their energy efficiency activities, to be completed by the end of the year.

 My Department has had intensive discussions with a wide range of industry interests and the European Commission about this, with a view to putting a strategy in place by the end of July, to apply from 1 September onwards.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) report was published today in respect of the London borough of Brent and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10718w30.html_para6">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10718w30.html_para7">The report notes that the authority was experiencing serious problems in delivering its benefit service at the time of the inspection. Inspectors found long delays and large backlogs of work in most areas. This had led to poor customer service and some significant security weaknesses, such as in verification. Although the report acknowledges that the inspection took place just after implementing new benefit processing software, inspectors consider that considerable improvements must be made to deliver adequate levels of service and security.
<P>

<a name="10718w30.html_para8">The report notes the positive work done by the council to counter fraud effectively, such as its detailed investigation of prosecution cases. However, BFI inspectors were disappointed that it is not supported by more rigorous recovery of overpayments.
<P>

<a name="10718w30.html_para9">BFI inspectors consider that achieving lasting improvements will not be an easy task for the council. The report notes the council has tried to use its contractual arrangements to bring about improvements in the service. The report also notes the council told BFI that it believes it is complying with 76 of a total 102 recommendations and has plans to address most of the others. Inspectors consider this demonstrates a good commitment to improve.

<P>
<a name="10718w31.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 From 3 April 2000 the Home Office is responsible for supporting and accommodating asylum seekers awaiting a determination of their case. Those asylum seekers in receipt of benefits prior to 3 April 2000 continue to be eligible to claim Income Support. Payment for any dependent children is at normal rates. Asylum seekers whose applications are accepted and who are awarded either refugee status or exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom are eligible for social security benefits in the usual way.
<P>

<a name="10718w31.html_para2">The levels of Income Support personal allowances for younger people take account of the fact that the majority of this group live in someone else's household and can reasonably be assumed to have fewer financial responsibilities than people who are older and who are more likely to live independently. However, those 16 and 17-year-olds who are forced to claim independently can receive Income Support at higher rates.
<P>

<a name="10718w31.html_para3">There is no provision for payment of Income Support to children aged under 16 in their own right. A dependant's allowance may be payable to people claiming benefit who have a dependent child or children living with them as part of their family.
