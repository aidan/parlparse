<a name="01025w01.html_para0">In addition, some half a million pensioners in Great Britain are missing out on their entitlement. We cannot routinely disaggregate take-up statistics for the income- related benefits. Inspection of the available data suggests that take-up of Minimum Income Guarantee in Devon is likely to be broadly the same as take-up for Great Britain as a whole.

<P>
<a name="01025w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Heppell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will publish the outcome of the Government's consultation on its proposals for managing dangerous people with severe personality disorders; and what progress has been made on them.  [135201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01025w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend, to the reply I gave him on 28 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1167-68W.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para1">The Government's proposals for those who are Dangerous and Severely Personality Disordered (D and SPD) address a longstanding challenge to public safety by ensuring that effective powers of detention and high quality services are available to deal with this group. The consultation period for these proposals ended on 31 December 1999. A summary of the analysis of the consultation will today be placed in the Library together with copies of individual responses, where permission to publish was not withheld.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para2">Of those expressing a preference, the majority of respondents to the consultation exercise preferred option B as the more effective way of providing high quality services for this group. The Home Affairs Committee in its report published on 14 March strongly supported option B. The Government attach great weight to these views. However, the Government have decided that before taking final decisions on how best to provide services for this group in the long term, they need to pilot and to evaluate the assessment process and the various treatments available for this group within existing service structures. This period of piloting and evaluation will however take place at the same time as the expansion of dedicated specialist facilities within both the Prison Service and the National Health Service (NHS) and the introduction, as soon as parliamentary time permits, of new powers of detention for the assessment and treatment of this group.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para3">Following the recent Spending Review, I announced during the summer the allocation of substantial resources to pilot and develop new services for those who are D and SPD. This will mean 320 new specialist secure places across the Prison Service and the NHS by the end of the Spending Review period. The first pilot project at Her Majesty's Prison Whitemoor in the Prison Service has already begun and the first NHS pilot at Rampton Hospital will commence in November.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para4">At the same time, we are pressing ahead with the preparations for those legislative changes which will be required under either option. For example, arrangements 



<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 2000 : Column: 127W</I><P>
for the assessment process and detention, and for safeguards and review, will apply whether those detained are held in existing services or in a new third service.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para5">Following the recent review of the Mental Health Act 1983, the Government believe that these changes can be made as part of wider changes to that Act. The effective implementation of new arrangements will require the provision of new, high quality, specialist services for this group which will be part of the process of service development and piloting. Access to these services will be managed through a plan of care and treatment appropriate to the individual. Subject to the results of the pilot projects, these powers would be available for this group as soon as they have been implemented. As my earlier reply indicated, these proposals will be published in detail in a White Paper before Christmas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01025w01.html_spnew5"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 I met with Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the International Olympic Committee while at the Olympic Games and Bob Steadwood, President of the International Paralympic Committee while at the Paralympic Games.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out the principal results of his visit to China.  [134309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01025w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I visited China from 12 to 18 October at the invitation of Vice Premier Wu Bangguo. My purpose was to enhance bilateral relations and promote UK business interests in China.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para6">I visited Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Guilin, and Chongqing. In Beijing I had meetings with Vice President Hu Jintao, Vice Premiers Wu Bangguo and Wen Jiabao, other Government Ministers and the Mayor of Beijing. I also opened the Second Session of the UK China Forum with Vice Premier Wu Bangguo.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para7">In Shenzhen I attended with Vice Premier Wu Bangguo the opening of the China High-Tech Fair, at which there was a strong British presence. In Shenzhen and the other cities I visited I held meetings with senior provincial and city politicians.
<P>

<a name="01025w01.html_para8">My discussions with Chinese political leaders covered bilateral relations, commercial matters, international issues, the environment, and human rights. I was received with great warmth throughout my visit and was left in no doubt as to the strength of UK/China political relations. I was particularly impressed by the effort that China is making to ensure that she develops in a sustainable way as she modernises for the 21st century, and the opportunities which exist for British companies to work with her in that modernisation.

<P>
<a name="01025w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Anthony D. Wright: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps are being taken to prepare for future petroleum licensing rounds on the UK continental shelf.  [135200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01025w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have today initiated a three month public consultation which will look at the potential environmental impact of oil and gas activity in the area between the Shetland and Faroe Islands known as the 'White Zone'.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para0">A formal invitation will shortly be made to oil companies to bid for licences in this area. But before any licences are awarded, I want to hear the views of the public and experts on the environmental impact that these activities might have. Depending on the outcome of this consultation, we may impose conditions on the licences or withhold areas on offer.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para1">For the first time, the Department has commissioned and published an independent strategic environmental assessment of the White Zone, the surrounding area and the possible oil and gas impacts on it. This report will be made available to interested parties and should help promote informed responses to the consultation.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para2">The consultation also asks for views on draft regulations applying the EU's Habitats Directive, which requires the protection of certain species and habitats, to offshore oil and gas activities. Under the regulations, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State must consider the requirements of the Directive when taking decisions relating to those activities.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para3">Today's proposals mark a further major improvement to the transparency of our environmental and licensing regimes. They demonstrate the importance Government and industry continue to place on protecting marine habitats and species.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para4">However, it is also important to provide further opportunities for petroleum exploration on the UK Continental Shelf. The proposed changes will provide a stronger legal and environmental framework for future offshore licensing rounds.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para5">The 19th licensing round applications, which should be received early next year, will be the first to be considered under this new approach.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para6">Maintaining oil and gas discoveries over the coming years is vital if we are to sustain an important industry and benefit the UK economy.

<P>
<a name="01025w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 12 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 509-10W, what changes there have been to the location and structures of the Reserve Forces and Cadets Association since that answer.  [134501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01025w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Following the laying of the Defence Council's Reserve Forces Act 1996 (Reserve Associations) Order 2000, the Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations (RFCA) for the South East and Eastern Wessex administrative areas, minus Dorset, have been amalgamated to reflect the South East Government Office and Channel Islands administrative jurisdictions. It will be known as the South East RFCA, with a headquarters at Seely House, Shoe Lane, Aldershot GU11 2HJ. The responsibility for carrying out the Eastern Wessex Association's functions for Dorset moves to the Wessex RFCA, whose administrative area will now reflect that of the South West Government Office region. The Wessex RFCA headquarters remains at 2 Beaufort Road, Clifton, Bristol BS8 2JS.
<P>

<a name="01025w02.html_para7">These arrangements took effect from 1 October 2000. They are reflected in minor amendments to the RFCA Regulations, details of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. We have also agreed with the RFCAs revised or amended Schemes of Association. Following consultation with their Trade Union representatives, arrangements for those Association employees opting for redundancy have been agreed. These are broadly in line with civil service arrangements. This completes the implementation of the organisational improvements and efficiencies sought in the Strategic Defence Review.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence concerning Soothsayer.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked when the Management Information System (MIS) for Soothsayer would be completed. Lockheed Martin System Integration and Thomson Racal Defence are undertaking studies that will help establish proposed schedules and the cost to completion, of the electronic warfare MIS included in Soothsayer as part of the ongoing Assessment Phase. A Soothsayer capability will be delivered into service in 2006. However, to keep pace with changing operational needs a programme of continuous evolution of the MIS software is planned beyond initial delivery. Initial project costings established during the Concept Studies prior to Initial Gate will be validated by the Assessment Phase studies to support the forthcoming Main Gate approval, but the total costs for Soothsayer procurement and initial support are estimated at this stage to be in the order of &#163;170M at 1999/00 economic conditions. It will be for the contractors to cost MIS elements as part of their overall bids for the demonstration and production phase contracts at Main Gate. The expected costs of the programme will be firmed up at that point.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked about the cost efficiency of the system. In accordance with Smart Acquisition guidelines the expected cost effectiveness of the Soothsayer electronic warfare system was assessed as part of the Initial Gate business case approved in Aug 00. This report also assessed the cost effectiveness of standalone systems currently deployed in the British Army and Royal Marines. As part of the Assessment Phase the cost effectiveness of Soothsayer and its alternatives will be continually monitored to inform the Main Gate submission.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Bids for the Soothsayer electronic warfare programme Assessment Phase were received from Lockheed Martin Systems Integration (Owego, NY,USA), Thomson Racal Defence (Bracknell, UK) and Raytheon Systems (Falls Church, Virginia, USA). Raytheon were teamed with BAe Defence Systems, (Christchurch, UK) and Alenia Marconi Systems, (Frimley, UK).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked for the timetable for assessment. In line with Smart Acquisition practice the requirements for the Soothsayer integrated electronic warfare system will be assessed in conjunction with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration and Thomson Racal Defence during the ongoing Assessment Phase (August 00 to August 02) leading to a Main Gate decision in 2002.</FONT></UL>

 The cannon was originally included in the European Staff Requirement for Eurofighter as a close range air-to-air weapon. The improved minimum range capability of Eurofighter's Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile over previous such missiles, together with the pattern of operations over the last decade, mean that the gun now has only a minimal operational utility, and this is outweighed by its support, fatigue and training cost implications.

<a name="01025w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Further to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's answer of 17 July, offensive air support is a term used to describe air action against hostile land targets which are either in close proximity to, or in a position directly to affect, friendly forces. The original European Staff Requirement for Eurofighter does not identify the cannon as an asset in that role.

 Investment in education for girls has been shown consistently to be one of the most important determinants of development, with positive implications for all other measures of progress.

Both have potentially devastating effects on the lives and livelihoods of people living downstream. We look forward to the launch of the report of the World Commission on Dams, in London next month, for which we have contributed financial support. This will provide guidance on balancing the positive developmental benefits of dams, against the detrimental social and environmental impacts.

 The UK's policy of 100 per cent. debt forgiveness starts at decision point. The exact amount of debt forgiven unilaterally in addition to the reduction as part of the HIPC initiative depends on the exact settlement reached multilaterally when a country's debts are reduced to a sustainable level. At the start of this month, 10 countries had reached decision point and will see &#163;245 million written off. Twenty countries are scheduled to reach decision point by the end of the year and will receive &#163;610 million debt relief under the UK's policy. The first 10 countries to reach decision point will receive $21 billion in total debt relief, $16 billion in debt relief under the HIPC initiative and $5 billion from traditional debt relief measures.

However, we understand that only four such trials have been undertaken this year, and that these have been small in scale. Three were co-located with other publicised trials, and all were conducted under the same guidelines for GM cropping as in the FSE trials, including the application of separation distances between the GM plants and equivalent non-GM plants.

<P>
<a name="01025w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The creation of the new CAP Payments Agency (CAPPA) will transform the way in which farmers claim their CAP payments. I recognise that some farmers are concerned about the changes and the CAPPA business case makes the prudent assumption that only around 20 per cent. of farmers will be using electronic forms by 2004. I believe that this is achievable, and that many farmers will recognise the benefits of electronic form submission and will be keen to use them.
<P>

<a name="01025w05.html_para8">Encouraging farmers to submit their claims electronically is clearly important to the success of CAPPA. We will work very closely with them to help them reap the benefits which electronic service delivery offers. As a first step, the consultation exercise "Modernising Key Services" sought views on the best way of ensuring a smooth transition to the new arrangements, and we are currently analysing the response.

<P>

<a name="01025w05.html_para9">A detailed analysis of financial issues did not produce clear conclusions on which sites should be selected: in most cases, the choice of one site over another had a very limited impact on the overall funding for the programme.

<P>

<a name="01025w05.html_para14">At the same time as announcing these changes, I also announced my plans to strengthen MAFF's regional strategic and policy activities through greater integration with the Government Office for the Regions and the establishment of a largely regionally based service organisation for the delivery of rural development policies and programmes. MAFF will retain a presence in Worcester, Cambridge, Bristol, Nottingham and Crewe to handle work on the England Rural Development Programme, as well as maintaining its presence in the GO Regions which have CAPPA sites. I am convinced that strengthening MAFF's regional presence in this way will benefit agriculture and the wider rural economy.

<a name="01025w07.html_para0">The UN has said that both parties to the dispute, Morocco and the Polisario Front, have been responsible for delays in implementing the UN Settlement Plan, and principally over who should be allowed to vote in a referendum on the future of the territory. The UN has concluded that these differences could prevent a referendum being held before 2002 or even beyond. There has only been limited progress on other key aspects to the plan, such as prisoners of war and refugee repatriation.
<P>

<a name="01025w07.html_para1">The Settlement Plan also lacks an enforcement mechanism. The UN Secretary-General has said that he does not expect one will be forthcoming. With this in mind, we believe that the Secretary-General was right to ask his Personal Envoy--James Baker--to explore the possibility of finding a mutually acceptable way forward, Mr. Baker has a broad mandate from the Security Council to look at all options. He has our full support. We provided him with two venues in London earlier this year to conduct high-level talks between the parties. We urge all sides to co-operate fully with his mission.

<P>
<a name="01025w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The fall of the Milosevic regime has given considerable reason for optimism about the political future and prospects for peace and security in the Balkans. Preparations for municipal elections in Kosovo on 28 October are on track, following which municipal assemblies will be established. The security situation has significantly improved although ethnic violence remains a serious problem. President Kostunica has already begun a dialogue aimed at improving relations between Serbia and Montenegro. There was also widespread electoral support on 24 September for the new democratic forces in both Vojvodina and the Sandjak area of Serbia.

 The political and security situation in Mitrovica remains tense. UNMIK and KFOR are taking steps to improve public order and to counter extremist activities. UNMIK is also trying to improve the quality of life for Serbs in northern Mitrovica. Our longer term aim is to promote ethnic reconciliation between the two communities. We hope the recent changes in Belgrade will improve the situation in Mitrovica, which has suffered in the past from interference by the Milosevic regime.

 Within Kosovo the UN/OSCE Joint Registration Task Force had registered approximately 1 million people before the official close of Registrations on 19 July 2000. To encourage registration the OSCE Mission in Kosovo mounted extensive public information campaigns and regular meetings with representatives of all ethnic groups. Out-of-Kosovo registration was contracted out to the Institute of Migration who have registered just under 40,000 people. Unfortunately as a result of Milosevic's deliberate policy of non-co-operation with the International Community those displaced persons resident in Serbia were not able to register.

 UNMIK, the EU, the International Committee for the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights worked hard on this issue while Milosevic was in power.
