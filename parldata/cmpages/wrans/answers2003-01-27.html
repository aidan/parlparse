<a name="30127w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Coinciding with the creation of the Department for Transport in May 2002, a new policy was introduced dealing with the use/misuse of the Department's ICT resources. This policy was brought to the attention of staff in a departmental Bulletin and is contained within the departmental Staff Handbook.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2003 : Column 521W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30127w01.html_para2">No cases of misuse have been raised since the introduction of the new policy. Similarly, there are no identifiable cases relating to the Department for Transport in the previous four years.

<P>
<a name="30127w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Exemptions from the central London congestion charge are primarily a matter for the Mayor.

<a name="30127w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Each European member state is required by law to ensure that vehicles bearing its registration are covered by motor insurance. Routine checks on foreign vehicles at ports would be illegal.

 Trials and operational use of radar satellites in a number of countries, including the UK, have proved that this technology can be used to detect oil spills.

 DVLA co-operates closely with the police and other enforcement agencies in attending joint roadside checks to target untaxed and unroadworthy vehicles.
<P>

<a name="30127w03.html_para0">The Agency took part in 656 roadside checks in 2000&#150;01, and 1,102 in 2001&#150;02. The keepers of all unlicensed vehicles detected by these checks were pursued for using an unlicensed vehicle on the road. So far in 2002&#150;03 the Agency has taken part in 842 checks, 79 of which were held in conjunction with vehicle excise duty campaigns involving the Agency's wheelclamping teams and the Stingray camera units. Any unlicensed vehicles detected in these checks were also clamped as well as being pursued for having no tax disc.

In order to secure these improvements at the earliest opportunity, by incorporating the changes in the May 2003 timetable, the Authority had limited time for consultation. The Authority consulted Department for Transport officials and Ministers about the implementation of the timetable changes announced last week, and informed other parties including the relevant Rail Passengers Committees in relation to Virgin Cross Country services.

<P>

: I am satisfied that the Highways Agency's decision not to extend the existing 30 mph speed limit on the A49 to include the Condover turning is correct. On the basis of the criteria that we use to decide appropriate speed limits, an extension would be very difficult to justify. In addition, West Mercia Police have confirmed that they would not support an extension in this case.
<P>

<a name="30127w03.html_para4">The Route Management Strategy for the A49 between Ross-on-Wye and Shrewsbury is looking at all existing speed limits along the route in the light of the criteria to ensure consistency. That work will include the Condover turning where there have been two personal injury accidents in the last 10 years. A report is due in the spring.
<P>

<a name="30127w03.html_para5">The introduction of speed limits is very carefully controlled as, to impose an inappropriate limit that would not appear reasonable to most drivers in the prevailing conditions could bring the national system of speed limits into disrepute and lead to greater non compliance.

<a name="30127w04.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide figures for each of the last five years because there is no requirement on local education authorities or the Learning and Skills Council to provide information on the number of asylum seekers in education.
<P>

<a name="30127w04.html_para4">Information from the local Learning and Skills Council suggests that, at the end of July 2000, 60 asylum seekers were known to have sought education within Bedfordshire. These figures include both children of compulsory school age and young people and adults aged over 16. In Luton over the past two years (2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02), an average of 130 pupils under 16 from both asylum seeking and refugee backgrounds were in education. The number of asylum seekers participating

in further education institutions within Bedfordshire and Luton was 318 during 1999&#150;2000 and 315 during 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="30127w04.html_para5">However, the high mobility of some asylum seekers and refugees makes any data collected unreliable.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30127w05.html_para0">Initial evaluation of breakfast clubs and the national school fruit scheme indicates that they have the potential to make an important contribution to improving children's diet, as do the compulsory nutritional standards for school meals. Measures to increase physical activity can also make a contribution to reducing childhood obesity. Further evaluation of breakfast clubs will be carried out under the food in schools programme. An assessment of the impact of the national school fruit scheme upon children's diets will be undertaken over the next two years.

<i>[holding answer 15 January 2003]:</i> Under SR2000 Sefton's Children's Fund partnership received a total allocation of &pound;2 million up to March 2004 for its Children's Fund programme. The partnership has been paid &pound;89,471.75 to date. A total of &pound;66,107 was allocated in FY 2002&#150;03 to personnel costs, of which &pound;36,508 has been paid to date. Sefton experienced a shortfall in expenditure against profile in its first year of operation because of early recruitment difficulties and the impact this has had on service delivery. The partnership also received an allocation of &pound;200,000 for activities undertaken as part of the Street Crime initiative from July 2002 to September 2004, and to date have been paid &pound;25,000. The partnership has profiled to spend its full SR2000 allocation by March 2004.

<a name="30127w05.html_para6">Many of the experts in this field hold differing views on whether or not the percentage of the prison population suffering from dyslexia is higher than that of the wider community. Some feel that what may appear to be indicators of dyslexia are in fact the result of a whole range of social factors that could include the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, physical injuries, interrupted schooling and lack of parental support. Conversely, others suspect that there is a high incidence of dyslexia among this specific group and that the frustrations arising from this learning difficulty have contributed to their offending behaviour.

<P>
<a name="30127w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 A survey carried out in 2001 indicated that around a quarter of establishments had staff trained to support learners with dyslexia. Under the Government's Skills for Life strategy, staff in all prisons and young offender institutions will have access to training so that they can identify indicators of dyslexia, know when to refer learners for specialist assessment, and provide appropriate educational programmes for them. This will be further enhanced in those young offender institutions caring for 15 to 17-year-olds by the appointment of special educational needs co-ordinators, and of learning support assistants on a ratio of one to every 10 learners.
<P>

<a name="30127w05.html_para9">New diagnostic assessments for prisoners, to be administered after initial assessment by a specialist teacher, will offer guidance on when to refer learners for a full dyslexia assessment with an educational psychologist or other appropriately trained person.
<P>

<a name="30127w05.html_para10">The majority of people with dyslexia do not require specialist teaching. They need high quality basic skills teaching which adopts a variety of inclusive strategies to support the needs of all learners. An inclusive learning handbook for all staff in prisons and YOls to be published this spring will increase the understanding of the needs of those with dyslexia.

<a name="30127w06.html_para5">New guidance was issued last year regarding the procedures schools should follow for the collection and recording of pupils' ethnic group. Schools should in the first instance seek information via parents, and any response (including a refusal to provide information) must be respected. However if there is no response at all to the school's inquiries it has the option of ascribing an ethnic group to the pupil based on its own best judgment. In this event various steps have to be taken in order to comply with data protection rules, and the fact that ascription has taken place must be shown alongside the ethnic group itself&#151;both in the school's own records, and in any information passed on to the LEA or to the Department in the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC). This year's PLASC returns from schools will reflect the ethnic group information which they have collected under the new guidance, including details of whether that was provided by parents or pupils or ascribed by the school.

 To meet the standard to become a Sector Skills Council, an organisation should be employer-led. This means it should be launched and led by employers but should also involve other important organisations in the sector, such as trade unions. We recognise that a component of many SSCs will be support from their trade association but the SSC, as an organisation licensed by Government and in receipt of

<P><I>27 Jan 2003 : Column 541W</I><P>

<a name="30127w06.html_para6">On the question of funding, my Department will meet part of the costs of an SSC (up to &pound;1 million core contribution) to give capacity to allow SSCs to take a more strategic approach underpinned by proper research and avoid being compromised by commercial interests.

 Local education authorities (the statutory sector) and a range of voluntary organisations provide the Youth Service. The priority age group for the service is 13 to 19-year-olds but the target age group may extend to 11 to 25-year-olds in some cases.

<P>

<a name="30127w07.html_para1">In December 2002 the Government launched the document &quot;Transforming Youth Work Resourcing Excellent Youth Services" which provides a cross Government view of the key elements of a high quality, well managed and properly resourced Youth Service. The document underpins the Transforming Youth Work programme and the Government's commitment to work with local authorities to ensure the delivery of a high quality Youth Service for young people which is at the heart of the Connexions Service. The document emphasises that local authorities should ensure the delivery of a service which targets the 13&#150;19 age range but may also be working at the margins with 11&#150;13 and 19 to 25-year-olds. The document confirms this existing age range criteria for the Youth Service.

<a name="30127w07.html_para2">Under the Learning and Skills Act, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a specific responsibility to help both young people and adults with learning difficulties and disabilities. The broad remit of the council enables it to fund a wide range of learning provision when considering their particular needs. This includes activities offering opportunities for non-formal types of learning, and learning which does not lead to a qualification. For adults, particularly those with special needs, this provision will be more suitable than a youth work curriculum provided by the Youth Service.

 On 12 December 2002, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, set out his strategy to improve behaviour and attendance in all schools. In doing so, he underlined our commitment to the Public Service Agreement: by 2004, to reduce truancies by 10 per cent. compared to 2002, to sustain the new lower level, and improve overall attendance levels thereafter. To achieve this objective, we have introduced a range of initiatives, such as the co-ordination of national truancy sweeps, funding for electronic registration systems, the development of guidance for more effective prosecutions and a sustained publicity campaign aimed at parents and pupils. In addition, we are proposing a new package of support and sanctions, such as behaviour and attendance training and audits available to all secondary schools from September, fixed penalty notices for parents of persistent truants and the introduction of parenting contracts.
<P>

<a name="30127w07.html_para7">Ministers and officials in this Department and the Home Office are in regular contact on truancy issues, for example through the Government's Street Crime Initiative and in developing measures for the proposed Anti-Social Behaviour Bill.

<P>
<a name="30127w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 None. There is no evidence that this is a significant problem. Aviation fuel can only be legally jettisoned in an emergency, when Air Traffic Control would advise the pilot to do so, if at all possible, either over the sea or over 10,000 feet above ground level so that the fuel would vaporise. Emergencies are by definition rare occurrences. There is no incentive for jettisoning fuel illegally&#151;it is an expensive commodity. If aviation fuel were to be jettisoned it would biodegrade readily and therefore would not be expected to have a long-term impact. As aviation fuel contains no more than the smallest traces of chlorine or bromine, it will make no contribution to ozone layer depletion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since the publication of the UK's Climate Change Programme in November 2000, the following main actions have been taken to promote energy efficiency in the domestic, business and public sectors:
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para8">The Climate Change Levy, a levy on the business use of fuel, was introduced in April 2001. Receipts, forecast at &pound;1 billion a year, are recycled back to business&#151;including &pound;50 million for business energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para9">Climate Change Agreements have been reached with 44 sectors of energy intensive industry. Participants in these agreements pay a reduced rate of Climate Change 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2003 : Column 548W</I><P>
Levy (20 per cent. of the full levy) in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency targets over a 10-year period.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para10">The Carbon Trust was launched in April 2001, and receives two-thirds of its annual budget from recycled receipts from the Climate Change Levy, it encourages and promotes the development of low carbon technologies to support the transition to a low carbon economy. It offers an interest free loan scheme for small and medium-sized businesses and provides funding for the development of low carbon technologies through the Low Carbon Innovation Programme.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para11">The Enhanced Capital Allowances Scheme enables businesses to claim 100 per cent. first year capital allowances on investments in a range of approved energy saving technologies.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para12">The UK Emissions Trading Scheme was launched in April 2002. Companies in Climate Change Agreements can trade within the scheme to help meet their targets. Participants entering directly into the scheme can trade to meet emission reduction targets delivering 1.1 MtC by 2006. Energy efficiency measures help participants to meet their targets.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para13">New requirements have been introduced for local authorities. Authorities have to know their buildings' energy consumption and carbon emissions. From 2002&#150;03 they are required to benchmark their energy use in operational property and street lighting, and will set local improvement targets from 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para14">The Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2002&#150;05 (EEC) places a challenging but realistic obligation on electricity and gas suppliers to promote improvements in domestic energy efficiency. Suppliers will achieve individual EEC targets by encouraging and assisting consumers to take up energy efficiency measures. It is expected to save 0.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2005. It will also help those on lower incomes&#151;who spend a larger proportion of their incomes on energy&#151;by focussing at least 50 per cent. of energy savings on consumers in receipt of benefits or tax credits.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para15">Since its launch in June 2000, the new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme&#151;which is now marketed as Warm Front&#151;has helped over 400,000 households through the installation of a range of insulation and heating measures. Warm Front is the Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty, aimed at the most vulnerable groups in the private sector in England.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para16">The Community Energy Programme is a &pound;50 million grant programme operational from 2002&#150;04 aiming to promote community heating in the UK, primarily through the use of CHP. It will install and refurbish community heating schemes, benefiting people on low incomes while contributing to the Climate Change Programme by reducing carbon emissions by an estimated 0.15 million tonnes of carbon a year.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para17">Part L of the Building Regulations covering energy efficiency provisions was revised in October 2001 and the changes came into effect in 2002. These require work on new buildings and the refurbishment of the existing stock to conform to higher energy efficiency standards including those relating to building insulation, air-tightness, lighting, space heating, hot water, boiler performance and replacement glazing. It is estimated 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2003 : Column 549W</I><P>
that the package of measures introduced in October will reduce carbon emissions from the domestic sector by 0.8 million tonnes per year by 2010.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para18">The Treasury introduced in the 2002 Budget, a VAT reduction on certain energy saving materials installed under grant schemes.
<P>

<a name="30127w08.html_para19">The Government have provided funding for the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to help individual households, local authorities and others improve domestic energy efficiency. Since 2000, EST has created the Practical Help advisory service, expanded its local authority support programme providing dedicated staff to 23 areas across the UK, introduced a new grant scheme for innovative projects and expanded its network of Energy Efficiency Advice Centres providing households with advice and support. EST has developed the Energy Efficiency Recommended (EER) labelling scheme (with energy efficiency manufacturers, retailers and installers) to provide easy identification of energy efficient products. EST has also developed EEI&#151;the network of accredited installers in the insulation and heating industries.

The table shows average direct subsidies received by farm businesses of different types in 2001&#150;02. Payments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were the responsibility of the devolved authorities in this period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 13 January 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 372W, on fisheries, for what reasons a copy of Opinion of the Legal Service, Council of the European Union, No. 13585/02, Limite, JUR424 PECHE164, dated 29 October 2002, was not passed by her Department to the <i>(a)</i> Scottish Fishermen's Federation and <i>(b)</i> National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations.  [92645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Documents bearing the classification &quot;Limite" are internal to the Council of the European Union and are not intended for disclosure to the public. Moreover, the Council Legal Service provides legal advice to assist the Council in the course of its work. The opinions are excluded from the categories of Council decisions subject to publication under the Council rules of procedure.
<P>

<a name="30127w09.html_para9">Under the terms of European Parliament and Council Regulation 1049/2001 it is not open to the Government to decide unilaterally to release a Council Legal Service opinion, unless there is a strong public interest to do so. Recent case law and Council decisions confirm that it is not in the public interest to release documents containing Council Legal Service advice. Release would also run contrary to the principle of Legal Professional Privilege.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w10.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions on industries important to the delivery of Government initiatives aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions.  [90810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK Climate Change Programme published in November 2000 sets out the range of policy measures&#151;regulation, economic instruments, information programmes and public expenditure&#151;that the Government and the devolved administrations are introducing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to meet the UK's climate change targets. The measures in the Programme will deliver wider environmental, social and economic benefits. Measures to stimulate more efficient use of energy by business, for example, will help improve competitiveness. The Programme is also designed to offer incentives to industry to develop new, low carbon technologies and to exploit the growing international market for more efficient processes and renewable technologies.
<P>

<a name="30127w10.html_para2">The Programme includes two legislative measures that affect industry directly, each of which was subject to individual regulatory impact assessments as part of the normal policy development process. The industries affected by the legislation will include some that are important to the delivery of the policy measures in the Programme, but the Government has not produced a separate assessment of the specific impacts on them.
<P>

<a name="30127w10.html_para3">The first legislative measure is the EC Directive 96/61 on integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC), which applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of certain industrial activities and, inter alia, contributes to the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, as well asimproving the energy

<P><I>27 Jan 2003 : Column 554W</I><P>
efficiency of most of the energy intensive sectors of industry. The impact of the Directive, and the legislation implementing its requirements in England and Wales, was considered in the regulatory impact assessment published on 26 April 2000. It is available on the Defra website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/ippc5/pdf/ippc5.pdf. The Directive has some impact on combined heat and power (CHP) technology, which the Government is supporting because of its high efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30127w10.html_para4">The second legislative measure is the energy efficiency provisions contained in Part L of the Building Regulations for England and Wales, which were amended by the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001. The aim is to improve the energy performance of all types of building, including those used for industrial and commercial purposes, to reduce energy use and therefore emissions of carbon dioxide. The Building Regulations are the responsibility of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The amendments came into force on 1 April 2002. A regulatory impact assessment for the Regulations was published by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (now the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) when the Regulations were made. It is available on the ODPM website at http://www.safety.odpm.gov.uk/bregs/brpub/ria/ria-01/index.htm. I understand that, in accordance with normal practice, the Office intends to investigate how the amended Regulations are being implemented around 2004, when there is a sufficient sample of works compliant with the new requirements.

 The Government are supporting a number of end-use studies for used tyres, including the incorporation of tyre granulate in road surfaces.
<P>

<a name="30127w11.html_para2">The EC Landfill Directive, in banning the disposal of almost all tyres to landfill, effectively sets a 100 per cent. recovery requirement. Within that overall recovery requirement, there are no individual targets for the recycling and retreading of tyres, and the Government have no present plans for introducing such targets. Figures for 2001 show that value was recovered from over 60 per cent. of the estimated 480,000 tonnes of tyres disposed of in the UK that year. Significant additional recovery capacity has since been brought forward and is anticipated to be taken up as the landfill directive requirements bear down.
<P>

<a name="30127w11.html_para3">The Government in partnership with the tyre industry through the Used Tyre Working Group (UTWG) are investigating alternative disposal, recycling and recovery options for those tyres displaced from landfill with the aim of ensuring that sufficient capacity is available to handle those tyres.

<P>
<a name="30127w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Thames Barrier and associated defences provide a high standard of protection to London and the Thames Estuary against a combination of tidal/fluvial flood risks, the principal risk being from tidal surge events.
<P>

<a name="30127w11.html_para12">A generous allowance for sea level rise was built into the design for the Thames Barrier and associated defences and thus we have today a standard of 0.05 per cent. risk of flooding from tidal surge in any one year. As sea level rises, this standard of protection will reduce as planned to the design standard of 0.1 per cent. risk of flooding from tidal surge by the year 2030. This will provide a level of protection equivalent to 2 metres above the maximum level of the 1953 flood event and is the highest standard of protection in the UK.

<a name="30127w11.html_para13">The Environment Agency, with Defra support, is engaged in a number of studies and investigations which are reviewing the current and future needs of London's tidal defences, including the overarching planning and research project &quot;Planning for Flood Risk management in the Thames Estuary".

We expect final agreement to take the form of a protocol which will be part of the terms of Cyprus's accession. The accession treaty is due to be signed on 16 April, and a Bill introduced to enable its ratification by the UK.

 Ten different individuals and organisations have made representations to the British High Commission in Nairobi since January 1999 to ask for compensation for alleged victims of repression by the British authorities during the period of the Mau Mau rebellion. The latest approach was on 19 October 2002 on behalf of the &quot;Mau Mau Original Trust". In addition, BHC officials received a delegation of Mau Mau veterans on 23 October 2002. Responsibility for the actions of the colonial Government of Kenya passed to the Government of Kenya at Independence in 1963.

 When he met President Kostunica and Foreign Minister Svilanovic in late 2002, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised our serious concerns about reports of arms sales from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) to Iraq and Liberia, in breach of UN sanctions. He urged them to ensure a thorough investigation, leading to prosecutions of those responsible. Since then Mr. Cekovic, Head of Jugoimport, and Mr. Djokic, Assistant Minister for Defence, have been sacked, the Jugoimport office in Baghdad closed and a commission established to investigate Jugoimport's activities. The FRY has also cancelled a bilateral agreement with Iraq and suspended bilateral military industrial agreements with all states that are subject to UN sanctions. Svilanovic has promised further investigation and possible prosecutions. The United Kingdom is considering the provision of technical assistance to the FRY to ensure effective regulation of arms exports. On 10 December UK experts visited Belgrade to conduct a preliminary assessment; a follow-up visit will take place soon. The EU provides support to the FRY's reform process, including improving the democratic control of the armed forces, from its Common Foreign and Security Policy budget.

The UK Government, along with other members of the international community, has consistently condemned the Government of Zimbabwe for its appalling record on human rights and have called on it to respect its obligations under international human rights conventions. Along with our EU partners, the UK Government will continue to focus international attention on human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The UK Government have taken a number of measures in response to the situation in Zimbabwe including; an outright rejection of the conduct and outcome of the Presidential election in March 2002; a complete embargo on arms sales since May 2000; a suspension of non-humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of our military training team. Working with our EU partners, we have also imposed targeted sanctions, a travel ban and assets freeze, on 79 members of the Mugabe regime.
<P>

<a name="30127w14.html_para1">The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe from its Councils in March 2002. The Commonwealth Troika is pressing for good governance and the rule of law to be restored in Zimbabwe. It last met in Abuja on 23 September 2002. It deferred a decision on further Commonwealth measures, but stated that it would stick to its task over the next six months &quot;at which point further measures might need to be considered". It is due to meet again in March.

 During my visit to Afghanistan in late October I visited a school in Kabul, this was one of many that have reopened across Afghanistan. In the past year 3 million children have returned to school and girls now make up 30 per cent. of school children. Estimates are that 7,000 schools for 4.5 million children will re-open on 21 March for the new year. Women are also seeking education to make up for a time when they were unable to study. Accurate figures are not available, but estimates are that literacy rates for women over 15 are less than 25 per cent. It remains difficult for women and girls to gain education in some parts of Afghanistan but we are supporting the fghan Government in assisting all those who wish to, to access education.

 The Afghanistan Support Group (ASG) in December brought together the Afghan Government, the United Nations and donors to discuss progress already made in Afghanistan and the next steps in the reconstruction process. A key element of the ASG was the launch of the 2003 UN appeal for the Transitional Assistance Programme forAfghanistan. Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani also made a brief presentation on the budget for the coming year. Few donors were in a position to make specific pledges 2003 but most were able to confirm that they expected to provide a similar level of funding as they had provided for 2002; around $1 .Sbillion.
<P>

<a name="30127w14.html_para3">It was also agreed by all present that this would be the final ASG. A new Development Forum, designed to ensure greater Afghan leadership of the reconstruction effort will supersede it.

 A great deal has been achieved since January 2002, when we pledged &pound;200 million to the reconstruction of Afghanistan at the Tokyo conference. A broad-based Transitional Administration has been elected. A new currency has been issued. 3 million children have returned to school, and polio has almost been eradicated.
<P>

<a name="30127w14.html_para4">The 2002 harvest saw grain production rise by 80 per cent. compared to 2001. The power station and airport in Kabul are being refurbished. The rebuilding of the roads system has begun, and work is continuing on customs reform and the drafting of a new constitution.
<P>

<a name="30127w14.html_para5">However, much remains to be done. One of the most pressing issues is to improve security for those living outside Kabul, and to extend the authority of the elected government beyond the capital. This is of fundamental importance to both the reconstruction effort, and in order to ensure human rights are respected. In December President Karzai issued a decree setting out plans for a multi-ethnic national army, and in the last month the first Provincial Reconstruction Team was deployed in Gardez province, under US leadership. First reports indicate that the security situation has improved as a result. The UK is actively considering leading a PRT in the future.
<P>

<a name="30127w14.html_para6">An important development has been the signing by Afghanistan's neighbours of Good Neighbourly Relations declaration by Afghanistan's neighbours. The declaration, essentially an agreement to maintain constructive relations and not to seek influence by exploiting ethnic rivalries, was signed by all Afghanistan's immediate neighbours in December 2002.
<P>

<a name="30127w14.html_para7">Work on humanitarian relief is also continuing. We contributed &pound;11 million to the UN's Winterisation programme to help ensure that vulnerable communities had adequate shelter and food over the winter, and a further &pound;2 million to the UN snow-clearing operation to ensure that aid reaches remote communities. Early indications are that this programme is going well, helped by a relatively mild winter. DFID will shortly be conducting a humanitarian assessment mission to formulate our strategy for the coming year.
<P>

 None. The construction of the road referred to took place from 1990 to 1993. Officials from the then Overseas Development Administration were aware of various complaints from people living in communities (not between Westlands and St. Austin, but further north on the same road) and discussed these with European Commission officials. The EC Ombudsman subsequently investigated and concluded that there had been no mal-administration on the part of the EC.

<a name="30127w16.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 While it is essential to deal with the problem of unsustainable debt in the poorest countries as part of our efforts to assist in eradicating poverty, complete cancellation of debt is not required; nor is it the most effective means of delivering aid resources to reduce poverty. We do not support the proposal for 100 per cent. cancellation of IMF and World bank loans, which is neither desirable nor equitable. For these institutions to provide 100 per cent. relief would risk skewing limited development resources away from other very poor countries, which have handled their debt well. Countries need to borrow&#151;initially only on very concessional terms&#151;to finance their poverty reduction strategies. In this way, they can re-establish their creditworthiness, which will also help them attract private investment and accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction.

This Statement will provide the Department with detailed information about the impact that a proposal may have on the environment.
<P>

<a name="30127w17.html_para7">It is not normal procedure to consult the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on planning applications that, although in scenic areas, do not have a direct impact on tourism, and thus do not fall within the statutory remit of the Board.

However, in terms of any potential direct impact of a wind farm proposal on the integrity of sites designated as of wildlife importance, including those designated for the conservation of birds, the Planning Service's main source of advice and guidance will remain the Department's Environment and Heritage Service and there are no plans to introduce a practice of consulting the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds on wind farm applications.

 The Government believe it is important for consumers to have choice in financial products, including the availability of 'ethical' products.

 The Department will allocate &pound;14.2 million from its Innovation Budget to fund the Manufacturing advisory Service. This money will be allocated to Regional Development Agencies and the Welsh Development Agency to match fund the Regional Centres for Manufacturing Excellence (RCMEs) that we have established in partnership with them to deliver the Manufacturing Advisory Service in their respective regions and in Wales. Our allocated Innovation Budget funding will also cover the cost of a contract that DTI has awarded to Inbis to establish a National Network of Centres of Expertise in Manufacturing and a website for the MAS. All 10 RCMEs and the national website have been launched and are in operation (the site is at <i>www.dit.gov.uk/manfacturingm/mas).</i>

 The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator, is reviewing security following the incursion into Sizewell B nuclear power station on 13 January by demonstrators organised by Greenpeace. Some security enhancements have already been identified and any others arising during the review will be implemented as soon as practicable. An earlier review was conducted following the incursion in October 2002 and action taken.
<P>

<a name="30127w21.html_para7">Responsibility for security at the Sizewell B nuclear power station lies with British Energy, the site licensee. Site management comply with the company's security plan in respect of the site as required by the Nuclear Generating Stations (Security) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No. 665). OCNS, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, advises site management about security threats, specifies the security standards to be followed, approves the security plan and monitors compliance. OCNS had already required the station to implement several additional measures in response to the heightened terrorist threat.

 The profitability and affordability of trips depend on several factors, including the price of tobacco products, the cost of passage to other EU member states and the level of disposable income available to different shoppers. Variations in cost between routes and products, in shoppers' income and in their understanding of existing unlimited shopping rights, prevent explicit or quantifiable relationships being derived about the likely response&#151;in terms of the

 As I stated in my answer of 16 January 2003, HM Customs and Excise's survey data of cross-channel travellers shows that the majority of travellers make no purchases of cigarettes and that, of those who do make purchases, two-thirds purchase below the previous indicative level of 800 cigarettes, and that a further 15 per cent. purchase above. The recent change to the levels can be expected to have little effect on the shopping patterns of these travellers.
<P>

<a name="30127w23.html_para3">The assumptions for the public finance forecasts relate to the impact on behaviour of those travellers purchasing at the previous indicative levels for tobacco. For this group of travellers it was assumed that:

 In consultation with representative bodies, the Inland Revenue has recently extended the framework developed for inquiries into Income Tax Self Assessment returns to cover Corporation Tax Self Assessment inquiries. The framework does not involve any new powers and does not affect taxpayers' rights. Rather, it is designed to enhance co-operation in inquiries between the Inland Revenue and tax practitioners. Details of the framework, as it extends to Corporation Tax, will be published in a 'Working Together' newsletter in February or early March 2003. The Working Together Group is a partnership between the Inland Revenue and those bodies who represent tax practitioners. There are no plans to issue a separate report.

 We have made no specific assessment of the effects of fuel duty on low-income families in rural areas.

<P>
<a name="30127w26.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The global economic slowdown of 2001 was the principal cause of recent difficulties faced by UK manufacturers. G7 industrial output grew by 4.7 per cent. in 2000. During 2001 it contracted by 3.6 per cent. This was the sharpest slowdown in G7 industrial activity since 1975. But manufacturing output showed signs of stabilising in the course of 2002&#151;in Q3 it rose by over 1 per cent., ending six consecutive quarters of decline.
<P>

<a name="30127w26.html_para0">The stable macroeconomic framework is creating the right underlying conditions to enable manufacturing to invest, grow and prosper. The UK stands ready to benefit from any sustained recovery in the sector due to strong economic fundamentals and the Government's pro-active enterprise agenda.
<P>

<a name="30127w26.html_para1">In particular, corporation tax is now lower than in any major industrialised country. Cuts in capital gains tax mean the UK's CGT regime will be more favourable than the US's from April. R&D tax credits for large companies will provide an important boost to UK manufacturing and RDAs have been created to drive growth in every English region.

<a name="30127w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Since 1999&#150;2000 figures for expenditure in support of the Treasury's better public services objective have been published in schedule 5 of its annual resource accounts (Cm 5062 and HC 573). The 2001&#150;02 accounts will be published shortly. No figures are available for earlier years.
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) whether periods of service as an armed forces reservist count as periods of continued employment in a taxpayer's main job for the purposes of the favourable tax treatment given to the share option scheme called Enterprise Management Incentive; and if he will make a statement;  [93345]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether favourable tax treatment available to taxpayers in continued employment is lost to them during periods of service as an armed forces reservist; and if he will make a statement.  [93344]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w26.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Enterprise Management Incentive rules dealing with employees' working time do not cater specifically for periods of service by armed forces reservists. Normally this will not cause difficulty in determining an employee's eligibility to the tax advantages available under Enterprise Management Incentives. However, I will be asking my officials to consider whether any issues may arise.

 The Chancellor announced in his 1998 Budget speech that rolling forward exemption for vehicles over 25-years-old would stop so that only vehicles manufactured before 1 January 1973 remained eligible for the exemption. Continuing the rolling forward exemption was difficult to justify on environmental grounds. Any changes to taxation policy will be announced by the Chancellor in the context of his Budget judgment.

The circular explains that definitions should be framed to endure for the life of the plan, for instance, through references to the level of local incomes and their relationship to house prices or rents, rather than to a particular price or rent.
<P>

<a name="30127w27.html_para7">Circular 06/98 also provides guidance on the securing and controlling of the occupancy of such housing by, for example, the involvement of a registered social landlord or through the use of appropriate planning conditions

 my right hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said in his statement on sustainable communities, housing and planning on 18 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i> columns 438&#150;442<i>.</i> the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister needs to make better use of land. The Government target that 60 per cent. of additional homes should be on brown-field land is being met but the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister needs to keep up the pressure.
<P>

<a name="30127w27.html_para8">English Partnerships have been appointed as the Government's expert advisors on brown-field land. They are currently working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to draw up a National Brown-field Strategy to be presented to the Deputy Prime Minister for approval in Spring 2003.
<P>

<a name="30127w27.html_para9">In addition, The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consulted in February 2002 on new technical planning advice on the development on land affected by contamination. This emphasised the positive role of planning in bringing about the remediation of contaminated land. It recognised particularly that much of the contaminated land identified under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 will be subject to voluntary remediation through the planning system as part of the process of redevelopment. This revision of the contaminated land aspects of Planning policy guidance note 23 will be incorporated later this year in a new Planning policy statement, accompanied by a technical annexes on development on land affected by contamination.

 In all three tables &quot;rural areas" refers to those local authorities classified by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister as &quot;mixed rural" or &quot;deeply rural".
<P>

<a name="30127w28.html_para6">The figures shown do not go back to 1978, as requested. This is because the current definitions of urban/rural apply to current local authority boundaries only. Rental figures prior to 1996 would require us to refer to earlier local authority boundaries and could be determined only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the annual housing investment that will be needed to ensure that his target for decent homes is met.  [93098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w28.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 To meet the decent homes target for social housing the investment needed has to both tackle homes that currently fail the standard and prevent homes from falling below it. For homes currently owned by local authorities the estimated average annual investment in their stock required to deliver decent homes is &pound;3.5 billion at current prices. This figure will reduce with stock losses from this sector. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not yet have comparable figures for homes owned by Registered Social Landlords.

Under Office of the Deputy Prime Minister central posting arrangements, all posts are open to part-time workers or job sharers. In very exceptional cases where line managers consider that a post cannot be filled on a part-time/job share basis, they must make a case to Human Resources setting out compelling reasons for this.

This takes account of all relevant factors in order to ensure that we acquire the capability required at best value for money. Wider industrial issues are also being considered, consistent with the defence industrial policy published in the autumn. Our decision will be announced shortly.

 While we want Saddam Hussein to disarm voluntarily, it is evident that we shall not achieve this unless we continue to present him with a clear and credible threat of force. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence told the House on Monday 20 January 2003, the United Kingdom forces being deployed to the Mediterranean and the middle east have the balance and flexibility for the tasks that might be asked of them. Exercise Saif Sareea II in Oman, towards the end of 2001, clearly demonstrated our ability to deploy United Kingdom ground forces to the middle east and sustain them there. I am confident therefore that we can sustain forces in the region for as long as necessary.

 Two epidemiological studies of some 22,000 participants of the British nuclear test programme have been carried out on the Ministry of Defence's behalf by the National Radiological Protection Board. The results of these studies were published in 1988 and 1993. They showed that, as a group, participation in the tests has had no detectable effect on the expectation of life, or on the risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases by those who took part.
<P>

<a name="30127w30.html_para1">The results of a third study are to be published in a few months' time. There are no plans for any further studies.
<P>

<a name="30127w30.html_para2">The Ministry of Defence is aware of clinical study programmes being undertaken at various universities worldwide. We have reservations about the applicability to test participants today since any radiation exposures involved in the tests were generally very small and over 40 years ago.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are currently six Royal Navy and two Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships on long-planned deployments to the Gulf. The Type 42 Destroyer, HMS Cardiff, is on Armilla Patrol contributing, with other nations, to the enforcement of UN embargoes against Iraq. It is usual for a United Kingdom tanker to be deployed in the region to support the Armilla patrol. At present, RFA Bayleaf is the Armilla tanker.
<P>

<a name="30127w30.html_para3">The Type 22 Frigate, HMS Cumberland, is in the Gulf in support of operations against international terrorism. Four Mine Counter Measures vessels, HMS Bangor, HMS Brockelsby, HMS Blyth and HMS Sandown, together with RFA Sir Bedevere, are in the region at the invitation of the Saudi Government, made early last year, to carry out a series of joint exercises. This invitation followed on from the success of similar co-operation during Exercise Saif Sareea II. In addition, the survey vessel, HMS Roebuck, is also on a long-planned deployment to the Gulf.

 There is no inevitability about military action against Iraq; this question is therefore hypothetical at this stage.

In the aftermath of any conflict, Britain would remain at the forefront of efforts to help the Iraqi people.

 The United States missile defence programme remains evolutionary and its future architecture has still finally to be decided. The US has offered to extend missile defence coverage and make missile defence capabilities available to the United Kingdom as the evolution of the system permits, subject to appropriate political and financial arrangements. An assessment of how coverage of the UK and allies might be achieved is included in the discussion paper published by the Ministry of Defence on 9 December 2002. The UK will continue this process of assessment, not least through agreeing a technical Memorandum of Understanding with the United States to gain further insight into the missile defence programme.

 As I informed the House on 15 January 2003, the Government's preliminary conclusion is that we should agree to the US request to upgrade RAF Fylingdales for missile defence purposes. Ballistic missile early warning would continue to be the station's primary role. The upgrade would enable the radar to track incoming missiles more accurately and guide interceptions by defensive missiles if necessary. We will take full account of the views which have been expressed in public and parliamentary discussion before communicating a final decision to the US Administration.

 The importance to the Ministry of Defence of our Lancashire-based suppliers is well understood.

The aerospace industry is of particular significance in the area, with BAES maintaining substantial facilities at Warton and Samlesbury. Prime contractors, together with a wide range of smaller companies supplying components and services, play an important role in equipping our Armed Forces.

 The anthrax vaccine found on the South Dorset coast is from a batch produced by the centre for Applied Microbiology and Research and purchased by the Ministry of Defence in February 2001. Because ampoules from the batch were issued to a large number of units it has not yet been possible to identify how they came to be in the sea. As far as we are aware, this is the only vaccine found, although a number of other pharmaceutical products, including drugs, have been recovered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Eurofighter aircraft requires large areas of airspace in which to train. Following a review of current allocation of air space, the National Air Traffic Control Services and the Ministry of Defence have therefore agreed to redesignate airspace over the North Sea. Three large managed areas have been designated which, when required, may be &quot;booked" and used for military training. Only the most northerly designated training area covers any land, and within this area all flights will be conducted above 24,500ft. Under Government guidelines public consultation regarding the use of airspace is not required except where flight takes place below 7,000ft.
<P>

<a name="30127w32.html_para2">The conduct of military flying is taken extremely seriously and any complaints are thoroughly investigated by the Ministry of Defence. Particular rules govern supersonic flight and these will continue to be strictly enforced.

 We remain committed to maximising the benefits that can be derived from collaborative defence equipment programmes. The smart acquisition initiative stresses the need to predict and plan against those issues that have the potential to cause delay. This aims to ensure that risks and opportunities are addressed before we commit to new co-operative programmes. More generally, the development of the international agency OCCAR continues to be an important part of our aim to provide an effective route for the management of defence equipment collaborative programmes.

It established the concept of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces to provide more capable, more deployable, and better supported Joint Forces. The initial operating capability was achieved in 1999, and elements have been deployed successfully both on operations and exercises. 16 Air Assault brigade, also formed in 1999, combines airborne and air mobile assets with, in the future, the new attack helicopter, and provides a further significant enhancement to our tactical mobility.

<P>
<a name="30127w33.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Following 11 September 2001 the increased danger from terrorist organisations to the Royal Navy (including the Royal Marines) has been recognised and work undertaken to ameliorate the risks to both deployed forces and those in their base port. Detailed Force Protection advice on countering the Asymmetric threat from terrorist attack is available in both Tactical and Reference publications and is the subject of continual assessment and periodic update as new information and feedback is obtained. This doctrine comprises both a generic description of likely threats and consideration of numerous measures that Commanding Officers need to consider adopting depending on their area of operations. The advice covers methods of reducing ship and personnel vulnerability to attack, enabling Commanding Officers to formulate a defensive posture commensurate with their operational state and location; reducing the risk of attack from an enemy who holds the advantage of surprise and method.

<a name="30127w33.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The threat from terrorist attack is kept under constant review and the Ministry of Defence works closely with other Government Departments on the protection of merchant shipping. The Royal Navy's worldwide Maritime Trade Operations&#151;known as UK MTO arrangements&#151;enable a number of options to be offered in support of merchant shipping, graduated to the prevailing threat. These range from the provision of routine advice and guidance through to naval supervision. The appropriate level of MTO support required in a given area remains under constant assessment. For example, UK MTO arrangements in the Gulf have been enhanced since October 2001 by the establishment of a UK MTO liaison cell in the region. If necessary, higher level Maritime Trade Operations can be implemented very quickly. Information on specific measures to protect naval shipping were provided in my answer to the hon. Member on 15 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 640W.

 Immunisation against anthrax is just one component of the range of defensive capabilities available to our Armed Forces which protect them against, and enable them to respond to, chemical and biological threats. These include detectors, warning and reporting systems, physical protection including respirators, decontamination equipment and procedures, and other medical counter measures such as antibiotics. We have assembled a package of information and education materials which we hope will encourage Service personnel to take advantage of the additional protection that immunisation against anthrax provides. We are confident that the majority of personnel now deploying to the Gulf will opt to receive immunisations against anthrax, and expect take-up to improve further as the programme expands.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 When employers close their defined benefit schemes, they are seeking to put a limit on the long term liabilities of the company. Given the nature of these liabilities, however, closure is unlikely to have an immediate or even necessarily a short term impact. This is because the existing liabilities will still have to be met for the continuing life of the scheme irrespective of whether new members are being accepted. The Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' (Cm5677) sets out the Government's view that, for this and other reasons, closing or winding up pension schemes are not in the interests of either employers or employees. The Green Paper, therefore, sets out a range of proposals to

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on fraud in the payment of benefit through post offices; and what plans he has to protect against fraud when the post office card account is introduced.  [88245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w35.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Paper-based instruments of payment can be vulnerable to fraudulent attack in a number of ways: they can go astray in the post, be lost or stolen, or be manipulated or counterfeited by a determined fraudster. We estimate that total benefit and pension losses from paper-based instruments of payment fraud in 2000&#150;01 were around &pound;77 million.
<P>

<a name="30127w35.html_para3">We have several measures in place to counter fraud, such as the Order Book Control System (OBCS). This makes use of barcode readers in post offices to scan order books that have been printed with a barcode on the front cover. OBCS alerts the post office clerk when a stop notice has been placed on an order book and instructs them to impound the book immediately. Crucially, the stop notice is activated in whatever post office the book is presented for payment and not only in the customer's designated post office. This helps to ensure that order books reported lost or stolen are not cashed, but instead impounded.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if it is his intention to transfer the existing Child Support Agency caseload onto the new scheme on a single common date.  [91296]<P>

<P>
<a name="30127w36.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Current plans envisage that existing cases will be converted to the new scheme on a common date. Where it emerges that a new application for child support maintenance is linked to an existing case, for example, because the non-resident parent is the same person in both cases, then the existing case will be transferred to the new scheme early.

: To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what effect changes proposed in the recent Green Paper on retirement would have on the retirement age of clergy.  [90570]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30127w36.html_para2">Currently the majority of Church of England clergy must retire on reaching 70, under the Ecclesiastical Offices (Age Limit) Measure 1975. Since the Government is still consulting on how the Employment Directive&#151;to which Chapter 6 of the Green Paper refers&#151;should be implemented as regards discrimination on grounds of age, it is not yet possible to say what its effect will be and whether changes will be required to the 1975 Measure.
<P>

<a name="30127w36.html_para3">However, since most clergy choose to retire before reaching 70, I do not envisage significant effect in practice on the retirement age of clergy.

<a name="30127w37.html_para2">The Department for Work and Pensions is committed to fair trade and ethical supply routes. There are no prescribed fair trade criteria, and each contract is considered individually on its merits in line with EC procurement regulations and Government policy regarding value for money. However, our supply policy is that supply decisions must be based on a balanced assessment of benefits which must include value for money and ethical issues across the whole supply chain. This policy allows individual procurement exercises to set the right criteria, including fair trade criteria, that are appropriate to the business requirement and the commodity or service being procured.

<a name="30127w37.html_para6">In April 2001, New Deal 25 plus was extended and enhanced to provide a flexible, more individually-tailored service to help more people get jobs and remain in them. This included the introduction of an Intensive Activity Period (IAP) for participants after an initial Gateway period. The IAP provides a wider package of tailored help, which might combine, for example, work experience, work-focused training, help with motivation and soft skills, and help with job search. From April 2001, all those eligible for New Deal 25 plus joined this re-engineered programme.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Production of comparable cross-country estimates is extremely difficult due to substantially different rules in various countries. Eurostat say about their numbers:<P>

&quot;This indicator is not perfect. Old-age pensions may cover different areas in different countries, and the retirement age differs from country to country (for both the legal age and the effective age)."<P>

However, Eurostat's: &quot;European Social Statistics&#151;Social Protection Expenditure and Receipts" (ESSPROS) is regarded as the best available measure.<P>

2. The definition of pensions in the ESSPROS methodology includes basic and supplementary schemes, sometimes known as first-pillar and second pillar schemes, but excludes third-pillar arrangements, for example personal pensions in the UK. The ESSPROS pensions aggregate comprises of only part of periodic cash benefits under the disability, old-age, survivors and unemployment functions in ESSPROS.<P>

3. In the case of the UK, the pensions aggregate recorded in ESSPROS comprises of benefits payable under the disability, old-age and survivors' functions and occupational pensions. It excludes lump-sum benefits payable on retirement (approximately 0.7 per cent. of GDP in 1999). Personal pensions are also not included in the ESSPROS social protection definition of pensions (approximately 1.5 per cent. of GDP in 1999).<P>

4. Data are not available for Sweden.<P>

 Ten local authorities have been invited to be pathfinders for the standard local housing allowance pilot.

This means that even though the Survey of English Housing is a large survey, the sample of regulated private tenancies is not large enough to allow reliable figures to be produced for individual regions and for individual years. Tabled is the estimated annual average number of regulated and deregulated tenancies for the period 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02 for London, and for broad regional groupings. Annual estimates of regulated and deregulated tenancies in England are also shown from 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02. There is no reason to expect that the trends in individual regions have been significantly different from those for England as a whole.

<a name="30127w39.html_para5">The abolition of ACT was part of a package of measures introduced over the period 1997 to 1999 aimed at creating an improved climate for long term investment. Subsequent tax changes have also been designed to promote enterprise and encourage economic growth. There are practical difficulties in assessing the impact of these changes, and in any case, it does not make sense to evaluate the impact of one part of this series of measures in isolation.

 Subject to the outcome of staff side consultation, the new national health service pay system is expected to be introduced in 'early implementer' sites, including some acute hospitals, in June 2003 and will be implemented across the rest of the NHS from October 2004. The new pay system will give NHS organisations much greater flexibility to design jobs and working practices around the needs of NHS patients both in the short term following implementation and on an ongoing basis in the future.

<a name="30127w42.html_para3">The Health Survey for England is a series of annual surveys about the health of people in England. This information is used to underpin and improve targeting of nation-wide health policies. The survey was carried out in 1991&#150;1993 by the Office for Population Censuses and Surveys, which is now part of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). From 1994 onwards, the survey has been carried out by the joint survey unit of the national centre of social research and the department of epidemiology and public health at University College, London. The survey includes questions on smoking, drinking, obesity, fruit and vegetable consumption and in certain years, physical activity, but it extends beyond lifestyle questions and covers a wide range of subjects to do with the general health of the population.

 The Department undertakes regular surveys to monitor the diet and health of children. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey showed that more than one in ten children aged 1&#189; to 2&#189; years were anaemic. Early introduction of cow's milk is associated with increased risk of anaemia. The Infant Feeding Survey 2000 reported that by the age of nine months 54 per cent. had introduced cow's milk, compared to 61 per cent. in 1995, while 8 per cent. were giving cow's milk as a main drink, compared to 15 per cent. in 1995.
<P>

<a name="30127w42.html_para11">The Department recommends that unmodified cow's milk be given as a main drink only after the age of one year and may be used in small quantities in the preparation of solid foods in the second half of infancy. After one year, diet should include a variety of foods to ensure that it is adequate in iron, vitamin C and D.

 The information requested is not collected at individual hospital level but at trust level.
<P>

<a name="30127w43.html_para4">The reasons for measuring at trust level is because hospital wards generally care for both men and women. To provide the required levels of privacy and dignity for patients, wards are split into single sex bays, or single rooms, or otherwise configured to provide adequate segregation of gender. It is the responsibility of each national health service trust to determine the most appropriate configuration to meet their specific requirements.
<P>

<a name="30127w43.html_para5">In 1998, we set three clear objectives which were designed to deliver separate sleeping areas and separate toilet and washing facilities for men and women, and to safeguard the privacy and dignity of patients who are mentally ill.

The target to provide separate toilet and washing facilities for men and women will be met by the end of March. 93 per cent. of NHS trusts currently meet this requirement, and a further 2 per cent. of NHS trusts have works underway to deliver the required standard, affecting just 32 wards, which will be completed by the end of the March.

1. Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March 1999.<P>

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents).<P>

3. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<P>

4. Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Non-Medical Census, September 1998.<P>

5. Staff in post data are from the Non-Medical Census, September 1998.<P>

6. Staff in post data exclude staff employed by health authorities, as vacancy information was only collected from trusts.<P>

7. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number.<P>

8. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<P>

9. Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts.<P>

10. Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<P>

 In England, most of the Public Health Laboratories Service (PHLS) laboratories which carry out general diagnostic microbiology are planned to transfer to national health service trusts by 31 March 2003. They are transferring with their current level of funding, which will be maintained for at least the first two years. Each transferring laboratory will have a public health microbiologist, who will work with consultants in communicable disease control, local authorities, the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre and other public health agencies. Service level agreements are being prepared to maintain this work. In addition, there will be a regional microbiologist in each of the nine public health regions, who will work with regional epidemiologists in the implementation of key infectious disease programmes as well as in the investigation of outbreaks of communicable disease. Regional microbiologists will also work to co-ordinate the work between the laboratories in the Health Protection Agency and the NHS. In Wales, PHLS laboratories and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Wales are transferring to the national public health service&#151;Wales, on 1 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30127w45.html_para0">The PHLS Board will remain in existence until primary legislation is changed. From 1 April 2003, we intend that it will be responsible for the production of media for microbiology laboratories, following the transfer of its other current functions to the HPA which we propose to create as a special health authority from the same date.

 The number of notifications received by the Home Office of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) issued, from 1 April 1999 up to 30 September 2002 (latest available), within the Easington district council area, (in which the Easington constituency is situated), are four.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w46.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Changes under the Police Reform Act 2002 make it easier for all relevant authorities to obtain anti-social behaviour orders (ASBO). Interim orders are now available, as are orders on conviction in the criminal courts. From April orders will also be available in the county courts. In addition, the British Transport Police can now apply directly for orders. The Home Office has issued guidance on these changes to assist practitioners in their implementation.
<P>

<a name="30127w46.html_para8">Measures to further improve ASBOs are being introduced under the forthcoming anti-social behaviour bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the launch of the EU's centralised fingerprinting system aimed at asylum seekers.  [92100]<P>

<P>
<a name="30127w46.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government welcome the implementation on 15 January of the centralised EURODAC fingerprint database. Fingerprint technology is an important tool to cut fraud and prevent abuse of national immigration and asylum systems. Co-operation with our European partners through the EURODAC system builds on this and EURODAC will provide a valuable resource to tackle multiple asylum applications. As it becomes established EURODAC will help speed up the processing of asylum cases under the Dublin Convention and its replacement, the Dublin II Regulation, by improving the detection of multiple asylum applications made within the EU or Norway and Iceland.

<i>[holding answer 22 January 2003]:</i> Asylum seekers and their dependants are not eligible to obtain milk tokens under the Welfare Food Scheme Regulations 1996. On 5 November my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced that the asylum support regulations 2000 would be amended to allow for additional payments to be made to supported pregnant women and children under the age of three. Supported pregnant women and children aged one to three will each receive &pound;3 per week. Babies under the age of one will receive &pound;5 per week.

 Blueprint is a drug prevention programme for 11 to 13-year-olds based on the principles that underpin effective school-based drug education. The project aims to recruit 30 schools to the project by April 2003. Invitations to participate in the project (dated 13 January 2003) have been sent to 122 secondary schools across eight local education authorities (Birmingham, Cheshire, Derby, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Leeds, Staffordshire and Stoke). The project is on target.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w47.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Under the Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative over &pound;170 million is being spent funding 684 CCTV schemes. More than 540 of these schemes are already fully operational, with further schemes coming on line weekly.
<P>

<a name="30127w47.html_para0">Although this strand of funding is now closed, other opportunities for funding of CCTV schemes currently exist through the funds available to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, on which the police are partners. Funding of &pound;94 million was announced on January 21 as being available to partnerships for 2003&#150;04. Potential funding is also available through the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas initiative.
<P>

<a name="30127w47.html_para1">General Police Grants will increase by 4.3 per cent. to &pound;7.3 billion in 2003&#150;04. These grants are used by police authorities and chief officers to support their policing programme and plans.

<P>

<a name="30127w47.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister warden schemes work in partnership with local communities and are still relatively new. Robust evaluation is not yet available, but interim findings are positive and show that warden schemes can contribute to improving the liveability of neighbourhoods and the reduction of crime and fear of crime. Residents report significant improvements in community spirit and the quality of life in their neighbourhoods where wardens have proven beneficial and popular.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w47.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Lancashire Constabulary has conducted successful operations to deal with major criminal activities which affect the community, such as drug dealing, burglary and car crime. The Chief Constable's July 2002 Constabulary Ambition Statement for Lancashire gives priority to leadership, resource management, communication, community engagement and delivering results. All are important for the promotion of community cohesion, which is central to the work of the police across the country and particularly in areas with fragmented communities.

 It is not possible to say how many asylum applicants from the Czech Republic are of Romany origin.

<a name="30127w48.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The DNA profile of people with criminal convictions is held on the National DNA database. The profile is derived from a sample taken by the police from the offender. A part of the original sample is also preserved for possible use in the future. This is to enable the profile to be upgraded if necessary in the light of advances in DNA technology and for quality assurance purposes.

 Work is continuing to produce guidance on dealing with perpetrators of domestic violence within police ranks. Consultation will take place with relevant bodies later this month, and guidance issued in spring. Work is also being done to ensure that police discipline procedures complement the guidance when it is issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w48.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what proportion of drug treatment testing orders in <i>(a)</i> Tunbridge Wells and <i>(b)</i> Kent have been breached;  [92105]

<UL>
<P>
(4) what estimate he has made of the cost of drug treatment testing orders in <i>(a)</i> Tunbridge Wells and <i>(b)</i> Kent.  [92104]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w48.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 No unit cost information is available for the specific costs of drug treatment and testing orders (DTTO) in Kent and Tunbridge Wells. The assessed national average unit cost of a DTTO is &pound;6,000, of which &pound;2,400 is retained by the probation service to cover supervision, enforcement and other related costs. The balance of &pound;3,600 per order is transferred to the Department of Health pooled treatment budget to cover treatment and related costs.
<P>

<a name="30127w48.html_para0">234 orders have been commenced in Kent since the national roll-out of DTTOs in October 2000. Kent probation area has been set a target of 160 DTTOs in the current year and 86 orders have been made to 30 November 2002 including six orders in Tunbridge Wells.
<P>

<a name="30127w48.html_para1">It is increasingly the practice of the courts when considering a breach of an order, to allow the DTTO to continue where good progress has otherwise been shown. Information is collected centrally on the total number of breach actions initiated but is not available in a form which allows the incidence of breaches to be linked to an individual order.
<P>

<a name="30127w48.html_para2">Since national roll-out in October 2000, Kent probation has initiated breach action which resulted in the revocation of 121 orders: 91 for failure to comply, and 30 following a conviction for another offence. However, some of these offences were committed before the order began. Results from local intelligence sources, including the police, suggest that the volume of offending for this chaotic group of offenders is reduced and maintained over time for those responding to their treatment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w48.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of each type of crime in <i>(a)</i> Tunbridge Wells and <i>(b)</i> Kent in each of the past five years was deemed to be drug-related.  [92116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w48.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="30127w48.html_para3">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Kent. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).
<P>

<a name="30127w48.html_para4">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2003 : Column 702W</I><P>
represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.
<P>

<a name="30127w48.html_para5">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.

<i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> About 40 staff are employed directly by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) to undertake fraud investigations. In the period April-December 2002 investigations were carried out into 3,161 cases of alleged benefit fraud. As a result of the investigation 1,286 support claimants had their NASS support terminated.
<P>

<a name="30127w49.html_para0">All asylum seekers are being issued with Application Registration Cards (ARCs) which contain photographs and biometric data. Arrangements are under way for NASS support to be paid via the person's ARC. This represents a more secure method of payment and will help to prevent fraud.
<P>

<a name="30127w49.html_para1">NASS has a full time liaison officer on secondment from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to establish closer working links with that Department's Benefits Fraud Investigations unit. In addition NASS contributes to multi-agency operations aimed at combating illegal working in partnership with other Government Departments including the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="30127w49.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Our policy on the use of prisons to hold immigration detainees was set out in the White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&#151;Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain". We made it clear that, although the routine use of prison accommodation for immigration detainees had ended, there would remain a need to hold small numbers of individual detainees in prison for reasons of security and control. There has been no change in that policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has had with the police about means of controlling nuisance by juvenile riders of off-road motor bikes; and if he will make a statement.  [92079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w49.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 22 January 2003]:</i> The Government have responded to public concerns about the nuisance and distress caused by juveniles riding off-road motor bikes across public parks, village greens or the countryside without authority by securing new powers for the police to deal with the anti-social use of any motor vehicle whether on- or off-road. The new powers are contained in section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002 and the Police (Retention and Disposal of Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2002, both of which came into force on 1 January.
<P>

<a name="30127w49.html_para5">The new powers build on existing road traffic legislation by enabling the police to seize any vehicle being driven carelessly or inconsiderately or off-road without authority and in such a way as to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. This will enable the police to deal more immediately and more effectively with the nuisance. The new powers will inconvenience those who misuse their vehicles and see them liable to meet the costs involved in seizure and storage in order to recover them.

My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has set a target for there to be 130,000 officers in March 2003 and 132,500 officers in 2004, but he has not set targets for individual forces.
<P>

<a name="30127w50.html_para0">The deployment of resources between the eight territorial divisions and other specialist operational and support units of the force is an operational matter for the Chief Constable.

 The average increase in Police Grant and Revenue Support Grant and National Non-Domestic Rates income in 2003&#150;04 will be 4.3 per cent. Each police authority will receive an increase of at least 3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30127w50.html_para2">Within the total sum available, distribution of Police Grant is based, by formula, on predicted relative demands on policing services for each police authority. Formula changes for 2003&#150;04 do not relate to pay or pension costs. The proportion of the formula attributable to projected pensions costs remains at 14.5 per cent.

<a name="30127w51.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police in England have been allocated to traffic duties in each year since 1990; and what training in road accident investigation is given to police officers.  [91852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30127w51.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The table gives the readily available information on the number of traffic officers in each police force in England. This covers the three years since 1999, in which year the definition of traffic officer used by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary changed. The definition is now &quot;staff who are predominantly employed on motor-cycles or in patrol vehicles for the policing of traffic and motorway related duties". This definition excludes those engaged in accident investigation, vehicle examination or radar duties.
<P>

<a name="30127w51.html_para10">The adoption of an intelligence-led approach to traffic policing, the integration of such policing with other core activities, the increased use of cameras and other technology, and the more effective use of police resources can lead to a reduction in dedicated traffic officers without a reduction in performance in meeting traffic-related targets or enforcement levels.
<P>

<a name="30127w51.html_para11">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has created a protocol to safeguard expertise and credibility by providing a common standard within the police service for the conduct of collision investigation and reconstruction. Under this, police forces should aim, at the primary level, to train collision investigation officers to the level of the appropriate City and Guilds qualification or an approved equivalent. The recommendation is that the qualification should be achieved within two years of the officer first undertaking this type of work. In addition, specialist officers are required to undergo continuing professional development, which provides a means of maintaining and enhancing their expertise and ensuring the maintenance of standards.
