 The review group will submit its first full report to the Archbishops' Council in December. It will look at ways of improving security for clergy who do not have freehold of office or employment contracts. The group hopes to submit its final report, which will consider the future of the freehold, by the end of 2004.

<a name="31110w01.html_para2">It is for the Government, not the Electoral Commission, to take steps to extend the availability of all-postal voting. However, the Electoral Commission submitted recommendations to Government on the future use of postal voting at local elections in their report "The shape of elections to come" in July 2003. It has also been directed by Government to recommend up to three European Parliamentary regions where all postal pilots would take place at the European Parliamentary elections in 2004.

<P>
<a name="31110w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take steps to require fast food outlets to use only biodegradable packaging.  [134847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have no plans at present to require fast food outlets to use only biodegradable packaging. The concept of degradable plastics that are made from mineral oil (a fossil fuel resource) and specifically designed for disposal with no beneficial recovery potential, runs counter to the aim to increase recycling. In addition, if disposed of in landfill rather than, for example, being composted, biodegradable waste breaks down to release greenhouse gases. It is for this reason that the Landfill Directive requires member states to significantly reduce the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfill.
<P>

<a name="31110w01.html_para3">The Government do support the development of biodegradable plastics from non-fossil sources. The Government-Industry Forum on Non-Food Uses of Crops has concluded that there is a opportunity to produce compostable packaging materials in the UK. Defra is currently drawing up a Non-Food Crops Strategy. A draft is expected to be issued for consultation early in 2004.
<P>

<a name="31110w01.html_para4">The Government are also committed to reducing the incidents of fast food litter. We recently launched a consultation document entitled "Voluntary Code of Practice for the Fast Food Industry&#151;Options for Reducing Fast Food Litter and Waste in the Local Environment". The consultation closes on 30 January 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the steps the Government is taking to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol becomes legally binding.  [136111]

<P>
<a name="31110w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 When the Kyoto Protocol enters into force, the targets it sets will become binding on the parties involved. In order for the Protocol to enter into force it must be signed by at least 55 countries including Annex 1 (developed) countries representing 55 per cent. of developed countries carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. Currently 119 countries representing 44.2 per cent. of emissions have ratified. Following withdrawal of the US from Kyoto in 2001, ratification by Russia is crucial to meet the 55 per cent. target and bring the Protocol into force.
<P>

<a name="31110w01.html_para5">The Prime Minister has written to President Putin twice this year to stress the importance of Russian ratification in the near future, and other ministerial colleagues press their Russian counterparts on the issue whenever appropriate. Officials also meet regularly with Russian counterparts and we have highlighted the significant economic, as well as environmental benefits to Russia if they ratify. We are confident that the Protocol will come into force in 2004.

<P>
<a name="31110w01.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Matters of propriety and conduct such as formal and informal interaction between employees of Defra and commercial lobbyists are covered by the general requirements of the Civil Service Code. The Code, along with further detailed guidance and advice is reproduced in the department's staff handbooks. The Cabinet Office also issued formal guidance on contact with lobbyists and this was made available to ex-MAFF staff via Office Notice and is replicated in the ex-DETR Staff Handbook.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since 1 February 2003, 207 export health certificates have been issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for exports of sheep. 145 of these certificates have been certified to enable exports to take place. Details of the number of certificates issued for exports to each country are set out in the following table. These figures are derived from the computer system used to issue export health certificates and are subject to updating and amendment. Figures for certificates issued by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland (DARDNI) for exports of sheep will follow shortly.

<P>

<a name="31110w01.html_para9">The district council is responsible for funding those projects which it directly promotes but Defra makes available grant aid at a rate of 45 per cent. for capital flood defence projects which meet the Department's criteria and (for those projects only) the council can also apply to the Department for a Supplementary Credit Approval to cover borrowing for the balance of expenditure after grant. The latter results in support from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) through its local authority funding mechanism.
<P>

<a name="31110w01.html_para10">The authority primarily responsible for managing flood risk in England is the Environment Agency. The Agency obtains part of its funding for capital flood defence projects along with other aspects of this activity from county councils and unitary authorities in the form of levies agreed annually by the relevant Flood Defence Committee. However, it is the intention that these levies should be largely replaced from April 2004 by direct funding from Defra as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced to the House on 12 March. An appropriate transfer of resource from ODPM to Defra will take place to reflect this change in funding. A further change we are making is to transfer responsibility from district councils to the Agency of those ordinary watercourses identified as creating the greatest flood risk.

 Information relating to individual premises or farms is held by Defra in strict confidence and, in accordance with the Data Protection Act, cannot be released.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which United Kingdom power stations have been granted derogation from the Large Combustion Plant Directive.  [136025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 So far the revised Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC) has been implemented in the UK only for plants subject to it that were first licensed after July 1987, and it will not apply to other plants until 1 January 2008. Derogations under the Directive for these plants will be a matter for Environment Agency in England and Wales and their equivalents in rest of the United Kingdom. Operators of plants licensed before July 1987 may apply for a limited hours derogation before 30 June 2004. Such a derogation would allow the plant to be exempt from complying with the emission limits or the national emission reduction plan established under the Directive, but it would mean that the plant could operate for no more than 20,000 operational hours between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015. Other applications for derogations would be made nearer the time that the Directive applies.

 The Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC) applies thoughout the United Kingdom. It has already been implemented for plants first licensed after July 1987. The Government have just completed a consultation on proposals to implement this Directive for plants first licensed before July 1987. We are considering the responses to that consultation and the Government will take a decision shortly on the most appropriate implementation approach; whichever approach is adopted would apply in the north-east region.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 30 October 2003]:</i> Most of the enforcement of EC Regulation 2037/2000 is carried out by agencies during the normal course of their duties. There are no estimates available of costs specifically related to this. The Environment Agency does not monitor the costs of implementing individual regulations. Charges are levied for applications and subsistence on waste management licences for storage and treatment sites and the Agency seeks to recover relevant costs, including site supervision.
<P>

<a name="31110w02.html_para1">However, with respect to waste implications of the Regulation, the principal public costs have fallen on local authorities. Local authorities in England received &#163;40 million to assist with the costs of storing and processing refrigerators and freezers in 2002&#150;03. This was in addition to &#163;6 million provided for the period 1 January 2002 to 31 March 2002. Spending Review 2002 included future funding within the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services block which will be distributed through Formula Standard Shares (FSAs).

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2003]:</i> This issue is regulated through the duty of care under section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which requires that the holder of waste: <i>(a)</i> may only pass it on to an authorised person such as a waste management licence holder or a person authorised for transport purposes, for example a registered carrier of controlled waste, and <i>(b)</i> should take all reasonable measures to prevent the fly tipping of waste or the escape of the waste from his control or that of any other person.
<P>

<a name="31110w02.html_para2">Generally, a fridge recycler cannot treat fridges until the recycling plant has been licensed and validated. However, the recycler or another party might properly store such fridges at a licensed storage site, pending treatment. Up until October 2002, the Environment Agency allowed operators to make applications and store fridges pending their determination. A local authority, for instance, could lawfully establish contracts with such operators in the expectation that their fridges would not be treated immediately.

 The assessment of the safety of the use of pesticides in school grounds and playing fields is covered by the specific assessments carried out by the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) when evaluating risks to human health prior to any decision to grant approval for the marketing and use of a pesticide.
<P>

<a name="31110w02.html_para5">There are an extensive range of legislative and administrative controls over the approval, storage, marketing and use of pesticides. Applicants for pesticide approvals must show that their products are effective, humane, and pose no unacceptable risks to human beings, non-target species, or the wider environment before approval will be granted. All pesticide manufacturers are required to provide a wide range of scientific data that are evaluated by scientific experts in the PSD or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). These evaluations are then scrutinised by the independent experts of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP), who make recommendations to Ministers. Only when the Ministers responsible for pesticides, are satisfied on the basis of this expert advice that a pesticide can be used without unacceptable risk to people, animals, and the environment, will approval be given to put it on the market.
<P>

<a name="31110w02.html_para6">As part of the risk assessment process, the exposure of bystanders and persons re-entering the treated area is considered. Specific estimates of potential dermal and inhalation exposure are made and the risk assessed directly.

 The Environment Agency has a duty to secure the proper use of water resources, ensuring that a balance is maintained between the needs of water consumers and the environment. Between 1997 and 2003, household water use remained fairly stable at about 8,600 Megalitres per day, whilst non-household use fell from 4320 to 3823 Megalitres per day. The Government undertakes a range of activities to encourage sustainable water use. The Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations were introduced in 1999 and set the maximum water consumption of certain domestic fittings and appliances. The Envirowise programme provides practical environmental advice to businesses to help reduce their water consumption, and the Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme has recently been extended to include designated water efficient technologies. Water companies have been set annual leakage targets since 1998 and are also under a statutory duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers.

 During the 12 months ending June 2003, the latest period for which figures are available, foreign-registered lorries made 1.4 million trips to Great Britain. However, the number of vehicles was much less than this because individual lorries may make more than one trip.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what regulatory framework protects the public from cold callers; and what plans the Government has for further regulation of the practice of cold calling.  [136598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The regulatory framework for unsolicited direct marketing by phone currently gives individual subscribers the right to opt-out of sales calls if they do not wish to receive them. Under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999 (which will shortly be replaced by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003), no-one may make a sales call to a subscriber who has previously notified them that they do not wish to receive such calls from them, or who has been registered with the Telephone Preference Service for twenty-eight days or more.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para0">Both the Distance Selling Regulations and the Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded away from Business Premises) Regulations provide rights to consumers over distance and doorstep selling. The Distance Selling Regulations require that consumers are provided with clear, comprehensible information about the goods or services offered. Where a business uses cold calling by telephone to sell to consumers, the caller must clearly identify the business they represent and the commercial purpose of the call at the start of a conversation. The Regulations also provide for a seven-day cooling off period (except for certain goods and services which are excluded) in which to withdraw from any contract.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para1">The Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded away from Business Premises) Regulations, commonly known as the "doorstep selling regulations" provide the right to a seven day cooling-off period during which an agreement to buy goods or services worth more than &#163;35 from a trader whose visit is unsolicited may by cancelled, and the same right where a visit by a trader follows an unsolicited doorstep or telephone approach.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para2">The Office of Fair Trading is currently investigating the doorstep selling market under powers provided by the Enterprise Act 2002. The OFT expect to report on their investigation early in the New Year. All recommendations will be carefully considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w06.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt  </B> 
<i>[holding answers 5 November 2003]:</i> Total UK Government expenditure in support of Concorde was &#163;1,358 million gross, &#163;1,062 million net of receipts in prices of the day. These data were compiled from information taken from the appropriation accounts over the period 1956&#150;57 to 1986&#150;87.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para3">Public ownership ceased in 1984 when British Airways became the owner and operator of the UK Concorde fleet. The Government is therefore not in a position to make a decision on the final destinations for each of the Concorde aircraft. That remains a decision for British Airways, the legal owner of the UK Concorde fleet.

 As you are no doubt aware, my Department is currently undertaking a major review of the Consumer Credit Act to bring it up to date so that it continues to provide appropriate consumer protection. A major aspect of this will be the publication in December 2003 of a Consumer Credit White Paper.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para6">The review has been characterised by consultation, and decisions on the content and focus of the White Paper have been made after comprehensive discussions with key stakeholders&#151;industry, consumer groups and enforcement agencies&#151;including the Office of Fair Trading, which has responsibility for monitoring social and commercial developments in the provision of credit.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para7">In addition, my Department has also received comments and opinions during the course of the review from many organisations and individuals&#151;including on the issue of doorstep lending techniques&#151;that have contributed to the development of the proposals that will be set out in the White Paper.

<a name="31110w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 As the hon. Gentleman is aware, my Department is nearing the conclusion of its review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. I have announced that a Consumer Credit White Paper, outlining our proposals will be published in December of this year.
<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para8">Among other things, the White Paper, will set out proposals for reform in two key areas where clear and accessible information for consumers is required, the advertising of consumer credit products and the form and content of credit agreements. Alongside the White Paper we will publish consultation draft legislation to reform the law in these areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the protection given to consumers and their right to financial compensation under <i>(a)</i> the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991, <i>(b)</i> the Estate Agents Act 1979 and <i>(c)</i> other legislation governing housing transactions.  [136797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> The Estate Agents Act 1979 regulates the conduct of estate agents in the buying and selling of property and seeks to ensure that consumers as either buyers or sellers are treated honestly and fairly. The Office of Fair Trading can, if satisfied that a person is unfit to carry on estate agency work, make an order prohibiting that person from carrying on estate agency work. Under the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 it is a criminal offence to make a false or misleading statement about a number of specified matters concerning a property in either written or verbal communication with a prospective client.




<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 25W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31110w06.html_para9">Neither of these Acts provides directly for the payment of compensation to consumers. However, those who suffer a financial loss as a result of malpractice by estate agents or misdescriptions of property may be able to make a claim for compensation in the civil courts. If the estate agent is a member of the Ombudsman for Estate Agents Scheme, consumers may also be able to make a claim for compensation to the ombudsman.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has answered part A and B on 3 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 404W. The Government's strategy with regard to long term carbon dioxide emissions is set out in the Energy White Paper published in February 2003. The Department of Trade and Industry will play its full part in delivering through its own operations the energy efficiency and carob reduction aims set out in the white paper. Forecasts of energy use for future years are not available, but we have committed to reducing CO2 emissions by at least 1 per cent. per annum. From 1 November all new DTI contracts will meet minimum energy efficiency standards, as well as value for money in line with the commitments laid out in the Energy White Paper.
<P>

<a name="31110w07.html_para0">On top of this the Department purchases electricity from renewables sources equating to almost 30 per cent. of its HQ estate requirement compared to a target of 5 per cent. The Department is also continuing to work toward the Sustainable Development in Government green energy targets, which are to be published by the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what changes have taken place in the balance of trade in manufactures with the EU since the UK joined the organisation.  [134097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> The UK's trade with the EU has grown steadily since UK membership in 1973. The value of the deficit in trade of manufacturers with the EU in 1973 was 0.3 per cent. of GDP. This grew to 3.0 per cent of GDP in 1989. In 2002 the deficit was 2.1 per cent. of GDP.
<P>

<a name="31110w07.html_para1">These changes since 1973 in the balance of trade with the EU are smaller than those seen with non-EU countries. Over the same period the trade of manufacturers with non-EU countries has gone from a surplus of 2.3 per cent. in 1973, to a deficit of 1.8 per cent. of GDP in 2002.
<P>

<a name="31110w07.html_para2">The UK's membership and increasing economic integration with the EU has generated considerable opportunities for UK businesses and contributed positively to UK prosperity. This has helped drive the twenty fold increase in UK trade in goods with the EU since 1973, compared to the twelve fold rise in trade in goods with non-EU countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on manufacturing industry in <i>(a)</i> the North West and <i>(b)</i> Lancashire.  [136917]

<a name="31110w08.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Manufacturing in the North West&#151;and especially in Lancashire&#151;remains vitally important to the regional and national economy. It contributes around &#163;19 billion to the region's GDP, accounts for some &#163;14 billion worth of exports and employs around 500,000 people, and its importance is reflected in the Regional Economic Strategy and Manufacturing Strategy. North West manufacturers have identified a number of key issues, including the need for more skilled personnel, greater availability of financial support for business start-ups and better product and process development. The North West Development Agency (NWDA) is piloting closer working with the Small Business Service and the Local Learning and Skills Councils to better address these issues. I recently announced an expansion of the successful Manufacturing Advisory Service in the region. This is an &#163;18 million project supported by an initial investment of &#163;5 million from the NWDA, and aims to deliver assistance to an additional 2,500 businesses in the region, and to achieve productivity increases of &#163;50 million. In addition to benefiting from these initiatives, businesses in Lancashire have access to the services provided by the Lancashire West Partnership Productivity Centre, which helps companies, particularly Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, to achieve significant productivity improvements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w08.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions her Department has held with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about recycling mobile phones; and what steps are being taken to encourage such recycling.  [136810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The recycling of mobile phones is covered by the EC Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The Directive is currently being transposed into UK legislation and this work is being overseen by an inter Departmental team, which includes officials from Defra. Although the recycling of mobile phones has not been discussed specifically, we are aware of a number of initiatives around the UK that take back, refurbish and reuse mobile phones or that recycle them.
<P>

<a name="31110w08.html_para0">The Department welcomes the reuse and recycling of mobile phones through these initiatives, as a useful contribution to sustainable consumption and production, but does not operate a promotional programme specifically aimed at encouraging mobile phone reuse or recycling. We believe that the WEEE Directive will offer the incentive for more schemes of this type to be established, especially since mobile phones contain potentially high value materials such as precious metals and chips.

 As we set out in our White Paper on the IGC, we will seek to ensure value for money for UK taxpayers by working to strengthen discipline and proper accountability in spending from the EU Budget. In this regard, we welcome the European Convention's proposals for a legally binding Multi-Annual Financial Framework and a streamlined annual budget procedure. We also welcome the consensus proposals by ECOFIN Ministers regarding the budgetary provisions of the draft constitutional treaty and we will support these proposals in the IGC.

 The Government are opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. The Ohio authorities are well aware of this.

We continue to monitor his case closely to determine what representations we might make on his behalf, and we will do all we properly can to try to prevent his execution.

 I have received a number of representations about the future of the Defence Fire Service from Members of Parliament, trade unions and members of the Defence Fire Service. These have been in the form of an Adjournment debate, an early-day motion, parliamentary questions, letters and face to face meetings. The future of the Defence Fire Service will be determined by the outcome of the Airfield Support Services Project and the recommendations of Fire Study 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his Department's budget was in the <i>(a)</i> 1998&#150;99 financial year and <i>(b)</i> 2003&#150;04 financial year at 1998&#150;99 prices, excluding expenditure from the contingency reserve.  [136740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The figure for 1998&#150;99 is &#163;22,240 million. That is a cash figure as the Department was controlled on a cash basis until the end of financial year 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="31110w13.html_para1">From 2001&#150;02 onwards, Resource Accounting and Budgeting became the basis for planning and controlling public expenditure. From that year the Defence budget has been set on a Resource basis, which includes accrued costs rather than cash. The Budget figures for 2003&#150;04 are therefore set on a completely different basis to those for 1998&#150;99, and the two sets of figures are not directly comparable. The 2003&#150;04 Budget consists of two separate elements, a Net Resource Cost budget of &#163;31,903 billion and a Capital budget of &#163;6,128 billion.
<P>

<a name="31110w13.html_para2">These figures are at current prices as there is little merit in providing them at the 1998&#150;99 price base.

<a name="31110w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made clear in the debate on Defence Policy on 16 October 2003, Departments have to deal with fluctuating financial pressures while living within their budgets. This year the Ministry of Defence is facing, among other factors, better than expected recruiting and adverse exchange rate movements. The introduction this year of full Resource Accounting and Budgeting has also raised new issues. We are therefore making a range of mostly relatively small adjustments to previous expenditure plans across the Ministry of Defence's budgetary areas. These include reduction in training activities where this is not essential to sustain operations, and re-profiling some spending on new equipments and equipment support. These adjustments do not affect our commitment to operations in Iraq and elsewhere, the net additional costs of which are funded separately.

Inevitably, a larger number of those planned exercises have been cancelled so far this year than is usual: 72 per cent. owing to increased level operational activity, predominantly Operations Telic and Fresco, and 11 per cent. owing to decisions by host nations (other than the UK). A further 11 per cent. have been cancelled after being subsumed into other exercises or re-scheduled for the next financial year.

 We currently expect unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to contribute significantly to future military capability in a number of areas. The WATCHKEEPER programme is on track to deliver a tactical UAV capability from 2006 which will provide UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery and support Network Enabled Capability. To explore the wider operational utility of UAV systems in the joint battlespace, we have established the Joint UAV Experimentation Programme (JUEP). Under the Future Offensive Air System programme, which is currently in its Concept Phase, we expect to look at a potential mix of platforms, including Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs), to meet our future strike capability from around the end of the next decade.

The WFP has agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Zimbabwe which clearly sets out the humanitarian principles governing the identification of beneficiaries for WFP's ongoing emergency operation. Distribution procedures have been agreed with Government which give WFP's implementing partners (NGOs) a clear role in ensuring that donor-funded food aid reaches only those for whom it is intended. UNICEF has similarly robust procedures for ensuring that vaccines are used effectively for protecting vulnerable children from potentially fatal diseases, including tuberculosis, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools in the UK provide breakfast clubs, broken down by education authority.  [136208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not keep a record of the number of breakfast clubs operating in any given area of the country. Breakfast clubs are available in a number of schools, and may form part of a school's study support or childcare provision for which Government funding is available. They can not only provide learning opportunities for pupils, but also help support the needs of working parents by offering food in a safe and stimulating environment for their children.

 In response to one of the recommendations of the Committee on the Lord Chancellor's Department in their report on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) (HC 614&#150;1), I appointed Professor Sir Clive Booth to carry out a review of the skills required by the CAFCASS Board. I will consider his report before taking any decisions on the organisation of the Board.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the <i>(a)</i> need for and <i>(b)</i> costs of enabling children's services in refuges to meet the national standards for under eights day care; and if he will make a statement.  [136394]<P>

 Where refuges offer day care they will need to be registered and inspected by Ofsted, and the national standards for under eights day care would apply. Under an agreed protocol between Ofsted and the Women's Aid Federation of England (WAFE), the unique position of women's refuges is recognised and Ofsted's guidance to its child care inspectors indicates that their special circumstances should be taken into account in applying the national standards.
<P>

<a name="31110w19.html_para6">Local authorities are funded to promote growth in the number of child care places generally and to provide information, training and advice to providers to help them meet the national standards. They work in partnership with refuges where appropriate.

 Social Services departments no longer register and inspect children's homes in their area. Any residential children's homes that are provided by local authorities are registered and inspected by the National Care Standards Commission in the same way as any other private or voluntary organisation providing residential children's homes.

 There is no requirement for the consultation of local residents in relation to a proposed children's home. The NCSC does not distinguish between small children's homes and large children's homes for the purpose of registration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what discussions his Department has had with the Royal National Institute for the Blind on the closure of Condover Hall School;  [134358]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the schools in England which provide the same education services as Condover Hall School for multisensory-disabled children;  [134359]

 There are many schools in England, approved to make provision for pupils with profound and multiple learning difficulties and severe learning

difficulties which are able to provide services for multi-disabled pupils. We understand from the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) that its school, Rushton Hall, provides education services very similar to those provided at Condover Hall. Other schools which provide services for mulit-sensory disabled children, but with different patterns of residential provision are: St. David's Unit at the West of England School, Exeter; and the Royal School for the Blind in Liverpool. Liden Lodge School in the London borough of Wandsworth is also developing support for multi-sensory disabled children.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para0">Official at the DfES have had no discussions to date with Shropshire county council about the closure of Condover Hall School. We do of course stand ready to discuss the matter with any interested party, including local education authorities which currently make use of the school, if asked to do so.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para1">Officials have however asked the RNIB to clarify its plans for the closure of Condover Hall School, and in particular to explain how the RNIB intends to ensure that appropriate and realistic plans for the placement of children currently attending the school are in place. We are currently awaiting a response.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para2">Condover Hall School currently has 34 pupils of statutory school age. There are no primary age pupils. Six pupils are in year 13 and are due to leave school at the end of the summer term 2004. In addition there are 12 young adults, aged from 19&#150;24, in the Adult Education Centre at Condover Hall School.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para3">Condover Hall School currently has 11 teachers, including the Principal and Deputy Headteacher. Nine teachers are employed in the main school and two in the Adult Education Centre. RNIB has stated its intention of exploring opportunities for redeployment of staff currently employed at Condover Hall.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para4">It will be for the home LEA of each child currently placed at Condover Hall to decide, based on the special educational needs of that child, the most suitable placement for them following the closure of the school.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many Connexions personal advisers were allocated to <i>(a)</i> information and advice in schools and colleges, <i>(b)</i> targeted preventative work in schools and colleges and <i>(c)</i> information and advice to those not engaged in education or training in (i) 2002&#150;03 and (ii) 2003&#150;04, in each Connexions region; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2003]:</i> Statistics relating to the specific areas listed in this question are not available from Connexions partnerships. Partnerships are required to show the percentages of total expenditure on both pre-16 and post-16 work. These figures include staff as well as other costs and give some indication of the balance of expenditure on young people during compulsory education and beyond. It can be assumed that the majority of pre-16 expenditure is devoted to young people wholly engaged in learning.




<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 75W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para5">The role of the personal adviser is very broad, covering initial information and advice through to more in-depth support. The specific roles of personal advisers within schools and colleges are determined via a partnership agreement signed between each institution and the partnership. This is a further reason why it is not possible to supply information in the forms requested.

<P>
<a name="31110w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much <i>(a)</i> electricity and <i>(b)</i> other energy his Department has used in each year since 1997 (i) in total and (ii) per square metre; what the projected use is for each of the following years for which forecasts are made; what plans he has to reduce usage; and if he will make a statement.  [135051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 In response to parts <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> parts (i) and (ii) of this question, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by Defra on 3 November 2003 (<i>Official Report</i> column 404W). Targets for future energy use on the Government Estate are being developed under the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para7">Recent and planned changes to our estate due to the rationalisation of the use of our headquarters buildings have meant that we cannot accurately predict our energy consumption in the near future. My Department remains committed to reducing energy use as part of our own sustainable development plan, and as part of the government-wide programme to improve performance in this area.

<P>

 Responses to "Safety and Justice: The Government's Proposals on Domestic Violence" are currently being analysed and will be considered by Ministers shortly. I shall ask for details of those responses to "Safety and Justice" which have a bearing on our proposals for improving services to children and young people, as set out in the Green Paper "Every Child Matters", to be considered together with the responses received to that Green Paper.

<i>[holding answer 28 October 2003]:</i> The Government set out in the Green Paper 'Every Child Matters' our intention to legislate for the appointment of a Children's Commissioner as a new voice for all children and young people, especially the disadvantaged. The Commissioner would ensure that the views of children and young people are heard, and report to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on progress against the outcomes for children set out in the Green Paper. Further details on the remit and responsibilities of the Commissioner will be made available in the light of the consultation which runs until 1 December.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2003]:</i> Cross-departmental issues relating to domestic violence, including those affecting children and young people, are overseen by the Inter-Ministerial Group for Domestic Violence chaired by Baroness Scotland of Asthal. Baroness Ashton of Upholland represents the Department for Education and Skills on the Inter-Ministerial Group.
<P>

<a name="31110w20.html_para8">When necessary, issues relating to domestic violence and children and young people will be considered by the children, young people and family services Cabinet Committee MISC9 chaired by the Chancellor. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills has Cabinet-level responsibility for both policy and delivery of services for children and young people and is a member of MISC9. He is also chair of the Cabinet sub-Committee MISC9(D) which is responsible for ordinating the delivery of services to children, young people and families. I am a member of both MISC9 and MISC9(D).

<P>
<a name="31110w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the role of coursework in the GCSE examination and <i>(b)</i> the International GCSE qualification developed by Edexcel exam board.  [136709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Coursework can be a valuable way of assessing achievement that cannot readily be demonstrated in an examination. The setting and assessment of coursework can help teaching and learning processes by measuring and encouraging the development of important skills not easily tested in timed written examinations, like the ability to tackle extended pieces of written work. The 14&#150;19 Reform Group is considering the place of coursework in the 14&#150;19 curriculum.
<P>

<a name="31110w21.html_para0">The concept of an IGCSE is not a new one. The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate has offered this type of examination since 1986. IGSEs

have been designed as qualifications primarily for overseas candidates, with some take up in the independent sector. Unlike GCSEs they are not approved for use in maintained schools and are not subject to any regulatory mechanisms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w21.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in annex D of his Department's policy guidance note, School and local education authority funding in 2003&#150;04, what increase in the education formula spending was indicated for local education authority budget forecasters to use for 2004&#150;05; and how this was determined.  [136886]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department's guidance note, sent to local education authorities on 10 December 2003, included advice to authorities to help them in forecasting their budget over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, so they could set indicative three-year budgets for schools.
<P>

<a name="31110w21.html_para1">Based on the outcome of the 2002 Spending Review, the guidance noted that Education Formula Spending was planned to increase between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 by 5.5 per cent. in cash, and approximately 6.0 per cent. per pupil, based on pupil number estimates from the Department's pupil projection model. It also noted that the floor and ceiling arrangements, introduced in 2003&#150;04, would continue to operate in future years.
<P>

<a name="31110w21.html_para2">The guidance explicitly recognised that the Department is unable to provide firm estimates of EFSS increases for future years for each authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what changes he has made to the work of educational psychologists in schools by grouping schools together; and if he will make a statement.  [134991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Educational psychologists are employed by local education authorities. Decisions on their deployment and use are therefore matters for LEAs to determine in the light of local circumstances and available resources. The grouping of schools in federations should not significantly affect the role or responsibilities of educational psychologists.
<P>

<a name="31110w21.html_wqn3"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many educational psychologists are employed by each local education authority in London; and <i>(a)</i> how many were employed by, <i>(b)</i> how many retired <i>(c)</i> how many were recruited in and <i>(d)</i> what the vacancy rates were in each local authority in London for each of the last six years.

 Ofsted registers and inspects pre-schools, day nurseries and childminders having regard to national standards set by the Department for Education and Skills. Revised national standards for under eights day care and childminding came into force in September 2003. For pre-school and nursery settings the standards specify that there is at least one member of staff with a current first aid training certificate on the premises or on outings at any one time, and that the first aid qualification includes training in first aid for infants and young children. The revisions make it clear that this training has to be consistent with any guidance issued by the Secretary of State to local authorities, who are responsible for making training available to settings.

 Local education authorities which allow licensed deficits for schools have various obligations specified in their schemes, including the maintenance of limits on the repayment periods and adherence to a maximum proportion of total school balances used to underwrite the deficits. None of these obligations will be directly affected by transitional support grant announced on 29 October, except insofar as use of such grant is likely to produce less pressure on local resources since the transitional grant is to be targeted specifically at those schools facing the greatest difficulty in bringing their budgets back into balance, on the basis of costed plans produced by those schools.

<a name="31110w23.html_para0">Emergency contraception is only provided to young people under 16 under medical supervision. This includes the supply by other health professionals, such as school nurses and community pharmacists, working to PGDs. A Patient Group Direction is a written instruction for the supply or administration of medicines to groups of patients without an individualised doctor's prescription.
<P>

<a name="31110w23.html_para1">All health professionals providing emergency contraception are trained to ensure that young women are informed about and encouraged to visit local services that provide regular forms of contraception and condoms to protect against sexually transmitted infections.
<P>

<a name="31110w23.html_para2">Services aimed at improving early access to emergency contraception should be seen in the context of a much wider programme of the Government's Teenage Pregnancy and Sexual Health and HIV Strategies. This includes helping young people to resist pressure to have early sex through improved sex and relationship education, improving knowledge of risks of unprotected sex, increasing early uptake of contraceptive and sexual health advice by sexually active young people and involving parents and the wider community.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will <i>(a)</i> list the criteria that were used to determine which authorities should receive additional transitional funding for 2004&#150;05, <i>(b)</i> set out the basis on which the amounts were calculated and <i>(c)</i> make a statement on why Lancashire did not receive an allocation of these monies.  [136890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Details of the transitional support package for 2004&#150;05, including details of the formula for calculating which local education authorities will be eligible, will be published at the time of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement later this month.
<P>

<a name="31110w23.html_para5">On 29 October the Government published indicative figures for the targeted grant in 2004&#150;05, which have been placed in the Library of the House. These assumed that grant would be available to authorities whose increase in Education Formula Spending and relevant DfES grant between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05 would otherwise be less than 12 per cent. per pupil. The increase in Lancashire LEA is expected to be above 12 per cent. per pupil over the relevant period, which means it would not be eligible for the targeted grant.
<P>

<a name="31110w23.html_para6">However, if Lancashire or any other LEA is able to put forward a compelling case that additional, transitional funds are needed in the short term&#151;above and beyond those already available to the LEA&#151;my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be prepared to consider bringing forward grant payments from my Department, so that the LEA will have funds available in 2004&#150;05 for this purpose, with the expectation of a consequential reduction to what they will receive in future years. The maximum amount that might be made available in this way would be &#163;300,000 per authority, or 0.2 per cent. of the authority's total education resources in 2004&#150;05, if that is higher. For Lancashire, 0.2 per cent. of its education resources would be over &#163;1.2 million.

authorities next year, so that the total increase in education resources for every authority, over the two year period between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05, will be a minimum of 12 per cent. per pupil.
<P>

<a name="31110w23.html_para7">Final allocations of targeted transitional grant will be announced at the time of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement. The indicative allocations published on 29 October made no allocation to Surrey, whose total increase in education resources between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05 was estimated to be above 12 per cent. per pupil. A list of indicative allocations has been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w23.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether after the introduction of variable tuition fees in 2006, those higher education institutions wishing <i>(a)</i> to charge fees not exceeding the current standard flat-rate fees and <i>(b)</i> wishing to charge top-up fees for only some of their courses will be required to conclude a (i) full and (ii) partial access agreement.  [136707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w23.html_spnew5"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 As we set out in Widening participation in higher education, any higher education provider wishing to charge variable fees for any of its courses above the standard rate from 2006, will need to have an access agreement approved by the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). Institutions which do not charge fees above the standard rate for any of their courses will not be required to have an access agreement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w23.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of the public expenditure impact of including the income of cohabiting partners and new spouses in the assessment of residual income for tuition fee exemption from 2004&#150;05; and what estimate he has made of the net change in the numbers paying full tuition fees which will result from the change.  [137134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w23.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We estimate that the change resulting from including the income of cohabiting partners and spouses will produce steady state savings of approximately &#163;30 million on funding of tuition fees by 2007&#150;08. The change is to be introduced for new students entering HE from 2004&#150;05 onwards.
<P>

<a name="31110w23.html_para8">This estimate has been derived using income-data from a number of sources and is indicative. Our best indication is that it could account for an increase of approximately three percentage points in the proportion of dependent students paying full tuition fees. We cannot give a precise estimate at this stage since some families will benefit from other aspects of the new household income definition, such as the new &#163;1000 disregard for children financially dependent on the household.

 It will be for universities to decide how to invest their income in teaching and in research.

 The Youth Justice Board (YJB) has commissioned Manchester University to undertake research at six sites, four of which are young offenders' institutions, into the prevalence of mental ill health, including Attention Deficit Hyper Activity Disorder (ADHD), and effective mental health practice. The YJB has developed a Mental Health Screening Tool and guidance on effective mental health practice. It is also developing a mental health awareness training pack for use by teams working with young people who come into contact with the criminal justice system.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the reasons for trends in robbery in Nottinghamshire between December 2001 and 2002.  [136245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w25.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There was an increase in robbery across England and Wales in 2001&#150;02, which occurred principally in urban areas. Nottinghamshire was one of the areas affected. According to Home Office research, the increase in robbery over this period is attributable to several factors, in particular, the rise in the number of young people robbing other young people allied to the sharp increase in mobile phone ownership providing easy targets for offenders. While Nottinghamshire was not one of the areas that the research drew data from, it aimed to consider a sufficiently large sample to gain an impression of the nature of robbery in different areas of England and Wales. On 14 October 2002, the Home Office published figures for the first six months of the Street Crime Initiative (April to September 2002), which showed that there had been 19 per cent. more robberies in Nottinghamshire in the six-month period April to September 2002 compared to the same period in 2001. By the end of the year, the increase had reduced to 3 per cent. (comparing the 12-month period with the previous year).

 The Home Office Statistical Bulletin, "Crime in England and Wales: Quarterly Update to June 2003", published on 16 October 2003, shows that recorded robbery fell by an estimated seven per cent. in April to June 2003 compared with the same period in the previous year. This quarterly update does not give figures for individual forces. Data for individual forces will be available in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin for the financial year 2003&#150;04, expected to be published in the summer of 2004.

 General information about the National Probation Service's (NPS) statutory victim contact scheme is already available on the probation service website at www.probation.homeoffice.gov.uk and in the Home Office leaflet: "Release of Prisoners: Information for victims of sexual or other violent offences". The leaflet is free and is available in a range of languages and is given, by the police, to victims who are eligible for the statutory scheme. The leaflet also contains information about the Prison Service Victims' Helpline and the services available from Victim Support. More detailed information about probation service work with victims can be obtained from local probation area offices. There are no plans to develop or publish a separate list of services for victims of crime available from either service as this information is already in the public domain.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what funding is available for drug addiction treatment of <i>(a)</i> prisoners and <i>(b)</i> ex-prisoners in 2003&#150;04; and what change has been recorded in reoffending rates for those who complete their treatment.  [136057]<P>

<a name="31110w26.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04 &#163;136,617,000 has been allocated to provide drug treatment for prisoners in England and Wales. It is not possible to differentiate between funding provided to treat ex-prisoners and others who access treatment in the community. The following table details the funding allocations for treating prisoners and those leaving custody. Research evidence shows that intensive drug treatment linked to good aftercare can result in reductions in reoffending of upto 11 per cent. compared with expected levels of offending.

<P>
<a name="31110w26.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Sexual offences are significantly under-reported to the authorities. Police and Government action to support the victims of sexual assaults is likely to have increased the number of such incidents being brought to the attention of the police and therefore recorded by them. The introduction of the new National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) for all forces in April 2002 has further increased the recording rate because it requires the police to record all reported offences even if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute. Trends in the number of recorded sexual offences does not, therefore, necessarily reflect the real experience of such crimes. The Government are taking action on a variety of fronts to reduce the actual incidence of rape.

The group has met on a number of occasions but has not concluded its deliberations. It would be premature to speculate on the outcome but a final or interim report will be sought early next year.

 The Prison Service entered into a contract with EDS in 2000 for the provision of a fully managed information technology and telephony service. Payment is based on the number of personal computers supported under the contract. The cost of the IT element only of the contract, together with the cost of non-IT activities, amounted to &#163;32,094,111 in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;47,471,074 in 2002&#150;2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes have been made to the criteria for allocating inmates to HMP Leyhill; and if he will make a statement.  [136450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w27.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 4 November 2003]:</i> Leyhill prison is an open training prison. Sentenced prisoners may be assessed for categorisation and allocation to open conditions either on initial categorisation following sentencing or during their sentence following a review of their security category.




<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 106W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31110w27.html_para5">Initial categorisation procedures consider: current offence, sentence length, previous offending, previous escapes or absconds and previous breaches of non-custodial disposals. For prisoners indicated for category D, consideration is also given to issues such as: current drug use: any previous breaches of bail; the circumstances of the offence and vulnerability to bullying or coercion.
<P>

<a name="31110w27.html_para6">Prisoners have their security category reviewed at regular intervals. Prisoners must be able to demonstrate that their risk is reduced sufficiently to warrant recategorisation to conditions of lower security. Where category D is indicated, consideration is given to any other issues which might suggest that the prisoner is otherwise unsuitable for open conditions.
<P>

<a name="31110w27.html_para7">Revised initial categorisation and recategorisation forms were introduced in April 2003 and their use is being monitored. However, the procedures detailed above remain unchanged. No changes have been made locally to the acceptance criteria at Leyhill prison.

<P>
<a name="31110w28.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of reported street crime involved the theft of mobile phones in each of the London boroughs in 2002&#150;03.  [136473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w28.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Home Office does not centrally collect or collate national statistics on the numbers of mobile phone thefts as mobile phone theft is not a separate crime category. Mobile phone theft crime figures are included within the crime categories of robbery, snatch theft and theft from the person.
<P>

<a name="31110w28.html_para0">Home Office Research ("Mobile Phone Theft", HORS 235) published in January 2002 estimated that mobile phones were stolen in 28 per cent. of all robberies in 2000&#150;01. The Metropolitan Police Service estimate that around 50 per cent. of street crime in London involved the theft of a mobile phone.

[136003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w28.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 In the last five years a total of 3,269 trainee probation officers have been appointed with a further 159 due to start in January 2004 as part of the 2003 recruitment process. This will make a total of 3,374.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his Department's initiatives for tackling persistent offenders.  [136244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w29.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Persistent Offender Scheme came into effect in April 2003. It is an obligatory component of Local Criminal Justice Boards' action plans to increase the number of offences brought to justice, aimed at targeting a small group of prolific offenders who are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. Areas have devised their own premium service protocols which include elements of proactive policing, improved investigations and case management, priority court listings, and strategies for rehabilitation. As well as targeting core persistent offenders, who are over 18 and have been convicted of six or more recordable offences in the last year, as part of their wider crime reduction strategies areas are also using the scheme flexibly to target persistent offenders defined on the basis of local intelligence.




<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 110W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31110w29.html_para0">The scheme is supported by an information system which is shared between criminal justice agencies, enabling persistent offenders to be tracked as their cases progress through the criminal justice system, and attrition points in the system to be identified and targeted for intervention.
<P>

<a name="31110w29.html_para1">In addition, the Government have given the courts new secure remand and tagging powers for 12 to 16-year-olds who repeatedly offend on bail, funded the Youth Justice Board's intensive supervision and surveillance programmes for the most prolific young offenders and renewed its commitment to maintain the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders at or below 71 days.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w29.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Death in-service benefits include a lump sum ranging from a death grant for all in-service deaths to a death gratuity for any death as a result of an injury in the execution of duty, where death occurs within one year of the injury. The lump sum death grant is twice the annual value of the officer's pensionable pay. The death grant will be the lesser of either five times the annual value of the officer's pensionable pay or four times his total remuneration during the last 12 months as an officer and his or her total pension contributions for that period.
<P>

<a name="31110w29.html_para7">These lump sums are payable in addition to a widow or widower's pension and any other dependant's benefits where applicable. The surviving spouse's pension will range from half the officer's pension, had he or she been medically retired and not died in service, to a special award of 45 per cent. of the officer's average pensionable pay where death is as a result of an injury in the execution of duty. The special award will be augmented to 50 per cent. where death occurred in particular circumstances such as in the course of trying to save another's life.

 The police performance monitors, which were published on 21 October 2003 are not league tables, but show performance across key areas of policing for each force in England and Wales, and show a comparison with similar forces.

A team of Evaluators, from London School of Economics (LSE) and the University of Kent, are preparing a report on the project but this will not be with the Home Office till the end of December. However, from 1 November 2003 visual recording may be undertaken on a discretionary basis and it is a matter for each force (including those not involved in the pilot) to decide which types of cases should be recorded in this way. Police officers have been told that regard should still be paid to Code F (Visual Recording of Suspect Interviews) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, when such interviews are undertaken.

<P>
<a name="31110w30.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Reducing the rate of self-inflicted deaths in prison establishments is an essential part of the Prison Service's decency agenda and a priority for Ministers. The three-year safer custody strategy to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons, implemented from April 2001, is currently under review. Account is being taken of emerging findings from practitioners and in-house and external researchers, and the views of a wide range of practitioners and external interests. I will be announcing the results of this work and next steps in spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="31110w30.html_para4">A team from the University of Cambridge is measuring the impact of the Safer Locals Programme (essentially in six pilot establishments) on the quality of prison life, and investigating possible links between these measures and rates of suicide and self-harm. Interim results indicate that the focus of the strategy on 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 116W</I><P>
the early period in custody, on local prisons, on high-risk prisoners with mental health and drug problems in particular, are the right ones.
<P>

<a name="31110w30.html_para5">A team from Manchester and London Universities is also evaluating elements of the Safer Locals Programme, particularly a workstream called the Care of At-Risk Prisoners project, health care provision, and detoxification services. Additionally, researchers from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science were commissioned to evaluate the impact of safer cells on suicide and self-harm. The evaluation included observations, interviews and focus groups with prisoners and staff in six prisons. The report, presented in August 2003, concluded that the safer cells programme has much to commend it and recommended that the programme continue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of reasons other than overcrowding for the suicide rate in prisons.  [136258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31110w30.html_spnew3"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The rate of self-inflicted deaths in prisons was 147.4 per 100,000 prisoners (at the end of 2002&#150;03). This high rate appears to be mainly a product of two factors: greater throughput of prisoners at a time of population increase and greater (but not easily quantifiable) numbers of prisoners in high risk categories. The effects of overcrowding and throughput include more prisoners being located further from home, thereby affecting their access to familial/social support; prisons handling large and variable numbers of prisoners, often arriving late in the day, which reduces the time staff can spend with individual prisoners on care and risk assessment; and an increase in the length of time prisoners are locked in their cells, rather than engaged in purposeful activity.
<P>

<a name="31110w30.html_para6">Emerging research from the evaluation of the Prison Service's safer custody strategy suggests that the suicide rate in an establishment may correlate with levels of psychological distress. This distress is affected by prisoners' perceptions of safety, their experiences of entering custody and their level of psychological, emotional and physical well-being upon entry to the establishment.
<P>

<a name="31110w30.html_para7">The general prison population contains a very large number of prisoners who, when they enter custody, are struggling to cope with a wide range of difficult issues, including drug and/or alcohol abuse, family background and relationship problems, social disadvantage or isolation, previous sexual or physical abuse, and mental health problems. Studies suggest that 90 per cent. of all prisoners have shown evidence of at least one of the following: personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence. These factors increase their likelihood of self-harm. It has been found that 27 per cent. of men and 44 per cent. of women on remand report having attempted suicide in their lifetime.

 Immigration officers have powers of arrest and search under the Immigration Act 1971 as amended by Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. These powers will not be superseded by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) which provides for the regulated use by public authorities of specific

<P>
<a name="31110w30.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Liability for payments under the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 (RDA) rests with police authorities. Police authorities normally pay claims made under the RDA from within their existing resources. Police authorities may request special grant from the Home Office to help meet the cost of payments made under the RDA. There have been no payments of special grant for this purpose since 1997.
<P>

<a name="31110w30.html_para10">Information about the settlement by police authorities of claims made under the RDA has not been regularly collected centrally. The 'Consultation Document on Options for the Review of the RDA', which was published in July, estimated that &#163;928,000 had been paid by police authorities since 1995. This is not a comprehensive figure as some RDA claims are still under negotiation by police authorities.

 We need effective policing arrangements in all areas, urban and rural.

North Yorkshire Police receive over &#163;2 million or 6.7 per cent. of the fund. I understand that this has been used to fund 60 additional officers as well as additional scenes of crime staff and support staff. North Yorkshire now has 37 Community Support Officers who patrol across the force area.

<P>
<a name="31110w32.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Government recognise that the intimidation of witnesses is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Witness intimidation in criminal proceedings is an offence under section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and intimidation in civil proceedings is an offence under the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. The Home Office has advised the police to take immediate action against offenders in cases of intimidation or harassment of witnesses.

<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para0">The Government published "Tackling Witness Intimidation&#151;An Outline Strategy" on 15 May 2003. It was issued to all Local Criminal Justice Boards and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships and is available on Criminal Justice System online. A copy has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para1">The police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the judiciary have all received specialist training to help them be more responsive to the needs of intimidated witnesses. The guidance on anti-social behaviour orders stresses the importance of offering support to witnesses and victims when applications for such orders are made.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para2">There needs to be adequate protection for witnesses in the courtroom to ensure that they can give their best evidence. Most courts now have separate waiting rooms for witnesses, reducing the possibility of their coming into contact with the defendant, or those closely acquainted with him or her, and thus reducing the risk of intimidation. Increased funding for Victim Support has enabled its Witness Service to be extended to all Crown court centres and magistrates courts in England and Wales. This means that there should always be someone at court to support witnesses who may feel intimidated or worried.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para3">The Government have also introduced a range of special measures to assist intimidated witnesses to give their evidence in court, including the use of TV links, screens around the witness box and clearing the public 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 123W</I><P>
gallery so that evidence can be given in private. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 provides the legislative framework for these measures and a phased implementation programme began on 24 July 2002.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para4">In exceptional cases, where there are real and substantial grounds for fear and the Crown would not be able to proceed without the witness's evidence, the judge may allow the identity of a credible witness to be concealed entirely from the defendant. In taking this decision, the court must balance the need for protection of the witness against the risk of unfairness to the defendant and must satisfy itself that the interests of the accused would not be unduly prejudiced.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para5">These court-based measures are complemented by community-based measures, ensuring that support is available to witnesses where they live. Co-ordinated action by a number of agencies, for example in carrying out an initial risk assessment of a witnesses' vulnerability to intimidation, is key.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para6">The Government, in conjunction with the Housing Corporation and the Mayor of London, are today launching a scheme which will give intimidated witnesses the option of fast track relocation within the social housing sector. The Government recognise that, while the aim should be that perpetrators of crime and anti-social behaviour should be those who are moved, there will be instances where the risk to the witness is so great that this option needs to be available.

<a name="31110w32.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Reconviction is used as a proxy measure for reoffending.

<a name="31110w32.html_para8"><i>Judges and Magistrates</i>
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para9">My Department continues to work closely with the Judicial Studies Board (JSB) to develop training for judges and magistrates that takes account of the growing body of knowledge about domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para10">All judges on first appointment to part-time judicial office and all judges newly authorised to hear family cases are required to attend a relevant JSB residential induction seminar. Both full-time and part-time judges attend residential continuation seminars every three years in each jurisdiction they exercise. All induction and continuation seminars include discussion of domestic violence issues. Family law induction and continuation seminars include such issues in virtually every session within the seminar programmes.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para11">Many judges in addition attend locally organised seminars. In 2002 the topic for the one-day Circuit Criminal Seminars, which are attended by all full and part-time judges sitting in the Crown court, was Domestic Violence.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para12">The training of Magistrates is the statutory responsibility of individual Magistrates courts committees. Recently, the JSB in conjunction with the Magistrates Association produced a training package for magistrates, specifically on domestic violence. The objectives for the pack are that by the end of the course delegates will: be able to define domestic violence; recognise when domestic violence features in a case; and describe how that recognition of domestic violence will impact on the conduct and disposal of a case and the treatment of any vulnerable individuals involved.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para13">The programme of training for trainers began at the end of October. Magistrates courts committees will be encouraged to train their magistrates and legal advisers as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para14"><i>Expert Witnesses</i>
<P>

<a name="31110w32.html_para15">The Home Office supports, and part funds, the work of the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP). The CRFP has rigorous procedures to ensure those persons admitted to the register have appropriate training, experience and expertise to act as experts. Currently there is no training, or requirement for training, in domestic violence involved in CRFP registration as it is not of direct relevance to the majority of registered practitioners.

<a name="31110w32.html_para17">CAFCASS's training programme for Family Court Advisors includes a module on domestic violence. This will be put into operation for the first time in November and December 2003. CAFCASS is also currently developing a policy on domestic violence, which will

 In Lancashire, as elsewhere, it is our intention to make better use of the joint estate (Court Service and Magistrates' Court Service). Where county court operations can be moved from unsatisfactory buildings into more modern magistrates courts they will be, so improving facilities for users and making efficiency savings. It is too early to say specifically where in Lancashire this will happen until feasibility studies have been completed but Chorley may be affected. The Lancashire Magistrates' Courts Committee has no plans to close any of the courts for which it is responsible.

<i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> Information about the number of current residents in secure mental hospitals who have been assessed as having Asperger's syndrome is not available. However, in 1999 the National Autistic Society published the results of a study of 1,305 residents of the three special (now high security) hospitals in England, which was funded by the Department through the Section 64 scheme of grants to voluntary organizations.

<i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> We have no plans to commission an inquiry into services for people with Asperger's syndrome in secure hospitals. However, services for people who have Apserger's syndrome have been included in the specialised services national definition set (SSNDS), with a view to improving the collaborative commissioning arrangements necessary to provide them with a seamless service. Inclusion in the SSNDS provides a basis for service reviews and strategic planning and enables commissioners to establish a broad base-line position and make initial comparisons on activity and spend.

 In England, primary care trusts are responsible for oral health promotion and currently they attach particular importance to ensuring that oral health is covered in initiatives like Sure Start, health action zones and healthy living centres.
<P>

<a name="31110w34.html_para2">In August 2001, to complement this work, we launched our "Brushing for Life" scheme which targets families with young children in the 31 areas where dental decay is highest. There are currently 32 schemes running nationally. When carrying out developmental checks, health visitors demonstrate good tooth brushing practice and give the families a free pack containing a tube of fluoridated toothpaste, a toothbrush and a leaflet on oral hygiene. In 2003, the "Brushing for Life" scheme has been extended to Sure Start schemes in order to ensure more parents are given the opportunity to improve the oral health of their children, particularly in more deprived areas of the country.

We have set a national target to reverse this trend and, in July, published a Programme for Action. The latest available data shows that while the gap between the infant mortality rate for routine and manual groups and the whole population widened slightly, there was no significant change for male or female life expectancy for the same period. This data refers chiefly to the period before targets were set. We will be publishing a first annual report on health inequalities in 2004.

Non-compliance covers a wide variety of conditions, including that which is just below standard. Therefore, the figures do not indicate levels of risk. Trusts make every effort to remedy any concerns from local enforcement bodies as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the very small numbers of injuries and deaths arising as a result of fires and reportable health and safety incidents in NHS hospitals in England, despite the very high numbers of people who use healthcare premises.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The Pension Schemes Registry (PSR) is not designed or intended to provide a comprehensive or continuous statistical record of the status of schemes. The PSR registers schemes for tracing purposes and collects the levy from pension schemes, including those in the process of winding-up. New scheme data are being reported to the PSR on a continuous basis. Therefore, the figures are subject to continuous revision. When a scheme has changed status, the previous status of the scheme is not recorded on the registry. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify OPRA of any status change. The data in the table do not include any schemes that may have changed their benefit type (money purchase, salary related or hybrid) but not their status code (from open to closed).<P>

2. A closed scheme is a registerable scheme to which no new members may be admitted, but existing members can continue to make contributions and accrue benefits. The data above do not contain any schemes that are either frozen, winding up or wound up.<P>

3. The data in the table relate to private sector occupational pension schemes. In addition to data on occupational schemes, the registry also collects data on personal pension and public sector schemes. These schemes are not included in the table<P>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's initial estimate is that between 7,500 and 8,500 Home Inspectors will be needed to carry out home condition reports but this figure may be revised in the light of consultations and further work with the industry. Research indicates that there is a substantial pool of 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2003 : Column 156W</I><P>
labour that could meet this potential demand, including the 4,500 people who are carrying out residential surveys now.
<P>

<a name="31110w40.html_para11">Home Inspectors will have to be certified and trained to National Occupational Standards. An awarding body will be appointed by the certification scheme to accredit the training courses and qualifications for home inspectors. Academic institutions, professional institutions and major employers are likely to run courses and training will take account of differences in prior knowledge and skills. Work on this has already started and we expect this will accelerate once the proposed new legislation is in place. Any requirement for sellers to provide a home condition report will not be brought into force until the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is satisfied that there are sufficient trained Home Inspectors in place.

 If the same grant floors had been retained then the full cost of the floor would have to be entirely financed via the scaling factor for all authorities above the floor. The factors by which grant increases were scaled back would have changed from approximately 0.94 to 0.84 for education authorities; from approximately 0.90 to 0.53 for police and fire authorities; and from approximately 0.95 to 0.64 for shire districts.

 National policy for England is set out in Circular 1/97 on Planning Obligations (January 1997) which sets out guidelines on the use of planning obligations. Broadly, it requires planning obligations to be: necessary; relevant; directly related to proposed development; fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development; and reasonable in all other respects. The Circular only gives a general indication of what might be reasonable, since establishing the relationship between a particular planning benefit and an individual development must be a matter of judgement, exercised in the light of local circumstances, rather than an issue for detailed national prescription.

 The Survey of English Housing has for several years asked tenants about what happened to the deposit for the tenancy they had left most recently. The survey has consistently reported that up to 20 per cent. of tenants considered that the withholding of their deposits, either in part or in full, had to some extent been unreasonable. These figures are, of course, based on tenant perception, and on any objective test, such as independent adjudication, a lower figure of unjustified withholding might be expected.
