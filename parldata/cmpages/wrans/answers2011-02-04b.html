<i> [holding answer 1 February 2011]:</i> As at end March 2010, 5,064 civil service posts had been relocated from London and the South East to the North West, of which 41 went to Warrington. There are currently no plans to relocate further posts, however relocation of Government staff outside of London and the South East continues to be considered amongst other options to deliver the savings set out at the spending review and increase the efficiency of the Government's estate.</p>

As a first step, the Government Property Unit will set up pilot PVs for the central London and Bristol office estate from 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="110204w0001.htm_para10"><a name="11020450000157">The current spending controls on government property will result in a reduction in both the cost and size of the estate. As at September 2010, the moratorium had resulted in estate cost reductions of over £18 million and is on track to deliver £49 million by the end of the financial year. As the estate reduces in size, retained buildings will be utilised more intensively wherever possible. This reduction of property in London and elsewhere could see posts being relocated to areas close to London, and where there is a strong business case, to other parts of the country.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 February 2011]:</i> The only cost that can be directly attributed to the US Navy and German Kriegsmarine ASW assets is for fuel. Fuel is supplied to the US under a reciprocal agreement which provides for each nation's assets to be refuelled by the other. The cost of fuel provided for German assets is invoiced and recovered to the Ministry of Defence. The value of fuel provided to US and German assets from RAF Kinloss to date in 2010-11 was £301,000 and £10,000 respectively. No figures are currently available for 2011-12.</p>

 We will put in place the necessary legislation to implement the provisions of the EU Illegal Timber (Due Diligence) Regulation in the United Kingdom. The regulation prohibits the first-placing of illegal timber on the EU market, which will restrict its purchase, possession and sale down the supply chain. In accordance with the provisions of the regulation, we will implement the EU Illegal Timber (Due Diligence) Regulation by 3 March 2013. This underlines our commitment to eliminating illegal timber from the UK market.</p>

We will work closely with other countries to ensure that future meetings on racism at the UN address all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, and do not become platforms for the dissemination of deeply offensive anti-Semitic viewpoints.

It also showed Iran had produced 3,183 kg of 3.5% low enriched uranium and 33 kg of 20% low enriched uranium, a significant step towards weapons grade enrichment, and was still failing to address the wide range of concerns over possible military dimensions of its programme.</p>

The P5+1 put forward substantial ideas technical proposals for how Iran could begin to build confidence in its nuclear programme but Iran refused to discuss these ideas or engage further until the P5+1 agreed to certain pre-conditions. The P5+1 were united in their view that these pre-conditions were unacceptable and therefore no further talks have been scheduled. However, the P5+1 reaffirmed their commitment to pursuing a diplomatic solution and that the door to further dialogue remained open.

In addition, our high commission in Kampala remains in close touch with civil society groups that are campaigning for LGBT rights in Uganda, to whom they have offered their support.</p>

 In my statement on the tragic murder of David Kato released last week, I urged the Ugandan authorities to investigate this crime thoroughly and bring the perpetrators to justice. Our high commission in Kampala has reinforced these points in discussion with the Ugandan authorities. I understand that the Ugandan police force has arrested two men in connection with Mr Kato's murder and is continuing its investigations.</p>

 The UK contribution to the UN regular budget is assessed as an overall percentage of that budget. For 2010, 2011, and 2012 the UK contribution is 6.604%. For 2007, 2008 and 2009, the UK contribution was 6.642%. This percentage contribution is the same for all parts of the UN regular budget, and does not vary by agency, programme or body.</p>

The budget is decided on a two year cycle and is split into 37 sections, or fascicles. Allocations for 2006 and 2007, 2008 and 2009, and 2010 and 2011 are presented as follows.</p>

 Capital investment proposals in the national health service are considered on a case by case basis and assessed against key approval criteria set down by the Department and Treasury. Each proposal is subject to a value for money test which compares the risk adjusted, whole life costs and benefits of a public capital funded option (known as the Public Sector Comparator) with one provided under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). This involves a private sector consortium raising finance either through a loan from a bank or from the capital markets (bonds).</p>

So in general terms, if the cost of this premium is lower to the public sector than the quantified value of the risk retained under the Public Sector Comparator, this, combined with any efficiency gains achieved in the PFI option, will determine if the PFI proposal represents better value for money and can be approved to go ahead.</p>

 The impact assessment for the Health and Social Care Bill (published on 19 January 2011) includes a partial assessment of factors affecting the costs incurred by national health service bodies and private providers, respectively, in delivering health services for NHS patients. The key conclusion is that some of these factors appear to increase costs for NHS bodies relative to private providers, whilst other factors appear to increase costs for private providers relative to NHS bodies. However, based on the information held centrally, it has not been possible to determine, on balance, whether NHS bodies or private providers of NHS services are systematically advantaged or disadvantaged relative to the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="110204w0002.htm_para5"><a name="11020450000932">Additional data collection and analysis would be needed to quantify some of the key factors, for example, to reflect the fact that private providers tend to treat less complex cases. With regard to corporation tax, however, this would not affect the accounting cost of providing NHS services, because it is a tax on profit, and would not affect the prices paid for NHS services under the national tariff.</p>

Among the many review recommendations was one to establish a strategic stockpile of up to 250,000 tonnes, managed by the Highways Agency, to provide a strategic reserve of salt for England through the 2010-11 winter season.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="110204w0002.htm_para24"><a name="11020450001213">The strategic salt is held at a number of ports across England including-Ellesmere Port, Birkenhead, Southampton, Strood, Immingham and Teesport. With salt currently both arriving and being distributed from the strategic stockpile the amounts held at each site vary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="110204w0002.htm_para25"><a name="11020450001214">As a result of the early onset and severity of the weather experienced already this winter season, the Secretary of State for Transport requested the Highways Agency to facilitate the import of a further volume of salt of up to 250,000 tonnes. Orders have been placed for this further amount which has started to arrive, with the majority expected between the end of January and mid-February. Storage locations are currently being arranged for the additional strategic salt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="110204w0002.htm_para26"><a name="11020450001215">In September 2010, the total volume of salt available across England, Scotland and Wales was estimated to be over 1,400,000 tonnes. No surveys were carried out in October or November 2010. For this winter season, the Department has introduced an electronic stock monitoring system to monitor salt stock holdings on a weekly basis. From the most recent audit undertaken on 17 January 2010, the total salt stock available in Great Britain is estimated to be over 912,000 tonnes (including the strategic stockpile in England) which compares to just over 243,600 tonnes at the same time last year.</p>

 A consumer's right to choose legal representation is set out in the Insurance Companies (Legal Expenses Insurance) Regulations 1990 ("the regulations").

In the absence of any legal expenses insurance policy, or where the consumer is not seeking to recover his legal costs from his insurer, there are no restrictions on a consumer choosing his own legal representative to pursue a claim. However, where a consumer has a legal expenses insurance policy to indemnify his legal costs, the insurer may require the use of one of its panel solicitors to pursue the consumer's claim for compensation.</p>

 Information on jobs achieved through Pathways to Work come from the Department's Pathways to Work database. Within this database, jobs are counted only where they start within 91 days of a customer's last contact with JCP. Jobs occurring after this period are not counted. This is in order to reasonably attribute the job to the activity which takes place through Pathways. The mandatory activity takes on average around nine months from Pathways start. This means that the majority of jobs recorded within this data are obtained within one year and therefore the average time it takes a Pathways customer to find work may appear lower than would otherwise be expected.</p>

We interpreted the question's mention of pensions savings to mean wealth held in private pensions and therefore provided figures in that context. Private pensions are all pensions that are not state basic retirement or state earnings related. There are nine categories included in the estimates of private pension wealth: defined benefit (DB) pensions, defined contribution (DC) pensions and personal pensions to which the individual was contributing at the time of survey, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) made to current pensions, retained rights in DB and DC schemes, pension funds from which the individual was drawing an income through income drawdown, pensions in payment and pensions expected in the future based on the contributions of a former spouse. The estimates quoted include those individuals with zero pension wealth.
