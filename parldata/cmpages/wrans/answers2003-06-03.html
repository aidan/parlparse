<a name="30603w01.html_para0">Splash and Splash Extra were an important part of last summer's programme of school holiday diversionary activities for young people living in high crime areas, which saw over 90,000 young people taking part in a wide range of activities. We intend to build on this success this year, by absorbing the Splash schemes, along with the Connexions Summer Plus programme, into a new single programme of positive activities for young people to provide year round out of school activities for eight to 19-year-olds.

 Since 1994, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has conducted an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. This concluded that the extent of cultivation in the last three years was:

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his Department's strategy is on opium sourced in Afghanistan that gets transported to the UK.  [114357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK is working with the Afghan Government to achieve their stated goal of eliminating opium production by 2013. We are co-ordinating international anti-narcotics assistance to Afghanistan. With the endorsement of the Afghan Government, and in consultation with other 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 2W</I><P>
international stakeholders (especially the UN), the UK has developed a long-term strategy. This identifies four key areas where assistance should be targeted: improving Afghan law enforcement capability; rural reconstruction to generate alternative livelihoods for opium poppy farmers; capacity-building for Afghan drug control institutions; and establishing prevention/treatment programmes to tackle addiction.
<P>

<a name="30603w01.html_para2">We are also working with governments along the main trafficking routes to disrupt the drug trade.

<a name="30603w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how much money the Government spent on their programme to eradicate poppy production in Afghanistan in 2002; and how much the Government intend to spend on this programme in 2003.  [115361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 At the Tokyo Reconstruction Conference for Afghanistan in January 2002 the UK pledged &#163;200 million over five years for development. The conference acknowledged that measures designed to contribute to the elimination of opium poppy cultivation should be included in all reconstruction programmes.
<P>

<a name="30603w01.html_para3">In 2002&#150;03 the UK spent &#163;70 million on development in Afghanistan. This included &#163;2 million on livelihoods programmes which promote the creation of alternative forms of licit livelihood for Afghan poppy farmers. The UK has also provided approximately &#163;24 million of assistance for the development of Afghan drug control capacity.

<a name="30603w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the success of the Government in meeting its PSA target to contribute to the reduction of opium cultivation in Afghanistan by 70 per cent. in five years with complete elimination in 10 years.  [115362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The elimination of cultivation of opium poppy in Afghanistan in 10 years is an ambitious target which has been embraced by the Afghan Government and included in their own national drug strategy, endorsed by President Karzai on 19 May.
<P>

<a name="30603w01.html_para4">A UK plan for assisting the Afghan authorities with implementation of their strategy is being finalised. It outlines a broad approach that balances the building up of Afghan drug law enforcement with the promotion of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers. Achievement of sustainable reductions in cultivation levels will also depend on whether a secure environment can be maintained in Afghanistan which enables central Government to assert its authority over the provinces and which allows the development community to implement reconstruction programmes. We have always been clear that we expect poppy production to rise before it falls in later years. This is inevitable given the poverty, the need for alternative livelihoods and the need to build a strong central Government in Afghanistan which can implement an effective eradication strategy.

Afghanistan that meets international standards; and what his assessment is of the adequacy of resources available to develop such a system.  [114876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Progress in this sector is gathering speed after the appointment of a Judicial Commission in October 2002. The Judicial Commission has established a programme of work together with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to which the UK has contributed &#163;0.5 million, with a further &#163;0.5 million pledged for later this year. Work on the programme is ongoing: a scoping study of existing infrastructure has already been completed across much of the country, and the Commission is actively reviewing the civil and penal codes.
<P>

<a name="30603w01.html_para5">Italy is the lead nation for co-ordinating international assistance to the Afghan justice sector with the Transitional Administration. It has estimated that the development and running of the Justice Sector will require approximately &#163;18 million per year (figure drawn from the Afghan National Development Budget 2003). Part of that sum can be met from the Afghan National Budget. Italy, the US and other donors are contributing significant sums to the Law and Order Trust Fund and to the Judicial Commission programme for reform of the Justice Sector enabling the reform programme to proceed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Germany is the lead nation for co-ordinating international assistance on police reform with the Afghan Transitional Administration. The Germans, assisted by other nations, have trained 1,300 men and 40 women at Kabul Police Academy. The UK ran a two week training course in Kabul in January attended by five male senior Afghan police officers, two of whom subsequently attended a course at the International Police College in the UK. These are the only figures that we can break down by gender. However, a further 25 Afghan police officers have been trained in Germany, as well as 340 officers in India, 60 in Turkey and 30 in Iran.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what estimate he has made of the likely production level of cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan in <i>(a)</i> 2003 and <i>(b)</i> 2004; and what percentage that represents of levels in (i) 2000 and (ii) 2001.  [115498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. They are in the process of completing the 2003 survey. The final results will be available in the autumn. The 2004 survey will get underway towards the end of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The monitoring of airport security abroad is a key task for Post Aviation Security Officers (PASOs) in the majority of our network of embassies, High Commissions and Consulate-Generals. PASOs assess security afforded to UK airlines and, where there are no UK carriers, report on the airport security regime generally.
<P>

<a name="30603w02.html_para1">Since 11 September 2001, the PASOs work has intensified and been supplemented by ad hoc visits and assessments by experts from Transport Security Directorate at the Department for Transport (DfT). PASOs are not aviation security experts and they all have other duties to undertake outside the aviation security field. Where a PASO identifies shortcomings in security he/she will be given guidance from DfT on how the issue should be addressed, with further support from the centre as necessary.

The army unit ceased their action following local protests and the intervention of security services who have tried to resolve the dispute. The Patmos Centre is currently in a legal dispute about its location. It has been built about 500 metres from the perimeter of an army camp. Under Egyptian law, the construction of buildings within such proximity of a military institution is not allowed. We hope that the authorities can reach a swift settlement to the dispute.

 No. We have not seen evidence of systematic targeting or maltreatment by police of converts from Islam to Christianity. However, we are concerned at the lack of an administrative means of changing ID cards to Christianity where a person has converted.

 Verifiable information on the numbers of executions which take place around the world is not available as not all countries publish such figures. We use statistics collected by Amnesty International which we regard as one definitive source of information on death penalty cases. Amnesty International do not publish a league table of figures covering every country in the world though their research and ours suggests that capital punishment continues to be implemented in about 30 countries. We also believe that the true number of executions world-wide is significantly higher than the number of recorded cases.

 The European Commission will speak on behalf of EU member states at the International Coffee Organisation/World Bank Conference. The Conference aims to bring together producers from developing countries, Government officials, experts from international organisations, advocacy groups and industry representatives to discuss alternatives such as diversification, quality, added value and market development in order to help coffee producers increase their income and improve living standards. It is hoped that the Conference will help to develop ideas for specific programmes and activities which could make a real contribution to solving the coffee crisis.

<P>
<a name="30603w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2003]:</i> CAP reform proposals introduced the concept of a decoupled single income payment with energy crops eligible for an additional 'carbon credit' aid of 45 per hectare, capped at 1.5 million hectares across the EU. Compulsory set-aside would have been retained, but the existing derogation to allow non-food, including energy, crops to be grown on it would be removed. We consider that the combination of decoupling together with a further cereals price cut removes the need for land to be taken out of production.
<P>

<a name="30603w05.html_para0">The European Commission have now indicated that they may be prepared to make some changes to their original proposal including allowing continued access for non-food crops to set-aside land. Our view is that if set-aside is to continue, it must be applied in a flexible way which maximises its potential benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 20W</I><P>
she has made of the estimate of the proportion of methane emissions arising from fossil fuel extraction, set out in paragraph 2.8 of the 22nd report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution; and what action she will take.  [114717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, the UK is required annually to compile an inventory of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para0">The latest published inventory is for 2001. This shows that fugitive emissions of methane from fossil fuel extraction represent 29.5 per cent. of total methane emissions in the UK. This is broadly consistent with the figure of 28 per cent. quoted in the RCEP report.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para1">Fugitive emissions of methane in the UK have fallen by half between 1990 and 2001 mainly due to a large reduction in methane emissions from coal mining as coal production has declined. Leakage rates from the natural gas transmission and distribution network have improved as old mains are replaced leading to a reduction in emissions from the network of 14 per cent. over the period. Other fugitive emissions of methane arise from smaller sources, such as venting and flaring from offshore platforms.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para2">Methane emissions from abandoned coal mines, for which there is no internationally agreed estimation methodology, are currently not included in the UK inventory. The Department has recently commissioned a research project aiming to produce a verifiable estimates with the aim of inclusion in the inventory in future.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the findings of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's 22nd report, "Energy-the Changing Climates", in paragraph 2.8 on page 18, on the contribution of methane gases from landfill sites to the greenhouse effect.  [114963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's 22nd report estimates that landfill methane emissions represent 7 to 8 per cent. of total global methane emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. This is consistent with figures reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 1994 report on Climate Change. If natural sources are excluded, landfills contribute an estimated 11 per cent. to total global anthropogenic methane emissions, or some 2.4 per cent. of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para3">Landfill emissions are generally higher for developed countries because of the greater amount of waste arising and because conditions within the landfills are more anaerobic. The latest published UK greenhouse gas emissions estimates are for 2001. These show that methane emissions from landfill sites represent 22 per cent. of total anthropogenic methane emissions, or 1.6 per cent. of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Historical data show that the UK ratio of landfill to total methane is comparable to that in other EU countries.




<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 21W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para4">Methane emissions from landfill sites in the UK have declined by 57 per cent. between 1990 and 2001 because of the implementation of methane recovery systems. This trend is likely to continue as the UK Government work towards compliance with the EU Landfill Directive. The Directive requires that all landfill gas is collected and treated, and sets progressive targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill, with the ultimate target of diverting 65 per cent. of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled in 1995 from this disposal route by 2020.

 The Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis 2003 shows, for Defra, estimated outturn for 2003 on a basis that is not strictly comparable with the final provision shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para6">The main difference is that the final provision shown only includes expenditure within the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL), whereas the estimated outturn includes some &#163;250 million reclassified from Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) to DEL at Main Estimates 2003. The outturn figures, in order to show trends, present this reclassification retrospectively. There is no increase in public expenditure as a result of this reclassification.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para7">A smaller part of the difference arises because the estimated outturn reflects some technical errors in information input to the Treasury database from which it is derived. These are due to be corrected later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make it her policy to fund the roll-out of kerbside recycling to all homes.  [114252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Current Government policy does not require kerbside recycling schemes to all homes. The Government sets targets for the level of recycling to be achieved, it is for local authorities to decide how they should be achieved. There are, therefore, no funds targetted specifically at kerbside collection although local authorities can and do use existing government funding for waste management&#151;including the national Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund&#151;to extend kerbside recycling collections in their areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans the Department has to lobby her European counterparts to reverse the prohibition on the growing of non-food crops on set-aside land.  [115212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The original CAP reform proposals removed the existing derogation which allows non-food crops to be grown on set-aside. Since these proposals were published, there have been a number of detailed discussions. The European Commission have indicated that they may make some changes to their original proposal on set-aside, including allowing continued access for non-food crops. Our view is that if set-aside is to continue, it must be applied in a flexible way which maximises its potential benefits.

 The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) was established to promote more sustainable waste management by working to create more stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para10">WRAP's current business plan, covering the period from 2001&#150;04, focuses on four specific materials: plastics, paper, glass and wood, and three general areas where action is needed to remove barriers to the greater use of recycled materials and products: financial mechanisms, standards and procurement.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para11">For 2003&#150;04 WRAP has been allocated &#163;10.2 million from Defra, &#163;5 million from DTI and &#163;0.6 million from the Welsh Assembly Government, for the continuation of its market development work. It may also receive small additional contributions from the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

<a name="30603w06.html_para12">Since 2002 WRAP has also taken on a programme of work on minimising the need for primary aggregates, funded through the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund. The budget has yet to be finalised but is likely to be between &#163;9 million&#150;&#163;13 million.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para13">From 2003&#150;04 WRAP will be taking forward three new programmes of work recommended by the Strategy Unit in its report "Waste Not, Want Not", in addition to their 'core' programme, on recycling (kerbside best practice and development of the organics market), waste minimisation and waste awareness.

 The costs involved in meeting the Article 5 Landfill Directive targets and other waste strategy targets were set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment, published with Waste Strategy 2000.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para14">A base case was established and various policy mixes were costed against that base case. The additional costs of the policy mixes that should deliver the levels of recycling, composting and recovery needed to meet the waste strategy targets fell in the range &#163;3.4 billion to &#163;7.7 billion (net present value) over the 20-year period 2000&#150;20.
<P>

<a name="30603w06.html_para15">Waste Strategy 2000 stated that the proposed targets for the recovery and recycling of municipal waste may not impose net additional costs if it is assumed that a broad mix of waste management options will be required to meet the Landfill Directive targets; and that reliance on incineration and composting is unlikely to be viable.

The remaining commitments are not yet reflected in the delivery planning system. The outcomes of the 2004 spending review cannot be pre-empted but, in consultation with HM Treasury, I intend to take the opportunity to incorporate these commitments into the system through amending and adding targets and delivery plans where relevant.

<a name="30603w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As part of his programme of reforms designed to raise productivity growth across the UK economy, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was involved at the inception of the Cambridge MIT Institute (CMI), between 1998 and 2000, to discuss how the project could be set up to forge joint educational and research initiatives in order to improve entrepreneurship, productivity and competitiveness in the UK. The Government's commitment to funding the CMI project for five years was given in November 1999 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The funding was allocated to the project by the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury during the 2000 Spending Review, which made available resources for the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Trade and Industry to fund CMI. DTI Ministers are responsible for the management of this budget and the funding of the project.

 Staff for the new teams will be drawn from existing Customs personnel. The anti-smuggling teams and detector dogs are mobile and the locations of their deployment will be varied according to risk. Where illness or injury seriously impairs a detector dog's long-term effectiveness, the dog would normally be retired from duty. Customs would then arrange for the supply and training of a new dog as soon as possible. DEFRA publicity is continuing while Customs publicity material is developed. This will be rolled out later this year.

 Members of the United Kingdom armed forces have an expectation of world wide service in a wide variety of operations, including war service, and their pay and allowances are structured accordingly and reviewed annually by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), an independent organisation.
<P>

<a name="30603w08.html_para4">Service basic pay includes an additional element&#151;the X Factor (currently 13 per cent. of basic pay and pensionable, for all ranks up to Lieutenant Colonel and equivalent at the mid pay point, beyond which it tapers) to reflect the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the UK armed forces over a full career and conditions in UK civilian life. The X Factor was increased from 12 per cent. in the 2000 award. Various allowances are also payable, such as the Longer Separated Service Allowance (LSSA) and Longer Service at Sea Bonus (LSSB) to compensate personnel for time away from their permanent base and separation from their families.

 We have the mechanisms in place to supply the equipment that our armed forces need. Equipment is held to meet the requirements of a range of possible scenarios. Additional equipment and supplies for specific operational needs can be obtained direct from our commercial partners, where necessary through the Ministry of Defence's tried and tested urgent operational requirement process. The recent operation in Iraq, for which an equivalent quantity of material to that supplied for the first Gulf conflict was deployed in half the time, demonstrated the overall adequacy of supply. However, action is in hand to identify lessons from this operation and we will publish the results in due course, subject to the usual constraints on force protection and security.

 During the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2003, 8,037 overseas military personnel from 115 countries visited the United Kingdom to undertake training at UK military establishments. This serves a range of specific purposes in pursuit of British interests, linked to various Memoranda of Understanding. More generally, however, it has helped to foster good relations between the UK military and many Foreign and Commonwealth armed forces and has assisted in achieving a higher degree of interoperability and influence than may otherwise have been possible. The principal objective of this activity is to use British Defence assets in peacetime to discourage hostility abroad, build and maintain trust between states, and assist in the development of democratically accountable armed forces; thereby helping to make a significant contribution to conflict prevention and resolution. A full breakdown of the numbers trained by country is set out in the following tables.

 The Ministry of Defence is presently conducting an assessment, to capture and analyse the lessons from the operations in Iraq. It is expected that a final report of the operation will be published by the end of 2003.

<a name="30603w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether any individuals detained by British forces in the Gulf are not being held under the terms of the Geneva Convention.  [109157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No. All Iraqi citizens captured by United Kingdom forces are being held under the authority of, and in accordance with, the terms of the Geneva Conventions.

<a name="30603w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> the life expectancy of rotor blades in European conditions and <i>(b)</i> the average life expectancy in Iraq and Kuwait of each type of helicopter deployed in Operation Telic is; and if he will make a statement on the comparative lift capability of the fleets in such conditions.  [111826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Main rotor blades typically have a long life expectancy, which in many cases is reflected in a fatigue life which exceeds that of the rotorcraft. Main rotor blades do, however, have a Mean Time Between Replacement (MTBR) which is shown by rotorcraft type in the following table. These figures represent a mean across all usage, and are not separated by environmental conditions (data on this are not held). Usually, main rotor blades that are replaced are repaired and returned to service.

Lift capability is determined by a number of factors. These include engine performance, which will be affected by high temperatures, and correspondingly lower air density, encountered in desert regions such as parts of Iraq. Post operational reporting will provide analysis and an assessment of equipment deployed on operations in Iraq. It would, therefore, be premature to provide a detailed assessment of the performance of equipment and any effect on operational use at this stage.<P>

<P>
<a name="30603w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 United Kingdom and United States Government officials have recently agreed proposed texts for a waiver from the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). This will provide for export licensing requirements to be waived in respect of certain unclassified defence items and technical data exported to Her Majesty's Government and qualified companies in the UK, which would facilitate US/UK defence industrial collaboration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Seizure of key elements of the Iraqi oil infrastructure was an early objective for the coalition in order to deny Iraqi forces the opportunity for sabotage, prevent environmental damage and to preserve the oil industry for the Iraqi people. The Royal Marines took the town of Al Faw with its significant oil infrastructure intact as part of a joint operation with United States and Australian Forces. They remained in place securing the peninsula and the associated oil infrastructure until the beginning of May 2003.

[110604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B>

 It would be inappropriate to make battle damage assessments available. They contain detailed information about the pattern and effectiveness of United Kingdom operations. Their public release could jeopardise future UK operations.

[112494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is likely that the power supply to the Waif al-Qaed water treatment plant was cut off when the southern Iraqi electricity grid was shut down by its Iraqi operators at the beginning of the conflict. The plant was restarted by the operators on 4 April using standby generators, and the mains power supply was re-established on 11 April. The Iraqi operators continue to be responsible for the operation of the Waif al-Qaed water treatment plant.

 For the purposes of answering this question I have taken bombs to mean large, high explosive air to ground bombs, specifically the RAFs 5401b and l000lb free-fall bombs, and the l000lb and 20001b Paveway bombs.

 There is no reliable current estimate of the level of take-up disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA), and an accurate estimate cannot be made because entitlement to the benefits is not based on diagnosis, but on the care and mobility needs arising from disability, which can vary widely between individuals.

 The special insert regarding Home Responsibilities Protection directed at married women paying reduced rate National Insurance contributions was placed in child benefit order books in 1979. Inserts have a short-term life&#151;the life of the order book. They are intended to draw attention to important information at a particular time in this case that married women who had chosen to pay reduced rate contributions could not qualify for Home Responsibilities Protection and might wish to reconsider their choice. However, information about HRP continued to feature in the order book notes.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> Between March-July 1995, 1,075 clients were recruited by 54 participating treatment programmes. These individuals presented with extensive, chronic and serious problems related to the use of drugs and alcohol. The most common drug problem was long-term opiate dependence, often in conjunction with polydrug and/or alcohol problems. Many clients had psychological and physical health problems, and high rates of criminal behaviour were reported.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of the effect of the lack of a statutory obligation on private care homes to protect older people from abuses under the Human Rights Act 1998.  [111050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w18.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 A person in need of residential care is entitled to an assessment of their needs by the local authority. The local authority must then go on to decide whether it will provide the necessary services. If the authority decides to provide services it will then go on to arrange these services, probably through a private provider. The local authority nonetheless retains a role and remains responsible for ensuring that the person is receiving the services he needs and for ensuring that the private provider is providing the services contracted for. As caselaw makes clear, in exercising its duties in respect of a person, the local authority remains accountable under the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="30603w18.html_para1">The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) also has an important role in ensuring the welfare of older people in care homes. The NCSC is responsible for regulating all care homes in England in accordance with statutory regulations and national minimum standards. The standards are designed to ensure that poor standards in care homes are a thing of the past and to tackle the problems of abuse and neglect that sadly still exists in some care homes today.

 There are a number of factors which impact on the welfare of a child with this condition and a well-documented association between enuresis and psychiatric disorder in community samples of children, although over half of enuretic children have no psychiatric disorder.

<a name="30603w18.html_para3">Common childhood conditions will be considered under the forthcoming national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, which is currently developing national standards. The standards are likely to cover support which should be available to children and their parents in managing a wide range of conditions and problems, including enuresis. This will emphasise the promotion of evidence based clinical guidelines and a number of examples of good practice in a range of different areas.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2003]:</i> The Government is delivering a range of programmes and activities in line with policy commitments to promote healthy eating among children. Action includes the National School Fruit Scheme, the Food in Schools programme and the Healthy School programme. Local Five-A-Day initiatives aim to increase awareness of and access to fruit and vegetables and this will include work with children.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para0">The welfare foods programme is being reformed to use the resources more effectively to ensure children in poverty have access to a healthy diet. There are also on-going initiatives to increase breastfeeding as breastfed babies are less likely to become obese in childhood.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para1">Work is underway with the food industry to improve the overall balance of diet, including salt, fat and sugar in food, working with the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The FSA is funding a review of aspects of the promotion of foods to children. Details of other initiatives by the FSA to promote the uptake of a healthy balanced diet in children are set out in the its Nutrition Action Plan.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para2">The food and health action plan will also pull together all the issues that influence what we eat and will address healthy eating at all stages of the life course. The plan will build on a comprehensive on-going programme of work already underway across Government on healthy eating.

<a name="30603w19.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Since April 2001 all acute trusts in England have had to report methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infections. Results for the first year of this scheme (April 2001 to March 2002) were published in the Communicable Disease Report Weekly on 20 June 2002 and are available on the Public Health Laboratory Service website www.phls.co.uk/publications/cdr/PDFfiles/2002/cdr2502.pdf. These data have enabled us to introduce an MRSA improvement score into the National Health Service performance management system this year to ensure that trusts investigate their MRSA levels.

 "Care of older people" has been identified as one of the themes for the work programme of the Innovation Forum, which brings together excellent councils and Government, to pioneer ways of delivering better public services for local communities. An initial proposal suggested reducing hospital admissions for older people through improved strategic commissioning of services by a council, on behalf of the local national health service and council. This will be taken forward in a few pilot areas as part of the work of the forum.

<P>
<a name="30603w19.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Yellow Card Scheme is recognised to be one of the best in the world in terms of the level of reporting, has a proven track record of identifying new drug safety hazards and enables the monitoring of all medicines, including Seroxat, in clinical use.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para11">The effectiveness of the Scheme is under continuous review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). From April 2003, the first phase of patient reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through the Yellow Card Scheme via NHS Direct was introduced. This will enable the first hand experiences of patients to be utilised in the identification and assessment of drug safety issues.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para12">Under-reporting of ADRs is an inherent feature of spontaneous reporting schemes. Although this means that data from the scheme have limited usefulness in terms of quantifying the frequency of an ADR, it does not detract from the ability of the scheme to identify new drug safety hazards. It has been estimated from various surveys that only 10&#150;15 per cent. of serious ADRs are reported through the Yellow Card Scheme, but the true extent of under-reporting is unknown and is likely to vary considerably between different drugs and different reactions.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para13">The effectiveness of the Yellow Card Scheme is reviewed regularly. CSM is updated twice monthly on the progress of the Yellow Card Scheme and the impact of new initiatives. Formal reviews of the scheme are carried out and presented to CSM annually. External reviews of the Yellow Card System were carried out in the 1980's by Grahame-Smith and earlier this year by the National Audit Office as part of their Value for Money study of the Medicines Controls Agency.
<P>

<a name="30603w19.html_para14">The following table lists the number of reports of suspected ADRs received per year for the last three years through the Yellow Card Scheme for paroxetine (Seroxat) and the number of cases of suicide reported as suspected adverse drug reactions in association with paroxetine in this time.

Also, all people who regularly disengage from services leading to frequent relapse will be in receipt of assertive outreach services by December 2003 and all young people who develop a severe mental illness will be in receipt of early intervention services by 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what interim measures he plans to introduce to maintain the number of dentists offering dentistry services on the NHS; and if he will make a statement.  [113275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 We are legislating for far-reaching reform of national health service dental services to improve the service for dentists and patients. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill proposes that each primary care trust be given a duty to provide, or secure the provision of, primary dental services in its area to the extent that it considers reasonable to do so and be given the financial resources to do this. Until this new framework is in place and to support primary care trusts in preparing for this, we plan to put in place a support team for NHS dentistry to develop interim measures of the kind referred to. The team will work closely with strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to identify which areas are most in need and to ensure that there is a rapid response to difficulties experienced by dentists working at the front-line of the NHS. New incentive directions will be made shortly to provide the necessary legal powers for PCTs to provide assistance and support to dentists, until the legislation now in Parliament provides the framework for trusts to commission NHS primary dental services themselves.
<P>

<a name="30603w20.html_para7">Primary care trusts will be able to help dental practices in a number of ways, for example when they are threatened by difficulties over practice premises. They will also be able to pay to increase the total amount of time that a practice devotes to NHS general dental services. It is also planned to build on existing experience of personal dental services pilot contracting, to enable committed dentists to work in the NHS without having to use the statement of dental remuneration to earn fees for items of service. This so-called treadmill has been a major source of complaint from the profession and will be abolished by the legislation before the House.




<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 80W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30603w20.html_para8">In addition to the above, the support team will help focus national plans on local challenges where workforce availability is the key issue.

This would enable local flexibility to be built into the system, allowing PCTs to address local access issues as they arise.

<P>
<a name="30603w21.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The most recent information about levels of physical activity among adults and children can be derived from the 1998 Health Survey for England. For adults aged 16 and over four types of activity are asked about in the survey: activity at work; in the home (housework, gardening); walks of 15 minutes or more and sports and exercise activities. For most activity types, survey informants were asked on how many days in the last four weeks they had participated in the activity for at least 15 minutes a time.
<P>

<a name="30603w21.html_para14">Current guidelines recommend that adults should take part in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity, ideally on a daily basis. This may include the accumulation of shorter bouts of activity to meet the 30 minutes target. The table summarises participation in activity. The category High represents the level of activity that fulfils the current physical activity recommendations for adults. Among men over a third, 37 per cent, were in the High category while among women, a quarter were in this category.
<P>

<a name="30603w21.html_para15">Further information about adult physical activity from the Health Survey will be available in the 2003 survey, the results from which will be available at the end of 2004.

For children, the latest information available is from the 1997 survey. This looked at children's involvement in sports and exercise, active play, walking and, for age eight and above, work at home such as housework or cleaning a car. Recommended activity levels for children are 60 minutes moderate physical activity, seven days a week. The survey showed that overall, 55 per cent., of boys and 39 per cent., of girls achieved this level. Any activity carried out as part of the school curriculum is not included in these estimates. Further information about children's physical activity will be available from the 2002 Health Survey, which focused on children and young people, the results from which are due to be published at the end of the year.<P>

For the former London health region, the figure was 57. Though there are major variations between former health regions in the provision of specialist palliative care beds, the &#163;50 million central budget for palliative care allocated will help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care, and enable cancer networks to reach at least the national average.

 Seroxat (paroxetine) is a member of a group of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Guidance on prescribing and use of Seroxat is provided in the authorised summary of product characteristics (SPC) for health professionals and patient information leaflet (PIL). These documents contain information on use of Seroxat, contraindications, warnings and possible adverse effects. Prescribing information is also included in the British National Formulary (BNF) which is sent by the Department of Health to doctors and pharmacists.
<P>

<a name="30603w22.html_para4">Since Seroxat was first marketed in 1990, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Government's independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) have kept the safety of Seroxat under close continuous review.

<P>
<a name="30603w22.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The combination of high levels of global travel and an infection with an incubation period of two to 10 days means that the United Kingdom will inevitably experience some cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in United Kingdom. The strategy therefore cannot be total exclusion, rather it is to diagnose early and minimise transmission from these cases within the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w22.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Any application to change the legal status of a particular medicine for lowering blood cholesterol will be carefully considered against the criteria for prescription-only status set out in European and UK Legislation and would be subject to public consultation. Following changes to the law in April 2002, the process of re-classifying medicines has been streamlined and the time taken from application to grant of a new legal status, has been reduced from up to 18 months to around six.
<P>

<a name="30603w22.html_para7">National Health Service prescribing for statins currently covers over a million patients at a cost of &#163;546 million per year and prescribing is growing by a third each year. Analysis of prescribing suggests that there is a higher rate of prescribing in areas of greater need and that general practice is successfully ensuring that cholesterol lowering therapy is being offered in a way which will assist in the reduction of health inequalities. If cholesterol lowering drugs become available in pharmacies, general practitioners will continue to prescribe to their patients according to clinical need and we expect that this will continue to result in higher prescribing in areas of greater deprivation and ill health.

<P>
<a name="30603w24.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Although I have not had any such discussions, officials from the National Probation Directorate (NPD) are in regular contact with officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on housing matters, and on matters connected with the possible replacement of or building of new approved premises. We do not have any specific plans at this stage to build approved hostels specifically for high-risk offenders on post-release licence. However, NPD are currently developing an accommodation strategy, covering the needs of offenders under probation supervision. When the results of this are available, we will be able to make an assessment as to whether any new provision is needed to house ex-offenders, including high-risk offenders, and if so, what type of new provision is required, and in what areas it is required.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the number of places available for high-risk offenders in approved hostels following release from custody in <i>(a)</i> Gloucestershire and <i>(b)</i> the UK; and what plans he has to increase the number of such hostels in each case.  [113749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w24.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 There are currently 100 approved hostels in England and Wales, providing around 2,250 places. These approved premises cater broadly for three groups of residents&#151;bailees, those on community orders with a condition of residence at the hostel, and post-release licencees. Because of the enhanced supervision that they offer, approved premises are primarily for those assessed as medium or high risk. 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 95W</I><P>
Approved premises play a vital role in public protection by providing closer supervision for offenders in the community than other alternatives such as normal local authority housing.
<P>

<a name="30603w24.html_para7">The current approved hostel in Gloucester is quite small and in due course may need to be replaced or extended&#151;but any plans to do this would need to be discussed with local agencies and community representatives before being taken forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w24.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The information could be compiled only at disproportionate cost, as it would require examining approximately 140 reports and around 15,000 recommendations. The Prison Service accepts the vast majority of recommendations. Recommendations are sometimes rejected for security reasons, where insurmountable staff deployment issues arise or where the recommendation is inappropriate for the nature of the establishment's population.

 In summer 2002, around 370 Splash and Splash Extra schemes were run in high crime areas, enabling over 90,000 young people to take part in a wide range of activities.

The new programme will absorb the Splash and Splash Extra schemes, and will deliver activities to more young people, providing support for those most at risk. The new programme will mean less bureaucracy for local areas, allowing them to focus on delivering good quality programmes to young people at risk of crime and social exclusion.

 The Cabinet Office always strives to operate sound financial management of its resource and capital budgets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 In total the Cabinet Office has committed &#163;1 million to the "Get Started" campaign which aims to drive up levels of internet access among key groups such as the elderly, disabled and unemployed. We expect the value of strong partnership activity to at least match our direct investment. As well as being used to publicise the campaign, our investment is supporting a number of voluntary sector organisations to deliver internet access projects for their users.
<P>

<a name="30603w27.html_para4">"Get Started" is a national campaign which was launched on 12 May and will run until 30 June.

 Coffee growers have been hit by low prices and deteriorating quality, the result of global over-supply and structural imbalances in the industry. The Government will support efforts to find solutions at the G8 summit and in follow-up work after the summit, notably for poor countries in Africa.
<P>

<a name="30603w27.html_para6">There are a number of possibilities. The UK is already contributing to a sustainable coffee market by helping growers to diversify through its development programme; trying to expand the trade opportunities of commodity-dependent countries, cut tariffs and reduce the negative impact of the CAP. We are promoting foreign investment and good regulatory frameworks, increasing the aid budget to 0.40 per cent. of national income by 2005&#150;06 and advocating more debt relief to highly indebted poor countries.

The Government's policy on the reduction of supply of and increasing the quality of coffee on the world market is via our membership of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) and our support for the ICO's coffee quality scheme.
<P>

<a name="30603w27.html_para7">The ICO Coffee Quality Improvement programme was approved by ICO Council Resolution 407 on 1 February 2002. The programme commenced on 1 October 2002 and requires that exports of coffee, accompanied by Certificates of Origin, shall comply with minimum standards specified in the Resolution. Exporting members are also required to develop and implement national measures to ensure that no exports of green coffee shall fail to meet the exportable standards. Discussions are currently on going about how the exports of processed coffee should be dealt with.

The US were Members under the 1983 Agreement, but left in 1993 mainly because at the time it did not wish to support mechanisms which could have a price-regulatory effect.

 Under the Dogs Act 1871 a magistrates court may make an order for the control or destruction of a dog that is dangerous and not kept under proper control. This Act applies everywhere, including in and around a private house. The Dangerous Dogs Acts 1991 and 1997 increased the range of penalties available to the court to deal with offenders whose dog is dangerously out of control in a public place. The Dangerous Dogs Acts have also placed restrictions over the ownership of types of dogs that have the characteristics of a type bred for fighting.

 On 1 November 2002 we wrote to all slaughterhouse operators to obtain information on existing blood disposal routes.

As a result the Department has worked closely with the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) and other industry experts to develop guidance on simple, low cost ways in which slaughterhouses could comply with the new requirements. This guidance was issued on 21 February 2003 to <i>(a)</i> all red meat slaughterhouses and <i>(b)</i> to the trade organisations listed at Annex 1.

<i>Note:</i><P>

In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of new heard incidents in 2002 is not comparable to that of previous years.<P>

 TB in deer is a notifiable disease. Article 5 of the Tuberculosis (Deer) Order 1989 requires all deer carcases which are suspected of being affected with tuberculosis to be reported to the appropriate Divisional Veterinary Manager (DVM). This applies to all deer species, whether farmed, parkland or wild.
<P>

<a name="30603w29.html_para9">If lesions suggestive of TB are reported in a deer carcase anywhere in GB, tissue samples are sent to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for bacteriological culture. If the causative organism of TB is isolated from wild deer in an area of the country that does not undergo annual TB testing of cattle, the DVM may instigate TB test checks of cattle herds in surrounding areas. This has been the standard Defra policy for many years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w29.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra provides grants for farm diversification projects under the Rural Enterprise Scheme, which forms part of the England Rural Development Programme. Similar arrangements apply in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly and other Objctive I areas through the separate Objective I programme. The Department also offers assistance in the form of free planning consultancy advice to farmers who intend to pursue an eligible diversification project through the Rural Enterprise Scheme or Objective I programme.
<P>

<a name="30603w29.html_para10">The Department is also considering how to improve the provision of help and informationto farmers considering diversification of their business base. The Farm Business Advice Service, which remains available until March 2004, provides up to three days of freeadvice based around a business healthcheck and results in a business action plan. The service can help farmers decide whether or not to diversify and will direct them to other sources of support to help them see the action plan through. In addition, the delivery plan for the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food in the South West includes projects designed to help farms develop additional activities and to boost the skills needed to support this.

<a name="30603w29.html_para11">The support provided to farmers in the South West mirrors that provided elsewhere in England.

 Defra has published guidance for public sector bodies on food procurement that covers issues such as removing obstacles to tendering by local and UK producers. This can be found on the internet at http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/index.htm.
<P>

<a name="30603w30.html_para0">The Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) is producing its own guidance on sustainable procurement for local authorities that I understand will reflect Defra's guidance on food procurement.

<P>

<a name="30603w30.html_para1">Local authorities are responsible for sourcing a significant amount of food and this has brought with it increased interest, for example, in sourcing fresh produce and promoting healthy eating through their procurement policies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Annual monitoring for evidence of Lindane in the area of the English Channel where MV Perintis sunk was undertaken between 1989 and 1993. This found that Lindane concentrations in seawater were low. The conclusion was that the English Channel had not been contaminated as a result of the sinking and that the container of Lindane on MV Perintis had sunk intact.
<P>

<a name="30603w30.html_para2">The Lindane (a pure, crystalline material not formulated in a carrying solvent) was packed in plastic sacks within the container. Advice from Defra's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is that dissolution of the Lindane in seawater at the ambient seabed temperature, leaching from the sacks, and diffusion from within the container into the surrounding water, are all likely to be slow processes and the impact on marine life is therefore expected to be negligible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures her Department will put in place under the CAP decoupling proposals to protect the future of <i>(a)</i> local authority owned and <i>(b)</i> other small farms following the proposal to pay a single subsidy payment to the tenant and to allow the tenant to retain the entitlement payments; and whether it is her policy that the subsidy remain with the farm rather than with the tenant.  [114587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are not convinced of the need for such measures. In order to claim the proposed single payment, those holding entitlements would need to farm, or at least keep in good agricultural condition, an equivalent number of hectares to that which established the entitlement. This means there are likely to be many farmers, including tenants, with an entitlement who would need to find land to attach it to in order to generate payments. Consequently, our initial assessment is that, while we might expect a greater equalisation of agricultural land values, a marked change in average values seems unlikely. It follows that, while individual circumstances would vary, landowners, including local authorities and small farmers, would continue to experience a benefit from CAP subsidies. The Government supports the Commission proposal that entitlements should be allocated to active farmers, whether they be owner/occupiers or tenants.

 We have put in place a number of strong legislative measures and checks to the planning system to ensure that playing fields can be protected throughout England, including the Crosby constituency. New planning guidance on open spaces, sport and recreation has also been published which provides robust guidelines for local planning authorities about the need to protect playing fields and open spaces and strongly emphasises 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 122W</I><P>
the need for local authorities to undertake rigorous needs assessments for local playing fields and sports facilities, when considering development on these sites or the creation of new facilities.
<P>

<a name="30603w31.html_para3">This Department recognises the crucial importance of play and in partnership with Sure Start is conducting a review of children's play, which will report in the summer. The review will identify how funding for children's play can be spent most effectively. Although no action has been taken specifically to protect play facilities in the Crosby constituency, the review has identified the need to improve existing play opportunities and develop new ones.

 I announced my intention to proceed with plans to merge the Community fund and New Opportunities fund in February, to create a new community Lottery distributor. The new body would set the pace for modernising delivery of Lottery funding, allowing better coordination and more efficient distribution of funding, and identify and implement programmes to transform communities. We are consulting with the voluntary sector and other interested parties, and these discussions will feed into proposals on the future of Lottery distribution which we intend to publish in the summer.

 It will be for the Bid Company to identify its overall land requirements and the precise location of each of the sporting venues. The Bid Company will be supported in this work by the London Development Agency which is commissioning a master planning exercise for the Lower Lea Valley which encompasses the proposed Olympic zone. The master planning exercise will help to co-ordinate Olympic plans with those currently being developed locally so that the Olympics will complement and reinforce existing regeneration plans in the area.

 An independent cost benefit analysis carried out by Arup for Government, the British Olympic Association and Greater London Authority estimated that costs of acquiring land for a specimen Olympic Games based primarily in the Lower Lea Valley at close to &#163;400 million. The costs of land assembly should be recovered through the subsequent sale or rent of the land.
<P>

<a name="30603w32.html_para4">The LDA has already begun assembling land in the area as part of its wider strategy for regeneration and economic development in the Thames Gateway&#151;an area that has been identified as a priority for development by the Government and the Greater London Authority with or without a successful Olympic bid. During the bid period the LDA will only acquire land which could be used for regeneration purposes should the bid not be successful.

 It is the Government's policy to encourage greater participation in sport and physical activity in all areas of the country and among all groups. Lottery funding both through the Lottery Sports Fund and the New Opportunities Fund has been made available for the provision of new sports facilities in Crosby. Sport England has awarded three community lottery awards in the Crosby constituency totalling &#163;519,229 towards total project costs of &#163;703,181, and 35 awards for all grants totalling &#163;130,481. In addition Sefton LEA's allocation under the New Opportunities Fund PE and sport programme is &#163;3,331,000 towards facilities that will be available to the wider community. Sport England also provided advice in the project to secure the recently opened replacement for Crosby Baths, and will be providing advice on design and planning issues for a second public pool in the Crosby constituency.

 The Government are committed to increasing and improving opportunities for all young people to participate in sporting activities both within and beyond the curriculum. For this reason, the joint DCMS/DfES national strategy for PE, school sport and club links is investing a total of &#163;459 million over three years (from April 2003). Since April 2001 Sefton has been involved in the School Sport Co-ordinator programme with Chesterfield High School being designated as a Specialist Sports College and acting as a hub site for a partnership of local schools. Stanley High School is in the process of being similarly designated and all schools in Sefton will eventually be involved in the programme. In addition, the New Opportunities PE and Sport programme aims to bring about a step change in the provision of sports facilities for young people. Sefton LEA has been allocated &#163;3,331,000 for this.

<a name="30603w35.html_para1">The public service agreement (PSA) targets for the criminal justice system are overarching measures. They apply to all criminal justice agencies working together in the 42 local criminal justice boards. Delivery against the targets and local monitoring of progress towards them are the responsibilities of a wide range of managers at both a local and national level, some within the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and some working for other agencies. Their grades vary according to their respective range and level of responsibility. These diverse arrangements cannot be readily summarised, nor is any central record held of the numbers and grades of those involved.
<P>

<a name="30603w35.html_para2">A new Directorate within CPS Headquarters, the Business Development Directorate (BDD), established in April 2003, has national responsibility for the Service's response to the PSA targets. Its role includes ownership of the business processes and co-ordination of the programme of change and reform needed to support service delivery. It also provides policy and guidance on planning and performance management, together with the provision and analysis of the management information which measures and accounts for our steps towards PSA goals. None of the staff within the BDD works exclusively on monitoring PSA targets: all have other responsibilities related to supporting the 42 CPS areas in realising the Service's demanding reform programme.
<P>

<a name="30603w35.html_para3">BDD is headed by a business development director and, within his overall command, the management of performance falls to the head of resources and performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy that asylum seekers from minority groups, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> the Roma, <i>(b)</i> people from Serbia and Montenegro and <i>(c)</i> people from Kosovo will not be placed in Oakington Immigration Reception Centre pending the outcome of a case filed by the European Roma Rights Centre on 9 May concerning the expulsion of a Kosovo Romani family from Denmark.

 The case filed by the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) with the European Court of Human Rights concerns the removal of a Kosovo Roma family to Kosovo. The UK does not currently enforce the removal of Roma or people from any other Kosovan ethnic minority groups to Kosovo or to other parts of Serbia and Montenegro.
<P>

<a name="30603w35.html_para16">The ERRC case therefore has no bearing on our policy in relation to asylum seekers from Kosovo or other parts of Serbia and Montenegro and there are no plans to alter our arrangements for dealing with these cases.

 Current contracts with accommodation providers are subject to contract compliance monitoring.

 Electronic applications to register with the Criminal Records Bureau were originally expected to be available in August 2001.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Changing the law on people smuggling (by means of the Immigration & Asylum Act 1999), increasing the maximum penalty for facilitating illegal entry to 14 years;
<P>
<BR>
Introducing (and subsequently amending) civil penalty provisions in order to encourage road hauliers to take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorised persons travelling to the UK in their vehicles. Combined with the potential liability of sea carriers to carriers' liability charges the Civil Penalty has also encouraged port authorities and sea carriers to take measures to improve their security, including the searching of vehicles;
<P>
<BR>
Obtaining a Memorandum of Understanding with the French and Belgian authorities to further the exchange of intelligence and joint working to disrupt the flows of illegal immigrants;
<P>
<BR>
Securing a similar agreement with the French which has ensured close collaboration in the fight against cross channel organised immigration crime;
<P>

Co-ordinating all activity against people smugglers through a multi-agency task force, which brings together the combined expertise of the National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service, Immigration Service, police forces, the intelligence community and a range of government departments;

<BR>
Deploying new detection technology, including gamma x-ray scanners at Dover;

<BR>
Securing agreement with the French government for the deployment at Calais of new detection equipment, including thermal imaging and acoustic sensors to help detect people illegally concealed in vehicles and containers and prevent them embarking for the United Kingdom;
<P>
<BR>
Obtaining the agreement of the French authorities for the closure of the Sangatte Refugee Centre;
<P>
<BR>
Concluding agreements with the governments of France and Belgium for the deployment of the new detection technology at other ports in northern continental Europe;

Our Staff Care and Welfare Service will offer basic counselling and staff will be treated through the NHS facilities where appropriate. However, staff are expected to cooperate constructively and continue with remedial action to overcome their problem.

<a name="30603w39.html_para2">Circumstances for Roma are difficult in a number of countries in central and eastern Europe, partly for reasons of societal prejudice and partly because of discriminatory treatment in various forms and to varying degrees.

<P>

<a name="30603w39.html_para3">Human Rights and equality issues with respect to Roma vary from country to country.

 Research conducted by University College London for the Home Office, which will be published on 5 June, suggests that the numbers of people who will migrate to the UK from the new Member States after enlargement will not be significant.

<P>

<a name="30603w39.html_para6">None of this research has been able to predict exact numbers expected from specific countries or ethnic groups to the UK. However, enlargement should improve the quality of life for all citizens in the new Member States as their governments must enforce human rights and minority rights, including protection against racial discrimination, to EU standards before accession and subsequently. EU accession should also improve economic prospects in the new Member States so reducing the incentive for economic migration.

 Passenger traffic at Stranraer is within the Common Travel Area between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, it is not designated as a Port of Entry within the provisions of the Immigration Acts. When available, Immigration Service staff operate at Stranraer in support of Police controls operated by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, from whom suspected immigration offenders are referred. Any person so referred is initially processed by the Immigration Service within police accommodation at Stranraer Police Station. Such persons may then be granted temporary release or transferred to Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre. As Stranraer and Cairnryan are within the Common Travel Area there is no lawful requirement for having a permanent on-entry Immigration control at Stranraer or Cairnryan.

<a name="30603w40.html_para0">The Prison Service's Standard for Clincal Services for Substance Misusers requires every establishment that receives prisoners from court to have detoxification guidelines in place for at least one of Methadone, Lofexidine, and Dihydrocodeine. It also states that, as new evidence becomes available on the Chemical management of detoxification or abstinence, establishments should develop further treatment guidelines which are in line with those available in the NHS. Prison Health expects the use of subutes in prisons to develop at a similar pace to the growth in its use in the community.

 Future policy on the provision of airport capacity will be informed by our published forecasts of demand for air transport services. These forecasts are long-term in nature and necessarily consider the aviation industry in the round. Some parts of the industry have been adversely affected recently by a downturn in global demand. Other sectors, such as the no-frills carriers, have performed well over the same period. Demand will always be subject to short-term fluctuations, but overall we remain confident that our forecasts for the next 30 years are robust.

 The environmental appraisal supporting the consultation took account of the impacts on tranquillity of any future airport development. Closely related environmental impacts, including noise and air quality impacts, were also appraised. The consultation documents, together with supporting background documents, explain the environmental appraisal and key impacts. The consultation documents also invite views on measures for managing environmental impacts. All consultation responses will be considered carefully before final decisions are made in the air transport White paper, which we aim to publish later this year.

 Statistics on the number of vehicles reported to police forces as having been cloned in each of the last five years are not available.
<P>

<a name="30603w41.html_para1">Evidence from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems suggests that cloning is being used by a small minority of motorists to evade fines and charges. In order to combat the problem and prevent people obtaining number plates to which they are not entitled, we have introduced measures to tighten up on the supply of plates. Since 1 January, all suppliers of number plates have been required to register with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and to keep records of sales. Purchasers of plates are required to produce evidence of their identity as well as the vehicle's registration document.
<P>

<a name="30603w41.html_para2">We are now working on measures to make number plates more secure and to ensure that they can be clearly and visibly linked to the vehicle on which they are displayed. A consultation paper on number plate security will be issued shortly.

 The English Regions Cycling Development Team, funded by the Department, is shortly to report on the progress being made by all highway authorities in England to provide facilities for cycling. Their report will identify areas where action is needed to remove barriers to increasing levels of cycling, taking account of the local context, whether rural or urban.
<P>

<a name="30603w41.html_para3">The Department is also supporting a conference at Nottingham University in September this year on "Promoting Cycling in Rural Areas".

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w41.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department for Transport carried out a public consultation last year into proposed changes to legislation controlling the sale of adult pedal cycles, including making it a requirement for a bell to be fitted prior to sale. Those responding included individual cycle owners, suppliers and manufacturers as well as the Bicycle Association of Great Britain, which represents cycle manufacturers and importers, the Association of Cycle Traders, which represents independent dealers, and the Cyclists' Touring Club which is a national organisation of cyclists.
<P>

<a name="30603w41.html_para4">As bells have a strong association with bicycles, the consultation did not address the fitting of other warning devices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the costs and benefits of <i>(a)</i> his Department's campaign to promote helmet-wearing for teenage cyclists and <i>(b)</i> other strategies and campaigns to promote cycle use.  [115841]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w41.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our Road Safety Strategy described the range of activity we are undertaking to make cycling safer, and that does not differentiate between them on grounds of cost and benefit. They all have value and a role to play in helping to reduce cyclist casualties. The strategy addresses the improvement of conditions and infrastructure, driver education, and the measures cyclists can take to protect themselves. As part of that package we said that we would encourage helmet wearing, recognising the evidence that helmets can reduce the severity of head injuries.
<P>

<a name="30603w41.html_para6">We are principally addressing adolescent boys. That is because the rate of deaths and serious injury for boys is about five times that of girls, and the 12 to 15- year age group accounts for about 60 per cent. of deaths and serious injury among boys. We also know that the early 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 164W</I><P>
indications from the 2002 wearing rate survey is that while generally rates have gone up from 16 per cent. in 1994 to 25 per cent. in 2002, for boys, the rate has decreased from 16 per cent. to 12 per cent. So we need to draw their attention to the potential safety benefits of cycle helmets, and the publicity material has been tested with the teenage audience to ensure that they will be receptive to it.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w41.html_wqn12"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the possibility of increased injury risk to cyclists wearing helmets as a result of diffuse axonal injury or subdural haematoma caused by rotational rather than linear impacts to the head.  [115842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w41.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has made no assessment of these specific injury mechanisms. When accident data were collected by the Transport Research Laboratory in the early 1990's those cyclists wearing helmets did not have any head injuries. Those that did sustain a brain injury were not wearing helmets.
<P>

<a name="30603w41.html_para7">A recent independent review of the literature, commissioned by my Department, critically assessed a number of studies to consider the effect of bicycle helmets on head, brain, facial and neck injuries to cyclists. The report concluded that&#151;"Bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injuries. Bicycle helmets have been found to be effective in reducing injury for users of all ages, though particularly for children." Results of this review are available on the Department for Transport website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the relative involvement rate, per kilometre cycled, of <i>(a)</i> helmeted and <i>(b)</i> unhelmeted cyclists in accidents which result in head injuries in the last three years.  [115843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w41.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our current data do not record information on whether or not cyclists were wearing helmets and therefore do not allow an assessment of this nature. However, the Bicycle Helmet Initiative Trust has been running a cycle helmet promotion scheme in Reading since 1992. Their data show that during that time cycle helmet use by children has trebled and there has been a 45 per cent. reduction in the number of hospital treated head injuries, although no data on changes in cycling levels were recorded.

<P>
<a name="30603w42.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The number of people killed and seriously injured in drink-related collisions has fallen significantly since the introduction of drink-driving laws in the 1960s. The effectiveness of these controls is monitored regularly.
<P>

<a name="30603w42.html_para5">The Government consider that enforcement of the law is a key priority for reducing drink-driving casualties. To that end, we are planning to strengthen the police's powers to enable them to carry out evidential breath testing at the roadside. We have also announced our intention to increase penalties for those found guilty of causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs and for repeat drink-drive offenders.

<P>
<P>

 Block allocations to local authorities for smaller (less than &#163;5 million) integrated transport and highway maintenance schemes have been made through the Single Capital Pot since its introduction for 2002&#150;03. Audited local authority expenditure data for that year will not be available until August this year, so there is as yet no firm evidence of its possible impact on authorities' allocation decisions.
<P>

<P>
<a name="30603w43.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Major transport schemes are not funded through the Single Capital Pot. They are funded through separate ear-marked resources.

 This issue was carefully considered prior to the making of the relevant regulations. The theft of historic vehicles is a specialised but lucrative activity. To grant the suggested exemption would deny the protection against vehicle theft that this scheme brings to other motorists.

 No records are currently kept in this country of motoring offences committed overseas by holders of UK driving licences.
<P>

<a name="30603w43.html_para4">Motoring laws can vary widely between countries and they are also subject to changes. It would therefore be impractical for the Government to provide definitive and comprehensive advice on compliance for UK licence holders visiting each country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the function of motorway hard shoulders as defined by <i>(a)</i> departmental guidance and <i>(b)</i> legislation.  [115705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w44.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is no departmental guidance on the function of motorway hard shoulders. The Highway Code (Para. 238) states that

<P>

"you must not drive on the hard shoulder except in an emergency or if directed to do so by signs".




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 172W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
The legislation covering the use of the hard shoulder is the Motorways Traffic (England and Wales) Regulations 1982. These do not set out the function of the hard shoulder but describe what it is and under what circumstances it may be used, which are as set out in the Highway Code.

<P>

[115706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w44.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Neither the Department for Transport nor the Highways Agency has conducted or commissioned research on the effect of hard shoulders on the numbers and severity of accidents. However, the Highways Agency has carried out research on hard shoulder discontinuities such as pinch points near bridges resulting from motorway widening schemes. This research has shown that there is no statistically significant difference in accident rates at hard shoulder discontinuities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reasons the motorway hard shoulder running trial will be extended to other motorways prior to the completion of the trial on the M42.  [115711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w44.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No decisions have been taken on extending active traffic management to sections of the motorway network beyond the pilot study announced for the M42. But as the motoring organisations have argued further trials at other sites would be required before hard shoulder running could be applied more generally. Such trials could be run in parallel with the M42 study.

<a name="30603w44.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No statutory consultation is required.

 The following table shows staff employed in the railways for each year since 1992. The apparently steep fall, especially pronounced after 1995, is due primarily to staff from parts of the former British Rail being reclassified to other sectors such as telecommunications, construction, manufacturing and business services. A 2001 report by the Rail Industry Training Council estimated the number of staff employed in the industry as a whole at that time at between 140,000 and 150,000, broadly comparable with the figure for 1992.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport which companies have been rejected by the Strategic Rail Authority from prequalification in the current franchise replacement programme, and what reasons in each case were given by the Strategic Rail Authority under the terms of the Cabinet Office guidance for non-departmental public bodies.  [115707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w45.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The companies that have failed to pre-qualify for franchises, and the reasons for their failure, are not made public in the interests of commercial confidentiality and maintaining a competitive procurement process. Potential bidders are given confidential feedback. In all cases the aim is to ensure a strong competition that delivers a value for money franchise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w45.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Franchising is a matter for the Strategic Rail Authority under the provisions of the Transport Act 2000. Neither the Act nor the Directions and Guidance to the Authority issued by the Secretary of State under the Act address the pre-qualification process. To pre-qualify prospective bidders must complete questionnaires which the Authority then evaluates and ranks in order of merit. On the basis of that evaluation, the Authority selects not less than three and not more than five bidders to receive Invitations to Tender.

 Travelsafe Officers are civilian employees of South West Trains. They are governed by the same legislation that applies to other employees of this company.

<P>
<a name="30603w46.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

<a name="30603w46.html_para0">In order to combat the problem and prevent people obtaining number plates to which they are not entitled, we have introduced measures to tighten up on the supply of plates.

 The major European, Japanese and Korean car manufacturers have made a commitment to fit ABS to all new cars sold from 1 July 2004. Only certain sports car and specialist vehicle manufacturers are not bound by this commitment. These represent a very small proportion of vehicles entering the vehicle fleet.
<P>

<a name="30603w46.html_para2">The Department for Transport commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory to carry out research into the effectiveness of ABS in reducing accidents. The results indicated a 3 per cent. overall reduction in accidents. The report concluded that, although ABS had the potential to reduce the number of accidents, this had not yet been fully realised, in part because many drivers had little or no knowledge of how ABS can help in an emergency. The Department's Driving Standards Agency is considering how driver understanding of ABS can be improved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will provide rest areas on motorways.  [115921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w46.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My officials are working up proposals to take forward a pilot scheme under which we will provide a purpose-built rest area directly accessed from the motorway network. If successful, such rest areas will be in addition to rest facilities provided by existing motorway service areas, which are available at approximately 30-mile intervals on most of the motorway network in England.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w46.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Watson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many road traffic accidents occurred in the last three years for which figures are available because of <i>(a)</i> motorists and <i>(b)</i> cyclists ignoring red traffic lights.  [115922]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w46.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. Research has established that tiredness is a principle factor in around 10 per cent. of car driver accidents and about 15&#150;20 per cent. of all accidents on motorways and other similar roads
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w46.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Watson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps his Department is taking to prevent road traffic accidents caused by motorists and cyclists ignoring red traffic light signals.  [116027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w46.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Red light enforcement cameras have proved to be highly effective at reducing redlight jumping by motorists and accident casualties have fallen as a result. More are now being deployed within the Safety Camera Netting-off Scheme that allows some fine revenue from fixed penalties to be re-invested in camera activity.
<P>

<a name="30603w46.html_para11">The minority of cyclists who irresponsibly ignore red traffic light signals, putting themselves and other road users at risk are liable to prosecution and the offences of careless and dangerous cycling currently carry maximum fines of &#163;1,000 and &#163;2,500 respectively. Enforcement of the law is of course a matter for the police.

 Funding for rural transport services has been available since 1998&#150;1999 through my Department's Rural Bus Subsidy Grant and Rural Bus Challenge and the Countryside Agency's rural transport schemes. The Rural Bus Subsidy Grant is supporting 1,900 new or improved routes in England on which about 21 million passenger journeys were made in 2001&#150;02, improving access to services and facilities for those living in many rural areas. The Rural Bus Challenge supports innovative rural bus projects and 259 projects have been awarded grants since 1998. These projects have provided many new flexible demand responsive and community transport services throughout England. My Department 



<P>

<a name="30603w47.html_para2">The Countryside Agency administers the Rural Transport Partnership Scheme and since April 2001 the Parish Transport Grant. These schemes are supporting small scale transport projects developed locally by rural communities and parishes to improve accessibility for socially excluded groups. 466 projects, ranging from community transport schemes, wheels-to-work initiatives, public transport information to local walking and cycling improvements, have been supported in 2002&#150;03. The Agency is currently carrying out a study of the impact and effectiveness of the Rural Transport Partnership Scheme, the results of which will be published in Spring 2004.

 The installation of ticket barriers at railway stations is a matter for individual train operating companies.

<P>

 Local authorities write five-year Local Transport Plans (LTPs), and report annually on progress made against those plans. The Government's guidance on LTPs (DETR 2000) stated that authorities would need to promote social inclusion and tackle the transport needs of people on low incomes. Authorities' subsequent progress reports have identified a wide range of local solutions designed to address these concerns.
<P>

<a name="30603w48.html_para3">The publication in February this year of the Social Exclusion Unit's report on transport, "Making the connections", presented new policies to improve people's access to jobs and key services. Particularly, authorities preparing second LTPs (due in 2005) will be asked to conduct accessibility planning. Accessibility planning will aim to identify barriers that prevent those who rely on public transport from accessing jobs and key services. Transport planners will then have to work in partnership with colleagues in other sectors, to agree and then implement action plans that make appropriate improvements.

 Corporation tax is forecast using a microsimulation model on a sample of company tax assessments.

Estimates of receipts and repayments in each financial year are then compiled. Any changes in liabilities arising from Budget and other changes are allowed for. A separate model is used to produce forecasts of corporation tax on North Sea oil and gas.

The potential impacts of combined measures on business competitiveness and fuel poverty will also be taken into account. The Government envisages that the EU trading scheme will play an important role in delivering the emissions reduction ambition set out in the Energy White Paper.

<P>
<a name="30603w50.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Formal links between the EU and Switzerland are governed by separate agreements. 73 such agreements have been signed since 1956. There are currently negotiations at different stages of progress on 10 agreements, one of which concerns the taxation of savings.

 All overseas territories covered by the Feira agreement have expressed a position to the Treasury on the EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on Government plans to ease the tax burden on foster carers.  [116806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w50.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Clause 175 and Schedule 36 of the Finance Bill 2003 provide for a income tax relief for foster carers from April 2003. Foster carers will be exempt from income tax if their total receipts from foster care do not exceed an individual amount. The individual amount will consist of &#163;10,000 per residence plus an additional amount per week per child of &#163;200 a week for each child aged under eleven and &#163;250 a week for each child aged eleven or over. This will ensure that benefits for these carers are applied consistently across the UK, and that they are not unfairly taxed upon the legitimate expenses they incur.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether VAT is levied on <i>(a)</i> the rental of garages and lock-ups by homeowners and <i>(b)</i> council tenants whose house includes a garage or lock-up.  [115820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w50.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Rental charges for garages or lock-ups separate from a house are subject to VAT at the standard rate. Charges levied by private landlords for the letting of houses combined with a garage or lock-up are considered a single supply exempt from VAT, while similar charges levied by councils as part of their statutory obligation are non-business activities, outside the scope of VAT. In either case, no VAT is charged.

 From 11 April Customs took over responsibility for anti-smuggling controls at the frontier for meat and animal products arriving directly from third countries. This implements one of the recommendations of a Cabinet Office Office Study, whose conclusions were announced in the House of Commons by Margaret Beckett in November 2002, into the organisation of controls on products of animal origin, fish, plants and forestry products commissioned following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001.

 The total number of public sector workers in 2001 was 5.259 million. Departments have estimated that public sector employment will increase by over 200,000 between 2003 and 2006 as a result of 2002 Spending Review commitments. This implies an average increase of approximately 70,000 per year. It is for Departments to provide individual workforce projections by region, because they are responsible for their own work force planning.

<P>

<a name="30603w51.html_para4">Under the proposals, the revised charge on leases will value the rent payable over the term of the lease at its net present value (NPV) and there will be a single rate of 1 per cent. of the NPV of rental payments, where the NPV exceeds the zero rate band threshold of &#163;60,000 (for residential property) or &#163;150,000 (for non-residential property).

<a name="30603w51.html_para14">This is particularly relevant for the grant of new leases. Where an election to charge VAT has been made before the effective date for the lease, lease duty will be charged on the VAT element of the lease rent.

This is a relaxation of the position under the current stamp duty regime where consideration is treated as including VAT unless the lease specifically prohibits it being charged, regardless of whether an election has in fact been made. The Government do not intend to make regulations to alter the position described above.

These figures reflect sustained Government investment and progress in the recruitment of teachers, which rose by 4,300, and support staff, up 8,300 in the same period, which should lead to efficiencies in advertising generally.

 The responsibility for providing careers education and guidance to young people in England is shared between schools and the Connexions Service. Schools are responsible for delivering a curriculum-led programme of careers education to all students in Years 9 to 11. A new, non-statutory framework for careers education and guidance&#151;which includes recommended learning outcomes from careers education programmes&#151;was issued to all schools, colleges and work-based training providers in March 2003. We have also signalled our intention to extend the current duty on schools to deliver a planned programme of careers education in Years 9 to 11, down to Years 7 and 8. The work of schools is complemented and strengthened by the Connexions Service, which provides access to information advice and guidance on a wide range of issues&#151;including on learning and career opportunities&#151;to all 13 to 19-year-olds in England. The level and type of support provided is differentiated on the basis of individual need.
<P>

<a name="30603w53.html_para5">The Department makes available &#163;25 million a year, through the local Learning and Skills Councils contracting with education/business links organisations, to promote closer links between schools and business.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what arrangements there are for educating schoolchildren in how better to deal with <i>(a)</i> depression and <i>(b)</i> related emotional help and well-being problems.  [114744]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w54.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Many schools actively adopt a variety of methods to help address the emotional needs of their pupils, including dealing with depression. Some adopt whole-school approaches, working to create a school environment with features designed to promote pupils' emotional well-being. Other schools choose actively to promote emotional well-being through the curriculum by using specific programmes designed to teach emotional, social and behavioural skills. Where

individual pupils could benefit from more intensive support, schools may decide to involve them in individual or group work, such as nurture groups, anger-management training or bereavement support groups, to help address their particular problems. Many schools use a combination of these approaches.
<P>

<a name="30603w54.html_para0">Schools within the Behaviour Improvement Project (BIP) are encouraged and advised on how to respond to the emotional needs of their pupils. In addition, the BIP funds the provision of multi-agency teams who help in the identification and support of those with, or at risk of developing social, emotional and behavioural problems including depression. Known as Behaviour and Education Support Teams (BESTs) they work in targeted primary and secondary schools, and in the community, alongside a range of other support structures and services. The BIP is fully operational in 34 LEAs and will apply to selected schools in a further 27 LEAs, which will be operational from September 2003. The Department is also looking at other ways of extending the spread of this work across schools, primarily through training and guidance.
<P>

<a name="30603w54.html_para1">In June 2001, the DfES issued guidance, "Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings". This is designed to help teachers and others, working alongside mental health professionals, to promote children's mental health and to intervene effectively with those children experiencing problems. There is a section in the guidance on the interventions teachers might use to address specific mental health disorders including depression. Schools are also encouraged to work closely with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Research on effective joint working between schools and CAMHS is given in the DfES Research Report 412, published in April 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many education action zones there are; what qualifies an area to be classified as a zone; and what action has been taken in these zones since they were established to improve education.  [115124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w54.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 There are currently 72 statutory zones (EAZs) made up of over 1,300 schools throughout the country. In Round One, 25 statutory zones were set up between September 1998 and January 1999. A further 48 zones were established between September 1999 and April 2000 in Round Two.
<P>

<a name="30603w54.html_para4">All zones were initially set up for a limited statutory term of three years. All Round One zones and many of the Round Two zones have had their terms extended to the maximum statutory period of five years. Preston EAZ transformed into an Excellence Cluster in December 2002 and was the pilot for our transformation strategy. EAZs have been set up in areas where there is a mixture of social and economic disadvantage where schools are tending to achieve levels of educational performance well below the national average.. They are in both urban and rural areas, wherever groups of schools want to take up the challenge of raising their educational standards.
<P>

<a name="30603w54.html_para5">EAZs have given local partnerships the freedom and resources to propose innovative strategies that would be difficult to put into practise at the level of the individual schools. Partnerships typically comprise a mix of parents, early years providers, businesses, the LEA, community organisations, the Learning Skills Council, careers services, colleges, other statutory agencies (such as health authorities, the youth service and the police) and others.
<P>

<a name="30603w54.html_para6">Zone initiatives generally focus on six main themes: improving the quality of teaching, improving the quality of learning, social inclusion, providing support to families, providing support to pupils and working with business and other organisations.

A significant reduction in the number of EAZ schools on special measures;
<P>
<BR>
Her Majesty's Chief Inspector's (HMCI) Annual Report, published by OFSTED in February 2002 described most of the first round EAZs inspected as "making reasonable progress", and said that "almost four-fifths of the major individual initiatives covered in detail were beginning to offer good value at the time of the inspections".

<a name="30603w54.html_para8">Our Transformation Strategy on the future of EAZs, announced in November 2001, aims to continue to support ex-EAZ schools through the Excellence in Cities (EiC) initiative. When zones come to the end of their five-year statutory period, they will transform either to an EiC Action Zone in an EiC area, or an Excellence Cluster outside of an EiC area. The ethos of the Transformation Strategy is to rationalise our area-based programmes for under performing schools, to target resources where they are most needed and to reduce the burden and bureaucracy on these struggling schools.

Participation rates have been calculated using the 17-year-old population from the previous year to reduce the distortion caused to LEA populations by the migration of students to their place of study. England figures include a very small number of accepted applicants of unknown English domicile. Population figures relate to persons aged 17 at 31 August in the year prior to entry, counts taken at the following 1 January; accepted applicants are aged 18 at 30 September in the year of entry.<P>

 I am not aware of plans to merge or close any further or higher education institution in Hampshire. There are always a number of potential changes being discussed locally; the majority of which do not result in a formal proposal to the Secretary of State. More further and higher education institutions are entering into strategic alliances to increase collaboration both within each sector and across sectors. However, one school sixth form in the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Learning and Skills Council Area has recently decided to close due to falling numbers of students in an area well provided with high quality colleges.

 The available information, as given in the table, covers only those who apply to full-time and sandwich undergraduate courses through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS); data on the family background of students applying to part-time courses are not held centrally. In 2002 UCAS moved to recording social class using the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) measure. There is no method of converting between the two measures of social class. As a result, the figures for 2002 entry are given in a separate table. There was an increase in entrants in 1997/98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE in that year rather than wait until 1998/99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998/99 before entrants started to increase again in 1999/00.
<P>

<a name="30603w55.html_para6">The Government are committed to raising the participation rates for people from less affluent backgrounds, and has introduced the Aimhigher programme, which is targeted at raising attainment and aspirations among young people who traditionally would not consider going to university.

<a name="30603w55.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The available information on non-completion rates is contained in "Performance Indicators in Higher Education", published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), copies of which are available from the House Library. The figures cover full-time first degree courses only, and show, for each individual HE institution in the UK, the proportion of entrants who failed to complete their course. Copies of the HEFCE publication are available for students starting courses in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98, 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000. The next edition, covering students starting courses in 2000/01, is scheduled for publication in autumn 2003.
<P>

<a name="30603w55.html_para7">Nationally, the non-completion rate has remained broadly the same at 17&#150;18 per cent. since 1991&#150;92, a period of considerable expansion of student numbers.

<P>
<a name="30603w56.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 ICT is a priority for this Government and is compulsory for all pupils aged five to 16. We have put in place the infrastructure to enable schools to use ICT in teaching and learning across the curriculum by equipping schools with modern ICT facilities; creating a National Grid for Learning that provides a rich source of classroom materials and providing training for teachers through the New Opportunities Fund. Our Key Stage 3 strategy for 11 to 14-year-olds has a specific focus on teaching and learning using ICT. Our Key Stage 4 proposals for 14 to 16-year-olds include greater development of ICT skills through other subjects and greater opportunity for pupils to gain qualifications which recognise their ICT capability. Ofsted reports show ICT teaching is good in over three primary schools in five and is generally sound in secondary schools.
<P>

<a name="30603w56.html_para0">There is a range of courses designed to allow students to demonstrate their proficiency in ICT. For students who wish to develop their skills as advanced ICT users, the GCE A level is available. Alternatively, the GCE A level in computing is appropriate for proficient students with aspirations of becoming ICT specialists.

In the White Paper we set out proposals to improve the financial support for part-time students including providing fee support for those on low incomes, a new means tested grant to help with the costs faced by the students and support for childcare costs.

<P>

<a name="30603w57.html_para6">It is important that student services in higher education institutions develop in order to support a more diverse student population as we widen access. Institutions are however responsible for deciding what services they need to provide and how best to deliver them in light of their circumstances and those of their students. One measure of their success is the rate of student retention. HEFCE will be monitoring the performance of individual institutions in this area through the continued publication of performance indicators and will be working with institutions to bear down on non-completion.

From September 2003, a new science GCSE, Science in the 21st Century, will be piloted in 50 schools. The aim is to provide a sound and stimulating science education for all students whether they become consumers, users or producers of science. We are currently consulting on the programme of study for science at Key Stage 4, following a review by the QCA. In partnership with the Wellcome Trust, we are creating a national network of science learning centres that will provide innovative training for science teachers and technicians, aiming to bring the excitement of science into the classroom, including encouraging more young women to continue studying science post-16. We are also developing innovative materials and teacher training to improve the teaching and learning of A Level biology, chemistry and physics.

 There are 6,938 state funded schools with a religious character in England.
<P>

<a name="30603w58.html_para4">Schools with a religious character, often called faith schools or religious schools, are funded by local education authorities for their recurrent costs on the same basis as other maintained schools of the same type, ie primary or secondary. Government grants, for example, Standards Fund grant, are also payable on the same basis as for other maintained schools of the same type.
<P>

<a name="30603w58.html_para6">Capital funding for schools not in the voluntary aided sector, irrespective of whether or not they are faith schools, is provided on the same basis for all categories of the same type of maintained schools, including the allocation of direct capital funding on the basis of a national formula, and access to local education authority formulaic funding in line with the priorities of the local asset management plan.
<P>

<a name="30603w58.html_para7">It is for promoters to put forward proposals to establish a school. Any new faith school must have the agreement of parents and the local community. Most decisions about whether or not a new faith school should open in England will be made locally&#151;by the School Organisation Committee for the area, following local consultation, or by the Schools Adjudicator if the Committee cannot agree. In the case where a local education authority identifies a need for an additional secondary school, new procedures from 1 June will require them to hold a competition to run it and the Secretary of State will make the decision, after receiving comments from the School Organisation Committee.
<P>

<a name="30603w58.html_para8">At present there is no right of appeal against unanimous rejection by the School Organisation Committee: in future promoters who are not represented on the School Organisation Committee, including those from minority faiths, will be able to appeal to the Schools Adjudicator.
<P>

<a name="30603w58.html_para9">We have not made an assessment of the effects of religious segregation in state education.

The remaining schools, previously on more generous levels of funding, are protected by our Real Terms Guarantee to ensure funding is maintained in real terms at historic levels, provided pupil numbers are maintained. The LSC has been responsive to the higher than expected growth in pupil numbers and higher than expected pupil retention in school sixth forms in 2002/03. The figure above includes additional sums to those originally planned, which the LSC has now allocated to school sixth form funding for 2002/03. Our assessment of the impact of the new LSC funding system on secondary schools with sixth forms is that it has been beneficial in ensuring that funding levels are protected or increased in real terms, and that successful school sixth forms are rewarded.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the cost was of collecting university tuition fees from students in the London Borough of Havering in the latest year for which figures are available.  [115342]<P>

<a name="30603w60.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Higher education institutions themselves, not local authorities, bear the cost of collecting student contributions to tuition fees. We do not have centrally-held data on the cost to institutions, but an element of institutional funding covers the cost of administration in collecting the fee contributions.

These programmes were designed to attract career-changers and, in tapping a new source of recruits, have more than bridged any shortfalls in conventional recruitment.
<P>

<a name="30603w60.html_para2">Recruitment to courses of initial teacher training in England fell for eight years in succession from 1992/93. Since the introduction of teacher training bursaries in September 2000, numbers of new entrants to teacher training have risen year on year. There have been 20 per cent. more new entrants to conventional teacher training courses in the current academic year than in 1999/2000. Figures published by the Graduate Teacher Training Registry on 7 May showed that there have been 38,118 applications for Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses so far this year, over 5,500 more than at the same point in 2002.
<P>

<a name="30603w60.html_para3">The increase in the numbers of entrants to teacher training that the Government's policies has secured has been accompanied by rising numbers of qualified teachers working in schools.

From September 2002, these incentives are being reinforced by a scheme to repay, over time, the student loans of new teachers of the priority subjects. These incentives have helped to ensure that recruitment to initial teacher training is higher than its 1999/2000 level by 29 per cent. in mathematics; 14 per cent. in science; and 41 per cent. in technology. Figures published by the Graduate Teacher Training Registry on 7 May 2003 show that applications for postgraduate teacher training courses for 2003/04 are currently running above last year's level by 36 per cent. in mathematics; by 14 per cent. in science; and by 44 per cent. in technology.

 The Teachers' Pension Scheme is a final salary scheme that provides retirement benefits based on  <sup>1</sup> /80 of salary for each year of pensionable service. The normal pension age is currently 60. Pensions in payment are up-rated each year in line with movements in the Retail Prices index. In addition a tax free lump sum equivalent to three years pension is payable on retirement. Arrangements also exist for the early payment of benefits on the grounds of permanent ill health. Teachers pay a contribution of 6 per cent. of salary and their employers contribute a further 13.5 per cent. of salary towards the cost of the Teachers' Pension Scheme.
<P>

<a name="30603w61.html_para1">The provisions of the Teachers' Pension Scheme are currently under review in the light of the proposals contained in the Pensions Green Paper "Security, Simplicity and Choice" and the Inland Revenue consultation on simplifying the taxation of pensions. Any changes to the scheme will be subject to full consultation with representatives of teacher and employer associations and other interested parties.

<a name="30603w62.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 April 2003]:</i> Overall responsibility for work placement arrangements rests with the local education authority or school governing body on its behalf. The Department provides &#163;25 million a year, via the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), for school/business links activities. Around &#163;10 million goes towards the costs of the work experience programme. Central guidance and advice is provided by the Department and LSC to help local partners provide high quality placements. This guidance emphasises the importance of ensuring placements are properly integrated within pupils' programmes of study, but we recognise the need for improvements in practice. As I said in my answer to the hon. Member on 8 April, we are taking steps to promote improvements in the context of our wider plans for work related learning.
<P>

<a name="30603w62.html_para0">For learners to gain a full NVQ they must complete a significant amount of learning in the workplace. Placements are usually arranged by the learning provider.

 In April 2002 President Karzai announced an eradication programme to tackle the 2002 opium poppy crop.

 As Mr. Meldrum is an American citizen, the Government do not have formal grounds for making consular representations on his behalf. However, the High Commissioner in Harare raised Mr. Meldrum's case with the acting Secretary (most senior official) at Zimbabwe's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ahead of Andrew Meldrum's deportation on 16 May 2003. He urged compliance with court orders barring deportation, and stressed that denying US consular officials access to Mr. Meldrum was unacceptable. High Commission staff have also kept in close touch with Mr. Meldrum in recent weeks, as well as attending the High Court hearings into his case and assisting Guardian staff when they visited Harare earlier this month.

 In the year 2002&#150;03 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's separately identifiable expenditure on advertising totalled &#163;602,670.

 The UK Government have not received any of the requested information from the UN Expert Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
<P>

<a name="30603w63.html_para0">Since 3 February, the UK Government have made several further requests to the Panel for information. On 11 March the UK's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN asked for specific information relating UK linked companies and individuals to the exploitation of natural resources in the DRC. The UK's National Contact Point for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has asked the Panel on several occasions, including at the OECD's conference in Paris on 11 April, for details of communications with UK linked companies alleged to have breached OECD guidelines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w63.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There have been no recent ministerial discussions on drug crime or piracy with Far Eastern Governments.
<P>

<a name="30603w63.html_para1">The Government are concerned at the level of piracy reported from the region and have participated in initiatives to raise the profile of this problem. In 2002, the UK and Philippine Governments took the lead in organising an EU-ASEAN Experts meeting on piracy and crimes at sea. Last year, the FCO sponsored delegations from the region to attend an international seminar on maritime violence. The UK continues to press the European Commission and EU Partners to follow up initiatives against this form of crime.
<P>

<a name="30603w63.html_para2">We monitor the regional threat to UK interests from other forms of organised crime. In response, we have concluded an agreement with the Chinese Government to post a Liaison Officer from the National Crime Squad to our embassy in Beijing. In addition, the remit of the regional Drugs Liaison Officer based in Hong Kong is being widened. He will in future cover serious crimes such as money laundering, the criminal facilitation of illegal immigration, the export of precursor chemicals for the production of class A drugs, the activities of paedophiles and the production and smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes.

 British Government policy is that war criminals and those responsible for crimes against humanity should be brought to justice.

 The UK, US and Spain have tabled a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council, a key element of which is the proposed establishment of a Development Fund for Iraq (previously known as the Iraq Assistance Fund). The aim of the fund is to meet costs associated with meeting the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, reconstruction and the establishment of a representative Government in Iraq. An integral part of this process will

 The UN Special Representative, as proposed in the draft Resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain, would be responsible for coordinating UN and international agencies' work in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction activities in Iraq. The Representative would be specifically tasked with facilitating the reconstruction of key infrastructure and promoting economic reconstruction.
<P>

[115701]<P>

<P>
<a name="30603w64.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The ICRC presently has Restoring Family Links (RFL) facilities in five centres in Iraq: Baghdad, Erbil, Dohuk, Sulymaniah and Basra. In addition, mobile tracing units have been set up at seven other sites: Mosul, Kirkuk, Nasiriyah, Amarah, Najaf, Kerbala and Samawa. More mobile units will be deployed following a forthcoming increase in capacity.
<P>

<a name="30603w64.html_para4">British forces are assisting the ICRC in its provision of RFL services by providing ICRC delegates with relevant field security information, thus allowing them to gain access to potential beneficiaries.

<a name="30603w64.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The fall of Saddam Hussein's regime brought to an end a long period of violations of the Iraqi people's human rights. As requested in UN Security Council Resolution 1483, put forward by the UK, US and Spain and adopted on 22 May, the UN Secretary-General has appointed a Special Representative whose responsibilities include the promotion of human rights. The UN, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, is examining how to take this forward. This might include the deployment of UN human rights monitors. We aim to work closely with the Special Representative. In addition, working to support the people of Iraq in moving toward the establishment of representative government based on the rule of law and affording equal rights and justice to all Iraqi citizens is the best means to ensure that their human rights are protected.

 Power, water and sewerage systems in Basra were in a poor state before the recent conflict. Royal Engineers are playing a vital role in repairing and restoring Iraqi power supplies. 80 per cent. of Basra now has power and access to running water, which is substantially better than before the conflict. UK forces and NGOs are working to replenish water treatment chemicals and 75 per cent. of the city is covered by a sewerage system.

<a name="30603w64.html_para7">Forces have been working to secure conditions for UN agencies and NGOs to take over responsibility for humanitarian relief.

 Since the volcanic crisis of 1995&#150;97, one of the main priorities for Montserrat has been a return to self-sufficiency. Substantial redevelopment of the habitable part of Montserrat has been achieved, mainly through support (totalling &#163;180 million to date) provided by the Department for International Development (DFID). To support Montserrat's return to self-sufficiency, a further &#163;45.6 million in DFID support has been earmarked for the period 2002&#150;03 to 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30603w65.html_para0">Another major concern is the continuing safety of the people on the island. The volcano is still active and constantly monitored. The dome of the volcano continues to grow and is the largest it has ever been and all the evidence indicates that the level of hazard is increasing as the dome grows. For public safety, around two-thirds of the southern part of the island remains an exclusion zone. The exclusion zone is reviewed regularly and was extended last October after careful consideration of scientific advice.

 Improving business competitiveness through international trade and investment is an important element of the FCO's work, reflected in its Public Service Agreement Objectives. British Trade International was established in 1999 to bring together the trade promotion activities of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Its priorities and activities are reported annually in its Departmental Report, the latest of which was published on 16 May 2003, Cm 5915.

<P>
<a name="30603w66.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The security situation continues to cause concern, and is hampering the operations of NGOs and UN agencies in the south and eastern provinces of Afghanistan. Reconstruction projects are continuing, however, although a lack of security may affect efforts to refurbish roads in some parts of the south and east.
<P>

<a name="30603w66.html_para0">The deployment of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) is designed to facilitate improved security in the regions and extend the authority of the Afghan Transitional Administration. The US have already deployed three PRTs to Gardez, Bamiyan and Kunduz provinces. The UK has recently announced its intention to lead a PRT in Mazaar-l-Shariff in the north of Afghanistan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w66.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 I am not aware of any non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which have left Afghanistan due to the deteriorating security situation in parts of the south. In southern Afghanistan, particularly following the killing of an international ICRC worker in March 2003, some NGOs temporarily suspended their operations in the more remote areas and withdrew, either back to the regional centre at Kandahar, or to the capital, Kabul. Most of these, such as Mercy Corps International (MCI), Oxfam, Tear Fund, Action Contre La Faim (ACF) and Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), do, however, continue to operate. The major change as result of insecurity has been in their mode of operation, forcing them to concentrate on more secure areas around Kandahar.

 US $4.5 billion was pledged by donors at the Tokyo conference in January 2002 over a period of between one and five years, depending on the donor. US $1.8 billion was disbursed last year to Afghanistan. A similar amount has been pledged for the current financial year. Donors such as the US, who had only made one-year pledges at the Tokyo conference, used the Afghan Development Forum held in March 2003 to make new pledges. The total pledged now stands at US $5.2 billion.

 The amount and forms of total bilateral assistance that DFID has given to individual countries is shown in tables 7.1 to 7.5 in the DFID publication, "Statistics on International Development". The 2002 edition contains figures relating to the years 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02, the latest for which data are available. A copy can be found in the House of Commons Library, or alternately, on DFID's website at: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Pubs/files/SID2002 main.pdf
<P>

<a name="30603w66.html_para3">In these tables, the column headed 'Programme Aid' is non-project financing that benefits the Central Government budget. In the same set of tables, the column titled 'Total DFID Programme' shows the total bilateral assistance given to a country in that year by DFID. In some cases, budget support is given to a particular sector as part of a sector-wide initiative. These figures are included in the 'Project or Sector Aid' column, but the element supporting sector budgets is not separately recorded.

 The Secretary of State visited Botswana on 1&#150;2 April 2003 as Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for Africa. During her visit she discussed with the Government of Botswana the issue of the relocation of the bushmen from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Her discussion was the latest in a continuing dialogue between the two Governments about the bushmen and about wider poverty issues in Botswana.

 DFID did not provide funding for programmes specifically focused on internally displaced people in Burma in 2002&#150;03. However, internally displaced people are likely to be among the beneficiaries of a UNICEF-led immunisation programme in Burma for which DFID provided &#163;567,000 in 2002&#150;03. In addition, part of DFID's &#163;1.5 million support for work in Burma by the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2002&#150;03 contributed to meeting water and sanitation needs in areas with internally displaced people. DFID did not provide funds for environmental projects in Burma in 2002&#150;03.

 CDC Capital Partners, the trading name of CDC Group plc, a company wholly owned by the government, was established in 1999 as a result of the Commonwealth Development Corporation Act. We have no plans to privatise this company. We are however currently in the process of preparing for its re-organisation. The purpose and format of this re-organisation were set out in a Written Statement tabled by the Secretary of State for International Development on 27 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 37WS. It was also described in evidence given by Ministers, officials and CDC management to the Select Committee on International Development in December 2002.

 Following a strategic review in 2002, it was concluded that CDC would narrow its focus and concentrate on making investments in defined geographies and sectors&#151;primarily, Africa and South Asia and the SME and power sectors. It is intended that CDC will raise third party funds for Africa later this year.

 16 Commonwealth (including UK) nationals have been made redundant since July 2002. This is mainly due to office closures or the fact that certain CDC-employed Commonwealth nationals have bought out a business from CDC or have stayed with the new owners of a business that CDC has sold.

<a name="30603w68.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what <i>(a)</i> the estimated cost and <i>(b)</i> the actual cost of the Chad/Cameroon pipeline project was; and if he will make a statement on the sustainability of the project.  [115423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w68.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The cost of this project is estimated at US $3.7 billion, the majority of which is being provided by the private sector. The project is still under implementation. We therefore do not have figures for the actual cost, nor have we made any projections. The World bank group undertook careful assessment of financial and environmental sustainability issues when the project was first designed and continue to monitor such questions.

<a name="30603w68.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID is not directly involved in funding or implementing this project. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation who are providing financing expect commercial organisations which receive funds to prepare audited financial reports on the basis of internationally recognised accounting standards.

<a name="30603w68.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what the status is of the design change order for the Chad/Cameroon pipeline project.  [115425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w68.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID is not providing direct financial support to this project. We therefore do not have first-hand information on detailed implementation issues such as design change orders. We have raised this issue with IFC staff who inform us that on a large project such as this, one might expect many design change orders and that as long as they do not affect the project's compliance with environmental and social safety guidelines, there should be no need for concern. There is a process in the World bank group for monitoring the project's compliance with the terms of agreements.

<P>
<a name="30603w68.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 While DFID is implementing the Government's 100 per cent. bilateral debt relief policy, the cost of financing this policy is being met by HM Treasury. At the time of the Chancellor's announcement in December 1999, he made it clear that the money paid to ECGD for the countries qualifying for HIPC debt relief would be additional to the international development budget.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w68.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development if he will list the payments made by the Department to the ECGD for debt relief, and the dates on which they were made; and if he will list the payments made by the Treasury to his Department in order to cover this debt relief, and the dates on which such payments were made.  [115103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w68.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 To date, DFID has paid &#163;42,359,392 to ECGD in respect of claims made under the Government's 100 per cent. bilateral debt relief policy. I attach a list of payments, including the dates they fell due, to ECGD. Of this amount, HM Treasury transferred &#163;37,004,492 to DFID in the Spring Supplementary Estimates for 2001&#150;02 (covering payments in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02) and 2002&#150;03. DFID also received &#163;6.5 million for 2002&#150;03 and a further &#163;6.5 million for 2003&#150;04 in the Spending Review 2002

 A full and detailed national nutritional survey is not immediately feasible because security conditions in many parts of Iraq are preventing humanitarian agencies' access to households. However, a few agencies, including UNICEF, have undertaken local rapid nutritional assessments in order to gain rough indicators of malnutrition levels.

 Our information on refugee movements, as well as those of internally displaced citizens in Liberia derives from reports of the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), in Monrovia. HMG does not have a permanent representation there. The reports, and those of other agencies, are generally available on the Relief website. Continuing war in Liberia has led to increased refugee flows into surrounding countries. Latest estimates from the UN (as at April 2003) indicate that some 225,000 Liberians were officially registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. This figure was swelled during the last week (to 28 May 2003), when more than 15,000 crossed the eastern border into Cote D'Ivoire.

 None. However we are concerned about recruitment of trained medical personnel from developing countries. The Department of Health (DoH) introduced a Code of Practice in 2001 designed to prevent such recruitment. The DoH has listed particular countries from which active recruitment should be avoided. Malawi is one of these. DFID is working with DoH to ensure the Code is effective. However the Code of Practice is only applicable to NHS recruitment. Anecdotal evidence shows that UK private recruitment agencies continue to recruit from Malawi, and other countries on the DoH list. DFID is gathering evidence on the exact nature and scale of such recruitment to determine if action can be taken to reduce its impact.

 There has been localised flooding in the Juba and Shabelle river basins in Somalia, particularly in the Jowhar, Jamame, Bualle and Jilib districts. The risk of flooding has been compounded by farmers opening up river-banks to facilitate flood cultivation.

The main sorghum and maize harvest of 2002 was up by as much as 40 per cent. from average years and 80 per cent. up on the 2001 harvest.

 The number of cases of Guinea worm (Dracunculiasis) worldwide has dropped 98 per cent. from 3.5 million to 50,000, in only a little more than 10 years.

Sudan is home to nearly 80 per cent. of the world's remaining cases (and of these as many as 99 per cent. are in the south), and therefore, clearly a target for continuing eradication efforts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w73.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Zimbabwe is still facing an acute humanitarian crisis. Although there is likely to be a modest increase in the maize crop, many Zimbabweans will remain vulnerable due to a poorly managed and funded Government food distribution programme; dramatic economic decline&#151;particularly rising inflation and unemployment; and chronic illness (particularly AIDS).
<P>

<a name="30603w73.html_para0">People in the south and west, where there has been little or no crop, are particularly vulnerable, as are approximately 200,000 farm workers&#151;perhaps 1 million people with their families&#151;who lost livelihoods after the fast track land programme. DFID is awaiting more details on the numbers and the location of populations at risk from the national vulnerability assessment, FAO/WFP crop survey and the national nutrition survey, which will give more precise information on the scale of the humanitarian crisis.
<P>

<a name="30603w73.html_para1">DFID support for the humanitarian crisis will continue in 2003&#150;4 through NGOs and UN feeding programmes. At this stage we envisage the DFID response will be on similar scale to last year.

 In the last year, the Government of Zimbabwe has imported 700,000 tonnes of maize, though the targeting and distribution of this food has not been transparent and has been criticised by Zimbabweans as erratic and biased. Many areas have received no

distribution from Government sources for up to six months. Donors have imported and distributed around 300,000 tonnes of maize. This has been distributed to vulnerable people according to humanitarian principles and has been monitored closely.
<P>

<a name="30603w73.html_para2">The national nutrition and health survey is expected to confirm that, overall, the aid effort in the last year has been successful, although there are areas with raised levels of malnutrition, unmet needs and continuing dependence on food aid. The prospects for the coming year remain dismal. The Government of Zimbabwe have yet to release a revised crop forecast or the results of a vulnerability assessment and the afore-mentioned national health and nutrition survey. They have no public plans to address the situation, and it seems likely that despite a higher maize harvest, the need for humanitarian assistance may be as high or even greater than last year as the collapsing economy limits the Government's capacity to import food.

The Antonov AN-124 is used in a heavy-lift role and is primarily utilized for the movement of out-sized or wheeled loads which exceed the capacity of RAF aircraft.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what service housing is available to military personnel; how much has been <i>(a)</i> sold, <i>(b)</i> built and <i>(c)</i> improved since 1997; what plans he has to integrate military families with surrounding civilian families; and what support is available to military personnel with families unable to find suitable accommodation.  [115162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w74.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) maintains about 50,000 family properties for allocation to Service personnel in mainland United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para0">About 16,000 surplus properties have been disposed of since 1997, mainly by release to Annington Homes Ltd. to whom most of the family housing stock (other than in Scotland) had already been sold in 1996 under a sale and leaseback agreement.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para1">Since its formation in 1995, the DHE has acquired about 2,380 new build houses for Service families in locations where existing housing was insufficient or required rebuilding.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para2">The overall condition of the housing stock has been improved substantially. Since the formation of DHE in 1995, the number of properties at Standard 1 for Condition has risen from about 1,000 to about 21,000. This has been achieved partly through upgrade and improvement work and partly by disposal and selective rebuilding.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para3">Service families are not left unable to find suitable accommodation. Normally DHE keeps houses waiting for people, not people waiting for houses. In the event that DHE locally has insufficient properties for entitled Service families, arrangements are made to rent additional properties from the private sector.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para4">The substantial disposal programme for surplus MOD housing has contributed significantly to the integration of military and civilian families. Although available for the population generally, a significant minority of ex-MOD houses are believed to have been bought by Service or ex-Service personnel.

[115790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w74.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The locations and formats of the personnel records, including medical and disciplinary records, of members of Her Majesty's Armed Forces who have died vary according to their Service and the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 2003 : Column 288W</I><P>
age of the records. Service personnel records are now normally held by the Ministry of Defence for 100 years from date of birth for administrative purposes, with those records over 30 years old being retained with the authority of the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para5">The surviving personnel records of those who served up to the early part of the last century are now publicly available in the National Archives at Kew, though the exact dates of the records available vary according to Service.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para6">Information from the records of deceased personnel still held by the MOD is normally only disclosed to the next of kin or to those authorities with a legitimate reason to receive the information, such as HM Coroner or the Police. Otherwise it is Departmental policy to obtain the consent of the next of kin as part of the consideration for a request for disclosure. Access to the medical records of deceased service personnel is normally governed by the Access to Medical Health Records Act 1990. Outside this, medical information is not normally disclosed without the consent of the personal representative or the next of kin.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assistance is given to local areas to raise <i>(a)</i> the level of and <i>(b)</i> finance available to cadet forces.  [115616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w74.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Army Cadets and the Air Training Corps are voluntary youth organisations sponsored by the Ministry of Defence and are funded appropriate to the way they are organised. The MOD provides support to both the Army Cadet Force (ACF) and the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) in the form of financial assistance, material and limited regular Army manpower resources. The Air Cadet Organisation is funded in a similar way. Efforts at a local level to raise the profile of, and finance available to, cadet forces must be conducted within the finite resources allocated.
<P>

<a name="30603w74.html_para7">The Sea Cadet Corps (SCC), unlike the Cadet Corps of the other two services who receive the majority of their funding from the MOD, is an independent youth movement administered by the Sea Cadet Association (SCA), which is a registered charity. The MOD support for the SCC is defined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the SCA agreed in July 2001. Under the MOU we provide annual funding that helps to provide for the HQ for the SCA and covers the cost of a number of personnel. Due to their independent, charitable status, SCC units are responsible for their own affairs such as raising their public profile and funding.

 The cost of publishing the Ministry of Defence's annual Performance Report 2000&#150;01 (Cm 5290) was largely borne by The Stationery Office, with whom the contract for producing Command Papers is held. The Stationery Office recoups these costs on a commercial basis through sales of the Reports.
<P>

<a name="30603w75.html_para0">The total cost to the Ministry of Defence was made up of two main elements: the number of copies purchased from TSO for our own use (e.g. internal distribution, MOD libraries), plus any additional printing/publication costs not covered by the TSO contract (e.g. overtime, special finishes or colours). For the 2000&#150;01 Departmental Performance Report, the MOD paid The Stationery Office &#163;12,610.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w75.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The efficiency target set for the Department in its 2002 Public Service Agreement is to increase value for money by making improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the key processes supporting the delivery of military capability, such as training, equipment acquisition, and logistics. In percentage terms, the Department aims to achieve output efficiency averaging 2.5 per cent. per annum over the period from 2002&#150;03 to 2005&#150;06.

 Throughout the military campaign, Coalition forces have taken tremendous care to ensure that damage to museums and other sites of historic, archaeological or cultural importance has been minimised. Great care was taken to ensure that such sites were not targeted by Coalition aircraft. Ground troops were briefed on the need to be especially careful while conducting operations in the vicinity of these sites.

 Under the terms of an agreement reached between the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia at the outset of the conflict, prisoners of war captured by UK forces were held for an initial period by UK personnel before being transferred into the custody of the US. At present, therefore, only US personnel are carrying out guarding duties for prisoners of war held in Iraq.

<P>
<a name="30603w78.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The priorities for legal aid expenditure are cases where the rights of citizens may be at risk, and cases involving social exclusion. Within these broad priorities, we have to judge which cases have the highest priority. The Lord Chancellor directs each year how much of the legal aid budget can be spent on the Community Legal Service. But ring-fencing this budget could, in certain circumstances, result in funds ceasing to be available within the overall legal aid budget for those cases which have the highest priority, for example, those where there is a risk of imprisonment. It would, therefore, be neither desirable nor possible (because of obligations under the Human Rights Act) to ring-fence one part of the legal aid budget.

<P>
<P>

 ECGD's application process requires certain details of agents' commission to be disclosed to ECGD in order that it can follow its due diligence procedures.

 For projects where the cover has been made available since September 2001, ECGD understands all are so far proceeding within the original cost. About 8 per cent. have required a time extension.

Some of these representations indicated that increased costs of insurance were not necessarily uniform across a particular trade, and that some businesses were therefore placed at a competitive disadvantage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w88.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In its first term (1997&#150;2001), the Government introduced a foundation of minimum standards in the workplace. Every employee now has, for example, the right to a minimum wage, paid holidays, rest breaks, time off for family emergencies, and a cap on the working week. Part-time workers have the same rights as their full-time colleagues. Since October 2002 there have also been specific protections for fixed- term employees not to be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees on the grounds that their employment is for a fixed term. We have also reduced the qualifying period for unfair dismissal from two years to one year.
<P>

<a name="30603w88.html_para3">The Government has strengthened trade union rights. For example, trade unions have the right to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes where a majority of the relevant workforce wants it. We have also placed union learning representatives on a statutory footing giving them clear time off rights. The law now enable workers to be accompanied at a disciplinary and grievance hearing by a trade union official or a fellow worker. To complement this right, the Employment Act 2002 introduced statutory grievance and disciplinary procedures, which will ensure that all employees have access to decent workplace procedures.
<P>

<a name="30603w88.html_para4">In its second term the Government is building on all these measure, including a range of changes to the tax credit system such as the new Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit which will provide a simpler and more streamlined system to support families and to make work pay. Around six million families are expected to benefit from the new credits.
<P>

<a name="30603w88.html_para5">The Government has also improved existing maternity rights and introduced paid paternity and adoption leave for the first time. For example the payment period of Statutory Maternity Pay and Maternity Allowance has been extended to 26 weeks.
<P>

<a name="30603w88.html_para6">The Government has recently laid before the House regulations to tackle discrimination in employment on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation and disability.

 Following the European Court of Justice ruling of 13 May 2003 on state-owned 'golden' shares, we are reviewing the situation in regard to special shares held by the Department of Trade and Industry (including those for National Grid, Rolls Royce, BAE Systems and British Energy) to ensure that such share holdings comply with EU law and continue to be in the public interest. State-owned shares in BAA and NATS are a matter for the Department for Transport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w89.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Developing countries have a significant interest in the Doha Development Agenda. Halving protection in agriculture, industrial goods and services around the world could boost developing country incomes by around $150 billion a year. Substantial trade liberalisation could reduce the number of people living in poverty by over 300 million by 2015&#151;a significant contribution to reaching the UN's Millennium Development Goals.
<P>

<a name="30603w89.html_para0">To achieve this we are working for a fairer international trading system for all WTO members with a particular emphasis on developing countries. In particular the Government is committed to working with our EU and other international partners to ensure that real and meaningful increases in market access in agriculture, and other areas of particular interest to developing countries, are agreed in the current WTO trade negotiations. At the same time the Government fully recognises that developing countries require trade related technical assistance and capacity building to increase their ability to participate effectively in the WTO. The Government has committed &#163;45 million specifically for this and other trade-related initiatives since 1998.

policies in careful sequence so that developing countries efforts to liberalise trade maximise the potential benefits and minimise the costs of trade reform. The Government supports an approach to the current WTO negotiations that recognises that WTO members are at different stages of development and have different capacities to implement WTO rules. To help countries manage their commitments, we are pressing for Special and Differential Treatment provisions to be real and binding and for any new WTO rules to reflect countries' implementation capacities.

 We have full diplomatic relations with North Korea, which include trade relations. There is no objection to UK companies trading with North Korea, if they wish to do so. However, given the political situation arising from the nuclear issue, all trade promotion activity by HMG has been suspended. Normal commercial activity will resume once the nuclear issue has been resolved.

 The regulation of gas and electricity supply, including billing, is a matter for the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). I receive correspondence from Members of Parliament and the general public about a range of gas and electricity consumer issues, including billing. Gas and electricity suppliers should operate to the highest standards in all areas of their operations, including billing. If they do not, they may face regulatory action, as well as the loss of their customers to other suppliers.

<i>[holding answer 14 May 2003]:</i> The Government fully supports the European Union objectives to seek agreement and a mandate at the Fifth WTO Ministerial at Cancun in September to negotiate new WTO agreements on the four Singapore new issues, including a Trade and Investment Agreement. This was confirmed in the Ministerial conference that I attended in Doha and in the Ministerial declaration adopted by consensus at Doha on 14 November 2001.
<P>

<a name="30603w89.html_para2">Developing Countries regularly emphasis their need for increased flows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). However, smaller developing countries do not have the resources to negotiate numerous bilateral investment treaties. It is of course up to developing countries that are WTO members to decide if it is in their interests to sign an investment agreement. However we believe that a WTO multilateral investment framework will benefit developing countries not only because it would make negotiations easier but also because it form the basis of a level playing field for all WTO members. This in turn would help developing countries create the low risk, stable and predictable conditions necessary to attract a larger share of global investment flows. Within the overall agreement developing countries would be able to decide in which areas it is most appropriate for them to schedule commitments.
<P>

<a name="30603w89.html_para3">When seeking agreement to launch negotiations in Cancun, we will ensure that the current proposals for these "new issues" offer a balanced and flexible approach. We want to make sure that any new obligations for WTO members allow them sufficient flexibility to pursue national development objectives. Any final agreement must include appropriate special and differential treatment for developing countries, and must also ensure that technical assistance and capacity building support is offered to help developing countries prepare for the post-Cancun negotiations.

<a name="30603w90.html_para10">In the three years 1998 to 2000 (the most recent year for which data are available), there were 1541, 1613 and 1628 deaths from the cancer mesothelioma in Great Britain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to improve services for sufferers of autistic spectrum disorders.  [115066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30603w90.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Autism is one of the least understood but most frightening and difficult of conditions. People with autism lead isolated lives. Their social and communication difficulties place great stress on their families. It is important that we should all be sensitive to their needs.
<P>

<a name="30603w90.html_para11">Children with autistic spectrum disorders will benefit from the programmes to improve services for disabled children. The Quality Protects (QP) programme to improve children's social services has made disabled children a priority area. From 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04, &#163;60 million from the children's services special grant has been earmarked for services for disabled children and their families&#151;&#163;15 million in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 and &#163;30 million in 2003&#150;04. Last year's QP management action plans show that more family support services are being provided, particularly home based respite care and sitting services. The Carers Grant is increasing from &#163;85 million this year to &#163;185 million by 2005&#150;06. Approximately 20 per cent. is spent on children's services, mainly to carers of disabled children to fund the provision of short term breaks. Direct payments were introduced in the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 and are increasing the flexibility and choice for parents in the provision of services.
<P>

<a name="30603w90.html_para12">Disabled children are also a priority area within the development of the children's national service framework (NSF). NSFs were established to improve services through setting national standards to drive up quality and tackle existing variations in care. The Children's NSF will develop new national standards across the NHS, social services and interface with education. It will be about putting children and young people at the centre of their care. The NSF will include care pathways/exemplar diagrams illustrating optimum approaches to delivering services in a number of different areas. It will show how families should receive multi-agency early intervention and support based on their needs. One of the exemplars will be on services for children with autism.
<P>

<a name="30603w90.html_para13">The Department of Health, in association with the Department for Education and Skills, published good practice guidance on autistic spectrum disorders last year. The guidance was primarily aimed at schools and local education authorities but was also relevant to health and social services providers. We will also be working with the Department for Education and Skills on the new Special Educational Needs Action Programme which, among other things, will promote effective approaches to teaching and learning for children with autism.

We are currently devoting a further &#163;154,000 over three years to the National Autistic Society project "Independence and Autism: Good Practice for Service Providers". This will support the development of new services to enable adults with autism or Asperger's Syndrome to live independently.
<P>

<a name="30603w90.html_para15">The "Valuing People" White Paper directly covers every adult with autism who also has a learning disability. Implementation guidance, issued in August 2001, makes clear that adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning autism are not precluded from using learning disability services, where appropriate, and may require an assessment of their social functioning and communication skills in order to establish their level of need. By bringing together a wide range of local statutory agencies, Valuing People gives us the scope to improve opportunities and services for people across the autistic spectrum.
<P>

<a name="30603w90.html_para16">Adults with autism will also gain, along with others, from the investment we are making to improve standards in health and social care services. In particular they will benefit from the NHS Plan, the mental health NSF, which covers the mental health needs of adults with autism, and Fair Access to Care Services.

<P>
<a name="30603w90.html_spnew13"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We recognise the problems that occur for children who suffer autistic spectrum disorders, and for their families. We will continue to work on what more we need to do to improve services for autistic children. We will also seek to ensure diagnosis and treatment provisions consistent with demand. Primary care trusts (PCT) have a pivotal role here, in ensuring an appropriate level of services to meet the health care demands of their local population. For those children with bowel symptoms suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), local paediatricians and paediatric gastroenterologists have the necessary expertise to investigate and manage IBD in children with, and without autism.
<P>

<a name="30603w90.html_para17">The children's national service framework (NSF) will set new national standards which will help to ensure better access and smoother progression in the provision of services for children, from initial contact and diagnosis with the National Health Service, via a general practitioner surgery or NHS hospital. The NSF will include care pathways/exemplar diagrams illustrating optimum approaches to delivering services in a number of different areas and one of these will be on services for children with autism.

 The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer that one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice; it is planned to achieve this by 2008. There is a series of staged milestones towards this goal: from 2001, new targets of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer and a maximum one month from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for acute leukaemia, children's cancer and testicular cancer were introduced. From 2002, the target of a maximum wait of two months from urgent referral to treatment for breast cancer was introduced. By 2005, there will be targets of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers. Data on current targets are published on the Department's website at www.doh.gov.uk/cancerwaits.

<P>
<a name="30603w92.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B>

<P>

<a name="30603w92.html_para3">Proposals under the Mental Health Bill would break the automatic link between using the powers and admission to hospital. Treatment in the community would provide a positive alternative for those patients who do not need to be detained in hospital and an opportunity to minimise the disruption to their lives. While the new legislation will lead to some change in the group of people treated, overall it is not the intention that more people will be subject to compulsion under the Bill. Investment under the NHS Plan and service improvements under the national service framework for mental health, such as assertive outreach, crisis resolution and early intervention, will help to provide more effective care and ensure that fewer people become so ill that they need compulsory treatment.

From April 2005, all hearing aids fitted in England will be digital unless an analogue aid is more appropriate for clinical reasons or because the patient prefers it.

 In 1994, the Department of Health received legal advice that an intervention not made with the patient's consent and not made in the patient's best interest was unlawful. This could leave health authorities, National Health Service trusts and individual clinicians open to the risk of prosecution for battery if the practice of elective ventilation was engaged in.

 Free sight tests are available under the national health service to large parts of the population, including all those aged 60 and over, children, those aged 16&#150;18 in full-time education, people on benefits, those people at particular risk of developing eye disease and people who are registered blind or partially sighted or who have a complex spectacle prescription. Sight tests are the ideal opportunity to review all aspects of eye health, including investigations for signs of disease. Those at risk of specific eye disease, for example, diabetic retinopathy, may be asked to attend regular screening. Overall, the number of NHS sight tests undertaken continues to increase. 9.8 million NHS sight tests were paid for by health authorities in 2001&#150;02, an increase of 3 per cent. on 2000&#150;01. 41 per cent. or four million of these sight tests were performed on patients aged 60 or over, a group most vulnerable to eye disease and 24 per cent. or 2.4 million on children.

<a name="30603w93.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that additives are only permitted in food if their use is technologically justified and independent experts consider them to be safe. The use of food additives is subject to strict legislative control across the European Union. Only those additives listed in the legislation may be used and then only in certain specified foods and, in a number of cases, subject to maximum permitted levels of use.

 The Food Standards Agency publishes a range of information on food additives on its website, including a list describing all currently permitted additives, details of the legislation in force and summaries of completed research and surveillance projects on additives. In addition the FSA's telephone inquiry point and website's 'Ask an expert' section answers questions on food additives and children. Any new advice for parents on food additives is issued by the FSA as a press release. Costs of providing information on food additives are borne predominantly within the overall budget of the FSA's website production team and cannot be separately identified.

 European rules implemented here by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 already require additives to be identified in the list of ingredients by their function, for example, preservative, colour, and either their specific name or serial number except where specific exemptions apply. There are no plans to require the name and the serial number to be given, although there is nothing to prevent this from being done voluntarily.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has issued guidance on the use of drugs for non-Hodgkin's lynphoma and chronic myeloid leukaemia, but not on non-cancer related lymphoedema. We have offered no guidance to general practitioners or other heal professionals on the use of manual lymphatic drainage in the treatment of lymphoedema.
<P>

<a name="30603w94.html_para5">The principles of manual lymphatic drainage are taught to physiotherapists as part of their training. The decision on whether to go on and specialise in this area is one for individual physiotherapists to make.
<P>

<a name="30603w94.html_para6">There is currently no cure but, with appropriate treatment, lymphoedema can be very well managed in the national health service. These treatments consist of a combination of skin care, exercise, massage and compression garments or bandaging. In a few cases it is possible to help surgically, for example by transplanting lymph vessels.

The strategy will enable researchers and funders to develop research proposals on all aspects of this illness.

<P>

<a name="30603w94.html_para10">The MRC has announced two initiatives in response to the strategy. One is a notice to the research community welcoming high quality proposals across the entire spectrum of CFS/ME research. The other is a scientific meeting to discuss the potential to use existing United Kingdom resources and infrastructures to undertake epidemiological studies in this country. In addition, the MRC has just announced funding, on 15 May 2003, for two trials that will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for CFS/ME. The results of these trials will help patients and their doctors to choose the best treatment. These complementary trials will assess a variety of treatments and in doing so will both help address important issues for those with CFS/ME.

<P>
<a name="30603w95.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Department of Health has not recently commissioned any research on the link between depression and substance abuse in women, as the links between mental health problems and substance misuse are already well established.
<P>

<a name="30603w95.html_para2">However, in 2002, the Department commissioned an evidence based document, 'Co-existing Problems of Mental Disorder and Substance Misuse (dual diagnosis)'. This is an information manual for the drugs and mental health field developed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Research Unit, which highlights the importance of partnership work between the two fields.
<P>

<a name="30603w95.html_para3">In addition to this, The National Treatment Agency has developed the 'Models of Care' document, which is effectively a national service framework for substance misuse. 'Models of Care' alerts treatment agencies to the risk of women who have accessed treatment developing recurrent mental health problems including eating disorders, self-mutilation, suicide attempts and low self-esteem.

 No direct assessment has been made of the computerised cognitive behavioural treatment for depression called Beating the Blues.

The report was published in October 2002 and is available on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk. The appraisal will be reviewed again in due course.

 The purpose of the proposed Mental Health Bill is to provide a legal framework for when someone can be treated for their mental disorder without consent. It is not about providing services or the standards of service provision. Therefore, it is not proposed to include a duty on primary care trusts to provide age-appropriate mental health services in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30603w95.html_para4">Reform of the legislation is only one strand of the Government's strategy. It should be seen alongside increased investment under the NHS Plan and modernisation of services under national service frameworks (NSFs) for standards of care for working-age adults with mental health problems.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make it his policy that compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is not treated as capital for the purposes of assessing the victim's entitlement to income-related benefit; and if he will make a statement.

 Lump sum payments from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Agency made directly to the injured person or someone acting on their behalf, or to a contingency fund as part of a structured settlement are subject to the normal capital rules when assessing entitlement to income-related benefits. However, payments placed in a trust fund for the injured person are disregarded in full. We have no plans to change this policy.

<P>
<a name="30603w98.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Disability Living Allowance may be awarded for an indefinite period or for a fixed period. The length of the award in individual cases depends on for how long the decision-maker considers that the severely disabled person will, or is likely to, continue to satisfy the entitlement conditions for the benefit in the light of the available evidence about their personal care needs and mobility needs. Decision makers are trained to make awards for the period that is supported by the evidence, and people who receive a fixed period award are invited to make a further claim some 6 months before the award expires.
<P>

<a name="30603w98.html_para0">We have no plans to change these arrangements. People who are dissatisfied with the length of their DLA award can ask for the decision to be reconsidered and have the right to appeal to an independent tribunal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the rates of Unemployment Benefit/Jobseekers Allowance (Contributions) were for a single claimant over the age of 25 in each year since 1979; and what those rates would have been had the benefit been uprated annually in line with the percentage increases in average earnings.

 <i>[holding answer 19 May 2003]</i>: The levels of social security benefits are reviewed each year and approved by Parliament. A range of factors is considered when reviewing benefit levels. As a contributory benefit Unemployment Benefit was uprated using the Retail Price Index. When Jobseeker's Allowance was introduced in 1996 it was decided that both income-based and contribution-based Jobseeker's Allowance would be uprated using the Rossi index.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assumptions have been made concerning the growth in pensioners' incomes from non-state sources in the estimates of future expenditure on pension credit shown in figure A3.1 of the Pensions Green Paper; what the estimated expenditure would be if this growth were <i>(a)</i> half the level assumed; and <i>(b)</i> three-quarters the level assumed.

 The latest projections of the full cost of Pension Credit (guarantee credit and savings credit) to 2050 are published on page 148, Annex 3 of the Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' (cm 5677). Based on a number of assumptions about the future, as set out in Annex 3, this shows that Pension Credit expenditure could rise to around 1.45 per cent of GDP by 2050.

<a name="30603w99.html_para5">One of the assumptions used was that on average, income brought to account in the Pension Credit would increase in line with average earnings.

<a name="30603w99.html_para6">The Pensioners' Incomes Series 2000/1, based on Family Resources Survey and Family Expenditure Survey data, shows that average pensioner incomes between 1979 and 1996&#150;97 rose by 64 per cent. in real terms, compared to average earnings growth in the whole economy of 36 per cent. in real terms. More recent growth estimates are subject to uncertainty, but the growth in average pensioner incomes between 1994&#150;95 and 2000&#150;01 was around 17 per cent. in real terms, higher than average earnings (up 9 per cent. over the same period).

obtained at disproportionate cost. However as an indication, under an assumption that pensioner incomes increased by prices to 2050, the cost of Pension Credit could be around 2 percentage points of GDP higher than the published costs. As explained, given the evidence of past pensioner income growth, the likelihood that those eligible for Pension Credit in the future will have higher state retirement pension income than previous cohorts, and the growth of non-pension income, such as income from housing or earnings, this assumption is likely to be unrealistic.

 The Pension Service has begun to write to pensioner households to explain pension credit and to invite applications. The order in which households are contacted has been designed to produce a controlled and measured build up of applications, evenly distributed throughout the UK. By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted. The Department will, during the period when advance applications for pension credit can be made, continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing campaign and make any refinements needed to ensure that pensioners take up their entitlement. All those who apply before October 2004, if they are entitled, will receive payment as though they had claimed at the very start, or to the first day they could have qualified if this is later.

<sup>(58)</sup> Total awards made on claims received between 01/01/1990 and 20/05/2003 = 46. These figures do not take account of the actual date the payment was made, nor do they take account of any cases where an award has occurred following a Section 3A reversal or an appeal after 01/01/1990, where the claim under consideration was actually received prior to 01/01/1990 (i.e. a claim received by the VDPU in 1984 that went to Appeal in 2002, resulting in an award in 2003 would not be shown in the above figures as the claim was not received after 01/01/1990).<P>

<sup>(59)</sup> Section 3A of the Vaccine Damage Payments Act states that the Secretary of State may reverse his own decision or that of an appeal tribunal. Application for reversal must be made within a prescribed period.<P>
