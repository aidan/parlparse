<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are carefully considering the comments made in response to the White Paper 'Modernising Company Law' (Cm 5553), including those in the Trade and Industry Committee's report on the White Paper (HC 439) published last week. A further announcement will be made to Parliament in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what criteria she has used in determining the budget allocations to individual regional development agencies in 2003&#150;04.  [114899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The budget for Regional Development Agencies is allocated between RDAs using a formula which takes into account nine weighted indictors of need and opportunity. Provision has also been made to ensure that no RDA will receive less in 2003&#150;04 than in previous years.
<P>

<a name="30521w01.html_para0">The nine indicators are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An allocation for each RDA to cover common administrative overheads;
<P>
<BR>
Population size;
<P>
<BR>
Gross Domestic Product per head, where the richest regions get zero;

Research and development expenditure per head with the weakest regions benefiting most;
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cummings: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to encourage the use of spare capacity at regional airports for low cost airlines.  [114796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government support the growth, subject to it being sustainable, of regional airports to meet local demand for air travel and we anticipate low cost airlines will make a major contribution to achieving this. Chapter 3 of our regional consultation documents sets out a range of possible policy mechanisms for delivering our objectives. The consultation closes on 30 June, and we will publish the Air Transport White Paper in late 2003.

<a name="30521w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Sizewell</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many aircraft have flown over the power stations since the airspace over Sizewell A and B power stations was invaded 18 months ago.  [112883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Aircraft are not permitted to fly within two nautical miles of Sizewell below a height of 2000 ft. There have been no confirmed breaches of this restriction since November 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The department's aviation security requirements do not differentiate between day time and night time operations. I will draw to the attention of colleagues in the relevant departments the hon. Member's particular concern about late hours coverage at airports by Customs and Immigration staff, so that they may respond direct.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many officials within his Department are engaged in examining the Crossrail proposals; when he will announce the Government's preferred option for Crossrail line 1; and if he will make a statement on the Crossrail project.  [113719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Currently, around half a dozen Departmental officials are substantially engaged on Crossrail-related work, among other duties, involving a range of other officials within the Department as necessary. As regards an announcement on Crossrail, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by the Secretary of State for Transport to the hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), and for Ilford South (Mike Gapes), on 13 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 149.

<a name="30521w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Cyclists</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what regulations are in force governing cyclists' conduct when using joint cycle and pedestrian paths;  [115044]




<P>
<P><I>21 May 2003 : Column 769W</I><P>

<P>
<UL>(2) what requirements there are for cyclists to warn other road users of their presence when using joint cycle and pedestrian paths.  [115043]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 On cycle tracks, cyclists and pedestrians may be segregated or they may share the same space. Highway authorities use signs and markings from the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 to indicate the part of the route which is allocated for cyclists and for pedestrians. On segregated tracks, cyclists must keep to the side intended for their use.
<P>

<a name="30521w01.html_para2">The Highway Code advises cyclists to take care when passing pedestrians, especially children, elderly or disabled people on cycle tracks, and allow them plenty of room. The code also advises that cyclists should slow down and stop for pedestrians if necessary. The law applying to dangerous and careless cycling applies on cycle tracks as it does on the road. Under the Road Traffic Act 1991, the two worst cycling offences attract maximum fines of &#163;2,500 (for dangerous cycling) and &#163;1,000 (for careless cycling).
<P>

<a name="30521w01.html_para3">There are no specific requirements for cyclists to warn other users of their presence on a cycle track. However, the Highway Code advises cyclists that they should be considerate of other road users, particularly blind and partially sighted pedestrians, and to let them know of their presence by ringing their bell. In April this year, the Pedal Bicycles (Safety) Regulations 2003 were published, coming into force on 1 May 2004. These will make it a requirement for a bell to be fitted on a bicycle by manufacturers at the point of sale. The Regulation will enhance the safety of pedestrians sharing space with cyclists, and had been requested for some time by groups representing pedestrians and disabled people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the total expenditure on advertising by the Department was in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; and what the level of planned expenditure is for (i) 2003&#150;04 and (ii) 2004&#150;05.  [114436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In 2001&#150;02, my Department's total expenditure on advertising was &#163;9.85 million to &#163;8.62 million on the THINK! road safety campaign and &#163;1.22 million to promote the Traveline public transport information line.
<P>

<a name="30521w01.html_para4">In 2002&#150;03, the total estimated expenditure on advertising was &#163;10.195 million to 9.5 million on the THINK! road safety campaign, &#163;299,000 on the Airports consultation exercise, &#163;274,000 on Traveline and &#163;122,000 on the new Vehicle Identity Checking scheme. These figures are subject to final audit.
<P>

<a name="30521w01.html_para5">The planned expenditure for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 is estimated at &#163;10 million in each year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to reduce his Department's underspend in 2003&#150;04 from that of 2002&#150;03.  [112771]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We will continue to monitor budgets very closely to ensure the most effective use of resources. I expect that, once the figures have been finalised, my Department's outturn for 2002&#150;03 will have been very close to budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the criteria will be for inspecting foreign flag vessels in UK ports when the port state control directive comes into force.  [114837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The UK will inspect foreign flag vessels in UK ports according to the criteria set out in the new Article 7 of EU Directive 2001/106/EC which comes into force on 22 July 2003. High risk ships posing the greatest threat to the safety of crew and passengers and to the environment will be targeted for inspection.
<P>

<a name="30521w01.html_para7">The target factor is determined by ship type, Flag, Classification Society, ship age, and previous inspection record. High risk ships, based on type and age, such as oil tankers over 15 years of age with a high target factor, will have a mandatory expanded inspection every 12 months. Any ship with a very high target factor and one month since last inspection will also have a mandatory inspection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Both the registration of number plate suppliers and vehicle identity checks (VICs) form part of the Government's programme to reduce vehicle crime. They are specifically designed to combat vehicle ringing and cloning (the practice of disguising the identity of stolen vehicles or vehicles used for unlawful purposes.)
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans the Government have to introduce measures to prevent three children, under 14 years of age, sitting on two seats on school buses.  [114974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Three children under the age of 14 sitting on two seats is permitted by the Public Service Vehicles (Carrying Capacity) Regulations 1984. However, as this is a concession and not a requirement I have no plans to abolish this allowance. The use of this concession is declining as the modern interior designs of buses and coaches make it impracticable to use. It is also not permissible where seat belts are fitted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Three children under the age of 14 sitting on two seats is a concession under the Public Service Vehicles (Carrying Capacity) Regulations 1984. It is the responsibility of the driver of any vehicle carrying schoolchildren to ensure that this concession is not abused. It is, however, becoming redundant. Sharing seats is not an option (no matter what the age of the children) in vehicles fitted with seat belts. All mini-buses and coaches carrying schoolchildren must now be fitted with seat belts, except for those that pre-date the legislation and which are gradually disappearing from the road.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has not received any cash sponsorship support.

The Regional Co-ordination Unit, as the corporate centre of the Government Office Network, collects data for the Government Offices. This data will be used to make assessments of regional differences in developing the Department's workforce strategies.

<P>
<a name="30521w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 There is no single "Civil Service exam". With the exception of the Fast Stream, and recruitment to the most senior posts, recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of individual government departments and agencies. In general their systems are based on the competences their businesses require, and their recruitment processes are determined by the needs of the post. Departments are free to choose the selection methods that best demonstrate the competences and skills they are seeking. These can include a variety of tests and exercises, interviews or assessment centres.
<P>

<a name="30521w02.html_para7">My own Department recruits for the graduate Fast Stream Programme on behalf of Departments and reports annually to Parliament with details of the scheme, including numbers of applicants and successes at each selection stage. The tests, exercises and interviews are designed and validated with the aim of achieving the best possible prediction of suitability for, and success in, the job. The recruitment process for all jobs in the Civil Service must be consistent with the principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition, in accordance with the requirements of the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code.

 I announced the programme of farm-scale evaluations of GM herbicide tolerant crops in October 1998. In February 1999, the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions consulted stakeholders, including biotechnology companies and health and environmental campaign and voluntary groups, about the proposals for the evaluations, the hypothesis to be tested and scale and scope of the field trials. Following this, in May 1999 the then Secretary of State appointed an independent Scientific Steering Committee to oversee the conduct of the evaluations. This Committee provides on-going advice to Ministers on all aspects of the design and methodology. Their advice is publicly available on the farm-scale evaluations website (www.defra.gov.uk/environment/fse)

 The budget for research and development on organic farming was &#163;2.029 million in 2002&#150;03, and is &#163;2.229 million for 2003&#150;04. These figures include &#163;200,000 spend via the Organic LINK programme.

<a name="30521w04.html_para2">The planned/target Organic LINK spend, which is dependant on successful bids being co-funded from industry, is &#163;400,000 in 2003&#150;04, &#163;700,000 in 2004&#150;05, and then &#163;1.3 million for the next three years&#151;a total of &#163;5 million.
<P>

<a name="30521w04.html_para3">In addition, the organic farming sector also benefits from much of the other research the Department undertakes, for example, its planned spend of over &#163;12.8 million on biological control techniques, plant health, animal welfare and wildlife conservation on farms this year.

 No reviews are planned and no studies have been conducted into the provision of naval navigational aids.

These services are currently provided by Serco Denholm, under a Government Owned-Contractor Operated (GOCO) arrangement and by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS), part of the Warship Support Agency. The RMAS are currently responsible for the laying/recovery and annual maintenance of some 205 navigational buoys around the coast of the British Isles. Under current plans, the design authority for navigational buoys and the supply of related mooring materials will also be transferred to the successful bidder.
<P>

<a name="30521w05.html_para3">Discussions took place with the General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA), Non-Departmental Public Bodies sponsored by the Department for Transport, in 2001 to determine whether there was scope for the GLA's to take over the maintenance and upkeep of Ministry of Defence United Kingdom navigational buoys. However, it was subsequently decided not to proceed as such an arrangement would provide little benefit to the MOD. No further discussions on this matter have taken place either with public or private sector bodies.

 Although such information would be held at unit level, there has been no recent centralised assessment of the reasons why Reserve Forces personnel resign. However, there are currently no indications to suggest that the recent call-out of reservists to support Operation TELIC will result in an increased rate of resignation from the Reserve Forces.
<P>

<a name="30521w05.html_para6">As part of the follow-up work that normally accompanies large scale operations, we will be contacting reservists who served on Operation TELIC to identify any lessons that may be learned from their experience.
<P>

<a name="30521w05.html_para7">We shall also be reviewing the relevant legislation to ensure that there are appropriate financial safeguards for both reservists and their employers and that job security is provided.

 The Ministry of Defence estate is continuously under review to ensure that it is no larger than required for operational and other essential purposes. Under the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), a total of 87 Territorial Army (TA) sites were identified for disposal. Of these sites, 55 have been sold, 15 are still awaiting disposal and 15 have been withdrawn from the programme. There are two sites at Northumberland, currently held on lease, which will be surrendered when the lease terminates. Details of the sites, broken into counties, are listed in the table.

 On 7 May 2003 I met the Burmese Ambassador to the UK and expressed my concern at the number of political prisoners in Burma. I urged the Burmese authorities to move ahead quickly with the release of all political prisoners. I explained that UK and EU policy would toughen unless there was significant improvement in human rights and progress towards democracy.

 In October 2002 the Chairman of the UN Special Committee on De-colonisation (C24) sought HMG's agreement to the Committee's annual seminar being held in 2003 in a UK Caribbean Overseas Territory. After consultation with the Territory Government, Anguilla was agreed as the venue. On 28 March officials discussed arrangements for the seminar with the C24 Chairman in New York. There has since been close liaison between the C24 Secretariat, the UK Mission in New York, the FCO and the Government of Anguilla.

The UK has ratified the key international legal instruments that outlaw slavery: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Slavery Convention, and ILO Conventions 29 and 105 on Forced Labour. We are promoting the widest possible ratification and practical implementation of these.

There has been no change in the rules on loan repayments. The increase in recoveries is due to the fact that the annual national gross loans budget has increased year after year enabling more people to take advantage of the Social Fund loans scheme.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what support the Government are giving <i>(a)</i> bilaterally and <i>(b)</i> through (i) World bank and (ii) UN agencies, to initiatives to assist African countries to overcome non-tariff barriers to trade by meeting G8 product standards and engaging in international standard setting; and if she will make a statement on G8 members' actions to improve the availability of information on standards and transparency to trade Ministers in developing countries.  [113649]<P>

<P>
<a name="30521w10.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the important area of assisting developing countries, including in Africa, in the areas of standard setting and compliance. Bilateral trade related technical assistance projects in Malawi and Ghana have both provided support to the Standards Bureaus in those countries, to enable them to participate in international standard setting and implement the standards set by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Codex Alimentarius Committee. The new Regional Trade Facilitation project in southern Africa, covering the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, also has a component to support implementation of international standards that SADC members have signed up to.
<P>

<a name="30521w10.html_para8">Through its funding of the Trade Policy Development Project of the World bank, DFID has supported the creation of the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), which has already undertaken exploratory work in Africa and will be developing projects to enable African countries to meet standards for agricultural exports. The STDF is a partnership of the World bank, World Trade Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Health Organisation, which attempts to strengthen donor coordination in standards related to food safety, and plant and animal health. Between November 1999 and February 2003, reports and action plans were developed in Nigeria, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya and Uganda, examining the link between trade facilitation, standards and trade.
<P>

<a name="30521w10.html_para9">DFID is also contributing to a new United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Trust Fund, 'Enabling Developing Countries to Participate in International Trade',which includes African countries in its first wave of projects. The Fund aims to: enhance developing country market accesses through appropriate infrastructure in order to meet and show compliance with export requirements; build capacity in potentially high productivity sectors; and provide support to developing countries that have encountered problems with meeting standards requirements for their exports.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what new initiatives her Department has taken since the G8 Kananaskis summit to promote agricultural productivity in Africa.  [113617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w10.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID promotes agricultural productivity in Africa through supporting African efforts to increase domestic productivity and working to creat a fair and equitable international trading system. We do not earmark bilateral funds, but support Africa's own priorities defined in national Poverty Reduction Strategy processes, which also seek to address the many constraints that lie outside the agriculture sector. These include issues such as economic policy, trade policy and credit and infrastructure provision. UK resources for Africa will increase by nearly 50 per cent. to around &#163;1 billion by 2006.
<P>

<a name="30521w10.html_para11">The UK supports the development of a fair and equitable international trading system. We believe the G8 process can add significant political momentum to the relevant negotiations. Following Kananaskis, DFID has been supporting progress internationally on CAP reform and WTO agriculture negotiations, the reform and harmonisation of G8 preferential access schemes and multilateral trade related technical assistance to Africa.
<P>

<a name="30521w10.html_para12">Access to agricultural technology in Africa was highlighted at Kananaskis. Two relevant initiatives are our support for the design of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (a public-private partnership to enable access to agricultural technology) and provision of &#163;16 million to support agricultural research for Africa in 2002&#150;03.

[113621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w10.html_spnew11"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID untied its aid in April 2001, when we opened our contracting to international competition. In 2001&#150;02 DFID headquarters awarded two contracts worth a total value of &#163;0.37 million to African-based businesses. In 2002&#150;03 there were eight such contracts with a total value of &#163;10.64 million. Figures for the period before 2001 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.




<P>
<P><I>21 May 2003 : Column 807W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30521w10.html_para13">We have also developed trained contracting capacity in DFID's overseas offices to allow them to make better use of both local and international suppliers for lower-value contracts. In 2001&#150;02 DFID offices in Africa let contracts worth a total of &#163;11.82 million. In 2002&#150;03, the corresponding figure was &#163;9.41 million.

 DFID is supporting the Commonwealth Business Council (CBC) to develop private sector engagement in the NEPAD Programme of Action, and stimulate the increased domestic and foreign investment required for NEPAD to succeed. This work is subsumed under the principal private sector initiative in support of NEPAD&#151;the NEPAD Business Group (NBG).

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what steps have been taken to implement the paper on access to medicine produced by the Government, the United Kingdom pharmaceutical industry and multilateral agencies; and if she will place a copy in the Library.  [113614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w11.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises four key factors that can improve access to medicines for diseases prevalent in poor countries (including AIDS, TB and Malaria): affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para0">The UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World, chaired by the former Secretary of State, reported to the Prime Minister in November 2002. A copy of the report is available in the Library. The Working Group consisted of senior representatives from UK Government, pharmaceutical industry, the UN, EC and other international organisations.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para1">The UK Working Group was asked to specifically consider:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ways of improving access to medicines through measures such as facilitating differential pricing arrangements and encouraging appropriate donations; and

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30521w11.html_para2">The Group recommended specific action on R&D, and outlined proposals that would encourage voluntary, widespread, sustainable and predictable differential pricing as the operational norm. In the short-term, it recommended gaining significant international commitment to this approach, including through the G8. A team has been established within DFID specifically to take this forward.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para3">The UK Government are firmly committed to increasing access to medicines and to strengthening health systems in developing countries. DFID has committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to support health systems, which will help build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection of drugs.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para4">On sustainable financing, we have pledged $200 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). This will help pay for increased coverage of proven interventions for the three diseases and some associated health systems strengthening. We have already disbursed $80 million to the Fund.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para5">The UK is also working through the World Trade Organisation to ensure that a satisfactory conclusion is reached on the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health agreement that will assist developing countries with insufficient or no drug manufacturing capacity to make effective use of compulsory licensing.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para6">Tax measures were introduced in the 2002 Budget aimed at encouraging private sector companies to increase investment into the research and development of new treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in developing countries, and encouraging responsible donations of medical supplies and equipment to developing countries. Departments across Whitehall will be working together to monitor the impact of these tax initiatives and to explore the potential of other mechanisms to increase investment.

<P>
<a name="30521w11.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 In the financial years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 respectively, DFID spent &#163;21,880 and &#163;98,334 on advertising to raise development awareness. Planned expenditure for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;70,000. As yet, no budget has been set for 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para7">The total spending on advertising relating to recruitment and contract procurement for 2001&#150;02 was &#163;1,070,357 and for 2002&#150;03 was &#163;1,143,796.

There have been a few high profile instances of children being trafficked into or through the UK, but there is insufficient information to say if this is a growing problem. However, the very nature of the crime demands that it is treated very seriously, which is why the Government have introduced criminal sanctions covering child traffickers and has tasked the Reflex group with co-ordinating intelligence on the problem.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para10">The UK is committed to tackling the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation. Our strategy on trafficking is set out in the White Paper "Secure Border Safe Haven" and focuses on strengthening the law through new offences covering trafficking; providing appropriate support to victims of trafficking in the UK; tackling the criminals through intelligence and enforcement operations through the Reflex taskforce; EU co-operation and provention is source and transit countries in partnership with Foreign and Commonwealth (FCO) Department for International Development (DFID). Joint work is also underway between key agencies at principal entry points to identify children at risk, and the Home Office is working closely with the Department of Health on good practice in delivering the best service to children who have been trafficked.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what increased contributions have been made to the Integral Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance; whether the framework has been extended to all developing countries; what additional capacity-building support to developing countries for trade has been introduced since June 2002; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="30521w11.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK has contributed &#163;1.5 million to the Integrated Framework Programme (IF) so far. The programme has been extended from the initial five least developed countries to include three pilot countries under the revised programme and a second wave of 11 least developed countries. There are sufficient funds available to complete the IF process in these countries. Further expansion will be considered following the evaluation of the programme this summer. The UK has committed &#163;51 million to trade related capacity building since June 2000.
<P>

<a name="30521w11.html_para13">The Integrated Framework aims to support least developed countries mainstream trade priorities into their development programmes, usually framed in the country's poverty reduction strategy. The process includes a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) which recommends policy measures and a matrix of technical assistance and capacity building support needs. The process is country led and the DTIS team comprises both international and local experts. The priorities will be funded through the existing mechanisms for support from bilateral and multilateral partners. In response to the call from participating countries and the World bank, a further trust fund is envisaged to support modest, priority, quick win projects to bridge the period between the DTIS and access to development assistance through the established consultative groups, roundtables and programme support. Its terms of reference were agreed on 16 May 2003. The UK plans to contribute shortly.

<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 HIV/AIDS represents a major development challenge in Southern Africa, and is a priority for DFID's funding in the region. Because good sexual health is essential for the prevention of HIV/AIDS, much of DFID's support for sexual health is now included in our response to HIV/AIDS. DFID has supported major programmes to combat HIV/AIDS and promote sexual health in South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In addition, DFID supports a South African Development Community (SADC) HIV/AIDS programme covering Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. Also DFID has recently approved a programme that will work across Africa to support connections between on-going regional work, and fund some new regional initiatives such as working with Orphans and Vulnerable Children. In addition to direct support for HIV/AIDS programmes, DFID is increasingly mainstreaming efforts to combat HIV/AIDS into all development programmes.

<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Southern Africa is the region worst affected by HIV and AIDS. In its 2002 report, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that 29.4 million people in sub-saharan Africa live with HIV/AIDS, and that 8.8 per cent. of the adult (15&#150;49 years) population is affected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 We recognise that unexploded ordnance (UXO) is a matter of grave humanitarian concern. The UK is fully committed to facilitating the clearance of unexploded ordnance as part of the post-conflict reconstruction of Iraq. De-mining organisations funded by DFID, the UN Mines Advisory Service (&#163;4 million) and the Mines Advisory Group (&#163;81,000) are working with local organisations and the coalition military to plot the locations of all unexploded ordnance and to carry out disposals.
<P>

 The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has made available emergency supplies for up to 2,000 people, including 400 tents, 1,200 mattresses and 2,000 blankets as well as stoves, jerry cans and soap to help newly-displaced Palestinian refugees in Baghdad.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Maintaining clean water supplies in Iraq has been an immediate concern. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and others, including the UK military, have worked hard to repair water stations and to supply water by alternative means in the interim. In Baghdad power and water are now reaching 80 per cent. of the urban population on an intermittent basis.

including Baghdad. DFID has committed &#163;16.5 million to ICRC for their work, which includes electricity infrastructure repair. DFID has also provided &#163;7 million to UNDP for its emergency assistance programme in the electricity sector, focusing on central and southern Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It is difficult to establish an accurate picture of disease trends in Iraq, as the former Iraqi disease surveillance system is no longer functioning. The reactivation of this system is a priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO).
<P>

<a name="30521w12.html_para2">Recent weeks have shown a steady increase in the number of reported cases of water- related disease in many locations. This is due to a combination of normal seasonal trends including the start of the hot season, inadequate supply of safe water, and poor sanitation. The Iraqi Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and NGOs are currently conducting assessments, and drawing up an action plan to deal with outbreaks of water-related diseases. UNICEF has prepositioned an extra 200,000 sachets of oral rehydration salts, in the region to deal with diarrhoeal disease outbreaks. DFID is donating cholera kits, sufficient to treat 11,000 people, and emergency health kits, sufficient for 10,000 people for three months, to WHO to assist their response as and when required.

<a name="30521w12.html_wqn6"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State for International Development, how many containers for the collection and storage of water have been made available to Iraqi civilians since the end of military action; and whether these supplies have been sufficient to meet requirements.  [114289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 This information is not available. However, DFID funding to UNICEF and NGOs has included provision to cover items such as water containers should they be needed, for example for refugees or internally displaced people.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what volume of water treatment chemicals are required per week for use by humanitarian agencies in Iraq; what impact shortages in stocks of water treatment chemicals are having on humanitarian efforts in Iraq; and what efforts the Department is taking to overcome these shortages. [114290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID is not aware of any reliable consolidated estimates of the requirement for water treatment chemicals in Iraq. Water disinfection normally involves treatment using chlorine, and reduction of turbidity using Aluminium Sulphate. One metric tonne of chlorine gas is sufficient to treat water for one million people for one day. The quantity of Aluminium Sulphate required depends on the turbidity 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2003 : Column 814W</I><P>
of the water. Some shortfalls of stocks have been identified in Iraq, which the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), UNICEF and the Coalition have taken steps to meet from outside the country. DFID has provided funding to ICRC and to UNICEF for water and sanitation activities including the distribution of water treatment chemicals.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what recent assessment he has made of the adequacy of the contingency plans which were put in place before the commencement of military action in Iraq, for the reconstruction of water treatment facilities in <i>(a)</i> Baghdad and <i>(b)</i> Basra.  [114305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Detailed planning for the reconstruction of water treatment facilities was not possible prior to the conflict in Iraq as it could not be known what condition the infrastructure would be in at the end of military action. DFID did however undertake a desk study review of all the reports on infrastructure in Iraq that were available at that time.
<P>

<a name="30521w12.html_para3">Maintaining clean water supplies in Iraq has been an immediate concern. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and others, including the UK military, have worked hard to repair water stations and supply water by alternative means In Basra the quantity of water being supplied now exceeds pre-conflict levels. In Baghdad power and water are now reaching 80 per cent. of the urban population on an intermittent basis.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the work done by his Department in providing humanitarian assistance to Iraq since the end of the conflict.  [114419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w12.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID is providing funding and other support to the UN agencies, Red Cross / Red Crescent and NGOs to enable them to provide humanitarian assistance where it is needed. DFID has committed &#163;115m to support work by humanitarian agencies in the current crisis and has set aside a further &#163;95 million to support emerging humanitarian needs. The attached table shows the detailed allocation of the funding. Supporting such agencies as part of a co-ordinated international response is more effective than running separate national relief operations. DFID looks to the UN to coordinate this humanitarian effort. DFID has also seconded staff to the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs, the UN, and UK forces to advise on humanitarian relief activities.
<P>

<a name="30521w12.html_para4">Now that major combat operations are complete, international staff from UN agencies and NGO's have begun returning to Iraq. On 2 May, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, Ramiro Lopes da Silva, arrived in Baghdad with senior representatives of the World Food Programme, United Nations Development Programme, World Health Organisation and UNICEF to re-establish a permanent presence. The UN's presence is now expanding rapidly, co-ordinated through five regional teams based in Baghdad, central Iraq, the north and in the upper and lower south.

 The UK's policy towards engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has resulted in limited but carefully targeted humanitarian contributions. There are many constraints to humanitarian agencies operating in North Korea, including problems of access. The Government of North Korea generally refuses to allow international organisations free and open access to rural areas and forbids post-distribution monitoring and evaluation.
<P>

<a name="30521w13.html_para1">The UK stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance in response to any new sudden humanitarian crisis. DFID contributed just over &#163;2 million to humanitarian assistance projects in 2001&#150;02.

 Poverty in the West Bank and Gaza has increased dramatically since the intifada started in September 2000. According to a recent World Bank assessment, some 60 per cent. of Palestinians are now living on less than $2 a day. Unemployment stands at 53 per cent. and many families are now dependent on food aid. A study by UNICEF has also found the incidence of acute malnutrition in Gaza (13.3 per cent.) is comparable to levels in Zimbabwe (13 per cent.) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (13.9 per cent.). Palestinian refugees in neighbouring countries also live in unacceptable circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30521w13.html_para3">The key element of any strategy to reduce poverty sustainably is a successful peaceprocess leading to the establishment of a viable Palestinian state living in peacealongside a secure Israel. Our programme in the West Bank and Gaza provides support for the peace process; capacity building and institutional development; improvements to basic services, and a range of emergency programmes arising from the current conflict.

<P>
<a name="30521w13.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Most parts of Tanzania have experienced exceptionally low rainfall during the current season. Its effects on the June harvest are still unclear. The Government of Tanzania carried out an initial food and crop assessment in May. This will be followed in July by a further assessment to identify particularly vulnerable areas following the June harvest. We await the results of these. DFID is ready to respond to any request the Government of Tanzania may make at that time.

 <i>[pursuant to his answer, 12 May 2003, Official Report, c.28W]:</i> This answer has been amended to include one offence created by an item of secondary legislation. The number of offences created under the Television Licences (Disclosure of Information) Act 2000 has also been revised from one to two.
<P>

<a name="30521w13.html_para4">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has enacted three measures since 1997 which created new criminal offences (one of which was created by secondary legislation). These are the Royal Parks (Trading) Act 2000 which created one offence, the Television Licences (Disclosure of Information) Act 2000 which created two offences, and the Regulatory Reform (Special Occasions Licensing) Order 2001 (IS 2001/3937) which created one offence. The last mentioned Order has been amended on two occasions (by SI 2002/1062 and SI 2002/3205).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w13.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department is currently estimating an underspend of &#163;74 million in 2002&#150;03, which is 5.7 per cent. of the total provision. The underspend relates to lower than expected take up of grants under schemes that are essentially demand led. Planned spending for 2003&#150;04 is set out in the Departmental Report CM5920.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps her Department is taking to ensure that people who are blind are able to enjoy digital television.  [114192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government fully recognise the importance of access to television services for people with sensory impairments. Digital technology has huge potential for improving services and we are extremely keen that all groups benefit.
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para0">The Communications Bill currently before Parliament strengthens the requirements for audio description on television. The Bill sets targets of 10 per cent. of programmes to be audio described for the blind, extending these requirements to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time.
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para1">The Government have also been raising awareness among manufacturers about the opportunities in the market for equipment for disabled people. For example 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2003 : Column 822W</I><P>
the Government are encouraging manufacturers to use design for all principles to produce better designed new equipment both for those with disabilities and those without.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Laxton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to raise the target for audio description for digital television programmes.  [114193]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The 10 per cent. target for audio description was considered as part of the Review of the Statutory Requirements for the Provision of Subtitling, Signing and Audio Description, the report of which was published In January 2001. Having considered all the issues, during the review, we concluded that the 10 per cent. target should be maintained. We believe that this target is challenging but achievable.
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para2">This decision recognised the unresolved production and distribution difficulties with the audio description modules needed to receive the service. The Government have been working with the RNIB, broadcasters and manufacturers to help identify possible solutions to these problems and we are disappointed that the current problems have not yet been solved.
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para3">The Communications Bill, currently in Parliament, allows the Secretary of State, following consultation with OFCOM, to vary the target percentage for audio description, by order. So even though the target is currently 10 per cent. it means that if there were significant advances in the current technology, and more widespread take-up of the modules, targets could be increased.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the potential impact of road charges on UK tourism.  [112717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 DCMS recognises that transport is a key issue for UK tourism and officials from DCMS and the Department for Transport are in regular contact on transport issues. The Government do not consider that the M6 toll road will have a significant impact on tourism. The revenues raised from local authority congestion charging schemes must be reinvested into local transport improvements and can help deliver a quality transport system that will benefit all sectors of the economy, including tourism.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what estimate she has made of the number of premises that will apply for an entertainments licence following passage of the Licensing Bill;  [114132]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps she is taking to increase the opportunities to hear live music in the UK;  [114131]
<P>
(3) what representations she has received from musicians' organisations about the Licensing Bill.  [114064]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 DCMS has received a great deal of correspondence from organisations representing musicians and other performers about the Licensing 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2003 : Column 823W</I><P>
Bill, most of whom have been concerned that it will restrict their activities. The vast majority of their concerns have been unfounded and based on a misinterpretation of the Bill's provisions. Where we believed that the Bill could be improved, however, we have listened to the concerns expressed to us and have made appropriate amendments, for instance by exempting places of public religious worship from the licensing regime as it relates to the provision of entertainment and entertainment facilities and by accepting the spirit of an amendment which exempts incidental live music in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para4">Under the provisions of the Bill there will be no separate licence for the provision of regulated entertainment. Permission to carry on any of the activities licensable under the Bill will be covered by a single premises licence. It will cost no more to apply at the same time for a licence permitting the sale of alcohol and the provision of entertainment than it would to apply for one permitting the sale of alcohol only. I therefore believe that the Bill will make it more affordable than now for venues to put on live performance in the vast majority of cases and increase opportunities for musicians and other artists to perform.
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para5">The Regulatory Impact Assessment that was published alongside the Licensing Bill states that just over 9,000 on-licensed premises and registered members clubs hold permanent public entertainment licences or certificates of suitability. An estimated 37,000 temporary public entertainment licences are also issued each year. The Government have made no estimate of the number of premises that will apply for permission to provide regulated entertainment under the new licensing regime. We expect, however, that the removal of the cost deterrent in applying for permission to provide such entertainment, along with the provision of a less bureaucratic system and measures to prevent unnecessary conditions being attached to licences by licensing authorities will encourage many more in respect of their premises to take the opportunity to provide public entertainment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the Fitness for Purpose Initiative.  [113717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Fitness for Purpose initiative was launched in the autumn 2001 by my Department in conjunction with the Local Government Association. The initiative promotes better inspection and regulation of hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation which are failing to meet minimum legal requirements on health and safety, food hygiene, trading standards and fire safety, in order to help them improve. Further details can be found at www.culture.gov.uk/tourism. 
<P>

<a name="30521w14.html_para6">From April this year, leading local authorities have been carrying out pilot studies of the initiative in major English tourist destinations. The lessons from these pilots will form the basis of a full set of proposals which DCMS and the Local Government Association will produce next year. We then hope to see Fitness for Purpose adopted across England from 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what guidance she has given to OFCOM on its duties in respect of the regulation of the content of broadcast material.  [114099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w14.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The principles and objectives for regulation of the content of Broadcast material by OFCOM are set out in the Communications Bill. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has given no further guidance to OFCOM on this matter. OFCOM will regulate content standards by way of a statutory code or codes, with regard to the specific provisions laid down in the Communications Bill. These codes will be developed on the basis of evidence and research.

 Entertainment provided by a school or college to which the public are admitted is currently licensable and will continue to be licensable under the provisions of the Licensing Bill. This is primarily because the public safety issues involved would be the same as for any other venue, although the promotion of the other licensing objectives, such as the protection of children from harm and the prevention of public nuisance are also important.

<a name="30521w15.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Quality is the foundation of a successful tourism industry. The industry must provide good quality accommodation that meets visitor expectations. We want to ensure that the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) schemes are easily understood by visitors, and that it is a scheme that owners of hotels and guest-houses want to be part of.
<P>

<a name="30521w15.html_para0">A two-part review of the (NQAS) schemes for serviced accommodation is now under way.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps she is taking to encourage subtitling on <i>(a)</i> television, <i>(b)</i> videos, <i>(c)</i> DVDs and <i>(d)</i> other audiovisual media.  [113768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w15.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 May 2003]:</i> The Communications Bill currently before Parliament strengthens the requirements for subtitling on television. The Bill sets subtitling targets of 90 per cent. of programmes on Channels 3 and 4, and 80 per cent. of programmes on all other channels, extending these requirements to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time.
<P>

<a name="30521w15.html_para4">The Government is working with a range of organisations in the audiovisual sector-such as the Broadcasters Disability Network, film distributors, trade organisations and companies providing subtitling&#151;to promote awareness of subtitling issues on DVD and video. We try to ensure that the views of people with sensory impairments are taken into account, and work is taken forward in liaison with organisations representing these groups.
<P>

<a name="30521w15.html_para5">Promotion of awareness of subtitling issues in cinema is primarily through the Film Council as the national body responsible for film strategy, but we also liase with other interested organisations in the sector such as PACT and the Film Distributors Association.

<a name="30521w15.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proposals she has to expand the number of English regional tourist boards so that their boundaries are co-terminators with those of the English Regions; how many <i>(a)</i> UK and <i>(b)</i> foreign tourists (i) there were in each of the four ERTBs in each of the last five years and (ii) there are predicted to be over the next three years; how much Government funding each of the ERTBs will receive in 2003&#150;04; and whether funding is adjusted according to local authority spending on tourism.  [114018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs) are not Government organisations and their geographical boundaries are for them to decide in consultation with their membership. They are the natural partners of the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) for the development and implementation of Regional Sustainable Tourism Strategies. The question of the coterminousness of RTB and RDA boundaries 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 2003 : Column 828W</I><P>
can be considered during the process of formulating those strategies, in consultation with RTBs and other RDAs as appropriate. Five of the regions already have coterminous boundaries.
<P>

<a name="30521w15.html_para7">Government funding for the RTBs, to be distributed via the RDAs single pot for three years from 2003&#150;04, is a continuation of the funding the RTBs received from the former English Tourism Council in 2002&#150;03 in respect of regional projects. It is guaranteed for three years at the same level as in 2002&#150;03 and does not take into account individual local authority spending on tourism, some of which may comprise membership subscriptions to RTBs. There are separate arrangements for London and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport funds the Greater London Authority (GLA) towards meeting its tourism responsibilities. Most of this funding flows to the London Development Agency, which in turn uses the London Tourist Board as a key delivery agent. The amounts for RDAs to pass on to RTBs in 2003&#150;04 are as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on her policy on the <i>(a)</i> prohibition and <i>(b)</i> regulation of televised food advertisement aimed at children.  [113889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w15.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government's policy is that television advertising should be undertaken responsibly and its regulation should be directed at ensuring the prevention of harm to vulnerable groups including children. To this end, television is regulated by the Independent Television Commission (ITC), which establishes codes covering all television advertising and sponsorship. Broadcasters must comply with these codes and sanctions are available for non-compliance. In relation to food advertising, the codes include provisions to prevent harm notably from advertisements which mislead, make unsubstantiated health claims, disparage good dietary practice or encourage excessive consumption. The ITC keeps the effectiveness of the codes under review and they can be amended, after appropriate consultation, if they are found to be inadequate in preventing harm. The Communications Bill provides for OFCOM to take on the responsibility for ensuring that standards are maintained. The Government believe that these arrangements provide for the effective regulation of television advertising and that at present there is no case for further Government action, such as entirely prohibiting the advertising of food during children's programming.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2003]:</i> We have recently designated our final tranche of Early Excellence Centre (EEC), which brings our total to 107 EECs operating in 80 local authority areas in England. We will not be designating any further EECs. Instead, we will be aiming to establish a children's centre in every one of the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards, building where possible on existing services including Sure Start local programmes, Neighbourhood Nurseries and EECs. Buckinghamshire will receive a small amount of money to develop children's centre services to serve the Booker and Castlefield ward in Wycombe that falls within in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged category.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much funding has been allocated to Suffolk local education authority for the provision of pupil referral units in each of the last five years.  [114550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Local education authorities (LEAs) have flexibility in the use of funding allocated for work on preventing and managing exclusions including support for Pupil Referral Units (PRUs). Provisional figures from the January census show that Suffolk LEA had eight PRUs which were catering for 237 pupils.
<P>

<a name="30521w16.html_para4">Suffolk LEA has not received capital funding specifically for PRUs in the last five years. The Department currently allocates most capital funding for schools and PRUs to LEAs by needs-related formulae, and it is for authorities to assess and prioritise the capital needs of their school and PRU buildings through their asset management planning process, in consultation with local schools. Individual LEAs will therefore hold information on how much capital investment is being directed towards the provision of PRUs.

 The Department for Education and Skills provides a maximum of 10 per cent. of regional allocation to support administrative costs for Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) Lead Delivery Agents, many of whom are Connexions Partnerships. These costs include local marketing of the programme, staff resource to support the development of plans and the costs of implementing the programme. Evidence from the regions suggests that these administration costs are much less than this (e.g. 6 per cent. in the Wirral). A separate top slice of &#163;2.6 million has been set aside to fund the national evaluation, national management information system, brand development and national support service.

At the same time, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published a consultation document on funding adult learning. Each local LSC is holding consultation events with employers and learning providers in their area. Responses are currently being considered. A summary of responses will be set out in the National Skills Strategy White Paper to be published in June. Throughout the process, a key message from employers has been the need to make adult skills training and funding more responsive to their needs.

 We have not had any specific discussions with either local authorities or teacher unions about early retirement. There are provisions within the Teachers' Pension Scheme under which employers can award premature retirement to teachers over the age of 50. The decision on whether an individual teacher should be granted early retirement is for the employer to take having regard to cost and the circumstances of each case.

Where households were absent a form was left asking the householders to complete and return the form to the local field staff. Due to the large number of uncollected forms, mainly from non-contacts and in inner cities, the collection period was extended into May in some areas and specially targeted postal facilities were introduced in the very worst areas to allow forms to be returned direct to OPCS (now ONS). Forms continued to be received in this way until early July.</FONT></UL>

 A key element of the Government's enterprise policy is the recognition that social attitudes, the business environment and specific market failures can present significantly higher barriers to enterprise within the UK's disadvantaged communities. Moreover it is in these communities that the benefits of enterprise are likely to have the greatest social impact through promoting increased economic activity and the creation of jobs. The Government is therefore concentrating particular efforts on the needs of the Enterprise Areas, the most deprived communities across the UK, with the intention of increasing the amount of enterprise in these communities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what <i>(a)</i> proportion of the NHS pay bill and <i>(b)</i> cash amount will be available to pay weighting to staff in high cost areas under Agenda for Change.  [113528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Under the proposed Agenda for Change agreement, an additional &#163;110 million in the first full year of national implementation will be invested in a new system of high cost area payments for National Health Service staff working in London and the fringe areas. For 2005&#150;06, this will mean total expenditure of around &#163;700 million on high cost area payments, including on-costs, in London and the fringe, or around 3 per cent, of the NHS pay bill excluding medical and dental staff. The proposed agreement provides scope for high cost area payments to be applied in other areas in future, where appropriate and for NHS organisations to pay recruitment and retention premia locally subject to certain criteria.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the expected cost to the Exchequer is of <i>(a)</i> the pay element of Agenda for Change in (i) cash terms and (ii) real terms and <i>(b)</i> the administration costs of the Agenda for Change process.  [113529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 By 2005&#150;06, the first full year of national implementation, the expected cost of the pay element of Agenda for Change proposals will be around &#163;950 million in England. This includes provision for the costs associated with the proposals for additional annual leave and changes to working hours. The figure does not include annual uplifts in pay awards for the cost of living, which have been set at 3.225 per cent. as part of the "Agenda for Change" package. It is not possible to give a firm estimate of the projected administrative costs associated with implementing "Agenda for Change", but we anticipate that these costs will be outweighed by the longer-term savings resulting from harmonisation and rationalisation of current pay systems in the national health service.

 It is a matter for the National Health Service trades unions and staff organisations involved to decide when and on what questions they conduct ballots of their members. The proposed "Agenda for Change" agreement includes a partnership agreement setting out the intended benefits of pay reform for NHS patients and NHS staff and the success criteria that will be used, subject to the outcome of the unions' current consultation process, to measure progress during the 'early implementation' phase. The Department is committed to working in partnership with NHS staff organisations and NHS employers to ensure that the appropriate action is taken in the event that these criteria are not sufficiently met.

<P>
<a name="30521w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Under the Agenda for Change proposals, there is no automatic connection between a job evaluation profile and any change in the length of the working week for a post covered by that profile. The proposals include a harmonised working week of 37&#189; hours for full-time national health service staff covered by Agenda for Change, including provisions to phase in these arrangements for staff who currently have longer or shorter hours. In broad terms, the proposals involve a phased increase in the working week for the Whitley groupings of professions allied to medicine, administrative and clerical, professional and technical staff B and speech and language therapists' assistants. A number of staff groups work unconditioned hours and there are national provisions for working hours to be determined locally for a number of staff groups. All of these will move over time to 37&#189; hours under the proposed agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are currently no nationally agreed payscales specifically for clinical coders, medical secretaries, medical records clerks or maintenance fitters (support services). Pay is determined either by reference to the national pay and grade structures for national health service administrative and clerical staff and maintenance staff or by reference to locally designed pay and grading structures.
<P>

<a name="30521w20.html_para7">Under the Agenda for Change proposals, there is no automatic fit between current job title and new pay band.

 Assuming no changes in the deployment of staff, we estimate that around 8 per cent. of staff covered by the Agenda for Change proposals would require pay protection.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures will be put in place to ensure that low-paid NHS workers <i>(a)</i> have a wage floor and <i>(b)</i> earn an adequate wage; and if he will make a statement on the support available.  [112831]<P>

<P>
<a name="30521w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government is committed to tackling low pay in the National Health Service. As part of NHS pay awards for 2002&#150;03, extra resources were targeted to give proportionally greater pay increases to the lowest paid National Health Service staff. From 1 April 2002, all non-medical staff groups received an increase of either 3.6 per cent., or 400 if greater. There was also a range of targeted action focused on the lower paid. This gave a new national minimum hourly rate for staff directly employed by the NHS of &#163;4.47 from 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="30521w24.html_para0">The minimum national adult rate, excluding trainees, has increased since 1997 from &#163;3.46 an hour to &#163;4.47 an hour; an increase of 29 per cent. in cash terms for staff directly employed in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30521w24.html_para1">A proposed agreement on pay modernisation for NHS non-medical staff, Agenda for Change, was published on 3 March.2003 Staff organisations are currently consulting their members on the proposed agreement. If ratified, the agreement will, when implemented, provide a new minimum wage for directly employed staff of &#163;10,100 (at 2002&#150;03 pay levels), equivalent to &#163;5.16 an hour. This will represent an 11 per cent, increase in basic starting salary for the lowest paid. Subject to the outcome of consultation, the proposed agreement will be implemented in a number of 'early implementer' sites from June 2003 and nationally from October 2004. Under the proposed agreement, rates of pay will in addition be uplifted by 10 per cent, over the next three years, compared with the 2002&#150;03 level set out above.

<a name="30521w24.html_para2">The information in this answer relates to England, although the Agenda for Change proposals apply across the United Kingdom. Pay for NHS staff in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved administrations.

 The Department of Health has recently completed its comprehensive review of National Health Service major incident plans. This review took into consideration conclusions reached by the National Audit Office in Facing the Challenge: NHS Emergency Planning in England.

 The Government is committed to increasing the number of radiographers employed in the National Health Service. The NHS Plan states that, by 2004, there will be an extra 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals employed in the NHS over 1999 levels, including radiographers. Between September 1997 and 2001, the number of diagnostic radiographers increased by 800, or 8 per cent., from 10,360 to 11,160 and therapeutic radiographers increased by 130, or 9 per cent., from 1,410 to 1,540.
<P>

<a name="30521w24.html_para9">To further increase the future radiography workforce, we are substantially increasing the numbers of training places. Since 1997, there has been an overall 63 per cent. increase in radiography training commissions from 582 to 948 and these will be increased further as part of the NHS Plan commitment for an extra 4,450 more training places for therapists and other key professional staff by 2004.

<a name="30521w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Implementation of the European Working Time Directive requires the hours of work of doctors training to reduce to 58 hours from August 2004 and to 48 hours by 2009, or 2012 with an extension. While the number of doctors on an individual rota on call will generally have to increase to implement the 2004 requirements, the intention of the Department's guidance&#151;HSC 2003/001: Protecting Staff, Delivering Services&#151;Implementing the European Working Time Directive for Doctors in Training&#151;is that trusts should find ways to reduce the number of resident rotas. Thus the total staffing requirement and costs do not increase substantially as a result of the Working Time Directive.

 The advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (AMD) that cannabis should be reclassified to Class C under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has accepted, was based on a detailed study of the available scientific literature covering all relevant aspects of the issue, including epidemiology and risks to health. Although products with cannabis remains illegal and controlled&#151;it is a harmful drug. Higher concentrations of the main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), became available during the late 1980s and 1990s, there has generally been a very wide variation in the THC levels found in cannabis, and this continues to be the case and the Advisory Council Misuse of Drugs took this into consideration in the advice they gave.

The analysis examined progression from a group of drugs, including cannabis, LSD, amphetamines, amylnitrate and magic mushrooms, to a group of highly dangerous drugs, including heroin, crack and methadone.

<P>
<a name="30521w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Both Houses have recently approved an Order which will bring 4-Hydroxy-n-butyric acid, otherwise known as gammahyrdoxy-butrate or GHB, within the controls of Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as a Class C drug. The provisions will come into effect on 1 July. From that date it will be a criminal offence to possess GHB unlawfully, and this will attract a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment.

 It is difficult to devise a suitable working definition for the purposes of restricting the sale or purchase of replica firearms. We are, however, introducing in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill a new offence of having an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much <i>(a)</i> revenue support grant and <i>(b)</i> formula spending share/standard spending assessment was given to local authorities (i) in total and (ii) in each English region in (A) 2001&#150;02, (B) 2002&#150;03 and (C) 2003&#150;04 (estimated).

 Information on Formula Grant and Standard Spending Assessments/Formula Spending Shares is given in the following table. The total of Revenue Support Grant depends in part on early estimates of the National Non-Domestic Rate yield, which is particularly variable. The total of Formula Grant has been quoted instead, the total general funding provided to local authorities and the basis of the "floor and ceiling" limitations on grant changes. Formula Grant consists of Revenue Support Grant, National Non-Domestic Rates and Police Grant.

<a name="30521w28.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the percentage increase was in <i>(a)</i> rate support and <i>(b)</i> NNDR to local authorities in 2003; what percentage of such increases will be taken up by (i) increases in national insurance, (ii) increased pension contributions, (iii) under funded public sector pay settlements and (iv) other duties and powers imposed but not funded by Government.  [114545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Under the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2003&#150;04, Revenue Support Grant (RSG) increased by 15.3 per cent. and the National Non Domestic Rates (NNDR) Distributable Amount decreased by 6.2 per cent. NNDR and RSG (along with Principal Formula Police Grant) are part of general grant which increased by 5.9 per cent. or &#163;2.249 billion overall on a like for like basis.
<P>

<a name="30521w28.html_para9">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimate the change in national insurance contributions will increase local authorities' pay costs on average by some &#163;250 million. It is estimated that the 0.4 per cent. increase in employers contributions to the Teacher's Pension Scheme which local authorities have had to fund from within the 5.9 per cent. increase in general grant will add some &#163;54 million to local authorities' revenue expenditure. These pressures add 0.73 per cent. to the 2002&#150;03 adjusted baseline of &#163;41.445 billion. If both are excluded, the increase in general grant would be 5.17 per cent. or &#163;2.145 billion.
<P>

<a name="30521w28.html_para10">The Spending Review 2000 took into account the results of the 1998 Local Government Pension Scheme valuation exercise and the forthcoming 2004 valuation exercise will inform SR2004. Pay settlements for local government staff are a matter for local authorities and the pay review bodies. It is expected that awards which take into account the overall increase in funding available to councils while reflecting the need to recruit and retain staff.
<P>

<a name="30521w28.html_para11">The Government funds all new burdens placed on local authorities under the principle of New Burdens which requires Government to reimburse local authorities for any additional costs they face as a result of the imposition of new powers or duties. For example, the Spending Review made clear for the first time the burdens funded in the environmental, protective and cultural services and provided &#163;82 million in year one for burdens such as the changes affecting the disposal of fridges. Following the Spending Review, we transferred funds into the settlement for burdens which could not be agreed at the time, such as an additional &#163;50 million a year over the next three years for the implications for age-equalisation on the mandatory concessionary fares scheme.

<a name="30521w29.html_wqn2"><B> Mr Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much funding each local authority contributes in the financial year 2002&#150;03 to funding regional assemblies; what the expenditure of each regional assembly <i>(a)</i> was in that period and <i>(b)</i> is expected to be in 2003&#150;04; how many staff each assembly employs; and what estimate he has made of the effect upon council tax levels of funding regional assemblies.  [114718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Regional Assemblies are answerable to central Government for the use of their allocation of the Chambers Fund (in both 2002&#150;3 and 2003&#150;4 &#163;5 million per annum across the eight regions); Regional Planning Body money (in 2003&#150;4 &#163;6 million per annum); and Planning Delivery Grant (in 2003&#150;4 &#163;3 million per annum). Their financial arrangements with local authorities are a matter between them and the relevant local authorities.

<a name="30521w29.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the timescale is for <i>(a)</i> English regional chambers to set up regional planning bodies as provided for in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill and <i>(b)</i> drawing up regional spatial strategies; how this timetable will be linked with that for drawing up regional transport strategies; what estimate he has made of (i) the initial and (ii) the annual running costs of regional planning bodies; and from which budgets these costs will be met.  [114343]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 All the English regional chambers are now regional planning bodies (RPBs). Providing they operate in a sufficiently inclusive way they will be recognised as RPBs once the relevant provisions of the new Bill commence. On commencement my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister will prescribe which existing regional planning guidance should become regional spatial strategies (RSSs). Thereafter, the timetable for revisions to particular RSSs, including their transport elements, will be agreed between the RPB and the Government Office. RPB running costs are a matter for them. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is contributing over &#163;9 million, including planning delivery grant, this year towards RPB running costs. RPBs can also receive moneys or in kind assistance from local authority and other member organisations.

 Section 3(3) of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act sets out the question to be asked in any local government referendum. The options for unitary local government which are put to voters in two-tier areas in such a referendum cannot be determined until the Boundary Committee has made its recommendations. So the order for a local government

referendum to be held will set out the text of the options which are to appear on the ballot paper. Sections 3(7) and 3(8) of the Act provide, respectively, that the Electoral Commission must be consulted on this wording and that their comments are laid before each House when the order is laid. The order will also be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.Local government reorganisation would only go ahead if an elected assembly is to be established. The local government referendums will be advisory, though the Govemment would intend to be guided by the results.

One of the key priorities is to support urban renaissance for economic growth. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is satisfied the RDA and its partners recognise the important role urban renewal plays in economic development. This is reflected in the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Economic Strategy.

To ask the Prime Minister how many contracts have been awarded by his Government to KPMG since 1997.  [113693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30521w30.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Contracts for Government work are awarded within a policy and legal framework which requires the process to be fair and objective and deliver value for money. However, responsibility for any contract rests with the individual Department concerned. Information for the Government as a whole is therefore not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The presentation of the painting, which was signed by the leaders of the three main political parties as well as a large number of Members of Parliament from all sides, was not carried out on my behalf.
