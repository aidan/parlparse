<a name="00117w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will make a statement on the prospects for criminal prosecutions being started relating to the Paddington rail disaster.  [104709]<P>

<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The British Transport Police are conducting a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the train collision in the vicinity of Ladbroke Grove on Tuesday 5 October 1999. As the police complete aspects of their inquiries, they intend to submit for advice reports, together with supporting evidence, to the Crown Prosecution Service. The prospects for criminal proceedings by the CPS are dependent on evidence derived from the police investigation, and not, for example, from evidence given to the public inquiry to be conducted by Lord Cullen, as that inquiry has an entirely different function. It is plainly not possible to anticipate, nor is it appropriate to speculate on, what evidence will be obtained by the police. When police inquiries conclude, the decision on whether or not to institute criminal proceedings will be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Crown Prosecution Service, in consultation with the Law Officers. I understand that the HSE will also be considering the possibility of bringing a prosecution.

To ask the Solicitor-General what recent representations he has received relating to immunity from prosecution for those giving evidence before a tribunal with special reference to the Paddington rail disaster; and if he will make a statement.  [104710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 On 29 November 1999 the Attorney-General authorised Lord Cullen to provide potential witnesses to his inquiry with the following undertaking:
<P>

<a name="00117w01.html_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To undertake in respect of any person who provides evidence to the inquiry that no evidence he or she may give before the inquiry (whether orally or by written statement) nor any written statement made preparatory to giving evidence nor any documents produced by that person to the inquiry will be used in evidence against him or her in any criminal proceedings, except in proceedings where he or she is charged with having given false evidence in the course of this inquiry or having conspired with or procured others to do so".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00117w01.html_para1">The purpose of authorising Lord Cullen to provide an undertaking in these terms was to enable him to begin his inquiry immediately, and to ensure that it would be fully effective. It was certain that without such an undertaking being given potential witnesses would be inhibited from providing Lord Cullen with full assistance. The public 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2000 : Column: 244W</I><P>
interest clearly favoured Lord Cullen undertaking his inquiry as soon as possible, and thereafter proceeding quickly, so that lessons can be learned from the circumstances that led to this tragedy. The undertaking is not the same as an immunity from prosecution: it has a much more limited effect.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the environmental improvements agreed by Ofwat for the Mersey Basin for the next price review to be completed in 2005.  [104292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have placed in the House Libraries a list of the schemes allowed for in the final determination of water industry price limits announced by Director General Ofwat on 25 July 1999, which will improve the waters in the Mersey Basin. The list is made up of 60 continuous discharges and 516 intermittent discharges. These were proposed by the Environment Agency and approved by me as part of my guidance to Ofwat on the provision to be made for investments by water companies to achieve environmental improvements. The Environment Agency is exploring in more detail the benefits of a further five schemes to allow us to assess these against improved information on costs from Ofwat and North West Water.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has made to <i>(a)</i> the European Commission and <i>(b)</i> other EU member states in respect of a common basis of charging for IPPC throughout the EU; and what response he has received.  [104114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The IPPC Directive makes no provision for a common charging scheme; in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, charging is a matter for individual member states.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is forecast to be the total level of investment in the London Underground in <i>(a)</i> 2000-01 and <i>(b)</i> 2001-02.  [104230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Planned investment in the Underground in 2000-01 totals &#163;753 million (in outturn prices). This comprises investment of &#163;535 million in the core Underground and a projected &#163;218 million in payments to JLE contractors for investment that took place in previous years.
<P>

<a name="00117w01.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> For 2001-02 and beyond, the Public Private Partnership currently under negotiation is designed to deliver around &#163;8 billion worth of investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the regulations covering domestic plumbing will come into force; and if he will take steps to ensure toilet flushes using valves do not waste more water than those using syphon systems.  [104424]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations came into force on 1 July 1999. They prevent the contamination and waste of water supplies. A WC Suite Performance Specification, made under the Regulations, will come into effect on 1 January 2001. This will require all new WC suites, whether they use valve or syphon flushing mechanisms, to perform to the same high standards of durability and water conservation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he has <i>(a)</i> taken and ((b) proposes to implement the commitment in the Transport White Paper to a more peaceful countryside.  [104576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department is an active participant in the Countryside Agency's Countryside Traffic Measures Group, and its Quiet Roads and Greenways Network Co-ordination Meetings. We provide support in the form of advice when required on traffic signing, and on highways and traffic matters. Research is in place, and more is planned, to monitor the success of schemes in these initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it is his policy to support the adoption of a biosafety protocol allowing Governments to prohibit imports of genetically modified organisms.  [104586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Yes. The Biosafety Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity would establish Advanced Informed Agreement (AIA) procedures, whereby a Party of import could accept or refuse imports of certain living (genetically) modified organisms (LMOs) on the basis of the impacts on biodiversity.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_wqn9"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it is his policy to support the adoption of a biosafety protocol making companies that produce genetically modified organisms legally liable for any future damage to the environment or public health resulting from the import of those GMOs by another country.  [104584]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In the negotiations on the Biosafety Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity resuming in Montreal later this month, we will continue to support an enabling provision that would adopt a process elaborating international rules and procedures in the field of liability and redress for damage resulting from 



<P>

<a name="00117w01.html_wqn10"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it is his policy to support the adoption of a biosafety protocol requiring the separation of genetically modified grain from other grain.  [104585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The draft text of the Biosafety Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity does not require separation. However, EU Ministers have agreed that information exchange and documentation requirements are needed under the Protocol and should ensure satisfactory transparency and monitoring of movements of LMOs as well as their identification, which would also enable traceability.

<UL>(2) what timetable has been agreed for the installation of train protection systems in all rolling stock, including the final date for completion.  [104665]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Railway Safety Regulations, laid before Parliament on 10 August 1999, requires train protection systems to be introduced and operational across the railway network by the end of 2003 at the latest.
<P>

<a name="00117w02.html_para0">At the Rail Safety Summit on 30 November the train operators announced that they have agreed a timetable to fit 33 per cent. of trains by the end of 2001, 75 per cent. of trains by the end of 2002 and all trains by the end of 2003. Also at the Summit, Railtrack agreed to aim to install train protection at 12,000 sites by the end of 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Following the Ladbroke Grove train accident the Government asked Sir David Davies, the President of the Royal Academy of Engineering, to report on the effectiveness, practicability and cost of train protection systems, and on how best to reduce the present incidence of signals passed at danger (SPADs). Ministers expect to receive his report shortly.
<P>

<a name="00117w02.html_para1">This information will be available to Lord Cullen (who is conducting the Public Inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove accident) and Professor Uff (conducting the Southall Inquiry), and they will jointly consider train protection systems.

<P>
<a name="00117w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 At the second Rail Safety Summit on 30 November 1999 Railtrack and the train operating companies agreed that the independent and confidential incident reporting system, which will allow all staff to phone in any safety concerns, will be extended throughout Great Britain by the end of 2000. Regional contracts are to be let by April 2000. The system will be fully operative by the end of 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to provide funding for <i>(a)</i> enforcing and overseeing corrective action at leaking underground storage tank sites and <i>(b)</i> clean-ups (i) where the owner or operator is unknown, or is unwilling or unable to respond and (ii) which require emergency action.  [104638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The main responsibilities for regulating underground storage tanks, including enforcing and overseeing corrective action when they are leaking, are held by the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the petroleum licensing authorities. The legal powers available to these bodies, and the detailed allocation of responsibilities between them, varies according to what is stored in the tank and the type of pollution incident involved. The Environment Agency is funded through grant-in-aid paid by my department as well as by charges paid by those seeking permits and licences. The Health and Safety Executive is also funded through grant-in-aid as well as from charges for certain activities which are recovered from industry. The petroleum licensing authorities are part of local government, and as such are funded through a combination of council tax, non-domestic rates and revenue support grant paid by my Department.
<P>

<a name="00117w02.html_para2">In cases where leaks have occurred and clean-up action is necessary, responsibility for paying for the work generally falls on the owner or operator of the tank. Depending on what was stored in the tank, and the nature of the problems which the leak has caused, this responsibility may be enforced under a number of legal powers. These include the works notice system in sections 161-161D of the Water Resources Act 1991, under which the Environment Agency may itself carry out works in an emergency or where it appears after reasonable inquiry that no person can be found on whom to serve a works notice; the statutory nuisance regime in Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990; and the Groundwater Regulations 1998. These powers will be supplemented in April by a new regime for remediating contaminated land, under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (which was inserted by section 57 of the Environment Act 1995). An additional &#163;12 million per year has been added to Standard Spending Assessments for local authorities in England to support their role under the new contaminated land regime.
<P>

<a name="00117w02.html_para3">The Contaminated Land Supplementary Credit Approval programme also provides capital expenditure support for local authorities in England to deal with cases where land contamination is causing unacceptable risks to human health and the environment, and where no-one else can be made to pay for the necessary remediation. This could include circumstances where leaks have occurred from underground storage tanks. The total provision in 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2000 : Column: 248W</I><P>
the current financial year for this programme is &#163;12.082 million. A further &#163;1.958 million has been provided to the Environment Agency as additional grant-in-aid to support equivalent work it is carrying out.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the increased contributions which local government employers will have to make to their pension schemes in order to offset the effect of the ACT charges in the 1997 Budget; and what these extra contributions are as a percentage of the total payroll costs.  [104674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The effect of the abolition of advance corporation tax on employer contributions to local authority pension funds was one of many factors taken into account in the 1998 actuarial valuation exercise. Information on increases to individual local authority employers' contributions specifically attributable to this aspect of the exercise is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="00117w02.html_para4">The Local Government Association estimated that the average net impact of the 1998 valuation, including the effect of the ACT changes on employers' contributions in 1999-2000 was 1 per cent., or about &#163;130 million nationally. We have honoured undertakings given at the time of the 1997 Budget to take into account this and all the other factors identified in the valuation exercise in determining the level of local authority provision in 1999-2000, and for subsequent years.

I would also add that the transport operators provided the absolute maximum service possible. Tube and DLR provided a peak level service from midnight to after 4 am (20 trains an hour for the tube). Train operators ran the maximum service possible from 1 am to after 4.30 am. LT ran nearly double the usual night bus service. We always warned that people should expect long delays. Most people were able to catch a train or tube before 2.30 am. Despite a very high level of attendance the transport operators were able to get people both safely to the event, and back home again after.

<P>
<a name="00117w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has reviewed the decision announced by the then Minister for Transport on 29 October 1998, following representations made to him and comments received during consultation earlier this year on draft regulations under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="00117w03.html_para3">Ministers have concluded that the earlier decision strikes a reasonable balance between the legitimate interests of the parties involved. I can therefore confirm that the utilities' contribution to diversionary works for "major transport works" (which as defined under the 1991 Act include rail based public transport schemes) will be reduced from 18 per cent. to 7.5 per cent., except that works that are of the nature of "major highways works" or "major bridge works" will continue to attract 18 per cent., whoever the works are done by.
<P>

<a name="00117w03.html_para4">I will shortly be laying regulations to implement this decision. The regulations will now come into effect after they have been laid and not from the date of the 1998 announcement, as stated at the time.

<P>
<a name="00117w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 DETR receives comprehensive data on the vehicle stock in Great Britain from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. These include the method of propulsion used to power vehicles. For those vehicles in the goods tax class at the end of June 1999, over 99 per cent. run on diesel. A further 0.7 per cent. run on petrol and less than 0.02 per cent. are recorded as running on other fuels.

 The Franchising Director has been instructed by the Secretary of State to have regard to the prospects for greater investment when considering the replacement of franchises. In pursuit of these instructions the Franchising Director is paying close attention to prospective franchisees' proposals for improving all aspects of the customer experience, including station facilities, security and integrated transport measures.
<P>

<a name="00117w03.html_para5">In examining proposals for renegotiated, extended or new franchises, the Franchising Director has also been instructed to give due weight to the commitment of existing franchise operators to performance, efficiency and customer services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Any tolling scheme, or any form of levy, would have to apply to domestic vehicles as well as foreign. To discriminate against foreign vehicles would be illegal under Community law. The Transport Bill currently before Parliament contains enabling powers for local authorities to introduce charging schemes on their roads, but there are no plans at present to introduce widespread charging on the trunk road network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government have taken a number of measures to promote the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels. Gas powered lorries and buses already qualify for a vehicle excise duty concession of up to &#163;1,000 and electrical vehicles are taxed at a concessionary rate of &#163;40. The new graduated vehicle excise duty system for cars is being built in a flexible way which will allow scope to create additional incentives for vehicles using cleaner fuels and technology.

 We require the operators of motorway service areas (MSAs) to provide up to two hours free parking for all types of vehicle. Operators are allowed to charge for longer stays but whether to levy a charge and, if so, how to enforce it against drivers who do not pay, are matters for the operator.

<a name="00117w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Train Operating Companies (TOCs) must set their timetables within the framework of the Passenger Service Requirements (PSR). The PSR sets minimum service frequency, stations to be served, times of first and last trains and maximum journey times, based on the service provided by British Rail at the time of franchising. TOCs can alter the journey times of services but only within the maxima allowed in the PSR. Temporary dispensations may be granted to TOCs by the Franchising Director to extend journey times during periods of bad weather and at times such as the annual leaf fall in order to provide a reliable service to passengers.

 Following a review by the British Railways Board/shadow Strategic Rail Authority of its property portfolio, the Government have agreed with the Chairman of the sSRA new marketing procedures which give priority to transport use. Under these arrangements the rail industry, local authorities and other transport interests are being informed of all the properties that BRB/sSRA have available including those judged to be of future transport potential. They are also being given prior notification of the intention to market all sites as they come up for sale and have the opportunity to seek a delay in order to work up a bid. All sites are to be sold at open market value in order to protect the taxpayers' interest. Full details are in the BRB's "Marketing Process" document which is available in the House Library.

 The Government are aware of concerns among some developing countries. However, the Government believe that there is nothing in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement which undermines the ability of developing countries to provide appropriate healthcare. Although the Agreement came into effect in 1995, developing country members have only to implement its provisions from this year and the least developed countries do not have to implement until 2006. The effects, benefits and problems arising from the agreement have therefore yet to emerge.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will publish the Government's assessment of the outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, including the conclusions it has drawn concerning future trade negotiations.  [104358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 An assessment of the outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations was published in May 1994 by the Government in a White Paper, "The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations 1986-94" (Cm 2579). In relation to future trade negotiations, the Government published a consultation paper in May 1999 entitled "The UK and the World Trade Organisation: An Introduction to the Next Round" (DTI/Pub4140/5k/5/99/NP. URN 99/875). Both documents are available in the Libraries of both Houses. The Government's position in supporting the launch of a comprehensive Round of trade negotiations has been discussed in Parliament, most recently in the debate in European Standing Committee C on 22 November 1999. The Government's position is well reflected in the position of the EU and its support for the launch of a comprehensive Round remains strong since the failure of the Seattle Conference, as the Secretary of State said in the debate in the House on 9 December 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1022-94.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Two hundred and twenty seven employees took early retirement packages at a cost of some &#163;1.4 million in the financial year 1996-97. This represents 20 per cent. of the costs, the other 80 per cent. being met by the Treasury under the 80:20 Scheme in force at the time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much was allocated from the social and

<P><I>17 Jan 2000 : Column: 258W</I><P>
regional funds of the European Union to the United Kingdom during the 1999 financial year; what was the value of match funding from United Kingdom sources; and from what sources these match funds were derived. [105124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Allocations from the European Union's Structural Funds relate to multiannual programmes. Expenditure must be committed within the programme period, but may be spent up to two years after the end of the period. There are therefore no allocations for specific years, and expenditure during 1999 would be in the context of programmes approved during the 1994-99 financing period with expenditure allowed until the end of 2001.
<P>

<a name="00117w05.html_para3">The level of match funding varies from programme to programme. The sources of match funding will depend on the nature of the many individual projects. It is the responsibility of applicants for funding to identify the sources of match funding for their projects. Programme secretariats can advise on this. There are many potential sources, e.g. central government, local authorities, the voluntary and private sectors. No central records exist of the sources of match funding used for individual projects.

[105062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 It remains Government policy to support a comprehensive round of negotiations in the WTO, including investment and government procurement.

As I made clear in my reply of 16 December 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 235W, I have asked the company to make public details of the remedial measures being taken as soon as possible, consistent with the need to address these matters thoroughly and to satisfy the HSE fully as to the adequacy of the company's proposals. On 15 December 1999, I received a briefing from HSE's Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations on progress with HSE's independent investigation into this matter.

 As a result of a fire at Drax power station on 27 December I understand that part of the output of the station will be unavailable for a period. It is not uncommon for some generating plants to be unavailable for technical reasons and there is adequate generating capacity available on the system to cover such incidents. The incident at Drax affected only around 1 per cent. of the available generation on the England and Wales system and the impact on Pool prices is small.

 The Peace Camps or Peace Villages set up by the Government of Sudan in the Nuba Mountain region have been accused of being part of the Government's alleged aim of islamisation of the people.

Last year's United Nations assessment mission to the region did not identify religious discrimination as a problem, but the subject was not part of the mission's terms of reference.

 In Ethiopia, recent estimates by the Government of Ethiopia, endorsed by the World Food Programme, give a total of 6.9 million people in need of food aid assistance due to adverse weather.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps have been taken to create an Equality Unit within the Northern Ireland Office to co-ordinate the work relating to equality schemes of United Kingdom departments and other bodies designated by the Secretary of State under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  [103814]<P>

<a name="00117w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Human Rights Unit in the Northern Ireland Office advises the Secretary of State on all issues relating to equality schemes for which the Secretary of State is responsible.
<P>

<a name="00117w07.html_para3">The Equality Commission is required by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to produce statutory guidelines on equality schemes (subject to approval by the Secretary of State) and these guidelines will be given to all public authorities designated under section 75. United Kingdom Government Departments and other bodies designated by the Secretary of State under section 75 will submit their equality schemes to the Commission for approval. The Secretary of State is responsible for approving public authority equality schemes which have been referred to him by the Equality Commission. The Commission cannot refer the equality schemes of United Kingdom Government Departments to the Secretary of State.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what provision has been made within the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that it, and the voluntary and community sectors with which it works, have been provided with sufficient resources to ensure that they are able to comply with the statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity.  [103815]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 No additional financial resources have been provided to ensure that the Northern Ireland Office and the voluntary and community sectors with whom it works are able to comply with the statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity. However the Government believes that these public authorities have sufficient resources to ensure that they are able to comply with the statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity.

 The extended consultation process which the Review Group engaged in, together with the range and complexity of the issues which the Group was invited to address, meant that the analytical phase of their work began later and has taken longer than the Group expected. I understand, however, that the report is now at an advanced stage of preparation and that it is hoped to publish it as soon as possible.

 Our objective is to reduce the learning time lost due to truancy and exclusion by one third by year 2002. Over three years we are investing &#163;500 million across England on projects tackling truancy and school exclusion, and other initiatives to get children back into school and learning. Projects supported include the purchasing of electronic equipment to monitor attendance, additional staff to chase-up truants, and reward schemes for acknowledging regular attendance. We are also encouraging schools to set up pupil mentoring schemes and to develop home-school liaison through the implementation of home-school agreements. All of these activities are designed to help schools reduce unauthorised absence.
<P>

<a name="00117w08.html_para5">On 1 November 1999 we issued our strategy document "Tackling Truancy Together" which sets out our further proposals for helping to reduce unauthorised absence from school. We are currently considering the many responses we received to the proposals in that document, and will make an announcement soon on what further action we want to take to help reduce unauthorised absence from school.

 Kent Local Education Authority's Standards Fund Grant 19 allocation for secondary schools and LEA initiatives has been increased from &#163;950,000 in 1999-2000 to &#163;2.8 million for 2000-01. Nearly &#163;2.2 million of the grant must be devolved directly to Kent secondary schools and colleges to help combat truancy and exclusions. Kent are consulting on how the funds will be distributed.

 In line with our continuing commitment for ensuring quality, the Employment Service has worked in partnership with the Training Standards Council (TSC) to develop a framework for the assessment of the quality of New Deal training provision. By March 2002, every New Deal Unit of Delivery will have been inspected by the Council. This framework is the basis for each New Deal partnership to carry out an annual self assessment. These inspections and self-assessments cover the quality of all training provision including that delivered by the private sector.

<P>
<a name="00117w09.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 We have significantly increased the funding available under the Schools Access Initiative to enable local education authorities to improve access to mainstream schools and the curriculum for pupils with disabilities. We recently announced that &#163;30 million will be available in the 2000-01 financial year. This is a 50 per cent. increase on the previous year's level of funding and 200 per cent. increase on funds available in 1996-97. We expect to allocate &#163;100 million for access schemes in the three years to 2002.
<P>

<a name="00117w09.html_para0">In the Further Education sector the Further Education Funding Council's (FEFC) funding methodology allows for additional units of funding, to be allocated to support provision for students with disabilities, or learning difficulties. This is used to fund a range of support for individual students, including care assistants and signers. In addition, &#163;12 million capital funding has been allocated

over three years (1999-2000, 2000-01, 2001-02) specifically to improve access and facilities for students with learning difficulties and or disabilities. Capital projects supported under the general widening participation and skills agenda will also have the potential to improve access for disabled students. Responsibility for funding of further education will pass to the Learning and Skills Council from April 2001 and a consultation document on the new Council's funding arrangements will be issued early in 2000.
<P>

<a name="00117w09.html_para1">Improving access and facilities for disabled people in education was a key feature of the recommendations of the Disability Rights Task Force, who published their report "From Exclusion to Inclusion" in December 1999. We will be introducing legislation later this session to address its recommendations for education and consider longer term costs as part of the Year 2000 Spending Review.

 Decisions have yet to be taken about the structure of the Youth Support Service and how Careers Service companies will be affected. It is therefore too early to consider the extent to which TUPE regulations will apply to Careers Service staff. We indicated in the White Paper "Learning to Succeed" that the best of the Careers Service companies will play a major role in the new Service together with a range of other local partners. We have established a Transitional Issues Group with Careers Service National Association (CSNA) that will be considering the implications for Careers Service companies and providing them with guidance.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> There is a comprehensive evaluation programme in place for all elements of New Deal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what assessment was made by his Department of the impact on fishing activity prior to the testing of live cluster bombs in Luce Bay;  [104356]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to use live munitions in future trials in <i>(a)</i> Luce Bay and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere around the Scottish coast;  [104353]
<P>
(3) for what reason live cluster bombs were used in recent trials at Luce Bay, Wigtownshire;  [104354]
<P>
(4) what assessment was made by his Department of the prospects for recovery of bombs, prior to the testing of live cluster bombs in Luce Bay; and if he will make a statement.  [104355]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The trials at Luce Bay that took place over Easter last year were an urgent operational requirement in direct support of the UK participation in the NATO action in Kosovo. Live variants of the cluster bomb were used because there were insufficient inert bombs available to complete the trials within the required timescale. Although these weapons contained live bomblets, they were configured in such a manner as not to deploy the bomblets in flight.
<P>

<a name="00117w10.html_para42">Before any trial is approved a detailed series of risk assessments and defined controlled operating procedures are required. In addition, prior to the Luce Bay trial options for the recovery, disposal and containment of the bombs were all considered. The final decision to contain the bombs on the seabed was made once the trial has been completed and the situation assessed. The impact area within the licensed danger area of the Luce Bay range was selected on the basis that no significant fishing activity was regularly carried out in that area. The exact location was selected using the experience and judgment of the West Freugh Range and Ground Control Officers, who have between them more than 38 years of experience of monitoring all activities which emanate from the range.

<a name="00117w10.html_para43">In common with other test and evaluation ranges in the UK the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's Luce Bay range is formally licensed for trials involving the use of live ordnance, and operates in accordance with the local byelaws governing its use. Whilst the majority of the trials conducted in the Luce Bay area and elsewhere around the Scottish coast are achieved wherever possible using inert material, there will inevitably be requirements in the future for trials using live ordnance to support the effectiveness of the United Kingdom armed services, sometimes at short notice. All trials, whether using live or inert weapons are subject to the same stringent controls and procedures to ensure the safe operation of all such activities.

Formal applications to use Ministry of Defence land are considered on a case-by-case basis to ensure that none of the above constraints are compromised. All applications for the use of Salisbury Plain are vetted by the Commandant Army Training Estate Salisbury Plain's staff to ensure that live firing, manoeuvre or general military training is not taking place.

 The limitations of the CLANSMAN tactical radio system are well understood and it is due to replaced by the BOWMAN system. MOD reacted swiftly to concern regarding the capability of CLANSMAN on operations in Kosovo. Two programmes were run under Urgent Operational Requirement procedures. Project POLYGON provided a commercial handheld radio system for the battalion operating in the Pristina area and entered service in September 1999. Project POLYGON PLUS will shortly extend this commercial system, giving all UK troops in theatre access to the protected tactical system.

 Funding to reduce orthopaedic waiting lists in the Defence Secondary Care Agency was not removed as part of my Department's efficiency programme as no funds had been allocated for this purpose in 1999-2000. At the beginning of the financial year consideration was given to the possibility of identifying funding to reduce waiting lists, primarily but not exclusively, for orthopaedic treatment. However, this did not prove to be practical, although some additional physiotherapy, provided through a separate initiative, is likely to have affected the numbers on waiting lists overall. The possibility of pursuing action to reduce orthopaedic waiting lists in the next financial year is currently under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w12.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 I am responding on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to the reports of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) and the Review Body on Nursing staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB), which are published today. I understand that a similar announcement is being made by the First Minister and the Minister for Health and Community Care in Scotland. Copies of the reports are 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2000 : Column: 286W</I><P>
available in the Vote Office and the Library. I am grateful to the chairmen and members of both Review Bodies for their hard work.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para3">Nurses are to receive another big real terms increase in pay and, for the second year in succession, the award is being paid in full, with no staging. The NPRB have recommended an across the board increase of 3.4 per cent. for nurses, midwives and health visitors with bigger targeted increases for specific groups. About 60,000 Grade E nurses on the scale maximum will get a total increase of 7.8 per cent., worth an extra &#163;1,390 a year, to improve career progression and reward skill acquisition and experience. Another 5,500 enrolled and auxiliary nurses in Grade C will receive total increases of 7 per cent., worth an extra &#163;975 a year. London allowances, stand-by and on-call allowances will also rise by 3.4 per cent. This means that an experienced staff nurse in London will earn basic pay of &#163;22,250; and elsewhere &#163;19,220, with allowances and enhancements typically worth &#163;2,000 on top of this.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para4">The NPRB have also recommended across the board increases of 3.4 per cent. for physiotherapists, radiographers and other professions allied to medicine (PAMs). In addition about 4,500 experienced staff in the Senior 2 grade will receive total increases worth between 8.1 per cent. and 8.4 per cent., to improve career progression for experienced staff at the top of their scale. The maximum of the scale for Senior 2 grade PAMs will be &#163;21,290. London allowances, stand-by and on-call allowances will also rise by 3.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para5">The Government have decided to accept all the NPRB pay recommendations for 2000-01, with no staging. The across the board settlement of 3.4 per cent. for nurses and other NPRB remit groups is high when set against the current headline inflation rate and more than we are expecting for pay settlements in the public sector generally. However, National Health Service staff deserve a fair pay award, especially after coping so magnificently with huge pressures over the past few weeks. Moreover, we are still having to tackle the nursing recruitment and retention problems inherited as a direct consequence of the last Government's failure. This year's settlement will build on last year's large awards. Taken together, the great majority of Grade D and E nurses--the backbone of the service, who deliver hands-on patient care--will have received very significant pay increases which both recognise and value their contribution to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para6">Last year's pay awards gave a big boost to the success of the nurses' recruitment campaign which we launched in February 1999. Already over 5,000 nurses have returned or are set to do so after completing refresher training, and numbers taking up nursing degree and diploma courses have increased by 24 per cent. and 18 per cent. respectively. There has also been a sharp increase in male applications and in applications from the ethnic minority communities. But we are not stopping there and are determined to build on this success in our 2000 campaign to be launched next month. These awards will provide a welcome boost.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para7">The Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB) has recommended an overall increase of 3.3 per cent. for salaried doctors and dentists and in the pay element of fees for general medical and general dental practitioners. In addition to the 3.3 per cent. increase, consultants will also start to receive from 1 April 2000 the increases 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2000 : Column: 287W</I><P>
flowing through from the &#163;50 million recommended by DDRB last year in recognition of their workload, work intensity and commitment to the NHS. These increases are worth a further 3 per cent. on their pay bill and will take two forms. First, changes to the discretionary point arrangements means that there will be over 2,400 extra awards available (worth over &#163;2,500 each), making almost 5,600 in total, while the number of consultants eligible to receive awards will increase from 12,600 to almost 16,000. Second, there will be a new scheme to recognise consultants working in the most intense posts. For junior doctors the 3.3 per cent. increase is over and above the money already on the table in our current negotiations on their new contract; from October 2000, this would add 6 per cent. to their paybill in the first 12 months.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para8">General dental practitioners will also benefit from a &#163;20 million package to recognise experience and quality and to reward past and present commitment to NHS dentistry. This will give a big boost to the Government's dental strategy and to improve access to NHS dentistry.
<P>

<a name="00117w12.html_para9">The contribution of all staff will be crucial if we are to maintain and improve the quality of patient care and to modernise the NHS. These pay awards, which build on the platform set by last year's increases, reflect a proper balance between the pay needed to recruit, retain and motivate staff and the needs of modern service delivery and patient care.

<P>
<a name="00117w13.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The epidemiologists definition of an epidemic is an increase in the frequency of occurrence of a disease in a population above its baseline level for a specified period of time. The term epidemic can be used when describing the pattern of either infectious or chronic diseases in the population.
<P>

<a name="00117w13.html_para3">Administrative definitions can be set for different diseases in which an arbitrary threshold is selected above which the term "epidemic" is applied. In the case of influenza, the Department introduced in 1996 an administrative definition of an "epidemic" for a rate of consultation (with a sample of general practices) of 400 per 100,000 population in a week.
<P>

<a name="00117w13.html_para4">Such influenza activity in England is thus monitored through the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sentinel surveillance scheme. This records the number of first visits to a general practitioner with influenza-illness. Other respiratory illnesses prevalent at this time of year are recorded separately.
<P>

<a name="00117w13.html_para5">This system does not and cannot measure the real incidence of influenza since it is restricted to those people who visit their general practitioner. This year a major 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2000 : Column: 289W</I><P>
campaign was run to encourage people to choose their own remedy, to consult a pharmacist and to use NHS Direct, as alternative sources of advice.
<P>

<a name="00117w13.html_para6">The severity of the disease itself can also vary from year to year. This year the elderly have been particularly affected by the complications of influenza. The level of cases of acute bronchitis, a serious complication of influenza, is the highest the RCGP surveillance system has seen for 15 years. In describing epidemics some other countries formally include measures of severity in the definition of an epidemic. For example, the United States declares an epidemic when the proportion of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza passes a certain threshold.
<P>

<a name="00117w13.html_para7">The Department has not introduced administrative definitions of an epidemic for diseases other than influenza.

The panel solicitors will advise the complainant on whether a solicitor has been negligent and if so what action can by pursued.

 Under Section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971, it is a criminal offence to facilitate the entry to the United Kingdom of an illegal entrant, or asylum claimant. The penalty, on summary conviction, is a fine of not more than &#163;5,000 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both; conviction on indictment is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than seven years, or both. That period is increased under Section 29 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to ten years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Allocations of Government funding to police authorities are made on the basis of a needs-based formula, which takes into account projected pensions expenditure. As with most formulae, variations can occur from year to year, with some authorities doing relatively better than others.
<P>

<a name="00117w16.html_para0">Police authority "budget requirements" will increase by 3.1 per cent. in this financial year. On the basis of estimates provided by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, the police service nationally could have an increase in net expenditure in this financial year of 5.9 per cent. taking account among other things of the use of reserves. It is for individual authorities to determine how best to manage their budgets. Prudent management of medical retirements can help police authorities to reduce pensions' costs and deploy more resources to front-line policing.

<P>

 Most of the costs of implementing the Public Safety Radio Communications Service (PSRCS) are contained within annual charges for the core service.

<P>

<a name="00117w16.html_para2">Individual forces will elect to take a range of services additional to the core service to meet their own requirements. From figures provided by forces we estimate that the cost of these non-core services will be around &#163;30 million per annum for the police service nationally. The table provides the currently available estimates for the cost of non-core services to individual forces.
<P>

<a name="00117w16.html_para3">Forces will also need to purchase radio terminals, control room equipment and integration services. No force-specific estimates are available, but the Police Information Technology Organisation estimates that the total cost of these additional items for forces in England and Wales will be around &#163;300 million in net present cost terms. This includes the cost of initial purchase and subsequent replacement over the life of the project but excludes the cost of the dedicated teams which each force will need to set up to manage implementation of the

<a name="00117w17.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ashdown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the real terms change in police budgets in each English county and Metropolitan area for each year from 1990-91 to 2001-02; if he will provide estimates on the same basis excluding moneys needed to fund annual increases in police pensions; and if he will make a statement.  [105097]<P>

<P>
<a name="00117w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The information available, which has been compiled from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's Police Statistics, is set out in the tables. Police authority budgets for 2001-02 have not been set. Information on net police pensions expenditure for 1990-91 to 1992-93 is not readily available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers there were in the Avon and Somerset force in each year from 1985 to 1999, giving figures on a quarterly basis from 1995 onwards; and if he will make a statement.  [105094]<P>

 The information available is set out in the table. Since 1995 police numbers have been collected only twice a year--in March and September--so as to reduce administrative burdens on the police.

<a name="00117w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Mike Tyson arrived in the United Kingdom on Sunday 16 January and was given leave to enter until 30 January, for the purposes of the scheduled contest on 29 January. He was admitted under an instruction to immigration officers which I announced on 13 January and which was made under schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971. Given the high profile nature of this case and the complex issues that it raised, I took the view that it would have been invidious for an individual immigration officer to have to weigh the competing considerations involved.
<P>

<a name="00117w18.html_para0">I was advised that the relevant Immigration Rule, which has been in place in this form since 1994, provides that normally persons with convictions for offences which in this country attract a maximum sentence of 12 months or more imprisonment are to be refused leave to enter, but leaves a discretion to allow entry if there are strong compassionate circumstances or the case is otherwise exceptional. I considered representations sent by Mr. Frank Warren against the background of this advice and concluded that there were no strong compassionate circumstances but there were other exceptional circumstances in this case which justified granting leave to enter to Mr. Tyson.
<P>

<a name="00117w18.html_para1">I took account, in particular, of evidence presented to me in these representations of the effects on small providers of ancillary services, some of whom could have been facing bankruptcy because they have invested heavily in the contest and who are innocent third parties. I also took account of the effect on business in the Manchester area and the inconvenience and disappointment of the many thousand members of the public who have purchased tickets for the fight in good faith, if entry had been refused and the contest cancelled at this notice.
<P>

<a name="00117w18.html_para2">Further, I was not satisfied that in practice this Immigration Rule has had consistent outcomes in the past; and took that into account in determining whether this case was exceptional. Persons seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom are not routinely asked whether they have relevant previous convictions on the landing card or otherwise (though they would be so asked if from countries requiring a pre-entry visa).
<P>

<a name="00117w18.html_para3">I have, therefore, asked for a full review to be carried out of the Rules and practice relating to admission of persons with previous convictions. I will report the outcome of this review to Parliament when it is completed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will require police-escorted wide loads to travel during the night.  [105019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The timing of abnormal load movements is an operational matter for the chief officers of police of the forces concerned. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has issued guidance to forces which allow night time movement of abnormal loads on motorways and linking dual carriageways. This is subject to individual chief officers of police being satisfied with the road safety of such movements. ACPO policy is to allow and facilitate the movement of abnormal loads on motorways at all times.

Since March 1998, we have contributed &#163;141,960 from the FCO's Human Rights Project Fund to assist the Ombudsman's office and the Ad Hoc Commission with their important work.

 The EU Common Position of 16 September 1999 imposing restrictive measures, including an arms embargo, against Indonesia for a fixed period of four months, expired on 17 January 2000. Following the expiry of the embargo all applications for the export of equipment on the Military List to Indonesia will be considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the national criteria on arms exports and the EU Code of Conduct.

 I am updated regularly on Libya's ambitions and efforts to acquire weapons technology. I am not briefed on the details of individual HMCE operations nor would I expect to be. I was given a full account of this specific operation following the disclosure on 9 January of some details of it to the media.
<P>

<a name="00117w20.html_para1">I took our concerns about Libyan weapons programmes into account when reviewing policy on Libya before my statement in the House on 7 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="00117w20.html_para2">In May 1999 HMCE initiated their inquiry with regard to this consignment. FCO officials were aware of the grounds for suspicion. HMCE sought the assistance of FCO officials on 16 June in pursuing their investigation with the Maltese authorities. MOD officials inspected the consignment on 13 July. FCO officials received confirmation on 29 July that the contents were consistent with Scud parts. Libya has possessed since the 1970s a number of Soviet-supplied Scud B missiles with a range limited to a maximum of 300km. The parts seized at Gatwick could be applicable to the Scud B or other Scud derivatives, but would not have enabled Libya to extend the range of its existing Scud missile arsenal.

 At present, the United Kingdom is not planning to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea.

Our future stance will largely depend on North Korea's willingness to address these long-standing concerns.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if it is his policy that, following the introduction of the State Second Pension, all employees below state pension age who have not contracted out of the state scheme will earn entitlements under the rules for the State Second Pension rather than SERPS; and if this is the assumption which underlies his estimates of the distributional impact of the reform.  [104687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Following the introduction of State Second Pension, all employees below State Pension age, who have paid Class 1 National Insurance Contributions on earnings at or above the Lower Earnings Limit and who have not contracted out of the State scheme, will accrue entitlement to a second pension under the rules for the State Second Pension. Any SERPS entitlement they have already accrued will be preserved. So when a person reaches State Pension age they will receive, in addition to their basic Retirement Pension, a second pension made up of any preserved SERPS plus entitlement under State Second Pension.
<P>

<a name="00117w21.html_para4">State Second Pension will reform SERPS so that those with low earnings will get much more additional pension. All those earning between &#163;3,432 (the annual Lower Earnings Limit) and &#163;9,500 will accrue at least twice as much entitlement under State Second Pension than they would have done under SERPS.

 The National Asset Register published in November 1997 showed the assets held by the Department, its agencies and associated public bodies to be 195 freehold properties, 54 historic leasehold properties, 59,500 personal computers, 24,400 printers and 2,853 vehicles.
<P>

<a name="00117w21.html_para6">The Department's freehold and historic leasehold properties were transferred to the private sector as part of two Private Finance Initiative deals. On 8 January 1998 the Department transferred the six properties in the Newcastle Estate (Newcastle Longbenton, Gosforth Broadway West, Newcastle Ponteland Road, Washington Emerson House, Newcastle Tyneview Park and Washington Durham House) to the Newcastle Estate Partnership. The Department did not receive a cash sum but will be charged rentals at a reduced rate for the period of the contract. On 1 April 1998 the remainder of the Departmental estate was transferred as part of the Private Sector Resource Initiative for Management of the Estate (PRIME). The Department received cash consideration of &#163;250 million. In addition, the sale of vehicles in the period up to the end of January 1999 realised an estimated &#163;2,223,458.
<P>

<a name="00117w21.html_para7">Following the transfer of properties, the Department no longer holds fixed assets of significant value. In the period from the beginning of February 1999 to the end of December 1999, the Department sold a small number of low value items such as personal computers and printers. In addition, sales of vehicles realised an estimated &#163;794,998.
<P>

<a name="00117w21.html_para8">The estimated total cash raised from such sales to date is therefore &#163;253,018,456.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will set out the assumptions about the proportion of benefit recipients opting to receive their benefits by automated credit transfer which underlie his estimate of a saving of &#163;400 million on benefit delivery by 2005.  [104148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The move to automated credit transfer as the normal method of payment from 2003 brings significant savings in DSS administrative costs. This is anticipated to be in the region of &#163;400 million per year once the transition from current paper based methods of payment is complete, and the majority of benefit recipients have moved to ACT. Further savings on fraud are also expected. Estimates of these range from &#163;140 million to &#163;240 million.
<P>

<P>
<a name="00117w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A number of changes have been made in the past year to control procedures for the staff who are enabled to issue adult National Insurance numbers. Firstly, reductions have been made in the number of staff who have access to the allocation process. The introduction of these new procedures has reduced the number of people who are able to allocate new numbers from over 1,500 to less than 525.
<P>

<a name="00117w22.html_para5">We have also created a database of the staff who are able to allocate numbers. This allows checks to be made on exactly how many people have access to this process at any one time, who those people are, why they need access and how many National Insurance numbers any one individual has allocated. This process is controlled via a security procedure agreed between this Department and the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="00117w22.html_para6">Finally we have introduced automatic security checks which enable managers to investigate whether staff have a continuing need to have access to the allocation process. The system will highlight unusual activity and prompt a Management check.

 The Department collects information on the total number of cases referred for prosecution by local authorities and whether they have been successful. In 1997-98, 212 local authorities referred 1,148 cases for prosecution, of which 631 were successfully convicted. This information is not broken down by type. Information about those authorities who did not prosecute any cases, or did not provide information on whether they had, has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para0">Evidence from the Audit Commission provided to the Public Accounts Committee indicated that 382 cases involving housing benefit fraud by council staff and councillors in 57 local authorities in England and Wales had occurred in 1998-99.

<a name="00117w23.html_para1">We are as dissatisfied as the PAC with the level of fraud and error in housing benefit--particularly where council members or officers are found to be involved.

<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para2">Councillors and council officers should always be prosecuted where they are found to be fraudulent and it is in the public interest to do so. There also has to be sufficient evidence to prosecute. The ethical standards Bill will put in place a new framework to deliver high standards of conduct throughout local government.
<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para3">Local authorities have the same powers to prosecute councillors and council officers as those used to prosecute benefit claimants who commit housing benefit fraud. Councillors and officers would normally be prosecuted under the Theft Act 1968 or the Social Security Administration Act 1992.

<a name="00117w23.html_para4">Reforms we have already set in train such as the Verification Framework (an intensive case checking regime), combined with rigorous identity checks and the requirement on claimants to provide National Insurance numbers will help to prevent and root out all types of fraud.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00117w23.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Following publication of a Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report, the Department invites the local authority to consider and respond to the report and to submit any proposals for improving its performance and remedying any failings identified by the report. The report and any proposals made by the local authority in response to it are then considered to determine whether the Secretary of State should give directions to the authority as to any standards the authority is to attain and the time within which they are to be attained.
<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para5">To date, 37 reports on local authorities have been published and responses by local authorities in respect of 33 of them have been, or are currently being, considered by the Department. In those cases where consideration has been completed the local authorities have been requested to provide periodic progress reports to enable us to monitor implementation of their action plans and future performance.

 The United Kingdom Sports Council (UK Sport) was established in January 1997 to focus on high performance sport at the UK level, with the aim of achieving sporting excellence on the world stage. The work of UK Sport, in liaison with the four Home Country Sports Councils, is to build a framework for success. Crucial to this is underpinning the base of participation and ensuring opportunities for youngsters to participate both in and out of school.
<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para10">The United Kingdom Sports Institute (UKSI) will provide our best sports men and women with the facilities and services they need to help them compete successfully at the highest level. The UKSI will be made up of a central services, to be part of UK Sport, and a network of centres throughout the UK, which are being delivered by the Home Country Sports Councils. These will deliver a range of sports science and sports medicine services, including sports physiology, biomechanics, sports nutrition, physiotherapy and podiatry.
<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para11">Work has also been undertaken in full consultation with Performance Directors, coaches and athletes to identify the services they need to support them in their training and competition programmes--such as, the Athlete Career and Education programme (ACE UK) and the High Performance Coaching Programme (CPD), both launched last year--to be delivered directly to our top athletes and coaches.
<P>

<a name="00117w23.html_para12">The development of sporting excellence, including disability sport, is also being provided through the World Class Programme. Over &#163;80 million has already been made available from the Lottery to some 33 sports and over 2,000 athletes for World Class Performance. World Class Start and World Class Potential (to be funded from the Lottery by Sport England) will provide &#163;25 million per annum to find, nurture and develop those with the characteristics and sporting talent to achieve success at the highest sporting level.

 This information is not available. However, production spend on animation in the UK is around &#163;200 million annually, which supports some 350 independent companies. These range in size from one or two-person outfits creating small-scale experimental works, to large set ups producing multi-episode series for major broadcasters such as Channel 4, BBC and Granada.

 My Department does not make forecasts of film production levels. The past decade has seen considerable fluctuation in the numbers of films produced in the UK, from a low of 47 in 1992 to a high of 128 in 1996. The first five years of the decade saw a total of 317 productions with the last five years totalling 479. With the policies we have been implementing over the past three years to build on and sustain this upward trend I fully expect the current levels of film production activity to at least be maintained over the next five years.

For example, the full company has recently toured to Oxford, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent and London. In addition, the company divides into two and has recently toured to smaller towns and cities including Barnstaple, Barrow-in-Furness, Bexhill-on-Sea, Blackpool, Cambridge, Cheltenham, Crawley, Crewe, Poole, Richmond, Scunthorpe, Swindon, Truro, Tunbridge Wells and Woking.

<a name="00117w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 The Arts Council of England aims to increase access to theatres for people living in rural areas by continuing to fund the touring activities of our arts organisations. Significantly, the Arts Council will be announcing later this year details of the National Touring Programme, a new Lottery scheme. This Programme, which has initially been allocated &#163;10 million over two years, will fund new and existing touring by supporting the distribution of work from across a broad range of arts disciplines and scales to audiences throughout England.
<P>

<a name="00117w25.html_para0">In addition, the New Audiences Fund is supporting over 100 projects with an annual budget of &#163;5 million. The projects supported include those which aim to deliver more arts events and activities to more people throughout the country, primarily by extending existing 'tours' to increase their geographical reach and by exploring new methods and means of distribution. A selection of projects will also promote broader access by addressing practical barriers to attendance in rural areas, including transport.

 <i>[holding answer 10 January 2000]:</i> Sport England, together with UK Sport, UK Athletics, the BOA and the Department, is undertaking further work on non-Wembley options for staging international athletics events. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) proposed that Twickenham might be used for such events and constructive discussions are underway between the Department, Sport England, UK Athletics, the BOA, the RFU and the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. A further announcement will be made once this work is completed.

Fraud", which includes figures for detected fraud and irregularities against the EC budget. The latest report, for 1998, was published on the Commission's public internet website on 19 November 1999 and previous reports are available in the House of Commons Library.

<a name="00117w27.html_para2">Classification between fraud and irregularity is difficult because cases where there is a suspicion of fraud will be subject to lengthy investigations and legal proceedings.
