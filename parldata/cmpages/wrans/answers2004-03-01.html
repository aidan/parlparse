To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the management agreement and associated fees between Actis and CDC.  [156399]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The management agreement will be a five-year commercial contract between CDC Group plc and Actis. The contract will set out the amounts that CDC shall commit to each of Actis's regional and sectoral funds, the minimum service levels that Actis shall provide (for example in terms of overseas office coverage), the management fees to be charged and all the detailed provisions necessary to this complex transaction.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para0">Actis's management fees will be determined as a percentage of the capital committed to each of the new funds that it is establishing. The percentages will vary from fund to fund, depending on the management services to be provided and the market norms (where these exist). The total sum of the management fees has been calculated to equate to the anticipated total operating costs of Actis on an approximately break-even basis over the first five years. The CDC Board has taken independent expert advice on the fee levels appropriate in the circumstances.

<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn1"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;valuation and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;organisational arrangements of Actis.  [156401]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Actis will be a limited liability partnership between its management and staff, and the Government. Management and staff will have a 60&nbsp;per cent. controlling interest, providing independence of ownership and investment decision taking. However, under "clawback" arrangements, over the first 10 years 80&nbsp;per cent. of any profits and proceeds from a sale of Actis would accrue to the Government.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para1">The board of CDC Group plc has an obligation to obtain full value for the sale of any part of CDC. The Independent Committee of the CDC board instructed KPMG to value the new company, as well as the interest to be acquired by management and staff.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para2">Taking into account the clawback arrangements and other obligations to Government, KPMG's opinion was that the market value of the 60&nbsp;per cent. interest in Actis to be sold to management and staff was some &#163;338,000 to &#163;408,000. The Independent Committee recommended that management and staff should pay &#163;373,000, the mid-point figure, which I have accepted. The Shareholder 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2004 : Column 638W</I><P>
Executive and our financial advisers have endorsed the valuation process and the NAO has been kept informed about this and other aspects of the CDC reorganisation.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para3">Actis will have a supervisory board, and the Government will retain the right to veto on the choice of chairman and two non-executive directors. Corporate governance arrangements will be in accordance with best practice for a public limited company. The other details of the organisation of Actis will be set down in the Partnership Agreement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn2"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much is being spent on the refurbishment of the office space of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;CDC and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Actis; and how much is being spent on office space used by the chief executive of each.  [157841]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Expenditure over the last four months on the preparation of new offices for CDC and Actis is estimated at &#163;0.5&nbsp;million and &#163;4.9&nbsp;million respectively. CDC, which now has a staff complement of about 20, moved to their new office in February. Actis, who employ some 150 staff in their UK headquarters, will move later this month.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para4">The offices of the chief executives were part of the overall refurbishment work and were not separately costed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn3"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the cost of corporate entertaining by CDC was for the last seven years; and what the budget for corporate entertainment by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;CDC and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Actis is for the next three years.  [157842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The information requested is not immediately available and will be provided shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn4"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the projected new investment in sub-Saharan Africa by CDC and Actis is in the next three years.  [157843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 CDC is required by the Investment Policy to make 50&nbsp;per cent. of its new investments in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Under the management contract, CDC will be committing $250&nbsp;million to Actis's Africa Fund 1 to be drawn-down for investment over the period to 2006. A further $100&nbsp;million will be committed to the fund for 2005. Actis will launch an Africa Fund 2 in 2006 to which it is intended that CDC will commit $320&nbsp;million alongside $160&nbsp;million to be raised from third party investors.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para5">In addition, some of the capital that CDC has committed to the Actis Power Fund and the Small and Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) Funds will also be invested in sub-Saharan Africa.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn5"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;salary and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;bonus and options payments of the 12 highest paid employees of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;CDC and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Actis will be in 2004.  [157844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Decisions on the 2004 salary and bonus levels for both CDC and Actis will be the responsibility of the Remuneration Committees of their respective boards, working within guidelines agreed with the Government.




<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2004 : Column 639W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para6">Bonus payments are dependent on performance, both that of the individual and of the company. It has been agreed that total remuneration for achieving Business Plan targets should move towards the 60th percentile of the nearest equivalent industries.

<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn6"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;length and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;terms of the contracts of the directors of Actis are.  [157845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 These matter have not yet been finalised, but will follow best practice for corporate governance.

<a name="40301w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Extractive Industries</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn7"><B> Tom Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will support the recommendations of the World Bank commissioned Extractive Industries Review.  [156465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government have been actively involved in the Extractive Industries Review (EIR).
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para7">We support the main conclusion of the review that the World Bank Group should remain involved with the extractive sector. We agree that it is important that social and environmental safeguards are rigorously applied, that human rights are respected, and that efforts are made to improve the governance and transparency of revenue flows from the sector.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para8">In light of the World Bank's existing and planned work to deal with these issues, we believe that the EIR's recommendation to end investments in the oil sector by 2008 is premature. We also believe that the primary responsibility to address climate change should rest with developed countries, and that it would not be appropriate to deny the potential economic benefits of extractive industries to developing countries.

<a name="40301w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Swaziland</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn8"><B> Tom Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;bilateral and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;multilateral aid his Department plans to offer Swaziland in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, broken down by (i) programme type and (ii) amount.  [156517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID currently funds only two bilateral programmes in Swaziland, both of which are due to end during 2004&#150;05. We expect to spend around &#163;300,000 on a Rural Water Supply Programme, and around &#163;80,000 on a programme of support to the Co-ordinating Assembly of Non-Government organisations.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para9">In addition, DFID will continue to support Swaziland through a number of regional initiatives. In particular we are supporting work on HIV/AIDS through the International Partnership against AIDS in Africa (implemented by UNAIDS and ActionAid), and through a programme implemented by the Southern African Development Community.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para10">I am afraid it is not possible to provide future projections of DFID's share of multilateral aid to Swaziland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_wqn9"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what facilities are available in Northern Ireland for checking the safety and maintenance records of airlines and aircraft using Northern Ireland's airports; and with what frequency safety inspections have been carried out on airlines and aircraft using airports in Northern Ireland in the last 12 months.  [156943]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for the safety oversight of UK registered aircraft and aircraft operators. The oversight for Northern Ireland is carried out by CAA Airworthiness Surveyors located at the Regional Office in Irvine and CAA Flight Operations Inspectors based at Stirling. UK operators serving Northern Ireland but based on the mainland will receive oversight from the other CAA Regional Offices.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para11">In the last 12 months CAA maintenance surveyors have visited Northern Ireland approximately once a month, each visit lasting several days. Flight Operations Inspectors have visited and conducted inspections on three separate occasions and have also conducted additional inspections on Northern Ireland operations from the mainland.
<P>

<a name="40301w01.html_para12">A number of foreign airlines also operate services to airports in Northern Ireland. These airlines are subject to oversight and inspection from their national aviation authorities and we require them to be operated in accordance with international standards. If we have reason to suspect that a foreign airline is not meeting international standards we will arrange for it to be inspected by the CAA. Such inspections will take place at the most appropriate airport. It was not necessary to carry out any such inspections in Northern Ireland last year.

In addition, on 6&nbsp;February we published a voluntary code of practice on the security of dangerous goods by road. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. The code implements the security provisions of the United Nations model regulations on the transport of dangerous goods by road until secondary legislation is in place in 2005. Similar provisions for the security of dangerous goods by rail are in preparation to supplement existing rail security measures.

 Prior to 2003&#150;4, the Powershift grant programme had been under-subscribed.

<P>
<a name="40301w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No taxis have claimed a Powershift grant since 2000. Obtaining information for earlier years would incur disproportionate cost as it would require a manual trawl of the Energy Saving Trust's paper records. In addition, information on the number of passenger cars that received Powershift grants and were subsequently operated as taxis is not held on the Trust's record.

<P>
<a name="40301w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I have asked officials to work up a pilot scheme to provide a dedicated rest area for lorry drivers away from the motorway network. This is in response to concerns raised by the haulage industry, and others, about the lack of such facilities. These proposals are still at an early stage, although it is envisaged that any such scheme should be a joint initiative involving the Highways Agency, the haulage industry, and the ultimate operator of the facility. Much of the work to date has concentrated on identifying a suitable site and undertaking discussions with relevant local planning authorities, the haulage industry and potential operators.

 A number of factors have to be taken into consideration. The main one being striking a balance between cost to the taxpayer and convenience to the motorist.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency has a national target for the average annual waiting time for a practical car driving test of six weeks. The current national average waiting time for a test is 10 weeks. The current waiting time for a test at the Jupiter Road test centre in Norwich is 18 weeks.
<P>

<a name="40301w03.html_para5">Demand for driving tests rose sharply in 2002&#150;03, with demand for car tests 20&nbsp;per cent. higher than forecast. In response, 235 driving examiners were recruited and a further 85 examiners will be recruited by the end of the financial year. The recruitment of another 140 examiners is planned for next financial year. By November 2003, the national average waiting time for a car test was down to 8.7 weeks. However, waiting times rose in December, mainly as a result of the holiday period. In January, bad weather resulted in some tests being cancelled nationally, with certain parts of the country more badly affected than others. Some 120 tests were cancelled at the Jupiter Road centre. Bad weather has resulted in some 30 tests being cancelled in February. Industrial action by driving examiners on 17&nbsp;February resulted in around 30 tests being cancelled.

 [<i>holding answer 26&nbsp;February 2004</i>]: Employment rights legislation is extensive and contains detailed definitions of those to whom it does and does not apply. To give only two examples, the unfair dismissal legislation generally applies to employees who have completed one year's qualifying service with their employer, but this qualifying period is waived if a dismissal is for one of a number of specified reasons; while the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 and the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 contain provisions (similar to those in other anti-discrimination legislation) which permit differences of treatment on grounds of sexual orientation or religion or belief respectively in certain limited circumstances where a particular sexual orientation or religion or belief is a genuine occupational requirement for the particular post, as allowed by the Employment Directive 2000/78/EC which they transpose. If the hon Member would like to provide more specific information about his concerns, I shall be happy to try to address them.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given today PQ No. 156289. Following a recent review the Department will move towards producing employment rights information mainly in internet format. We will continue to provide hard copy prints of national minimum wage guidance and a booklet summarising individual employment rights (PL716) as required.
<P>

<a name="40301w04.html_para2">We are mindful that not everyone has access to the internet. We have put in place arrangements to print copies on request for people who are either unable to use or do not have access to the internet.
<P>

<a name="40301w04.html_para3">We are working in partnership with Acas to provide advice on employment issues. Acas produce a series of booklets, which will be reprinted according to demand and any necessary textual revisions. These booklets are available in hard copy.

<P>

<a name="40301w04.html_para4">End users generally told us that they did not need the detailed explanations of the law given in DTI's existing publications. Users want practical advice and guidance on what they should actually do in respect of employment issues. Acas, who provide advice and guidance to employers and employees, are usually better placed to provide user focussed advice based on factual information supplied by the Department. Acas recently produced a series of booklets summarising individual rights. These can be obtained free of charge from the Acas distribution centre on 08702 429090. I understand that feedback on the publications has been generally very positive.

 We are continuing to assess the potential economic impact of the introduction of the directive on the UK coal industry, and on the coal-fired electricity generating industry which is its major market, using both internal analyses and independent research.

 It is not possible to say which regular overseas trade exhibitions supported in the 2003&#150;04 financial year will not be supported in 2004&#150;05. The final programme of supported exhibitions is not fully fixed a year in advance, and there is flexibility for events to be added to replace those that are cancelled (e.g. through lack of interest, or other factors such as terrorism, SARS etc.).
<P>

<a name="40301w05.html_para2">It is not possible to say which overseas exhibitions supported in 2003&#150;04 will receive reduced funding in 2004&#150;05. The exact funding level for an exhibition is not fixed in advance. It will normally depend upon the number of businesses wishing to join the UK Trade and Investment supported group, the actual Pound Sterling cost of stand space and construction, and the demands of other events in the same industry sector. Furthermore, the actual cost of many 2003&#150;04 exhibitions is still unknown, as claims can be submitted up to four months after the date of an exhibition.

 When running recruitment campaigns, recruitment costs, including advertising costs are generally devolved to individual management units and there are no central records held of the breakdown of advertising costs. When advertising vacancies, my Department uses the most appropriate advertising media, be it national, regional, local, trade magazine or website, depending on the nature of the vacancy to be filled.

 The Department works with business to produce a biennial survey of information security breaches. The 2004 Information Security Breaches Survey will be launched on 27&nbsp;April at the Infosecurity Europe exhibition. These surveys help to raise awareness of the need for good information security practice and help to inform our own activities. Recent surveys have identified a need for easy to understand security advice for small and medium-sized companies. In response to this need, our most recent initiative was the launch last year of an online source of information on e-security. This resource draws together a range of tools, advice and guidance on core areas of information security and is aimed particularly at smaller businesses. New content is currently being added to this site which can be found at www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk/informationsecurity. This will assist businesses in preventing and recovering from information security breaches.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government believe that there are arguments that it is important for developed and developing countries alike to reduce bureaucracy on cross border trade (trade facilitation), to encourage a climate which facilitates foreign direct investment, to promote economic growth through fair competition and to encourage transparency in the procurement of public goods and services to help reduce corruption and increase good governance. However, we have made clear to our European Community partners that the UK prefers not to insist on including negotiations on investment and competition within the WTO Doha Development Agenda if doing so would jeopardise the DDA as a whole, given the benefits we believe a successful trade round could bring particularly to developing countries.

 The Department recognises the important benefits of agricultural crops acting as carbon 'sinks', and removing a significant greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. The inclusion of sinks in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme via Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism projects (Kyoto Protocol mechanisms) is currently under discussion at EU level where the UK supports their inclusion.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para2">The UK Emissions Trading Scheme includes direct emissions of greenhouse gases from installations and indirect emissions associates with electricity use. There is no provision for carbon sinks projects in the Scheme. The Scheme will be reviewed once final agreement has been reached on the inclusion of credits from Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism in the EU Scheme.

[154900]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The demountable flood defences form an integral part of the Shrewsbury Flood Alleviation Scheme. The February 2004 floods were the first time such barriers had been used in the UK and were a great success, holding back 1.9 metres of water at the peak. Seventy properties in Frankwell are now protected for the first time in their history. The performance of the barriers was assessed and recorded and operational matters are currently being reviewed by the Environment Agency and Bauer&#151;IBS.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para3">The Environment Agency and Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council jointly purchased 1400m of Danish Mobile Dam at a cost of &#163;72,000 two years ago. A 90 metre length was used in Shrewsbury during the recent floods (pro rata cost of circa &#163;5,000) and together with associated pumps helped protect approximately 40 properties and kept the main road into Shrewsbury open.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para4">A comprehensive monitoring and survey programme of all the defences was carried out during the floods. Debrief meetings with professional partners are now scheduled to assess the overall response. However it is clear the defences and associated drainage pumping stations worked very successfully and Frankwell remained dry.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para5">The Environment Agency has undertaken a thorough assessment of the remaining flood risk areas of Shrewsbury. Further permanent defences are difficult to justify but the Environment Agency will continue to keep the possibilities for further protection under review.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para6">The Bellwin scheme is only operated in circumstances that are exceptional by local standards and unforeseeable. ODPM have not received any application from the relevant Councils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra grant aids capital projects and related studies that meet specified economic, technical and environmental criteria and achieve the threshold priority score for the year in which they start. Decisions regarding which flood and coastal defence projects to promote, their timing and appropriate solutions are matters for the operating authorities the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and (in areas with special drainage needs) internal drainage boards.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para8">No central record is kept of estimated savings from flood defences during actual flood events but appraisal of proposed defences includes assessment of estimated costs and benefits to the national economy. The Department estimates that total benefits of approximately &#163;17 billion (in terms of flood damages avoided) were attributable to urban areas (at the time of project approval) for projects approved since 1997 over the lifetime of the defences.
<P>

<a name="40301w06.html_para9">While savings to households will contribute significantly to the overall benefit, centrally held records do not identify them separately from other benefit items nor by constituency or year. I regret, therefore, that I am unable to answer the specific question without incurring disproportionate cost.

 This information has not been collected centrally in the past but I have been working closely with the industry to achieve a national equine database which will then be able to provide such information. This opportunity arises from the implementation of the Horse Passport legislation. Currently the best estimate is provided by the British Equestrian Trade Association's National Equestrian Survey published in 1999, which estimated that there were some 900,000 privately owned horses or ponies in Great Britain.

 With the Department of Trade and Industry, we are continuing to assess the potential economic impact of the introduction of the Directive on the UK coal industry, and on the coal-fired electricity generating industry which is its major market, using both internal analyses and independent research.

 The &#163;37&nbsp;million funding identified in the Rural White Paper was to enable the Regional Development Agencies and the Countryside Agency to support market town regeneration in the regions. The initiative was therefore not established as a national funding programme, but as a means of enabling regional partnerships to target towns in their region according to regionally agreed selection criteria.
<P>

<a name="40301w07.html_para1">When the announcement of the funding was made, it was envisaged that 100 towns would benefit from this funding. I am pleased to report that, through the innovative methods used in each of the regions, currently 227 towns are receiving support.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 DCMS travel and subsistence rules encourage staff to use Standard Class travel wherever possible. To obtain best value for money, management of the policy is delegated to line management who are responsible for authorisation and economical management of all official travel. While first class travel is permitted for some grades many of them travel at standard class unless, for example, they need extra space or comfort to work during travel.
<P>

<a name="40301w09.html_para3">The number of people entitled to travel by first class rail when travelling in the UK to perform their responsibilities is 124 (including Ministers). The number of people entitled to travel by first class rail when travelling overseas to perform their responsibilities is 400 (including Ministers).

 Governing bodies have to become, or work in partnership with, a recognised Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) Awarding Body before their qualifications can be added to the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). The Central Council for Physical Recreation is providing support and guidance to help governing bodies achieve this.

We are encouraging them to work towards enlarging the overall national market, in a manner consistent with the national marketing strategy. The North West Development Agency (NWDA) will receive Government funding of &#163;713,000 per annum over 2003&#150;06 towards implementing their tourism strategy for the region. Part of this strategy includes the creation of five new Destination Management Organisations (DMOs). Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board will be the DMO for the Lancashire sub region and its board will represent the county's tourism interests. It is anticipated that the Ribble Valley will play a significant and supporting role in the establishment of the new tourism support structures. A bid is currently with NWDA for funding for the new DMO.
<P>

<a name="40301w09.html_para5">In addition, the Ribble Valley is featured in VisitBritain's domestic Outdoor England campaign, launched in Autumn 2003, which encourages tourists to walk along the Ribble Way or cycle round the Lancashire Cycleway Northern Loop. A photograph of Ribble Valley is also featured prominently in the brochure. Details can be found on www.visitengland.com/outdoorengland.

<a name="40301w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 With the exception of the Licensing Act 2003, which integrates six archaic licensing regimes into a single efficient system, DCMS does not have direct responsibility for the majority of regulations that affect the tourism industry. In pursuit of the DCMS Public Spending Agreement objective to increase the productivity of the domestic tourism industry, my Department will continue to work hard with other Departments to ensure that the burden of regulation is reasonable, and that regulation is applied sympathetically and consistently.

To ask the Solicitor-General what plans she has for CPS Direct.  [156335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w10.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 A key component of the Government's criminal justice reform is to transfer responsibility for determining the charge in criminal proceedings from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service. This change is embodied in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The early involvement of prosecutors will ensure that the right charge is put before the court and will help police officers to gather more quickly the evidence the prosecutor will need to prove the case.
<P>

<a name="40301w10.html_para0">To fulfil this new role the CPS will make prosecutors available to provide early advice or charging decisions at any time of the day or night. Daytime cover will generally be provided by local prosecutors based in police stations, but this is not feasible or cost-effective throughout the night. The CPS will therefore provide cover during quieter periods by means of a national telephone-based service known as CPS Direct.
<P>

<a name="40301w10.html_para1">In September 2003, the CPS Direct pilot was launched to provide out of hours cover for police stations in Humberside, parts of West Yorkshire and the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. The pilot uses sophisticated telephony and IT links to connect police officers to prosecutors and is currently staffed by 13 experienced prosecutors working from their homes. They provide cover from 5 pm to 9 am each weekday and for 24 hours a day at the weekend and on public holidays. As at 22&nbsp;February 2004, the pilot scheme had provided the police with 6,866 written decisions or advices.
<P>

<a name="40301w10.html_para2">Many CPS areas and police forces already have "shadow" arrangements in place ahead of the new statutory provisions and from 1&nbsp;April 2004, there will be a phased migration to the full statutory scheme. As areas move to the statutory scheme CPS Direct will gradually expand to provide them with out of hours cover. Current forecasts indicate that CPS Direct will eventually require around 80 prosecutors.

<a name="40301w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hague: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of total expenditure on the education of pupils with special needs in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;mainstream schools and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;special schools in the latest year for which figures are available.  [156000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Information about expenditure on the education of pupils with special educational needs is collected from local education authorities on their Section 52 Budget Statements. Where money is delegated to mainstream schools, figures are indicative rather than actual as final decisions are made by the schools. Latest figures available are for 2003&#150;04, as reported by LEAs at 19&nbsp;February 2004.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para1">Total estimated gross expenditure for pupils in mainstream schools is &#163;1,717,253,601. This includes support for pupils with statements and for those with special educational needs (SEN) but without statements. This expenditure will be in addition to their normal place funding.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para2">Total estimated gross expenditure for pupils in special schools is &#163;1,511,349,567. This includes pupils in maintained special schools and fees for pupils in independent and non-maintained special schools.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para3">In addition, an estimated &#163;236,233,036 will be spent in this financial year on centrally funded SEN activities. These include the costs of educational psychology services, assessment and statementing, parent partnership services and the provision of information.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para4">Overall, the estimated gross expenditure on pupils with special educational needs in the year 2003&#150;04 is &#163;3,464,836,204.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) how many schools from <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;rural and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;urban areas applied for specialist school status in the October 2003 application round;  [156881]

<P>
<a name="40301w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Of the 403 schools which applied for specialist school status in the October 2003 application round, 118 (29&nbsp;per cent.) were from rural areas and 285 (71&nbsp;per cent.) were from urban areas. Of the 238 schools then granted specialist school status in that round, 71 (30&nbsp;per cent.) were from rural areas and 167 (70&nbsp;per cent.) were from urban areas. These proportions are in line with the overall national picture: 27&nbsp;per cent. of the 3,126 maintained secondary schools in England are located in rural areas, and 73&nbsp;per cent. are in urban areas.

 The UK non-completion rate has stayed broadly the same at around 17&#150;18&nbsp;per cent. since 1991&#150;92, and in the latest figures published in December 2003 by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) it fell to just over 16&nbsp;per cent. This represents one of the highest completion rates in the OECD and we are determined to maintain this level of performance.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para5">We have asked HEFCE to bear down on non-completion and their national co-ordination team, Action on Access, is working with institutions to improve retention rates and to spread good practice from those institutions with low drop-out rates and good access figures. The &#163;255&nbsp;million which HEFCE has allocated to institutions in 2003&#150;04 for widening access and improving retention recognises some of the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and those who are less well prepared for higher education.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para6">Research indicates that the reasons for non-completion are many and varied, but one factor is incompatibility between the student and their course or institution. It is vital that potential HE students have the right information on which to base sound decisions. We are working with the National Union of Students to develop a new guide to help students narrow down their choices and make decisions about what and where to study. The guide will be linked to the new Aimhigher portal that launched in September 2003. A new National Student Survey is planned to take place in January 2005, seeking the views of final year students on their learning experience. HEFCE will also ensure that there is a wide range of published information about the quality and standards of institutions' programmes.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para7">Another factor which has been associated with non-completion is financial hardship. In addition to statutory student support, discretionary support is also available as a safety net for vulnerable students. For 2003&#150;04, Hardship Loans are available for students who are in such serious financial difficulty that their access to, or continued attendance on a course may be at risk. Grants from the Hardship Fund are also available to help students access and remain in higher education.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para8">From the academic year 2004&#150;05, the Hardship Loans budget will be amalgamated with the Hardship Fund into the new non-repayable, Access to Learning Fund. Students who would previously have been eligible for a Hardship Loan should be able to apply for a grant rather than a loan.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para9">From 2006&#150;07, under proposals laid out in the Higher Education Bill, the poorest students entering higher education will receive up to &#163;2,700 in up-front support, and we are raising the levels of maintenance loan to meet the basic living costs of the mid-range student, in response to the recent Student Income and Expenditure Survey.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para10">Additionally, institutions will, under the terms of access agreements, be required to provide further financial help to poorer students in the form of bursaries.

 <i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The information requested is not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para11">Borrowers enter repayment status in the April following graduation or otherwise leaving their course. There were 1,409,000 borrowers in the United Kingdom with income contingent student loan accounts at the end of the financial year 2002&#150;03 of whom approximately 298,000 had accounts in repayment status. Borrowers can have accounts both in repayment status and not in repayment status if, for example, they have attended a second course of higher education.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para12">No repayments are due from borrowers who are not in repayment status, although just under 15,000 borrowers made early repayments voluntarily in 2002&#150;03. No repayments are deducted from income-contingent borrowers in repayment status whose income falls below &#163;10,000 per annum. Repayments of income-contingent loans are, apart from a few exceptions, collected through the tax system. Most repayments are notified to the Student Loans Company more than one year after the end of the tax year, after which time has to be allowed for reconciliation with their records. Therefore the data on the number of borrowers with income-contingent loans where repayments are not being deducted because the borrower's income is below the repayment threshold, or for some other reason, are not yet available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what projections he has made of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the size of official student loan debt, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the likely annual interest accruing on that debt, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;the likely total repayments of (i) debt and (ii) interest on that debt and <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;the likely subsidy required from his Department to support the official student loan debt in (A) 2007 and (B) 2009; and on what assumptions his calculations are based.  [155538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w11.html_spnew5"><B> Alan Johnson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> Estimates of the cost of subsidising both maintenance and fee loans in 2006&#150;07 were set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) published on 8&nbsp;January alongside the Higher Education Bill. These estimates&#151;rather than projections&#151;are based on the different scenarios set out in the RIA. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the costs vary greatly according to the decisions that both higher education institutions and students take, for example the number of students who decide to defer their fees, and the pattern of fee charging that emerges.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para13">The economic cost of providing student loans is made up of the interest rate subsidy on loans together with the cost of any loans which are never repaid, for example loans written-off after 25 years or on death.
<P>

<a name="40301w11.html_para14">Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House; it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.

 As lead nation for counter-narcotics activity in Afghanistan, the UK supports the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which was adopted by President Karzai in May 2003. The strategy proposes activities in four key areas: improved drugs law enforcement; alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers; capacity building for Afghan drugs institutions; and public awareness campaigns/treatment programmes to help reduce demand. The UK has committed &#163;70&nbsp;million over three years and additional personnel for the British Embassy in Kabul to drive forward implementation of the strategy.

 We remain deeply concerned about the political situation in Burma. Although the Burmese regime's plans for a National Convention are a step in the right direction, the process needs to be inclusive and transparent, involving all political parties and ethnic groups. Convention participants must be allowed full freedom of speech, movement and political activity. As a first step Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) colleagues must be fully released and NLD offices re-opened.

 Iraqi oil and the revenue it generates are both governed by UN Security Council Resolution 1483. This stresses the right of the Iraqi people to control their own natural resources.

The remaining 5&nbsp;per cent. is deposited into the UN Compensation Fund (to meet outstanding claims for reparations against Iraq).

<P>

<a name="40301w13.html_para1">The DFI balance is available on the Coalition Provisional Authority website www.cpa-iraq.org and both the DFI and the practice of selling Iraqi oil are to be audited by independent public accountants under supervision by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board.

 We support the Sri Lankan peace process politically and practically and welcome the progress made since February 2002 when the ceasefire came into effect. The parliamentary election in Sri Lanka on 2&nbsp;April comes at a crucial moment for the peace process. We urge all Sri Lanka's political leaders to ensure that their, and their supporters', actions and rhetoric during the election campaign do nothing to undermine the important gains made in the peace process or to make it more difficult to resume peace process talks after the election. It is also essential that the election is free of intimidation, fair and non-violent throughout Sri Lanka. We urge all political parties and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to commit themselves to supporting the early resumption of peace negotiations after the election so that they can move forward together in building a peaceful and prosperous country. We are working closely with international partners to reinforce these messages.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w14.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are two types of Army training: individual training and collective training. Army individual training is undertaken within the Army Training and Recruiting Agency and is split into a number of phases. Initial training, teaches soldier recruits and officer cadets basic military skills. Phase 2, or specialist training, is special to arm training to prepare soldiers for their first appointment in the Field Army. Career training (Phase 3) is continuation and professional development training to enhance individual soldiers' and officers' career progression and to meet the Army's need for specialists.
<P>

<a name="40301w14.html_para10">The collective training programme is constructed to train the Army for current operations, to prepare it to contribute to Joint Rapid Reaction Force Readiness and Development, and to support Alliance commitments. The ability to deliver trained, ready forces for any contingency remains a key Army priority.

 Extensive negotiations over several months did not result in an agreed pay deal for the 11 Departments of the Northern Ireland Administration this year. Management Side presented an offer worth 3.67&nbsp;per cent. on 5&nbsp;November. As this could not be agreed, and Trade Union Side declined to negotiate within the 3.67&nbsp;per cent. envelope, we took the decision to proceed to pay the award and communicated this to staff and Trade Union Side on 27&nbsp;November. I have made clear to Trade Union Side that the 3.67&nbsp;per cent. deal is the maximum that can be paid. We are however open to exploring other reasonable means of resolving the dispute. The latest meeting of the Central Whitley Council between Trade Union and Management Sides took place on Thursday, 19&nbsp;February, and we have agreed to hold further negotiations as a matter of urgency.

 The only effective option would be to introduce a new &#163;1 coin. However, at present, given the very low incidence of counterfeit &#163;1 coins by international monetary standards, it would not present a good value for money case to replace the existing coin.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w19.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The only effective action HM Treasury and the Royal Mint could take is to replace the &#163;1 coin. Any level of counterfeiting must be a matter of concern but, given the Royal Mint's recent estimate of the incidence of &#163;1 counterfeit coins to be less than 1&nbsp;per cent. and anecdotal evidence from cash handlers suggesting a figure even less than this, this is considered to be well within the level generally tolerated by monetary authorities across the world and does not provide a value for money case for replacing the &#163;1 coin.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w19.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Royal Mint conducts annual surveys to establish the incidence of &#163;1 counterfeit coins. The most recent survey in December 2003 indicated a counterfeit rate of just under 1&nbsp;per cent.&#151;almost identical to the previous year's results. Anecdotal evidence from cash handlers suggests that the real level of counterfeits may be substantially lower.

 In the last pre-Budget report (Cm6042) the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an Alternative Fuels Framework, which sets out the rationale for Government support for alternative fuels, and places environmental benefits at its core. In recognition of the importance to investors of providing

<P><I>1 Mar 2004 : Column 711W</I><P>
long-term certainty in the market, the framework includes an unprecedented commitment to a three-year rolling guarantee on the fuel duty differentials for all alternative fuels.
<P>

<a name="40301w20.html_para1">The UK offers the biggest duty incentive for road fuel gases, including liquefied petroleum gas, in Europe. This incentive cost the Exchequer &#163;75&nbsp;million in duty forgone in 2002&#150;03 alone. The Government also give valuable support to this sector through grants for vehicle conversions (the Powershift scheme), reduced rates of vehicle excise duty for gas powered vehicles, and company car tax reliefs.

<a name="40301w20.html_para2">Fuel duty rates are being considered as part of the Budget process, taking account of all relevant economic, social and environmental factors including the likely impacts on different population groups.

 Treasury Ministers meet a wide range of organisations, companies and individuals, including representatives of the Scottish whisky industry, as part of the process of policy development and analysis. As with previous Administrations, it is not the Government's practice to provide details of all such meetings. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Code.

 The Government are committed to tackling age discrimination in employment, extending opportunities for older workers and to introducing age discrimination legislation in 2006. The Government are assessing the responses to the consultation last year on proposals for the age legislation and will consult from this spring on draft age regulations covering employment and vocational training. The legislation will be in place, but not implemented, by the end of 2004, to give employers and individuals about two years to prepare before the legislation comes into force on 1&nbsp;October 2006. Over the coming year, we will prepare further practical guidance for employers on adopting age positive practices and flexible approaches to retirement.
<P>

<a name="40301w21.html_para4">In the meantime our Age Positive campaign is encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices now. Through Age Positive, we are promoting the business benefits of an age diverse workforce by encouraging employers to adopt the voluntary Code of Practice: 'Age' Diversity at Work, A Practical Guide For Business, which was first developed in 1998 and updated in 2002. Over 750,000 copies of the Age Positive Code have been issued to employers and individuals and it is available on the Age Positive website www.agepositive.gov.uk, which has 75,000 visits per month.
<P>

<a name="40301w21.html_para5">The Age Positive campaign is widely promoted to employers and individuals through advertising, the website and press features in national, local and specialist publications and at exhibitions and workshops for employers. Age Positive awards help to further publicise the achievements of businesses and individuals who conquer age prejudice.

 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published its clinical guidelines on the Prevention of Early Onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease in November 2003. The RCOG clinical guidelines are recommendations for good practice and exist to help patients and their healthcare team make the right decisions about health care. The guidelines are developed by teams of healthcare professionals, patients and scientists who look at the best evidence about care for a particular condition.

 The answer of 10&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1410W, stated that the decision in the case of Malcolm Pointon is a decision on an individual case and as such has no bearing on national estimates of the cost of free personal care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w23.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The national service framework (NSF) for mental health provides rationale and evidence base for a national standard for mental health services relating to carers of people with mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="40301w23.html_para3">In accordance with the NSF for mental health standard six, all individuals who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach should have an assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs repeated on at least an annual basis. People who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach are also entitled to have their own written care plan which is given to them and implemented in discussion with them.




<P>

<P>

<a name="40301w23.html_para4">The importance of support for carers was further emphasised in the "NHS Plan (2000)" and in the "Priorities and Planning Framework 2003&#150;06" issued to local services.

<P>
<a name="40301w23.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 makes it clear that local services must deliver appropriate training to staff. We reinforce this message in our consultation document "Delivering Race Equality: A Framework for Action."
<P>

<a name="40301w23.html_para8">The National Institute of Mental Health in England's national workforce programme is developing a set of shared capabilities that all staff should possess as part of their education and training.

<a name="40301w23.html_para9">The NIMHE will be developing proposals for a national accreditation and regulation scheme for trainers and programmes of education and training.

<P>

<a name="40301w23.html_para11">For those detained under section of the Mental Health Act 1983, trusts should follow the guidance laid out in the Mental Health Act 1983 Code of Practice.

 This information is not available centrally. Administrative cost savings resulting from the introduction of a system of free personal care for the elderly would be marginal, as primary care trusts and local councils would still need to assess the needs of

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the current resources allocations are for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;social care, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;preventive health and education and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;public health; and how they will change as a result of the departmental reorganisation.  [153685]<P>

<P>
<a name="40301w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Before the departmental reorganisation, there were 652 whole-time equivalent (WTE) staff working in the social care field (including children, older people, mental health and prison health services) within the Department. Post re-organisation, there will be 140 WTE staff representing the target number of posts planned for the new care services directorate within the Department. The figure also takes into account work transferring to other Government departments or agencies and an expected reduction of 94 WTE posts.
<P>

<a name="40301w24.html_para2">The departmental reorganisation will see 418 WTE posts associated with social care transfer to the National Health Service, the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE), the Department for Constitutional Affairs (in respect to the Mental Health Tribunal and the Care Standards Tribunal), the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Department for Education and Skills (in respect to services for children).

<a name="40301w24.html_para3">Before the departmental reorganisation, there were 314 WTE staff working in the public health field (including preventative health and education services) within the Department. Post re-organisation, there will be 250 WTE staff, who will work both within the newly created health improvement directorate in the Department and in public health posts planned in each of the nine regional public health areas. The post re-organisation staffing figure already takes into account the planned transfer of nine WTE posts to the Department for Education and Skills (in respect to teenage pregnancy services), and an expected reduction of 64 WTE posts.

No resources are available explicitly to promote best practice in service provision for child victims of trafficking. However, the Home Office has published a best practice toolkit for those who deal with illegal immigrants and the victims of trafficking. The toolkit will help those who come into contact with victims of child trafficking to identify and deal with them appropriately. The Immigration Service is also starting specialist training for around 600 operational members of staff nation-wide, which will have a positive impact on their ability to identify and assist trafficked children.

 Assessing the reliability of evidence in whatever form is a matter for the courts. However, the Government are concerned that the public should have full confidence in the integrity of all evidence, including electronic evidence, and are determined to ensure that appropriate guidance and procedures are in place to support it. In March 2002, the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), published the guidance document, Digital Imaging Procedure. This is now in use across the criminal justice system in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40301w27.html_para0">The document sets out detailed guidance for operational, administrative, and judicial staff on the procedures that should be followed to ensure that digitally captured images can be accepted as evidence throughout the Criminal Justice System. Among other matters, the document includes guidance for audit trails to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the evidence, and how to protect the 'Master' image. The procedure does not rely on 'electronic' protection but neither does it preclude its use: as the guidance points out, there are several methods for 'electronically' authenticating an image file.
<P>

<a name="40301w27.html_para1">However, in the case of digital images captured by unattended roadside traffic enforcement cameras, the use of electronic protection is made mandatory by non-statutory guidance in the form of a document issued by the Police Scientific Development Branch entitled "The Speedmeter Handbook". This is because the image is the only evidence of an offence having taken place. The method of protection used is one that is based on techniques used to secure banking transactions.

 The Government are concerned that the public should have full confidence in the integrity of all evidence adduced in criminal proceedings, including evidence in an electronic form. Unattended roadside traffic enforcement cameras are required to be of a type approved by the Secretary of State, and the digital images they capture are protected electronically. A method based on techniques used to secure banking transactions is used for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="40301w27.html_para3">The 'Digital Imaging Procedure', which sets out best practice guidelines for ensuring the acceptability in court of all other digital images as evidence, does not rely on electronic protection of images but neither does it preclude its use.

Prisoners who have been involved in notorious crimes will not be released on HDC unless the chief executive of National Offender Management Service is satisfied that their release will not undermine public confidence in the scheme.

 Women are generally permitted to wear their own clothes, but if there are any difficulties in obtaining them, clothing will be supplied by the Service from existing stocks or outside suppliers. In certain situations, for example outdoor work, suitable clothing will be automatically provided for the women.

<P>
<a name="40301w28.html_spnew13"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Housing is the major resettlement priority for women leaving prison and considerable investment has been made in housing advice projects through the custody to work programme, Prison Service Plus and other funding streams. Much of the investment has gone into local prisons so that housing needs can be assessed and acted on when women first enter custody as well as prior to their release. In addition, the Home Office is leading cross-Government work on the Women's Offending Reduction Programme to address the complex criminogenic factors that affect women's offending. The Correctional Services are also jointly contributing to the development of a National Accommodation Strategy for all offenders as part of a wider rehabilitation strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to increase the availability of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;therapeutic, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;counselling and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;support provision for prisoners identified as being vulnerable or at risk.  [155246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w28.html_spnew14"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The prison population contains a substantial number of people who have experienced negative life events, all of which are identified as significant risk factors for suicide and self-harm. These include family background and relationship problems, social disadvantage or isolation, previous sexual or physical abuse, and mental health problems. Self-harming and suicidal behaviour often pre-date custody, and may have started early in life. Studies show that 27&nbsp;per cent. of men and 44&nbsp;per cent. of women on remand report having attempted suicide in their lifetime; and that 90&nbsp;per cent. of all prisoners have shown evidence of at least one of the following: personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, and alcohol misuse and drug dependence.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para4">Intervention strategies have been introduced for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to establishments. A video is also being produced.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para5"><i> (a)</i> <i>Therapeutic provision</i>:
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para6">A number of prisons, particularly women's, provide a range of therapeutic interventions for prisoners who self-harm. These include Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), an innovative programme developed in the USA for women diagnosed with 'borderline personality disorder' (BPD) who also self-harm or who are suicidal. The Prison Service has introduced DBT to the women's estate, starting with an initial development programme at three sites: Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para7"><i>(b)</i> <i>Counselling provision:</i>
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para8">A number of prison establishments have introduced counselling for vulnerable prisoners. At both Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons, all prisoners who have been identified as at risk of suicide/self-harm are offered individual crisis counselling. If appropriate, they are also referred to other agencies such as the general counselling service or CRUSE, a charity working with people who are suffering from

bereavement, or the prison's art therapist, Counselling, Assessment, Referral and Throughcare (CARAT) services or Chaplaincy.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para9"><i>(c) Support provision:</i>
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para10">The F2052SH self-harm warning system identifies and reviews the particular needs of prisoners experiencing periods of distress or crisis. The pilot of a replacement system began in January 2004 at five establishments. It aims to build on the successful aspects of the existing system, but build in a greater focus on care with teams of specially trained staff assessing the level of risk that at-risk prisoners present.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para11">Further avenues of support available across the prison estate include help with substance misuse issues, the input of healthcare professionals and/or mental health in-reach teams, helping maintain contact with family and friends, and the encouragement of self-help, for example, through education, IT or sport. There are numerous agencies and support mechanisms available to prisoners identified as at-risk, including Samaritans.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para12">Several prisons have set up support groups for prisoners who self-harm, or are at risk of self-harming. These are usually run by staff such as Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators or Occupational Therapists. These may either be informal 'drop-in' groups, that prisoners can choose to attend for as many or few sessions as they wish, or groups which run for a specific period of time with the same set of participants.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans the Prison Service has to introduce <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;a policy, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;a programme and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;a target for alcohol reduction.  [155249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w28.html_spnew15"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Prison Service is currently preparing an alcohol strategy, which will be finalised in spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para13">A range of anti-alcohol interventions are available. Detoxification for alcohol is available on reception in all local and remand prisons; some prisons run alcohol awareness courses; Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) run services in around 50&nbsp;per cent. of prisons and more intensive courses are run in nine prisons. Some offending behaviour programmes address the underlying criminogenic factors, which occur in alcohol related violent crime. Further expansion of interventions will depend on the availability of additional resources. There are no plans to introduce a target for alcohol reduction.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make an assessment of the extent of inter-prisoner violence.  [155346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w28.html_spnew16"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The extent of violence in prisons is measured each year as a key performance indicator.
<P>

<a name="40301w28.html_para14">In April 2003, a new high level measure of violence was introduced, based on the number of reported serious assaults. This replaced the previous measure, which was based on positive adjudications for assault. All establishments are currently developing a violence reduction strategy and action plan for personal safety.

<P>

<a name="40301w29.html_para2">Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison establishments is an essential part of the Prison Service's decency agenda and a priority for Ministers. A three-year strategy to develop policies and practices to prevent prisoner suicide and manage self-harm started in April 2001. This is currently under review, taking into account learning from the various projects initiated over the last three years, emerging research findings and a wide consultation process. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types of prisons and to all prisoners, regardless of nationality.
<P>

<a name="40301w29.html_para3">All immigration removal centres are required to comply with an Operating Standard on suicide and self-harm prevention, and a range of measures is in place to address the issue. These measures include: suicide awareness and emergency first aid training for staff, active Suicide Prevention Committees operating in all centres, and systems for paying particular attention to detainees on their first night in detention or immediately prior to their removal.
<P>

<a name="40301w29.html_para4">The police have also undertaken a number of initiatives to prevent self-inflicted deaths in their custody. These include: custody officer training in risk assessment and management, improvements in police practice in relation to the mentally ill, an increase in the range of custody healthcare professionals, improvements in procedures to assess and document specific risks presented by those coming into custody, the use of closed circuit television in cells, and the use in some forces of life signs monitoring systems.

All convicted prisoners have a statutory entitlement to send one letter, and unconvicted prisoners, two letters per week, at public expense. In addition to this, prisoners may send a letter at public expense in lieu of a statutory domestic visit. In addition, there are several measures which are advantageous to foreign national prisoners:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to monitor differences in the sentencing of offenders from different ethnic groups in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;England and Wales and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;London.  [155955]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w30.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Section 95 Criminal Justice Act 1991 requires the Home Office to publish statistics annually to help those involved in the administration of justice avoid discrimination against any persons on the grounds of race or sex or any improper grounds. The first edition of what has become a series of publications on Race and the Criminal Justice System was published in 1992 including demographic data and prison statistics.
<P>

<a name="40301w30.html_para3">The Home Office is monitoring sentences handed down by the Crown court in terms of the ethnicity of the person prosecuted. A similar programme of monitoring is being developed for magistrates courts. This data will be broken down into the 42 Local Criminal Justice areas (including London) and will also be available for England and Wales as a whole. It has already been published for a number of areas and will be published for other areas once it is of sufficient quality to be statistically acceptable as showing an accurate picture.
<P>

<a name="40301w30.html_para4">The "Ethnic Minorities in the Criminal Courts: Perceptions of Fairness and Equality of Treatment" study published by the Department of Constitutional Affairs (Hood, Shute and Seemungal 2003) concludes that although perceptions have improved since previous studies, more work is needed to eliminate perceived discrimination. The report reveals that although there is no hard research to prove this one way or another, around two thirds of the complaints about racial bias concerned perceived inequitable sentencing, with Black and Minority Ethnic defendants believing they had received a harsher sentence than would have been handed down to a similarly placed white defendant&#151;CJS professionals e.g. lawyers had a stronger perception still. This is likely to be a contributory factor to low BME confidence in respecting the rights of defendants.
<P>

<a name="40301w30.html_para5">The CJS Race Unit will now work to establish whether there is any quantitative evidence of different sentencing between people in different BME and white populations while controlling for type of offence and other contributing or mitigating factors. If there is such evidence the Unit will consider actions to counter it, if not they will address the perception that there is

<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w30.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Both Her Majesty's Prison Service and the National Probation Service provide treatment programmes to challenge attitudes and beliefs which offenders use to justify their crimes and increase their understanding of the harm caused to victims. In addition new skills are acquired by offenders to enable them to recognise and deal more appropriately with high risk situations and high risk mood states on release. Details of all the programmes are contained in the Home Office publication "The Treatment and Risk Management of Sexual Offenders in Custody and in the Community", copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40301w30.html_para6">This document also contains reconviction data on offenders who have completed the Prison Service programmes. Insufficient time has elapsed to collect similar data on the accredited community-based programmes.

Friend, the Home Secretary attended the "National Respect for Shop Workers Day" organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers' (USDAW) in September.

<a name="40301w30.html_para8">Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) can also be used to protect shopworkers from violence. The orders can prohibit persons entering specified areas such as shopping centres, or prohibit persons engaging in specified anti-social acts eg shoplifting, verbally abusing shopworkers, writing graffiti on a shop, or prohibit persons approaching specified persons. Breach of an ABSO is a criminal offence attracting a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to amend the building regulations in order to require the installation of fire sprinkler systems in new public leisure facilities.  [156813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w32.html_spnew5"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to improve fire safety by all reasonable means and sprinklers are part of a package of measures that can be used in buildings. Other measures include the installation of fire alarm and fire detection systems and the provision of compartmentation that restricts the spread of fire within buildings by means of sub-dividing it into compartments, separated from one another by walls and/or floors of fire resisting construction.
<P>

<a name="40301w32.html_para9">In the case of places of assembly, which would include public leisure facilities, the guidance document that supports the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations, known as Approved Document B, already limits the size of fire compartments to a floor area no larger than 2,000 square metres in multi-storey buildings. These compartments can be increased to 4,000 square metres where sprinklers are provided.
<P>

<a name="40301w32.html_para10">However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently commenced a review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations and we will be considering the role that sprinklers can play in all buildings, including places of assembly, and deciding whether the current thresholds in the guidance should be amended or indeed new ones introduced.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has to set up a separate formula spending settlement for waste; and what discussions he has had on this issue with the Local Government Association.  [156385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to set up a separate formula spending share for waste. In the course of the review of formula grant distribution, which led to the new formulae introduced for 2003&#150;04, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister examined possible options in consultation with local government. Analyses undertaken demonstrated a very poor fit between expenditure levels on waste and any combination of plausible indicators.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what discussions he has had with local authorities in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the North East, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the North West and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;Yorkshire and Humber about how the costs of local government reorganisation will be funded.  [157024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 None, but as previously explained in the answer given on 23&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 32W, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be discussing the cost of reorganisation with local government in due course. A working group has been established to look at costs and the wider practical implications of reorganisation. Its first meeting will take place on 9&nbsp;March. The Local Government Association is part of the group.

 Planning Inspectors act in a quasi-judicial role, under delegated powers, for my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. Once the Inspector issues a decision letter on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, that is his decision. If a party to the matter is dissatisfied, their recourse is through an appeal to the Court.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what budgets have been allocated for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;each New Deal for Communities partnership and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the New Deal for Communities in total for each financial year from 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, broken down by English region.  [156473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40301w34.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The New Deal for Communities Programme has 39 NDC Partnerships and &#163;2 billion has been committed to them over the 10 years of the NDC Programme. The 17 Round 1 Partnerships entered their delivery phase in 2000&#150;01 and the 22 Round 2 Partnerships entered their delivery phase in 2001&#150;02. Figures for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 are tabled as follows. These figures are the budgets allocated to each NDC during the re-profiling exercise, which took place in early 2002.
<P>

<a name="40301w34.html_para0">The NDC budget is ring fenced and has end year flexibility, so the figures for 2004&#150;05 onwards are estimates at this stage, and may be subject to change.
