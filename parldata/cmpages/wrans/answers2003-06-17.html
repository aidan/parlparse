<P>
12. <a name="30617w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on congestion charging in metropolitan areas outside London.  [119414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Apart from Durham County Council, whose scheme order was approved on 24 September 2002, no other local authority in England has submitted either a road user charging or a workplace parking levy scheme order for my confirmation.

<P>
15. <a name="30617w01.html_wqn1"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent assessment he has made of the effect <i>(a)</i> congestion charging and <i>(b)</i> motorway road pricing may have on (i) road safety and (ii) congestion.  [119417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The responsibility for developing urban congestion charging schemes lies with local authorities. We would expect local authorities to evaluate the impact of any proposed schemes on road safety and congestion, among other things.
<P>

<a name="30617w01.html_para0">At the national level we recognise the need for action to tackle congestion, but believe that the UK must have a proper debate before any decisions are taken. We need to look carefully at the implications of any national level road pricing, including the effects on road safety and congestion.

<P>
13. <a name="30617w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Weir: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent discussions he has had with Network Rail on the maintenance of level crossings.  [119415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. I understand that the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate have ongoing discussions at local and national level about safety arrangements; and that Network Rail has recently revised its level crossing management strategy to ensure that the risks associated with usage are reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when he plans to make a full response to the recent Health and Safety Executive report into the Potters Bar rail disaster.  [119416]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The next stage is for the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate to agree with Network Rail and others a strategy, including a timetable, for addressing the recommendations in the report. This will be published.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent discussions his Department has had with bus companies about improvements in the accessibility of bus services for disabled people.  [119418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We maintain a close dialogue with industry to ensure that Regulations which require all buses and coaches on local services to be accessible by 2020 are working effectively. Also, we have regular discussions with operators on meeting targets, including one for 50 per cent. of buses to be accessible by 2010.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The South East and East of England Regional Air Services study (SERAS) analysis has not attempted to identify proposed locations of holding stacks for any of the published consultation options. For all options, the SERAS noise appraisal required nominal aircraft departure and arrival routes to be drawn up.
<P>

<a name="30617w01.html_para2">If the air transport White Paper supports any option, and as part of any detailed design and project definition, additional work would be needed to optimise these routes and the air traffic control arrangements more generally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the effect on the volume of traffic on <i>(a)</i> the M25,<i> (b)</i> the M23 and <i>(c)</i> other roads of (i) a new close parallel runway, (ii) a new wide spaced runway and (iii) two new runways at Gatwick Airport.  [119955]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The South East and East of England Regional Air Services Study (SERAS) included an assessment of the type of road and rail infrastructure that would be needed both to connect the airport options to the strategic network and the type and scale of improvements that might be required on the strategic network.
<P>

<a name="30617w01.html_para3">The results of these appraisals for the Gatwick options are summarised in "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East (second edition)" main consultation document, sections 8.16 to 8.20. Further details are contained in chapter 8.5 of the SERAS Stage Two Appraisal Findings report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will commission an independent review of industry-funded research on air quality issues relating to his consultation on the future development of air transport in the South East.  [119953]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Recent research into the air quality situation at Heathrow Airport is being published by British Airways and BAA plc as part of their responses to the Government's consultation on the future development of air transport in South East England. This new research will be assessed rigorously by the Government as part of the overall analysis of consultation responses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Department has received no recent representations regarding the criteria for assessing the safety of child restraints. However, the Department is active in its support for activities contributing to 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 2003 : Column 106W</I><P>
improved child restraint standards. As representatives of the UK in the UNECE Group of Experts on passive safety, we argued successfully in Europe for the most effective requirements for the universal version of ISOFix including the provision of top tethers. This will offer a significant step in improved child restraints.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the Department collates statistics about injuries to children while in car seats; and if he will make a statement.  [119165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Information regarding injuries to children travelling in child restraints is not collected nationally in the official statistics. However, the clear road safety message from research is that child restraints are a very effective means of protecting children in cars.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what compensation is available to tenants of landowners whose land is compulsorily purchased for a new road scheme; and how this may be claimed.  [119810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Compensation payable to tenants where the landowner's interest has been compulsorily acquired for a new road scheme depends on the nature of the tenancy, that is, whether it is residential or agricultural and its duration. Generally, a tenant is entitled to compensation for the unexpired term of the tenancy and any other loss of injury sustained as a result. The acquiring authority will serve notice on the tenant and invite him/her to submit a claim for compensation.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is currently considering, together with the National Cycling Strategy Board, ways to improve facilities for cyclists at stations and on trains. It will hold a consultation exercise on its proposals in due course. The SRA is expected, in examining proposals for new or replacement passenger rail franchises, to have regard to delivery of the 10-Year Plan for Transport, which sets out the Government's aims to improve integration between modes and to triple the number of cycling trips by 2010.

<a name="30617w02.html_wqn2"><B> Lembit &#214;pik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to ensure that the Driving Standards Agency introduces the new requirements under the Second EC Driving Licence Directive as an add on to the existing UK arrangements for motorcycle tests; and if he will make a statement.  [119925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 European legislation adopted in 2000 requires Member States to conduct practical motorcycling tests that include extra and more demanding specific exercises than are currently contained in the UK test, in particular the inclusion of higher speed manoeuvring and braking exercises. Member States were required to implement these higher testing standards no later than October 2005, though the European Commission have indicated that they will shortly be bringing forward amending legislation that will allow a further three years for implementation.
<P>

<a name="30617w02.html_para0">We consulted in 2001 about the new European driving test standards, which affect theory as well as practical tests, plus tests taken by learners for other types of motor vehicle. The responses suggested that that the new higher speed exercises in the motorcycling test could only be tested safely and to a common standard off the public road.
<P>

<a name="30617w02.html_para1">Making provision for an off-road element in the motorcycling test would have significant estates and expenditure implications for the Driving Standards Agency. Therefore in 2002 we undertook further consultation about possible service delivery options involving both DSA and non-DSA delivery. The consultation period closed in April, and the responses are being analysed. We intend to announce our decisions later this year. These decisions will in due course be given effect in the domestic regulations that set out the driving test requirements.

<P>
<a name="30617w02.html_wqn3"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures his Department is taking to contribute to the Government's implementation of the Kyoto Agreement.  [119371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The transport sector has an important contribution to make towards helping the Government to meet its Kyoto commitments. The 10 Year Plan for Transport, published in July 2000, envisaged a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the transport sector over the current decade, and some significant reductions against projected emissions of greenhouse gases have already been, or are being, 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 2003 : Column 108W</I><P>
achieved. The progress report on the 10 Year Plan, published in December 2002, showed a small reduction in CO2 emissions from road transport in the UK in each of the last two years, following a generally rising trend through the 1990s.
<P>

<a name="30617w02.html_para2">The Government's plans for moving towards a low carbon transport economy are set out in the Powering Future Vehicles Strategy, published in July 2002, and in the transport chapter of the Energy White Paper, published in February 2003. Central to these plans are the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers which are set, by 2008, to reduce average CO2 emissions from new cars by 25 per cent. against 1995 levels.
<P>

<a name="30617w02.html_para3">In developing transport policy, we give due weight to the need to limit emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. The Kyoto agreement treats emissions from international and domestic transport somewhat differently. The forthcoming Air Transport White Paper and in the review of the Transport 10 Year Plan in particular will be taking account of the contribution the sector can make to helping meet the UK's domestic climate change commitments. The Department is also taking a leading role in the discussions required by the Kyoto agreement within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), on how best to limit or reduce emissions from international aviation and shipping respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 9 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column 593W, on the equal treatment and non-discrimination directive, what the results of the Regulatory Impact Analysis was; and if he will make a statement on how the EU Directive on equal treatment and non-discrimination will affect the recruitment of foreign seafarers and the UK Ship Register.  [119652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Draft Race Relations Act 1976 (Seamen Recruited Abroad) Order 2003 forms part of the implementation of the EC Article 13 Race Directive. A Regulatory ImpactAssessment was carried out. A total repeal of Section 9 of the Race Relations Act1976 was estimated to result in additional, annual wage costs to employers of around &#163;40.5 million. Industry estimates, supported by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, indicated that up to 400 ships would leave the UK flag if a total repeal of Section 9 were to proceed. To revise Section 9 of the RRA 1976 was estimated to present the shipping industry with negligible additional costs and to protect the substantial increases in the UK flagged fleet that we have secured in recent years.
<P>

<a name="30617w02.html_para4">The proposals go beyond the requirements of the Directive: the amendment will prohibit discrimination on the basis of colour and national origins as well as on the basis of racial and ethnic origins as required by the Directive. This will provide more protection under the Race Relations Act 1976 to foreign seafarers recruited abroad to serve on UK flagged ships that will enter UK territorial waters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason highway authorities are not obliged to record their roadworks in the same way as utility companies; and what plans he has to ensure that all roadworks are recorded in the same way.  [119557]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 places a range of requirements on utility companies concerning the recording of their works in the street. The Code of Practice for Maintenance Management, published in 2001, governs, among other things, the recording by highway authorities of their works.
<P>

<a name="30617w02.html_para6">We are reviewing what changes might usefully be made to the current legislative regime for highway authority and utility works in order to ensure that they are carried out more efficiently and to reduce the disruption that they cause. We intend bringing forward a Traffic Management Bill, incorporating appropriate changes, once parliamentary time allows.

 The impact of the trade in small arms on development is of great concern both to the UK Government and other international bodies who are trying to combat the effects of this trade. The UK Government recently sponsored a 3-day workshop on integrating small arms controls into development assistance. A key finding was the need for further research and analysis of the development implications of small arms proliferation, including the impact of the trade in small guns. DFID will commission this research shortly, and aims to disseminate results by the end of 2003.

 I met with the Indonesia Minister of Forestry, Dr. Prakosa just over a year ago on 18 April 2002 when the bilateral "Memorandum of Understanding to Combat Illegal Logging and the Associated Trade in Illegal Timber and Wood Products" was signed between Indonesia and UK. Since then we have done a number of things.
<P>

<a name="30617w06.html_para2">First of all we are supporting a process to develop a working definition of legality in Indonesia. This is fundamental and it may sound straightforward. However, in Indonesia many laws govern different aspects of forests and forest industry and reaching agreement on an enforceable definition of legality is difficult. We are helping to bring a range of stakeholders together and broker an agreement that will allow us to move forward. We have started the process of piloting verification schemes that will be needed to confirm compliance with legal requirements. Allied to this we are supporting efforts to restructure forest industry and close down mills that rely on illegally sourced timber.
<P>

<a name="30617w06.html_para3">The UK timber trade is taking this seriously too. Just last week, on the day the Greenpeace report "Partners in Crime: a Greenpeace investigation of the links between the UK and Indonesia's timber barons" was published, UK timber traders met with Indonesian suppliers in London to discuss common supplier assessments and third party auditing.
<P>

<a name="30617w06.html_para4">Other countries are also beginning to play their part. China and Norway have signed MoUs with Indonesia that draw on that signed by Indonesia and UK last year.

<P>

<a name="30617w06.html_para5">However, under EU law, a ban on illegally logged timber, can only be imposed at EU level, not at UK level. We are therefore working actively within the EU.

 The Government are committed to the principle that all those who can benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so. We amended the Disability Discrimination Act in 2001 to make it unlawful for higher education institutions to treat disabled applicants less favourably than others and to require them to make reasonable adjustments so that disabled students are not placed at a substantial disadvantage. It is, however, for the institutions themselves to determine which courses they will provide.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his written ministerial statement of 15 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 13WS, on bankruptcy and student loans, how many and what amount of student loans have so far been written off on account of bankruptcy; and if he will make a statement on action being taken to frustrate write-offs in advance of correcting legislation.

 No loans have been written off since the statement to Parliament on bankruptcy and student loans, made on 15 May 2003. The Student Loans Company (SLC) will now take this forward.
<P>

<a name="30617w09.html_para0">The SLC have identified 633 bankrupt borrowers, with a total of &#163;2.4 million in outstanding loan balances to be written off. Against a customer base of 2.4 million and a total loan book of &#163;10 billion, the proportion of affected borrowers is very small.

 The Government have no plans to commission a study of this nature. They will, however, continue to support through their Aimhigher Programme improvement in the attainment, aspirations and applications of a wider range of young people who hitherto may have failed to participate in Higher Education (HE). Continuing evaluation of the Aimhigher Programme will help determine the effectiveness of our policies on widening participation in HE. We will also support the identification, development and dissemination of good practice in admissions policies and practises across HE.

 We are working closely with the Department of Trade and Industry to take forward recommendations made in the Baroness Greenfield's report "SET Fair." The Government's response, "A Strategy for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology", was published in April 2003. It outlined a coherent strategy to tackle under-representation of women in science, engineering and technology at all levels. Both these documents are available on the website of the Promoting SET for Women Unit of the DTI (www.set4women.gov.uk).
<P>

<a name="30617w09.html_para2">The Government are also working in partnership with the "Welcome Trust" to create a national network of science learning centres. These will provide innovative training for science teachers and technicians, aiming to bring the excitement of science into the classroom, including encouraging more young women to continue studying science post 16.
<P>

<a name="30617w09.html_para3">More generally, we have in place a range of initiatives to encourage greater progression to higher education by those young people who do not traditionally access higher education in large numbers. The Aimhigher programme in particular helps to raise the aspirations of young people. We also provide a range of financial support for students from low income families. For example, we pay the first &#163;1,100 of tuition fees, depending on the income of the student's family. And, in October 2004, we are introducing a new higher education grant of up to &#163;1,000 for those from low income families.

 Following concerns that students in higher education may not be getting the careers advice and guidance they needed, and that quality of provision was variable, we asked Sir Martin Harris, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester to carry out a review. Sir Martin's report was published in January 2001. He found that while there was much good practice, standards generally needed to be brought up to the level of the best. Sir Martin made a number of recommendations to institutions to help them develop their careers services and to make clear to students and employers what they would provide. Since then, Universities UK and the Standing Conference of Principals have published additional guidance, based on Sir Martin's recommendations, that institutions can use in modernising and providing careers services that are increasingly effective.
<P>

<a name="30617w09.html_para4">The Department does not assess higher education careers services for any specific outcome. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) publishes annually a set of performance indicators for higher education. For the last two years it has published data on employment outcomes from each institution, with benchmarks that include social class as a factor. The data are on HEFCE's website at: www.hefce.ac.uk/Learning/perfind/2002/ and show that, nationally for 2000/01, 93 per cent. of full-time first degree students were employed or going on to further study six months after graduation, although those from lower social classes had a slightly lower employment rate than those from affluent classes.

<a name="30617w10.html_para3">No separate assessment has been made of environmental impacts from the storage or reprocessing of spent AGR fuel. AGR fuel is reprocessed at the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) at Sellafield. The Environment Agency, on the basis of the National Radiological Protection Board model, estimates that the operation of THORP, when dealing with any type of spent fuel, contributes a maximum of 11 microsieverts a year to the radiation dose received by the Sellafield critical group (those people potentially most exposed to discharges from Sellafield).
<P>

<a name="30617w10.html_para4">This may be compared to the annual UK dose limit for man-made radioactivity of 1000 microsieverts. The estimated critical group doses for Sellafield as a whole at the Agency's proposed new discharge limits, including THORP, are 92 microsieverts for aerial discharges and 190 microsieverts for liquid discharges. Thus, for Sellafield as a whole, the maximum dose to a member of a critical group would be less than 20 per cent. of what would be acceptable under European limits. The THORP contribution is just over 1 per cent. of that limit.

 <i>[holding answer 16 June 2003]:</i> As documented in the FCO's December 2002 dossier "Saddam Hussein&#151;Crimes and Human Rights Abuses", the human rights record under Saddam Hussein was appalling. The dossier examines Iraq's record on torture, the treatment of women, prison conditions, arbitrary and summary killings, the persecution of the Kurds and Shia, the harassment of opposition figures outside Iraq and the occupation of Kuwait. It is based on the testimony of Iraqi exiles, evidence gathered by human rights organisations and intelligence material.
<P>

<a name="30617w11.html_para2">Since the fall of the regime, information and testimonies are emerging that reveal a scale of torture and killing perpetrated by the regime which was arguably even greater than feared.
<P>

<a name="30617w11.html_para3">One example is that the UK team of forensic experts currently working in Iraq estimate that there may be at least 50 mass graves in Iraq and that more than 300,000 people may have been murdered.

<P>
<UL>(2) whether he has sought assurances from the Government of Dubai that Mr. George Atkinson will be deported to the United Kingdom when he is released;  [117479]
<P>
(3) pursuant to his answer of 10 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 370W, whether he expects Mr. George Atkinson will be released from custody in Dubai on 1 September 2003.  [117964]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UAE courts sentenced George Atkinson to six years imprisonment for financial crimes and payment of fines and compensation totalling approximately &#163;1,560,000. George Atkinson is currently serving an additional six-month sentence for non-payment of fines. The Dubai Ruler's Court has informed George Atkinson's lawyers that he can expect to be released at the end of this period on 1 September 2003. The original judgement also indicated that Mr. Atkinson will be deported from the UAE on completion of the sentence.

Mr. Brown continues to argue that the travel ban is illegal, but despite several requests that he provide a legal opinion to support his position, he has not yet been able to do so.

 Mr. Brown has been involved in a commercial dispute in Oman since mid-2000.

Our ambassador also suggested that Mr. Brown consider meeting the costs of the Omani judgement against him in order to facilitate his departure from Oman. Mr. Brown replied that he has chosen not to comply with these requests.

Two letters seeking support for this vessel have also been received from members of the public. The Government welcomes the efforts of those involved in the preservation of the country's maritime heritage. However, we do not provide direct financial support for the acquisition, movement or conservation of historic ships, other than through the provision of grant-in-aid to those museums, funded by the Department, which hold vessels of historic significance in their collections.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made no assessment of the conservation of literary landmarks. However, English Heritage offers grants for the repair and conservation of historic buildings, monuments, areas and historic parks and gardens. The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) distributes money raised by the National Lottery to support all aspects of heritage in the UK, from historic buildings and museums to archives, nature conservation and oral history. The HLF provides both capital grants (for buildings and equipment) and time-limited activity grants. Further information is available from both organisations.

<a name="30617w12.html_spnew5"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, information about the types of grant available for conservation of this historic environment is available at the English Heritage (EH) and Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) websites. The HLF are also developing a searchable database of Heritage Lottery Fund grants on their site.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is not responsible for identifying landmarks for conservation. Planning Policy Guidance Note 16 issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister makes clear that detailed development plans (i.e. local and unitary development plans) should include policies for the protection, enhancement and preservation of sites of archaeological interest and of their settings.

<a name="30617w12.html_para4">VisitBritain is responsible for promoting Britain overseas and England domestically. On St. George's Day a new campaign called 'Enjoy England' was launched, to promote England as a tourist destination to the domestic market. A US advertising campaign was launched in June targeting key American 'gateway' cities; this campaign is a unique partnership between the public and private sectors. VisitBritain is also currently planning a European 'British Cities' campaign to be launched in autumn 2003, marketing British cities, including some 'Capital of Culture' candidates.

 The Government are determined to tackle the increasing problem of air weapon misuse. We are increasing from 14 years to 17 the age at which a person can own an air weapon and introducing further controls on their use without adult supervision. In addition, we are introducing a new offence of having an air weapon in a public place without lawful cause or reasonable excuse. These measures will mean that any unsupervised young person seen with an air weapon can be arrested before any further offence can be committed. In addition, any adult who has one in public may be asked to explain himself and, if he does not have a good reason for having the weapon, arrested.

No other Home Office Minister has been to Sweden or the Netherlands to look at drugs treatment there during the last five years.

 Plans are in place to ensure that this Department will be fully compliant with the new Regulation 4 of the Control of Asbestos at Work (CAW) regulations 2002 by the required date of 21 May 2004. A programme to carry out the required surveying and risk assessment work is due to begin this summer. The cost of compliance has not been estimated. Asbestos registers have been held for some time for individual buildings and condition inspections of known asbestos are carried out at least annually. There are regular checks are to ensure compliance with relevant legislation.

 The outreach location used by the Middlesbrough Action Team for Jobs in the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency is in the Hemlington Initiative Centre, Cass House Road. Action Team Advisers attend the Centre twice a week and, on average, see 10 clients on each visit.
<P>

<a name="30617w14.html_para3">In 2001, Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland was chosen as an Action Teams for Jobs area because the local authority was ranked as one of the 30 with the lowest labour market participation in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="30617w14.html_para4">The selection of wards within the area to be covered by the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency was based on the proportion of the working age population not in employment. The wards targeted had a working age employment rate of 58.5 per cent. or below at the time of selection.
<P>

<a name="30617w14.html_para5">The office for National Statistics does not produce employment rates down to individual wards from the Labour Force Survey. For this specific purpose a one off exercise was carried out to calculate data at ward level in Action Team areas. At ward level there is a larger margin of error and so a combination of data, including benefit recipient data, was used to rank wards in Action Team Local Authority Districts.

<P>
<a name="30617w15.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Pension Service has begun to write to pensioner households to explain Pension Credit and to invite advance applications. Around 1.8 million people who currently receive the Minimum Income Guarantee have been told that they will be transferred automatically to Pension Credit, ready for payments to be made from October 2003. By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted. This systematic approach will be supported by regional and national advertising. The marketing campaign for Pension Credit is in its early stages and the level of expenditure may change according to need. However, it is currently estimated that media costs, including direct mailing, television and press advertising, will be in the region of &#163;12&#150;17 million, excluding VAT, to October 2004.

<a name="30617w16.html_para0">Three new Action On programmes began in spring 2003, covering services in general surgery, plastic surgery, and urology. 18 pilot sites in plastic surgery and 15 pilot sites in urology were announced in early May 2003, details of which are also available on the Action On website. Projects in general surgery will be announced in July 2003.
<P>

<a name="30617w16.html_para1">Existing pilot sites received revenue funding of typically &#163;75,000 per annum over 18 months. In addition to this, a total of more than &#163;75 million capital funding has also been allocated to selected sites in dermatology, ENT and orthopaedics over 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 to increase capacity and support developments in service modernisation.

<a name="30617w16.html_para2">Pilot sites for the three new Action On programmes will also receive revenue funding to support the costs of running the project over 18 months.

These posts will support local modernisation initiatives in the Action On specialties, including the three new programmes in plastic surgery, general surgery and urology.
<P>

<a name="30617w16.html_para4">All capital schemes are required to deliver additional service capacity and waiting time improvements. Cataracts schemes have contributed to the 17 per cent. increase in surgery rates achieved during the first two years of the programme. Action On ENT, dermatology and orthopaedics are still in the process of completion and implementation. However, good practice guidance issued by all four programmes give examples of productivity gains and service improvements at each of the pilot sites. These guides are available on the Action On website.

 National planning policies encourage the reuse of suitable brownfield sites. Through Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3), the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has introduced new measures, including an urban brownfield first policy, to meet the country's housing needs in the most sustainable way. Planning policies for land recycling are backed by a package of fiscal measures worth &#163;1 billion over five years designed to bring empty property back into use and encourage the recycling of land.

<a name="30617w17.html_para4">In addition we have made English Partnerships our expert advisor on brownfield land and charged them with considering where and when public sector intervention could be required to bring brownfield sites back into sustainable use. This work will form part of a National Brownfield Strategy which English Partnerships are preparing. Regional Development Agencies are also taking an active role in developing brownfield sites and will be producing Brownfield Land Action Plans in co-operation with other local agencies.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the compatibility of PPG6 with the conclusions of the 1998 McKinsey report "Driving Productivity and Growth in the UK Economy" relating to the impact on UK productivity of planning considerations.  [119303]<P>

<P>
<a name="30617w17.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The 1998 McKinsey report was not commissioned by the Government. It assessed the productivity of six sectors of the United Kingdom economy in comparison with the United States and France, one of which was food retailing. For food retailing it showed that the United Kingdom lagged behind the other two countries, but that the primary difference was on labour productivity. The United Kingdom food retail sector scored very highly on productivity in its use of land and capital, and, overall, United Kingdom major food retailers were judged to

<P>

<a name="30617w17.html_para5">Land-use planning and other regulations were considered to account for only a small part of the difference in productivity. Nevertheless, the report suggested that planning policy made it difficult for food retailers to develop large-format stores, which might enable them to better compete and displace less productive retailers. They acknowledged, however, that this took no account of differences between countries or of other public policy objectives.

 Inspections of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) are normally carried out by local authority environmental health officers under powers conferred upon the authority by Part XI of the Housing Act 1985. An authority has a right to survey or examine an HMO internally to check to see if it is being used as an HMO and to ensure that it is reasonably suitable for the number of occupants, whether any works are required, that it is not overcrowded, that the management regulations are being complied with, that conditions attached to registration are being adhered to and that any works the authority has required have been carried out to the authority's satisfaction. A person who obstructs an authorised officer (e.g. by refusing entry) is guilty of an offence and subject to a fine not exceeding &#163;2,500. A local authority may apply to a Justice of the Peace for a warrant of entry if admission to the property

 Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 (revised). The installation of any telecommunications mast in designated area such as National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, conservation areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and of a mast of more than 15 metres in height elsewhere, is subject to a full planning application. The local planning authority (or the Secretary of State on appeal) in the light of development plan policies and any

other material considerations, including any relevant representations either for or against the proposal, will decide any such application.
<P>

<a name="30617w18.html_para2">The Department of Trade and Industry under the Telecommunications Act 1984 license telecommunications operators. Outside the designated areas mentioned above, licensed telecommunications code system operators are authorised under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) to install specified telecommunications apparatus without the need to make a planning application to the local authority. Certain types of development however, such as the installation of ground-based masts of up to 15 metres in height, are subject to a prior approval procedure. Prior approval procedures allow the local planning authority the opportunity to say whether it wishes to approve details of the siting and appearance of the installation. If the authority considers that the development will pose a serious threat to amenity, it is able to refuse approval.

<P>
<a name="30617w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Analysis carried out both by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and by the Department suggests that emission reductions of about 80 per cent. may be required by 2100 to allow stabilisation at 550ppm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment the Government have made of the environmental impacts if carbon dioxide concentrations are stabilised at 550ppm; and what the maximum safe limit is of concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  [117829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has funded research to examine the potential effects of controlling greenhouse gas emissions at a level that would lead to carbon dioxide concentrations being stabilised at 550ppm, compared with taking no action to reduce emissions. There is a high degree of uncertainty, but the research estimates that controlling emissions in this way would, for example, reduce the additional number of people at risk of water stress from three to one billion by the 2080s (compared to the 1961&#150;90 average). Similarly, the additional number at risk from flooding due to sea level rise would be reduced from 90 million to 20 million.
<P>

<a name="30617w19.html_para0">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Third Assessment Report indicates that the impacts of climate change, and the ability to adapt to them, are somewhat uncertain and will vary between regions. The question of what is the maximum safe limit of carbon dioxide is therefore a complex one, and there is as yet no international consensus on the level at which greenhouse gas concentrations should be stabilised. However, in 1996 the EU recognised that, to avoid the serious risks posed by climate change, global average temperatures should not exceed 2oC above the pre-industrial level and that therefore concentration levels lower than 550ppm carbon dioxide should guide global mitigation efforts.

<i>[holding answer 16 June 2003]</i>: The Environment Agency has a formal role in relation to land determined as contaminated land and designated as a special site, under the provisions of Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. In such cases, it may agree a remediation statement which sets out work which has been, is being, or will be carried out on particular land by the person responsible. This provides an alternative to the service of a remediation notice. Part 2A is designed to support Government policy on urban regeneration, both by encouraging voluntary action to deal with contamination, and by providing a framework for taking the necessary decisions about remediation. The Agency has no formal role outside this regime in approving proposals for dealing with land affected by contamination, other than when consulted in relation to planning applications on such land. It provides advice on a non-statutory basis in other cases, as resources allow. English Partnerships is currently developing a Brownfield Strategy for the Government, which is likely to address obstacles to brownfield regeneration, including contamination and regulatory issues, and the Environment Agency is actively assisting in its preparation.

<a name="30617w20.html_wqn5"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made by her Department of the cost and potential savings at different initial levels of energy efficiency of property of the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme; what assessment has been made by her Department of the cost effectiveness of the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in reducing fuel poverty amongst owner-occupiers and private sector tenants; what <i>(a)</i> assessment she has made, <i>(b)</i> discussions she has had or plans to have and <i>(c)</i> representations she has received in relation to the research conducted by the Institute of Fiscal Studies on the cost-effectiveness of the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme; and what assessment (i) has been made and (ii) is planned of the effects of the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme on reducing fuel poverty (A) to date and (B) under the fuel poverty strategy.  [109067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 April 2003]:</i> The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) is now marketed as The Warm Front Team, and is the Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England. The Scheme was launched in June 2000. Warm Front provides insulation and heating measures depending upon the needs of the householder and the property type.
<P>

<a name="30617w20.html_para4">You ask what assessments we have made of the Warm Front and its impact on reducing fuel poverty. Warm Front has now been in existence for over two and a half years and we are currently carrying out a review to look what it has delivered, the issues faced, solutions found, examples of best practice and future priorities. This review has included discussions with key stakeholders to assess progress and to help the debate on progress to achieving our overall goal of an end to fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="30617w20.html_para5">Our Warm Front review is looking at the scope and targeting of the scheme, the measures offered&#151;including their cost effectiveness&#151;and practical issues surrounding delivery. The review is also looking at issues around SAP improvements to properties under the scheme. Overall, we are looking both to identify the impact on properties once measures have been installed and potential savings for householders.
<P>

<a name="30617w20.html_para6">We are also funding a piece of research to look specifically at the adverse health impact that can be impacted by fuel poverty, and the effect of assistance under Warm Front. The study was launched during 2002 with investigations being run over two winters. The findings of both these pieces of work will be published once completed.
<P>

<a name="30617w20.html_para7">The Department is aware of the report undertaken by the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IPS), although we have received no representations on it. The report highlights a number of interesting issues surrounding the targeting and impact of Warm Front and is a helpful contribution to the debate.
<P>

<a name="30617w20.html_para8">Government's first annual report on progress since the launch of the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy was published on 4 March. This provides an update on the number of households in fuel poverty, taking account of initial findings from the English House Condition Survey 2001. It also provides an update on programmes undertaken to help alleviate fuel poverty.

[116298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The licensing of the commercial cultivation of GM crops in, and import of GM crops into, the EU is subject to EU Directive 2001/18/EC, which establishes the framework by which collective EU decisions are made on whether or not to authorise individual GMOs for use on the single market. The import of GM foods and GM food ingredients is subject to EU Regulation 258/97. The UK and all other EU member states are fully signed up to this EU legislation, and our policy is to act in accordance with its requirements.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para0">Our policy with respect to the applications to market GMOs currently under consideration is set out in the statement issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 24 March 2003. A copy is in the Library and on the Defra website.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para1">Patenting of genetic resources is the responsibility of the Patent Office but I understand that patents are available in Europe for inventions relating to genetic resources, according to the provisions of EC Directive 98/44 which has been enacted into UK law. Such inventions have to meet the usual patentability requirements including novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. Plant varieties are specifically

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what efforts have been made to publicise the national debate on genetically modified organisms and GM foods; and on what television and radio programmes Ministers in her Department have appeared since 1 May 2003 to provide advanced information on the national GM debate.

<P>

 GM Nation?&#151;the public debate on GM issues&#151;is being run by an independent Steering Board. The announcement of the debate and appointment of the Board were well publicised in the media last July. All meetings of the Steering Board are held in public and the minutes of the meetings and other key documents are available on the debate website, which has kept the debate in the public eye throughout the year. The Steering Board is responsible for publicising the debate at arm's length from Government.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para2">The Steering Board announced their detailed plans for the debate through a press release issued on 13 May 2003. This was pro-actively sent to over 150 national, regional and specialist correspondents and received wide coverage. Professor Malcolm Grant, chair of the Steering Board, sent a letter to all local authorities and hundreds of other organisations at the same time, inviting them to get involved and host their own regional or local meetings. Professor Grant launched the debate on 3 June 2003 at a well-attended press conference, which attracted extensive media coverage. In addition, members of the Steering Board have given interviews to national and local media to help publicise the GM debate.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para3">Since 1 May 2003, Ministers have given interviews on aspects of the GM public debate to BBC Radio 4 Farming Today, the Today Programme, Radio 5 Live, BBC Breakfast Television News, BBC News 24 and Channel 4 News.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what property of the genetic modification of seed enables genetically-modified crops to give a higher yield than conventional crops; and if she will make a statement.  [115908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The yield of crops is dependent on a number of factors, but it is especially sensitive to the environment in which the crop is grown. In particular, the presence of pests and diseases (for example, weeds, damaging insects or fungal disease), or unfavourable conditions such as drought, limit the yield of most crops.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para5">The current generation of genetically modified (GM) crops are largely intended to increase yield by reducing the impact of pests. Herbicide-tolerant crops allow more effective weed control, whereas insect-resistant crops help reduce the impact of damaging insects. The extent to which these approaches improve yield depends on how important the pest concerned is in adversely affecting yield. For example, in Europe and North America damaging insects are generally controlled through the use of chemical insecticides, so insect-resistant crops do not show a large yield increase. There is, however, the potential for the reduction in chemical insecticide use, which may reduce costs and bring environmental and health benefits. In contrast, recent work has shown that insect-resistant crops may have a much greater impact on yield in developing world agricultural systems where there is lower use of chemical insecticide and there are significant losses to insect pests.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para6">In the future it may be possible to increase the efficiency with which plants capture energy from sunlight, either through GM or by conventional plant breeding. This would be expected to improve yield independently of control of pests or other environmental impacts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what liability provisions are in place to protect those who might suffer harm as a consequence of future GM releases.  [118574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under European and UK law, all releases of genetically modified organisms require prior authorisation. This is only given once the relevant authorities are satisfied that the application complies with the terms of the legislation and that all appropriate measures are being taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment. There are specific provisions in Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act giving powers to the courts and the Secretary of State to remedy harm where the commission of an offence has caused harm. Otherwise currently there are no specific liability provisions in relation to GM releases. Depending on the circumstances, a claim for redress, however, could be made through the courts under existing general legal principles.
<P>

<a name="30617w21.html_para7">The independent Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission is preparing a report to Government on GM crop liability. Among other things, this is likely to include an examination of how existing general legal principles might operate here. We will consider this issue further in the light of that report.

<a name="30617w22.html_para12">The aim of the new programme is, however, to provide highly targeted and thus effective funding to improve performance on sustainable waste management.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many grants have been given to support organic farming in the UK in each of the last three years, broken down by <i>(a)</i> county and <i>(b)</i> the purpose for which the grant was given.  [116931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30617w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The table sets out by county in the years concerned the number of agreements with farmers in England in respect of aid under the Organic Farming Scheme to support conversion to organic farming. Aid paid elsewhere in the UK to support organic farming is the responsibility of the devolved Administrations and the Northern Ireland Department.
<P>

<a name="30617w23.html_para0">On 5 June 2003, I launched a modified Organic Farming Scheme which offers support to existing organic farmers, in order to encourage the continued management of organic land in an environmentally beneficial way, as well as supporting conversion to organic farming.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she will take to ensure that the UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges meets the commitments signed up to at the OSPAR Commission in July 1998.  [116118]<P>

 The Government are satisfied that the OSPAR Commission is on target to achieve the reductions in radioactive discharges agreed in 1998. The UK Strategy describes the UK's contribution to achieving that target.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is her policy under the terms of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, that developed countries' production allowance for chlorofluorocarbons for export to meet the basic domestic needs of developing countries should be further reduced below the percentages allowed in the Beijing Adjustment to the Protocol; and whether the UK will raise this issue as one to be advanced by the EC in this year's meeting of the parties to the Protocol.

<a name="30617w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Further to the answer given on 1 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 646W, I can report to the hon. Member that there have been further discussions on this issue between member states and the Commission. The UK is not persuaded that there is at present sufficient justification to propose amending the current reduction schedule under the Montreal Protocol. However we are keeping this situation under review in consultation with stakeholders.

<P>
<a name="30617w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department is working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Improvement and Development Agency to raise awareness of sustainable procurement, including timber. My right hon. Friend (Mr. Meacher) wrote to local authority chief executives on 19 September, as explained in his previous answers of 27 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 564W, and 24 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 98W. He followed that letter up with a further one of 7 April 2003 to those that did not reply. A number of further replies have been received that indicate a generally positive picture in terms of their strategies for procuring timber.

 Ministers and officials in the Department hold numerous meetings with many and varied interests. However, as tyres are the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry, there have been no meetings with the retread tyre industry for some considerable time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department plans to take against those local authorities who fail to meet their recycling targets and continue to export waste out of their area of responsibility for landfill; and if she will make a statement.

 The Secretary of State has powers under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999 to act where authorities are failing to deliver best value. The way in which these powers would be used in support of statutory performance standards for recycling and composting of household waste is set out in Annex A of Guidance on Municipal Waste 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 2003 : Column 201W</I><P>
Management Strategies (DETR March 2001); http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/index.htm The use of these powers will be considered where appropriate in support of the recycling targets. The Government have made clear that they will work with local authorities to ensure that failures are minimised, and that the principles that underpin the Waste Strategy, including the waste hierarchy and the proximity principle, are reflected in municipal waste management strategies.

<P>
<a name="30617w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The initial decision on the location of waste facilities is a planning matter. Planning permission, which is a prerequisite for a waste management licence or a waste facility PPC permit from the Agency, can be refused if the local authority consider the site being proposed is in an inappropriate location.
<P>

<a name="30617w25.html_para2">In dealing with its own licences/permits, the Agency adopts a site specific risk based approach on the Source&#151;Pathway&#151;Receptor principle and applies permit conditions accordingly, including monitoring requirements with indicative trigger levels which initiate specified actions by the site operator.
<P>

<a name="30617w25.html_para3">Many existing waste sites have licences granted by predecessor authorities, based on a variety of approaches to the proximity of houses. The location of all occupied property is taken into account through the Operator and Pollution Risk Appraisal (OPRA) scheme, which determines the frequency of Agency inspections to individual waste sites. The higher the risk the site poses and the closer occupied premises are located, the higher the OPRA score and, therefore, the more frequent the inspections.
