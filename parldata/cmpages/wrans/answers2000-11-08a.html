<P>
<a name="01108w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Since May 1997 I have attended 12 cinematic and 25 theatrical performances in an official capacity. In addition I have also attended performances at various festivals over this period and have attended both the cinema and theatre on numerous other occasions in a personal capacity.

[137008]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 I have received two representations asking me to consider listing the Westminster Theatre and none about the Mermaid. The Westminster Theatre has been assessed for listing and found not to meet the strict criteria; a certificate of immunity against listing, valid for five years, was issued in June 1997. The Mermaid Theatre will be considered should I receive such a request.

<a name="01108w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 My Department has no regionally based offices so has had no need of such contracts.

<P>
<a name="01108w01.html_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Government's Sports Strategy "A Sporting Future for All" is based on creating opportunities to participate in sport. Wide participation, which requires easy access to various types of sports and fitness facilities and to sports clubs, will help to improve levels of fitness and lead to long-term improvements. The strategy implementation subgroup charged with this task, whose members include representatives from local authority sport and the private health and fitness sector, is on course to report back to Ministers at the end of the year.

[136166]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The measure of the average cost to a local authority of administering a Housing Benefit case is based on a comparison of the amount the authority reports it spends on benefit administration and the reported size of its case load. The figures have been calculated using this comparison and have been placed in the Library.

 In April we published our Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all" setting out our vision and strategy for the provision of housing in the future. It is the most comprehensive review of housing policy for 23 years and is all about raising standards, improving performance, extending choice and increasing accessibility and accountability. I am aware that some of the responses to the Housing Green Paper support the introduction of a mortgage benefit scheme.

a proportion of gross domestic product in 1996-97; what he estimates it will be in 2001-02; and what amount this would be if basic state pension had been linked to earnings, excluding the cost of free television licences for the over-75s, Winter Fuel Payments and the Minimum Income Guarantee, but including Income Support.  [137903]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In 1996-97, Social Security benefit expenditure on elderly people accounted for 5.32 per cent. of GDP. The forecasts underlying the most recently published expenditure plans <sup>1</sup>  show that in 2001-02 the corresponding figure will be 5.33 per cent. of GDP. The corresponding figure for 2001-02 would have been 5.23 per cent. if basic state pension had been linked to earnings, excluding the cost of free TV licences for the over-75s, Winter Fuel Payments and the Minimum Income Guarantee, but including Income Support.

 Oversight of the railway industry is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="01108w01.html_para1">I have met representatives of rail companies on several occasions to discuss a range of issues. I also maintain close contact with the National Assembly for Wales, which has a key role to play in encouraging the development of integrated transport networks. I know that Sue Essex, the Assembly's Secretary for Planning, Environment and Transport, has had numerous meetings with the train operating companies and has issued guidance to those bidding for the Wales and Borders franchise, setting out the Assembly's aspirations for rail services in Wales.

 As we have acknowledged in the publication 'Kosovo--Lessons from the Crisis', the RAF already has a well-practised low-level all-weather attack capability. Given the strong possibility that future operations could, as in Kosovo, be conducted at medium altitude, we have considered how best to be prepared for such an eventuality. Precision guided munitions, including the RAF's Laser Guided Bombs (Paveway II and Paveway III), achieved good results in the Kosovo crisis. The RAF had built up their precision attack capability as a consequence of lessons from the Gulf War and this paid dividends, with the laser-guided systems performing well and in accordance with expectations. Nevertheless, the limitations of our current laser-guided systems in poor weather were highlighted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 30 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 276W, what percentage of Army commitment and what interval between deployments his Department assesses to be optimal in order for overstretch to be alleviated; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="01108w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> We concluded during the Strategic Defence Review process that for the Army, six-month operational tours and an average interval between tours of 24 months are optimum for operational effectiveness and retention. We do not identify an optimum percentage figure for commitment levels, which are a reflection of operational deployments. Whether such deployments are sustainable depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the task and duration of the commitment, which are not reflected in overall percentage figures on commitment levels.

<P>
<a name="01108w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Royal Navy nuclear submarines are subject to a rolling programme of planned inspection and maintenance. The periodicity of this work is designed to ensure the safety of the nuclear reactor and the submarine as a whole. For example, certain reactor protection systems are inspected every 24 hours, while some hull and support system components are examined every few months. In addition, there are major overhaul periods, which can take some two years to complete, when further inspections are made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Since her arrival in Gibraltar on 19 May, HMS Tireless has undergone routine radiation monitoring and has had no effect on the immediate environment. During her repair, no radioactive contamination of any kind will be released into the environment either within HMS Tireless or externally in Gibraltar. All nuclear waste arising from her repair will have extremely low levels of radioactivity and will be returned to the UK in specially constructed tanks.
<P>

<a name="01108w02.html_para7">At present there is no evidence to suggest that the defect found in some, but not all, hunter-killer submarines, has resulted from a design flaw. It is feasible that the defect could have arisen from the manufacturing process when the submarines were built or have some other origin. The analysis of the evidence collected so far is, as yet, inconclusive.

 The Government have a strong commitment to concessionary travel for elderly people. In the Transport Bill, we are introducing a statutory minimum for local authority concessionary travel schemes, which will provide pensioners and disabled people with half-fare travel or better on local buses with a free pass. In total about 6.5 million people will benefit from the new minimum standard. Under the terms of the Pensions Act 1995, the age of entitlement for concessionary travel for both men and women will be equalised at 65 by 2020.

<a name="01108w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the compatibility of operating asphalt production plants with the proposed European Union directive on assessment and management of environmental noise, COM (2000) 468 Final, of 26 July.  [136295]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The proposed directive does not contain provisions for controlling noise at source. The proposals are for harmonisation of noise indicators and assessment methods for noise from transport sources and from industry in urban areas. They would require use of the common indicators and assessment measures to gather information about exposure of individuals to these sources in the form of noise maps. Information would be made available to the public, and would form the basis for action plans at the local level.

<P>
(3) if he will list the applications refused for the operation of asphalt plants for each of the past 10 years.  [136531]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I understand that the asphalt production referred to is roadstone coating. These plants are a prescribed process under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and as a result must be authorised by the relevant local authority. Authorisations must include conditions aimed at ensuring the use of Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) to prevent and minimise air emissions. Statutory guidance is issued by the Secretary of State on what constitutes BATNEEC for various sectors, including roadstone coating plant. This guidance has been recently revised and published for consultation. A copy of this can be found on the Internet at http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ epns/laucons.html
<P>

<a name="01108w05.html_para8">My Department does not collect the specific data requested for each of the 17,000 processes regulated by authorities in England and Wales. However, data taken from our annual Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC) statistical survey for 1998-99 allow us to prepare good estimates of the number of roadstone coating and mineral drying processes in England and Wales and which authority authorises them. This information is given in the table. The precise numbers cannot be produced without disproportionate cost. But under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 authorities have a duty to maintain a public register containing all particulars of any application for an authorisation made to an authority and the authorisation itself, and it would therefore be feasible to examine authority registers individually.
<P>

<a name="01108w05.html_para9">The Environment Agency is reviewing the LAPC guidance, referred to above, on roadstone coating and mineral drying processes for the Department has 



<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 2000 : Column: 235W</I><P>
examined air pollution impacts. In addition the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, which is produced under a departmental contract, estimates that in 1998 emissions from roadstone coating plant contributed 0.4 per cent. of UK particulate matter under 10 microns (PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> ) and 0.3 per cent. of UK dioxin emissions. Copies of the latest National Air Emissions Inventory are available at http://www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual/ and will be available in the Library of the House shortly. These plant are included in the national PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  mapping project which in turn forms the basis of the national scale assessment of health effects of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> .
<P>

<a name="01108w05.html_para10">Some operators of roadstone coating plant use waste oil to fuel the process. The proposed EU Waste Incineration directive will apply to the burning of waste oil in such plant, and a copy of the Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment relating to the proposal was submitted to the House under cover of Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum EM 12791/98.
<P>

<a name="01108w05.html_para11">The Health and Safety Executive has also made no assessment, though research into the health hazards at such plant, has been carried out in recent years. However, during their routine inspections of quarries where asphalt is produced, Health and Safety Executive inspectors would check that the employer has taken appropriate precautions in line with the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999. This would include checking the employer's risk assessment, which should detail how potentially hazardous substances are controlled in the asphalt production process, e. g. through extraction ventilation of dust/vapour/fumes, cleanliness of plant, protection clothing of plant operators etc.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The statutory purposes of Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) relate to: economic development and regeneration, business efficiency, investment and competitiveness, employment, skills and training and sustainable development. They apply as much in relation to the rural parts of their areas as to the non-rural parts. In addition there is at least one member of every RDA Board with experience in rural issues. The statutory guidance on the preparation of RDAs' strategies states that RDAs should take account of the particular features of the region's rural areas including the role of land-based industries such as agriculture.

 <i>[holding answer 7 November 2000]:</i> There are no specific sanctions. However, a waste local plan is required to set out credible land use policies to deliver the waste management strategy determined by the local waste disposal authority. The Secretary of State will scrutinise waste local plans and can make objections to any of the policies of a plan, which will be considered by an Inspector at a public inquiry. He may also object to any of the policies as proposed to be modified after such an inquiry. Should the Secretary of State and the relevant authority fail to agree on the policies he may direct that changes be made. The Secretary of State would not normally issue directions about particular sites or technical options, but would address plans which did not contain satisfactory policies to manage or dispose of the waste likely to arise in the authority's area. In exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State could call in part or all of a plan for his own determination.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on Mr. Justice Colman's report following the re-opened formal investigation into the loss of the MV Derbyshire.  [137362]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 On 17 December 1998 I ordered that the Formal Investigation into the loss of the MV Derbyshire be re-opened in the High Court. Today the Honourable Mr. Justice Colman has published his report following a reading of his executive summary at the Royal Courts of Justice, London. The Court sat for a total of 54 days from the 5 April 2000 and concluded its oral hearings on the 26 July. I am grateful to Mr. Justice Colman for presiding over the hearings in the way he did and for producing such a comprehensive and conclusive report.
<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para2">My gratitude also extends to all those who contributed to the underwater survey of the wreck, the subsequent analysis of the survey material, the related research and the Court hearings. I particularly applaud the fortitude of the relatives and friends of those who died with the vessel. The demands of the investigation will have been difficult for many.
<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para3">Copies of Mr. Justice Colman's report have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para4">Mr. Justice Colman finds that the ship sank through progressive collapse of the main hatch covers following significant flooding of some bow spaces through broken ventilators and air pipes located on the foredeck as a result of prolonged exposure to the sea states generated by Typhoon Orchid. He concludes that the officers and crew of the vessel were in no way to blame for the vessel's loss and specifically rejects any suggestion that the bosun's stores hatch on the foredeck was left unsecured by the crew.




<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 2000 : Column: 240W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para5">The report concludes that the exposure to risk of bulk carriers of the size of the Derbyshire whose hatch covers do no more than comply with the International Load Line Convention of 1966 poses an unacceptable risk to the safety of those vessels and their crews. Further, Mr. Justice Colman wishes to consider the results of a series of model tests relating to hatch cover strength initiated during the closing states of his investigation's oral hearings and may issue an Addendum to his report, if necessary.
<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para6">While Mr. Justice Colman is critical of the construction of the vessel at frame 65 he concludes that this did not contribute to the actual loss of the vessel and presented a very low additional safety risk to those on board.
<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para7">Mr. Justice Colman makes a total of 24 recommendations to enhance bulk carrier safety and safety generally. These are addressed, to the Department, Lloyds Register of Shipping, the International Association of Classification Societies and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). In consultation with the others to whom recommendations are addressed the Department will prepare a response to each of the recommendations. This response will be presented to Parliament. In this respect the Department will give urgent consideration, in particular, to the recommendations that the IMO should revise the relevant provisions of the International Load Line Convention 1966 and that any enhanced requirements concerning hatch cover strength should also apply to existing ships.
<P>

<a name="01108w06.html_para8">I hope that Mr. Justice Colman's report will finally provide the answers to the many questions surrounding the sinking of the MV Derbyshire in September 1980. I have every reason to believe that the work that has been done will enhance future bulk carrier safety. Though nothing can compensate them for their loss, I trust that this will provide some comfort to the relatives and friends of the 44 people who so tragically lost their lives with the ship.

 Our 10-year plan, Transport 2010, and White Paper "A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone", both recognise the contribution that motorcycles can make to integrated transport in certain circumstances. There are complex matters to consider, including road safety, traffic management and environmental issues. We therefore set up an Advisory Group on Motorcycling, chaired by my noble Friend the Under-Secretary, to look at such issues. This will assist us in further defining the role of motorcycles within integrated transport.
<P>

<a name="01108w07.html_para0">We intend to issue guidance to local authorities on how road user charging and workplace parking levy schemes might best be implemented and operated. This guidance will include advice on the treatment of motorcycles in charging and levy schemes.
<P>

<a name="01108w07.html_para1">We need properly monitored pilot studies on motorcycle use of bus lanes before we can reach conclusions about this practice. We are seeking to encourage proposals from local authorities interested in conducting such pilots. A thorough examination of the traffic, safety and environmental implications for motorcyclists and other road users is required. We have contacted a number of authorities that have expressed an interest and will work with any who are keen to proceed to monitor and evaluate the effects.

<a name="01108w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 For students eligible for student support the total tuition fees payable over the duration of their course will depend on the type and length of course as well as their and their families' financial circumstances. For those normally resident in England and Wales only a minority of full-time undergraduates are expected to pay the full fee, which in 2000-01 is set at &#163;1,050 per year, and in future around a half are expected to pay no fees at all. Taking this into account, we estimate that the average total fee payable by an English or Welsh full-time student on a three year degree course (excluding any repeated years) will be around &#163;1,360 in 2000-01 prices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the effect on the number of compensation claims for perceived educational or other deficiencies in schools by present or former pupils, of the incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights into UK law.

<a name="01108w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Although European Convention Rights were incorporated into UK law in October this year, the Government have observed them for 50 years. We believe that our domestic laws are in harmony with the Convention and we have undertaken a thorough review of our policies and procedures over the past few months. We think these steps reduce the risk of a successful challenge. As with any new legislation, we will keep the situation under review as the law develops.

 Should a local education authority fail to give notice in writing to the parent of the name of the person to whom he may apply for information and advice about the child's special educational needs when serving a copy of the statement on the parent of the child, the parent should ask the LEA to do so immediately. If this does not succeed, it is open to the parent to ask the Secretary of State to investigate in order to try and resolve the issue.

 Each secure training centre (STC) is subject to comprehensive inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate (SSI), who may be accompanied by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and by one or more of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools (OFSTED), at least once every three years. There are also annual inspections to check that the secure training centre is meeting core requirements. Other inspections, with or without notice, can take place at any time of the year; and each centre is subject to a pre-opening inspection. Annual and triennial inspection reports are placed in the House of Commons Library as they become available.
<P>

<a name="01108w08.html_para1">The Inspectors' reports show that, after significant initial operational difficulties at the first STC, Medway, both it and the newer centres at Rainsbrook and Hassockfield have progressively developed to provide a good standard, comprehensive regime for difficult young juveniles.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Article 26 of the Schengen Agreement signed in 1985 was given effect through the Schengen Implementing Convention signed in 1990. Those provisions of the Schengen Implementing Convention dealing with certain aspects of the creation of the Single Market (Articles 120-125) were not given a legal basis in the European Union Treaties as they had been superseded by European Communities legislation. They are therefore not the basis of future Schengen development, and they were not included in the Council Decision on the United Kingdom's participation.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many procedure 1 projects under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, as a proportion of the total, were in the substantial severity category for each of the last 10 years.  [136600]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 sets out the criteria for determining severity levels. Two different types of severity levels are set on project licences; a severity limit for each protocol authorised in the licence and an overall severity banding for the project.
<P>

<a name="01108w10.html_para2">The severity limit for each protocol is determined by the upper limit of the expected adverse effects that may be encountered by a protected animal, taking into account the measures specified in the licence for avoiding and controlling these effects. It represents the worst potential outcome for any animal subjected to the protocol, even if it may only be, and often is, experienced by a small number of the animals to be used. Indeed, it may never be encountered.
<P>

<a name="01108w10.html_para3">Protocols of substantial severity may result in a major departure from the animal's usual state of health or well-being. These include: acute toxicity procedures where significant morbidity is an endpoint; some efficacy tests of anti-microbial agents and vaccines; major surgery; and some models of disease, where welfare may be seriously compromised. If it is expected that even one animal would suffer substantial effects, the procedure would merit a substantial severity limit. The Secretary of State will not license any procedure likely to cause severe pain or distress that cannot be alleviated. Licence holders are required by conditions in both project and personal licences to minimise any pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm and to approach the set severity limit only when absolutely necessary.
<P>

<a name="01108w10.html_para4">The assessment of the overall severity of a project reflects the cumulative effect of each procedure. This assessment is used to weigh the likely adverse effects on

 A stable and improving economy in Northern Ireland is contributing greatly to the peace process in Northern Ireland, helping to build confidence and demonstrating that Northern Ireland is moving into a brighter and more prosperous future. The peace process has in return benefited the Northern Ireland economy. The Belfast agreement gave a tremendous boost to economic activity in Northern Ireland and the transfer of responsibility for economic matters to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 2 December gave back to locally elected representatives the power to take vital economic decisions for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> Farmers are entitled to payments under the Arable Area Payments Scheme in respect of cereals grown and claimed under the rules of that Scheme. In 2000, farmers in England will receive &#163;217.27/ha on 98.36% of their payable area of eligible cereal crops (other than maize). In addition, and subject to the agreement of the European Commission, they are expected to receive &#163;7.37/ha in agrimonetary compensation on the same area. In 1999 they received &#163;208.06/ha on 99.06 per cent. of their payable area. In addition they received a payment of &#163;33.66/ha in agrimonetary compensation and are now receiving a further instalment of &#163;11.22/ha on the same area. Producers of maize in England received the same payments but on a lower area (33.15 per cent. of the payable area in 1999 and 35 per cent. of the payable area in 2000). Farmers in other parts of the UK receive lower payments in line with historic yields but, other than in Scotland, do not suffer area penalties.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what his annual budget for poultry science research and development was in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999; and in each of those years what proportion of this budget was spent on research aimed at increasing broiler chicken (i) growth rate and (ii) feed efficiency.  [136155]
<P>

<P>
<a name="01108w12.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The annual budget for poultry science research and development was &#163;1.0 million in 1998 and &#163;940,000 in 1999. In addition, a further &#163;1.66 million and &#163;1.44 million were spent in 1998 and 1999 respectively on animal welfare projects relevant to poultry nutrition and welfare. There were no projects during 1998-99 aimed at increasing standard broiler chicken growth rate. The work we are funding on increasing broiler chicken feed efficiency in 1998-99 was &#163;325,000 and &#163;338,000 in 1999-2000. This research is driven by a need--with the reduction in pollutants in mind--to move away from the use of animal proteins in chicken feed and to utilise home grown sources of proteins.

 It is not possible to calculate accurately the percentage of agricultural products made in the UK which are exported, as many exports will be in the form of processed food and feed products. Using a broad assumption to value just the raw commodity element of these processed products, it is estimated that approximately 20 per cent. of UK agricultural production in 1999 was exported.

 The timing of the various stages in the European Commission's case against the French Government is determined by the European Court of Justice. The case is now entering the final phase of the written procedure and once that is concluded the Court will fix a Hearing date. It is possible, but not certain, that the Hearing could take place by Spring 2001. However, if the French Government, the Commission and the Court all agreed that a Hearing was not necessary, the oral procedure could be dispensed with altogether leaving the Court to begin its deliberations in advance of the Advocate General's Opinion and the Court's Judgment.

It will consider the rainfall/hydrology which caused the flooding, the existing flood defences and the options available to help improve the situation. The report will also link in with the planned Sussex Ouse River strategy, which will consider the management of the Ouse defences in the longer term.

 The Government wish to see the fishing industry develop a positive safety culture. Former schemes providing grants simply for equipment have not been successful in cutting accident rates. One of the keys to improving safety is good training and that will be our priority. We therefore propose to make up to &#163;0.5 million available in each of the next three financial years to deliver safety training for fishermen in England. These

<P>

<a name="01108w13.html_para2">My Department is in discussion with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Fisheries Departments of the devolved Administrations to develop a suitable new package of training measures. These will include courses to update safety awareness among fishermen hitherto exempt from the requirement for safety training; to provide training in accident prevention and risk assessment; and safety training for newcomers to the industry. We will consult the fishing industry on our proposals.

<P>
<a name="01108w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 I have no such plans. The prices of branded medicines are controlled indirectly by the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) which limits the profits which companies can make from the sale of these products to the National Health Service. Companies have freedom of pricing within this ceiling on overall profits. A new scheme was introduced in October 1999 under which the prices of medicines covered by the PPRS were reduced by 4.5 per cent. overall giving savings to the NHS of around &#163;200 million per year. Copies of the agreement, containing full details, are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01108w14.html_para0">At the same time, hospitals can aggregate their purchasing power for these products and the NHS Purchasing and Supplies Authority then competitively tenders this business on their behalf. In some cases hospitals themselves negotiate direct with the pharmaceutical industry.

 In April 1999 we made everyone aged 60 and over eligible for a free, National Health Service sight test. Children, people on low incomes and people suffering from or predisposed to eye disease are also eligible. Our estimates of the costs per annum of extending eligibility further are &#163;75 million for all adults and &#163;15 million for people aged 55 and over.

 The cost of restoring free prescriptions to all adults would be &#163;380 million a year. The cost of restoring free prescriptions to all adults aged 55 and over is estimated to be &#163;70 million a year. Those who are over the age of 60 are already exempt. These figures relate solely to the loss of patient charge revenue and make no allowance for any increase in the number of prescription items that might result from this change.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> In line with the National Health Service Plan, we aim to introduce a single assessment process for health and social care for older people by April 2002, with protocols to be agreed locally between health and social services. Initially this will be introduced for those older people who are most vulnerable, for example those living alone, or recently discharged from hospital or entering residential or nursing care. Work on developing the assessment process is being taken forward as part of the development of the National Service Framework for older people.
<P>

<a name="01108w14.html_para3">With regard to nursing care, the NHS will make an assessment of the nursing care requirements of nursing home residents. The Department is working in close consultation with a number of organisations on a standardised approach for this part of the assessment process, which will be ready for implementation in October 2001. There are a range of nursing assessment tools currently available, though each is likely to require some development to deliver the outputs needed.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The Department maintains a list under the Protection of Children Act of persons considered to be unsuitable to work with children. The Department for Education and Employment maintains a separate list of persons barred from working in educational establishments. The Protection of Children Act 1999 requires all regulated child care organisations (including all children's homes) to check against these lists everyone they intend to employ in work that brings them into contact with children. Criminal record checks are also available and where the person being employed will have regular unsupervised contact with children the information supplied will include relevant non-conviction information.

<a name="01108w15.html_para1">A thorough investigation is made into any organisation or private individual applying to set up a registered voluntary or private children's home. This includes making reference checks with both employment and personal referees. Applicants are asked to supply details of their employment history. Applicants must satisfy the registration authority that they have relevant experience and qualifications. If it appears that further investigation is needed the registration authority can ask the police to check if the applicant has a criminal record. These arrangements will be extended in 2001 to small private unregistered children's homes which will be required to register with local authorities for the first time.
<P>

<a name="01108w15.html_para2">In the future, with the introduction of the National Care Standards Commission, there will be a nationwide, comprehensive set of national minimum standards for all children's homes.

<BR>
As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question asking for an estimate of the numbers of excess winter deaths which occurred in 1999-2000, providing a breakdown for each English region, Scotland, Wales and the GB figure by age band, and for corresponding estimates for each of the last five years.
<BR>
Figures are provided in the attached table for English Government Office Regions and for Wales. Figures are also provided for Great Britain but were only readily obtainable for all ages. Figures for Scotland are now the responsibility of the Scottish Executive.
<BR>
The figures for winter 1999-2000 are provisional and will only be finalised in October 2001 when data for all deaths occurring in 2000 becomes complete.
<BR>
Excess winter deaths are defined by National Statistics as the difference between the number of deaths during the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of deaths during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer (April to July).

As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the number of long-term young unemployed in Hendon in May 1997 and now. (136952)

<BR>
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the main source of labour market data on individuals used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS preferred measure of unemployment is derived from the LFS and is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, estimates for the number of ILO long-term young unemployed in the constituency of Hendon cannot be used as they are below the threshold for reliable data.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly number of people who are claiming unemployment-related benefits, also known as the Claimant count.
<BR>
In May 1997 there were 160 18-24 year olds on the claimant count (computerised claims only). This fell to 9 by May 2000 and to 14 in September 2000. Constituency level claimant count figures are not seasonally adjusted so comparisons are best made year to year. Computerised claims do not include clerical claims which currently makes up around 1 per cent of the total claimant count.

<a name="01108w16.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I have completed the annual review under section 141 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. In line with the reforms to national insurance contributions announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his March 1999 Budget and reaffirmed in his pre-Budget reports of 9 November 



<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 2000 : Column: 275W</I><P>
1999 and 8 November 2000, I propose the following changes to take effect from 6 April 2001. These rates and limits will also apply to Northern Ireland national insurance contributions.
<P>

<a name="01108w16.html_para11">

<BR>
<i>Employers and Employees</i>
<BR>
In line with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the lower earnings limit for primary class 1 contributions is to be raised to &#163;72 a week. It is set at the level of the basic retirement pension for a single person from April 2001 and rounded down to the nearest pound.
<BR>
The primary threshold for primary class 1 contributions will be aligned with the secondary threshold for secondary class 1 contributions and the weekly amount of the income tax personal allowance at &#163;87 a week. This means that no tax or class 1 contributions will actually be paid on earnings below this level.
<BR>
The upper earnings limit for primary class 1 contributions will be raised to &#163;575 a week to ensure a fair base of earnings liable to such contributions.
<BR>
The rate of secondary class 1 contributions payable by all employers is to be reduced by 0.3 per cent., from 12.2 per cent. to 11.9 per cent.
<BR>
<i>The self-employed</i>
<BR>
The rate of class 2 contributions is to remain at &#163;2 a week.
<BR>
Self-employed people with earnings below the annual small earnings exception can apply to be exempted from paying class 2 contributions. This limit will be raised by &#163;130 to &#163;3,955.
<BR>
The annual lower and upper profits limits for liability to class 4 contributions will be raised respectively by &#163;150 to &#163;4,535 (in line with the income tax personal allowance) and by &#163;2,080 to &#163;29,900, to maintain the link with employees' earnings liable to class 1 contributions and ensure a fair base for contributions by the self-employed.




<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 2000 : Column: 276W</I><P>

<BR>
<i>Class 3</i>
<BR>
The rate of class 3 voluntary contributions will be increased by 20 pence to &#163;6.75 a week.
<BR>
<i>Share Fishermen</i>
<BR>
The special rate of class 2 contributions for share fishermen, which allows them to build entitlement to contributory jobseekers allowance in addition to the other contributory benefits available to the self-employed, will remain at &#163;2.65 a week.
<BR>
<i>Volunteer Development Workers</i>
<BR>
The special rate of class 2 contributions for volunteer development workers, which entitles them to the full range of contributory benefits, will be increased by 25 pence to &#163;3.60 in line with the statutory formula of 5 per cent. of the primary class 1 lower earnings limit.
<BR>
<i>Treasury Grant</i>
<BR>
Although benefit expenditure from the National Insurance Fund will broadly match income, I need to ensure that the fund can maintain a prudent working balance throughout the coming year. In accordance with section 2(2) of the Social Security Act 1993, I propose to do so by prescribing that the maximum Treasury grant which may be made available to the fund in 2001-02 shall not exceed 2 per cent. of the estimated benefit expenditure for that year. Similar provision will be made in respect of the Northern Ireland National Insurance Fund.

<P>

<a name="01108w16.html_para12">I shall be laying a draft re-rating order before Parliament in due course. This will accompany a report by the Government Actuary to myself and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, which we shall jointly present to Parliament.

 The Council Secretariat does not hold figures on the number of times proposals for legislation are vetoed, and the figures sought could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The use of the veto on legislative proposals is comparatively rare.

<P>
<a name="01108w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Council of the European Union adopted a decision establishing an interim Political and Security Committee (PSC) on 14 February 2000. It met for the first time on 3 March 2000. The interim PSC meets on average twice weekly and can address the full range of Common Foreign and Security Policy issues. As a standing body it

<P>
<a name="01108w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Government believe that the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) should continue to be based on inter-governmental cooperation. The role of High Representative provides a valuable focus for the increasingly important role played CFSP. The Government would not support proposals to incorporate this role into the Commission.

 Our understanding is that Morocco remains committed to the UN Settlement Plan for Western Sahara, and to a referendum. The UN Secretary-General has said that the implementation of the plan has been held up for ten years because of differences between the two parties on its voter identification and appeals protocols.
<P>

<a name="01108w18.html_para0">The Secretary-General's Personal Envoy, James Baker, was drafted in earlier this year to explore all options for an agreed and durable solution, including a political solution which could then be put to a referendum. Morocco's recently stated willingness in principle to consider a political means of breaking the impasse is a positive development. We will continue to give our full support to Mr. Baker's efforts to resolve this dispute.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01108w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Government are continually seeking to strengthen further their monitoring of the end-use of defence exports to prevent diversion to third parties. The Government have already taken a number of steps to strengthen risk assessment at the licensing stage and to improve the sharing of information on end-users of concern with like-minded countries. For example, the UK regularly seeks additional details of proposed end-use and end-users, including through our overseas posts, in order better to assess particular export licence applications.
<P>

<a name="01108w18.html_para1">It would be neither practical nor useful to monitor the end-use of all strategic goods exported from the UK over their lifetime with the end-user, particularly when we have already taken steps to satisfy ourselves of the end-user's reliability and integrity before issuing a licence. Post-export monitoring cannot in itself prevent equipment from being diverted or misused, although it may help to inform future licensing decisions. Such monitoring is extremely resource-intensive and generally requires a degree of technical expertise on the part of those involved.
<P>

<a name="01108w18.html_para2">Nevertheless, the UK is prepared to undertake monitoring of equipment in the recipient country in certain circumstances where the Government believe that such monitoring would genuinely add value to its efforts to minimise the risk of diversion. Several examples of such post-export monitoring are contained in the Government's 1999 Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, copies of which are in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="01108w18.html_para3">At present the Government have powers to control only trafficking and brokering of defence equipment under the United Nations Act 1946 where this is necessary to implement a binding United Nations decision. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 28 September that the Government have decided to introduce a system of licensing for arms trafficking and brokering. This will go significantly further than the proposals on trafficking and brokering in the 1998 White Paper on Strategic Export Controls. Full details of the Government's proposals on trafficking and brokering will

<P><I>8 Nov 2000 : Column: 283W</I><P>

 Over the summer, the participants in the British-Irish Council have been taking forward in a number of the areas identified as priorities at the first BIC summit meeting last December. The second BIC summit was due to take place in Dublin on Wednesday 18 October, hosted by the Irish Government. Regrettably, the summit had to be postponed following the death of the right hon. Donald Dewar MP MSP, First Minister of the Scottish Executive. Action is in hand to identify a new date for the summit.

 As required under the legislation, from October 2001, designated stakeholder pension arrangements will be made available to all civil servants who cannot be covered by the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS). Civil service stakeholder pension arrangements will also be made available to civil servants who are covered by the PCSPS but who earn less than &#163;30,000 a year, and who wish to top up their PCSPS benefits.
<P>

<a name="01108w19.html_para2">These arrangements will be for <i>(a)</i> new civil servants, <i>(b)</i> existing civil servants, and <i>(c)</i> staff of executive agencies while they are employed within the civil service.
