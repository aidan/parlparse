<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence published its Defence Industrial Strategy in December 2005. This gives greater transparency to future UK defence requirements and sets out the industrial capabilities which need to be retained in the UK to meet those requirements. In doing so, it recognises that both MOD and industry will need jointly to develop and change their acquisition behaviours to adopt a through life perspective.

 Between November 2003 and December 2005 the cross-Government Conflict Prevention Pools contributed over &#163;30 million towards the training and equipping of the Iraqi Security Forces. It is not possible to collate the cost of the UK forces programme of training the Iraqi army because MOD identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred, not the individual tasks associated with operations.

 I have written to all MPs announcing that a Veterans Day will take place on 27 June 2006 and we will be marking that date as Veterans Day in future years. It is important that the nation should have an opportunity each year to recognise the contribution that veterans have made and that they continue to make to our life in the UK today. It will be a day to focus on veterans of all ages, raising public awareness of their achievements and celebrating these. The day will also be an appropriate occasion to celebrate the service given by those currently serving in the armed forces.

<p><a name="qn_9"><a name="60227w01.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> legal regime and <i>(b)</i> rules of engagement govern the activities of United Kingdom armed forces in Afghanistan as part of (i) the international security assistance force and (ii) Operation Enduring Freedom; and whether these will change in respect of the forthcoming Allied Rapid Reaction Corps deployment.  [48772]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 British troops in Afghanistan are deployed primarily under the international security assistance force (ISAF). ISAF operates at the request of the Afghan Government and with the authorisation of the United Nations. The latest Security Council resolution on the ISAF (UNSCR 1623) was agreed on 13 September 2005, and will remain in force until October 2006. UK troops deployed under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) operate in Afghanistan with the consent of the Afghan Government.

<p>
<a name="60227w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">UK troops in Afghanistan, whether under ISAF or OEF, will continue to act under UK rules of engagement (ROE), which ensure that UK military actions are consistent with UK law. However, as has been the practice of successive Governments, I am unable to comment in detail on the ROE under which our armed forces operate.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The role of British troops deployed as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Helmand is to support the Afghan Government as it extends its authority across the entire country and to assist its national security forces to maintain security. Responsibility for protection of sites and artefacts of archaeological or historical value lies primarily with the Government of Afghanistan. However, UK troops will show the utmost respect for local people, customs and Afghanistan&#039;s culture.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 A key role of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan is to provide a stable security environment to facilitate development 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 4W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and reconstruction work done by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and others. The UK will deploy the HQ Group of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps to lead the ISAF for a period of nine months from May 2006. British troops deploying to Helmand will support a UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, which will help enable NGOs to operate in that province.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of the unrest in Afghanistan on 4 and 5 February on the security situation there; and if he will make a statement.  [50364]</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The unrest that occurred between 4 and 5 February in Helmand province will have little impact on the overall security situation in Afghanistan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The incident initially gave cause for concern due to the significant numbers of insurgents and tribesmen involved in what is assessed to be a well planned and executed operation. However, the response by Afghan Security Forces against a determined and well organised enemy, with minimal coalition support, clearly demonstrates the increasing capability of the ANA and ANP.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 6 February 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> column 817W on Afghanistan, how the expected breach of Harmony guidelines caused by the planned deployment to Afghanistan will be managed.  [50728]</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Harmony guidelines are measured by average Tour Intervals for units and personnel. Breaches are managed in a number of ways, including through tailoring of force packages to achieve objectives in the most efficient way possible, and sensitive posting and deployment of personnel. Pressure is further alleviated through contributions made by other Allies, which we continue to encourage through the NATO force generation process, and through eventual reductions in UK force commitments elsewhere. Over the longer-term, programmes such as the Future Army Structure will help to bring Tour Intervals in line with Harmony guidelines.

<a name="stpa_7">However, I am not aware of any credible evidence to suggest that insurgents or their techniques and procedures have infiltrated Helmand Province from Iraq or Iran. Helmand does not share a border with either country, but the armed forces of Pakistan have made extensive efforts, at considerable loss of life, to improve the rule of law along their border with Afghanistan. Iran has stated that it supports the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan and the efforts of

[53831]</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew15"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Under the terms of NATO&#039;s Operational Plan, ISAF troops can support Afghan counter-narcotics forces and operations in a number of ways, including by training Afghan forces, sharing information on the opium trade, supporting the counter-narcotics information campaign, and providing enabling support for Afghan counter-narcotics efforts. ISAF will also help provide the security environment in which the rule of law can be applied, traffickers can be effectively targeted by Afghan forces and a diversified economy capable of providing sustainable legal rural livelihoods for the farmers can be developed.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster what the retirement age is for civil servants; and whether his Department plans to change it.  [51496]</p>

 Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff below the senior civil service subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_52">Against this background, over 80 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions.

<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para1">
The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, heads of departments and agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_53">Legislation which will come into force in October 2006 will result in the normal retirement age in the United Kingdom being 65. As a result employers will not have to justify the decision to retire an employee after that age. This will be subject to review after five years. To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of all its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants.

 DFID&#039;s only current bilateral support for alternative livelihoods (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production) is in Afghanistan. Here, DFID&#039;s alternative livelihoods programme was developed substantially after full-blown conflict ended in 2001, although terrorist violence continues in parts of the country where we are supporting the Government to promote alternatives to poppy production. DFID also supports a UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) project in Myanmar, which aims to support the local population in meeting their food security needs following the banning of opium production.

A further &#163;16 million was provided in the 1980s and 90s to broader agricultural research projects in non coca-growing areas of Bolivia of which some 10&#150;20 per cent. may have had an impact on coca-growing households in adjacent areas.

 Afghanistan is the only country where DFID has a bilateral alternative livelihoods programme (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production). The Afghan Government launched its updated National Drug Control Strategy at the London Conference in January which sets out the Afghan Governments policies and plans for tackling Afghanistan&#039;s narcotics trade for the coming three years and highlights four key priorities. These are (i) targeting the trafficker and trade, (ii) strengthening and diversifying legal livelihoods, (iii) developing effective counter-narcotics institutions and (iv) demand reduction. The UK has a three year plan to support this and DFID leads on UK support for alternative livelihoods.

<a name="stpa_91">Between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 DFID&#039;s spending on alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan has increased ten fold. The forecast spend for this year is in the region of &#163;45 million and we hope to maintain similar levels of funding in future years. The DFID livelihoods programme will support the Afghan Government&#039;s efforts to mitigate the impact of those who have lost their livelihoods, through the expansion of key Afghan Government National Programmes into priority poppy growing provinces; support programmes to improve farm and off-farm opportunities for poor Afghan farmers and labourers to access legal income from sustainable legal employment, credit productive assets such as infrastructure and social assets such as education and health services, and markets for legal goods; help generate an improved policy and planning environment for alternative livelihood programmes; and support greater financial and technical support from other donors, delivered in a more coherent manner in line with the Afghan Government&#039;s policies and plans.

<a name="stpa_92">The success criterion for alternative livelihoods is a 10 per cent. year-on-year increase in uptake of legal livelihood opportunities.

 The African Union Mission in Sudan covers the three states of Darfur (Western, Northern and Southern).

<a name="stpa_94">Darfur remains highly dependent on food aid. Although this year there is expected to be above average food production, the ability of Darfuris to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas.

The AU has performed well in very challenging circumstances but the deterioration in security in Darfur since the end of 2005 has been marked by an increase in violence and banditry. This change has underlined that a peace support mission will be required for quite some time.

While the final decision on transfer needs to come from the AU, I welcome their agreement in principle on 12 January and the UN&#039;s planning for such a contingency.

The role the AU plays in providing support to the humanitarian agencies and protecting civilians is critical to the people of Darfur and there cannot be any winding down of effectiveness in anticipation of the UN arriving. The UK, therefore, in addition to providing substantial funding, is encouraging our international partners to maintain and increase their levels of support to the AU. This includes taking forward the recommendations of the December 2005 Joint Assessment Mission which will assist in strengthening the AU&#039;s capabilities.

 There is considerable suffering in Tanzania owing to the present food insecurity. The Government of Tanzania has made effective use of its Strategic Grain Reserve to deliver grain to vulnerable households, although the continuing drought means this is now under pressure. A Rapid Vulnerability Assessment (RVA), conducted by the Government in response to the food and water situation was circulated on 13 February. The RVA found that 3.8 million Tanzanians need food assistance to the tune of 100,000 metric tonnes up to the next expected harvest in May. Of those, around 565,000 are considered destitute and need immediate food aid. DFID stands ready to help the Government respond to this situation. We are consulting with other agencies, notably the World Food Programme, to determine the robustness of the RVA and inform decisions on assistance. DFID&#039;s response will be based on a proposal received from the Government of Tanzania, outlining what additional resources it needs from donors, and how it would like them delivered. Other donors are also likely to respond to the Government&#039;s proposal.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what baseline figures he is using for assessing progress on his Department&#039;s targets to reduce <i>(a)</i> the number of posts in the National Offender Management Service and <i>(b)</i> the Immigration and Nationality Directorate Headquarters by 1,170; what progress has been made towards these targets to date; and what the total efficiency savings achieved to date are for these targets.  [52937]</p>




<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60227w21.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 My Department&#039;s target is to reduce the size of the headquarters by 2,700 full time-equivalent posts by 31 March 2008 (of which the Department estimates that around 1,170 posts would be derived from reduction in headquarters functions in the National Offender Management Service and Immigration and Nationality Directorate). That is from a baseline figure for the size of the headquarters of 9,900 full-time equivalent posts in March 2004 (reported in my Department&#039;s value for money technical note, available via http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/our-service-to-you/?view=Standard). Of the total baseline, the National Offender Management Service accounts for around one third of posts in the headquarters, and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate around one quarter.

<p>
<a name="60227w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_59">In my 2005 Autumn Performance Report to Parliament (Cm 6707), I reported that my Department had reduced the size of the headquarters by 917 full-time equivalent posts, including posts in the headquarters functions of the National Offender Management Service and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. This reduction contributed &#163;32 million per annum cashable gains to the increase in value for money worth &#163;845 million per annum that I reported in respect of the financial year 2004&#150;05.

 London locational allowances are normally reviewed as part of the annual pay award settlements and takes account of the Home Office business needs to recruit and retain staff, local employment markets and cost of living pressures. The last review of these allowances occurred in 2005. For the non-agency Home Office these allowances were increased by 12 per cent. with a further review timetabled for 2007. For the Prison Service there was no increase in the value of local pay allowances in London.

Ten local authorities applied to conduct early voting from alternative locations, of which seven of these have been approved. Early voting from alternative locations has also been piloted in 2000, 2002 and 2003. Work on some of these pilots will help explore the potential future use of the technology available to enable voters to vote from any polling station in their local authority area.

 Rolling registration allows names to be added to the electoral register at any time of the year and enables people who have moved home or otherwise been excluded from being registered to be included in respect of their current place of residence. The Office for National Statistics published on 23 February figures in respect of the size of the electorate as of 1 December 2005 following the annual registration canvass which revealed that for the second successive year there has been an increase in the number of electors included in the electoral registers in the United Kingdom.

 The process for becoming a magistrate in Lancashire is the same as in other parts of England and Wales. Magistrates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor on behalf of and in the name of HM the Queen. Candidates are recommended for appointment by local Advisory Committees (ACs) following a two-stage interview process in which they will be assessed against six key personal qualities: good character, understanding and communication, social awareness, maturity and sound temperament, sound judgment and commitment and reliability. The process requires applicants to complete an application form, which is checked for eligibility. Successful candidates are subject to background checks for any conflicts of interest and exceptional circumstances before being recommended for appointment.

The necessary primary legislation to implement it in the UK formed part of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003.

 Folding bicycles may be carried on all trains at all times, free of charge.

This arrangement is common to all operators, although the exact time restriction may vary by route. Operators are encouraged to provide cycle facilities at stations and since 2004&#150;05 the Department for Transport has funded around 2,900 additional new cycle parking spaces at stations across the rail network.

 Information on monthly sales of biofuels and all other transport fuels is available from the HM Revenue and Customs website at http://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=facthydro. The data for November and December 2005 are still provisional at this stage, but suggests that, across the year as a whole, sales of biofuels accounted for some 0.25 per cent. of total transport fuel sales. The Government&#039;s recently announced Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation is set to deliver a huge increase in UK biofuels over the next few years, and will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that, by 2010, biofuels account for 5 per cent. of their total sales.

Any change to the impact on the environment is therefore likely to be negligible and no Environmental Impact Assessment is planned.

We have already made regulations that will lift the exemption in relation to public transport-buses and coaches, trains and trams, taxis and private hire vehicles-as well as for vehicles used on leisure and tourism services, vehicle hire services and vehicle breakdown services.

The figures for 1997 to 2001 are based on a combination of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA) return, and the Housing Corporation&#039;s Regulatory Statistical Return (RSR). For the years 2002 to 2004 the figures are based on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Council Tax Base 1 (CTB1) return.<br>

These figures are for all vacant dwellings, including dwellings that have been empty for fewer than six months, some for less than 1 month. The Government are introducing new powers from April 2006 for local authorities to reduce the number of long-term empty homes in their area.<br>

 Funding for the Firefighters&#039; Pension Scheme was not separately identified within the grant distributed to Fire and Rescue Authorities for the years between 1997 and 2005. From the 1 April 2006 the new arrangements for financing firefighter pensions will ensure that funding allocated to support the cost of the Firefighters&#039; Pension Scheme is separately identified. This is designed to increase transparency in authorities&#039; budgets, in that they will more accurately reflect the ongoing accruing costs of providing the frontline service.

 It is not possible to calculate how much funding has been allocated to each authority with respect to concessionary fares, since this is funded through an unhypothecated formula grant.

<a name="stpa_241">Information is also collected on the number of people who sleep rough, that is, those with no fixed abode who are literally roofless. As at June 2005 there were an estimated 459 people sleeping rough in England on any one single night, the lowest ever recorded figure. In 2001, a survey estimated that 14 per cent. of rough sleepers had served in the forces at some point in their lives, although more recent analysis suggest this has fallen to 10 per cent.

 The Government&#039;s understanding of the causes of homelessness and the actions that can be taken to tackle it more effectively was summarised in 2005 in the strategy for tackling homelessness, &quot;Sustainable Communities: settled homes, changing lives&quot;. This endorsed the analysis in the 2002 report &quot;More than a roof&quot;. Homelessness is caused by a number of factors, some of which relate to the wider state of the economy and the housing market and others which are personal to the individual or family, or reflect social and demographic change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w49.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_243">The overall supply of affordable housing is a key structural factor and the Government are increasing investment to deliver 75,000 social rented homes and 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low cost home ownership by 2008. Options for making greater use of the private rented sector as a source of settled solutions for homeless households are also being developed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w49.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_244">Local authorities are asked to record the reasons when they accept a household as being unintentionally homeless and in priority need. The most recent statutory homelessness statistics for England (for the third quarter of 2005) are on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website. The most important recorded reasons are parents, relatives or friends no longer willing to accommodate the household, the breakdown of a relationship with a partner and the ending of an assured shorthold tenancy. Since 2002 the Government have promoted an increasing emphasis on developing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 180W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
innovative approaches to the prevention of homelessness. Successful approaches to homelessness prevention have been developed to address the presenting problems of households approaching local authorities, for example mediation to resolve family and relationship breakdown and rent deposit schemes to provide access to the private rented sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w49.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_245">It is recognised that the recorded reasons often obscure a complex chain of events that preceded the homelessness acceptance. At present relatively little is known about the personal, social and economic circumstances of homeless families and other vulnerable people accepted by local authorities, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is undertaking further research to improve understanding of the deeper social and personal issues involved. To address this gap in the evidence base the ODPM is currently conducting a major survey of households with children and of young people accepted as homeless by local authorities on the causes, impacts and costs of homelessness. This study will report in the summer of 2006 and results will be published later this year.

In September 2005, it was agreed that his remit should be extended to consider issues of role and function before the finalisation of conclusions on funding.

<a name="stpa_295"><i>(b)</i><i>,</i> <i>(c)</i>, <i>(d)</i> These rules and regulations are part of a package of measures providing a useful framework to various planning and related appeals procedures. Their main purpose is to ensure that all the information, evidence and submissions needed to make a fully informed and timely appeal decision can be assembled in an orderly fashion to enable the appeal proceedings to operate smoothly. While they are generally operating satisfactorily, we are not complacent. There is still some room for further improvement, such as in complying with timetables for the production of proofs of evidence for inquiries and statements of common ground between the main parties and in providing realistic estimates of the time likely to be required to make submissions and the number of witnesses to be called. However, where a party fails to adhere to the timetables, there is power to disregard late representations. Moreover, if that failure is unreasonable and leads to another party incurring unnecessary expense, the power to award costs also provides an effective discipline in the case of hearings and inquiries. For its part, the Planning Inspectorate is actively managing improvements to its own performance in arranging hearing and inquiry dates in the face of a continuing high level and variety of casework which places conflicting demands on the available inspector resource.

 The working groups and committees within the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) that operated to prepare for the council tax revaluations were set up in accordance with recognised programme management methodology. Thus for the revaluation in England a programme board oversaw the work of five constituent projects, each having its own project board. The projects covered data; valuations; inquiries, appeals and list maintenance; resources; and information technology. For the revaluation in Wales, there was a single project and project board dealing with all aspects.

 The Government&#039;s aim is to tackle homelessness more effectively and has provided over &#163;200 million to support local authorities&#039; prevention strategies. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is providing practical assistance for authorities in delivering these strategies whose purpose is to ensure that accommodation and support are available for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It is therefore a matter for Shrewsbury and Atcham to decide on the provision of a shelter for homeless women in the area.
