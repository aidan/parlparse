 Sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the independent judiciary. We have however announced plans for changes to the statutory sentencing framework to introduce new public protection sentences for dangerous sexual and violent offenders. Under the proposals, dangerous sexual and violent offenders could receive extended public protection sentences whereby they could be detained in custody for the fall term of their prison sentence. Those committing the most serious sexual and violent offences could receive indeterminate public protection sentences and could remain in prison for an indefinite period. I will be publishing draft legislative proposals shortly.</p>

Specifically, some MP Hotline telephone numbers have changed without the Agency alerting either MPs or its people to the new numbers.

 Following publication of the proposals for the Third Rail Package, the Government undertook a statutory public consultation to take into account the views of stakeholders which were integral to formulating the UK negotiating line. In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines the Government produced an initial Regulatory Impact Assessment at the time of consultation in 2004 to assess the likely effects of the directive on the UK industry and users. This was continually updated to account for changes made to the proposal by the Council and European Parliament. A partial Regulatory Impact Assessment was submitted to the Scrutiny Committee of both Houses on 14 January 2005.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 July 2007]:</i><i> </i>My Department is committed to helping all school children in England learn more about food and farming in a sustainable countryside. DEFRA provides approximately &#163;1 million a year in payments to farmers who provide schools with free educational visits to their farms as part of their agri-environment scheme agreements. In addition, in the current financial year, DEFRA will provide &#163;146,000 to support the Countryside Educational Visits Accreditation Scheme (CEVAS), which provides training to farmers who provide educational access visits. This amounts to 50 per cent. of the scheme&#146;s funding.</p>

This is a campaign to promote healthy living by giving children direct experience of food, farming and the countryside. It is an industry-led initiative, fully endorsed by Government, which will run throughout the academic year, September 2007 to July 2008. DEFRA has contributed financial support amounting to &#163;130,000 to develop the programme. In addition, DEFRA has lent a member of staff to the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) to work on the initiative.</p>

 In his review of the Animal Health and Welfare delivery landscape, David Eves made wide-ranging recommendations. The need for greater co-ordination is a significant issue, leading to the recommendation for a pivotal role for Animal Health (formerly the State Veterinary Service). DEFRA accepts his recommendations and has considered how to act on them with Animal Health and Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services in particular. Animal Health is developing a lead role in co-ordinating Animal Health and Welfare delivery. At the same time, Animal Health is conducting, with local authority representatives, a review of the efficacy of the current delivery arrangements.</p>

Preventing the importation of heroin from Afghanistan and cocaine from Latin America into the UK is a top priority for our international efforts. We engage with countries along the main trafficking routes from Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and the Balkans, and Latin America, especially the Caribbean and West Africa, as well as with the producer countries.

 There are 230 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff with an Arabic language qualification at various levels recorded on the FCO management information system.

Using success in the internal FCO Arabic exam at Operational or Extensive level as a measure of fluency, 70 staff acquired fluency in Arabic between 2000 and 2006. Other staff serving in Arabic-speaking posts will have retained fluency from previous use of the language. Five staff will complete Arabic Operational training in 2007 and a further 14 in 2008. We would expect the overall number of Arabic speakers in the diplomatic service to increase as we continue to train staff and target hard language skills, including Arabic, at recruitment and inward transfer.

1. PCA data: Prescription information is taken from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, supplied by the Prescription Pricing Division (PPD) of the Business Services Authority (BSA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.<br>
2. Prescription items: Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>
3. Exemption category estimates: The exemption data are identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and rely on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case. Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a one in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. The information we have is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. Children are defined as 0 to 15-year-olds, and as 16 to 18-year-olds in full-time education.<br>
4. Dispensing doctors: Data up to 2000 are not strictly comparable with data from later years. Up until September 2000 only patients having their prescriptions dispensed by the community pharmacists and appliance contractors were required to complete the back of the prescription form, but from October 2000 this requirement was extended to patients of dispensing doctors. Therefore data prior to October 2000 do not include prescriptions dispensed by dispensing doctors.<br>
5. BNF classifications: The Prescription Cost Analysis system uses the therapeutic classifications defined in the British National Formulary (BNF). No information on why a drug is prescribed is available and since drugs can be prescribed to treat more than one condition it is impossible to separate the different conditions that a drug was prescribed for.<br>

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2007]:</i> This is a matter of concern across Europe. The European Commission has indicated that it will propose amending the Framework Decision on combating Terrorism to criminalise the incitement to terrorism and the intentional transmission of information useful to terrorism, such as bomb-making instructions.

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2007]: </i>Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is an established technology that the police use to identify vehicles of interest through pattern recognition software. It is used to target terrorism, serious and organised crime, volume crime (such as burglary) and some vehicle documentation offences (for example, uninsured driving and road tax evasion). Police officers using the technology are achieving a significantly higher arrest rate and offences brought to justice rate when compared to conventional policing methods. The recent terrorist incidents in London and Glasgow demonstrated the usefulness of ANPR as an intelligence and analysis tool.</p>

 Coroners are funded by the relevant local authority and police authority.

Since 1 April 2007 bodies from Iraq and Afghanistan have been repatriated via RAF Lyneham to the jurisdiction of the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner.

 The Prison Service does not keep information on the number of prisoners that have dependent children.

However, the 2003-04 resettlement survey commissioned by the Prison Service Custody to Work Unit showed that half of all female prisoners had dependent children (including stepchildren), and that 46 per cent. of those women had lived with at least one dependent child before custody.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> The Prison Service definition of self-inflicted deaths is broader than the legal definition of suicide and includes all deaths where it appears that a prisoner has acted specifically to take their own life. This inclusive approach is used in part because inquest verdicts are often not available for some years after a death (some 20 per cent. of these deaths will not receive a suicide or open verdict at inquest). Annual numbers may change slightly from time to time as inquest verdicts and other information become available.<br>

 Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data cannot determine when an admitted patient has been involved in an incident of binge drinking, and the vast majority of incidents of binge drinking do not result in an admission to hospital. While HES data can be used to determine the number of episodes where the patient had an alcohol related illness, many patients may not be admitted to hospital and would instead be treated in other settings such as primary care or outpatients. Neither can HES supply data that could be used to accurately assess the change in the number of alcohol related illnesses since 2004. While it is likely that alcohol-related attendances at accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments will be higher than those for alcohol-related admissions to hospital, this data is not recorded.</p>

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

This provides a fairer and more consistent way of assessing clinical needs and ensuring that resources are deployed on treatments that bring genuine health gain. It is for primary care trusts to agree local clinical governance frameworks that cover what information providers of orthodontic services have to make available to demonstrate compliance with this and other contractual requirements.</p>

 The Talk to Frank helpline is run as part of a pooled service that includes Know the Score, Drinkline, Sexual Health Line and Hepatitis C Information Line. This allows for a more efficient and cost effective model that shares costs across the helplines. The overall cost for the pooled service in 2006-07 was &#163;1.45 million. Due to the shared nature of this service, it is impossible to give completely accurate cost for the Talk to Frank helpline alone. But based upon the split in number of calls, we estimate that the Talk to Frank helpline service would cost roughly &#163;800,000 of the &#163;1.5 million.</p>

 The Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with independent advice from the Commission on Human Medicines, assesses the balance of risks and benefits of all medicines at the time of initial licensing and throughout their use in clinical practice.</p>

Serious side-effects, however, are rare. The recognised side effects of licensed medicines are listed in their product information, provided for healthcare professionals. All new medicines are now also required to have patient information leaflets which provide information on how to use the medicine, and on their side effects.</p>
