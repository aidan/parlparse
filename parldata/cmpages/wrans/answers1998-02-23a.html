To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will list the properties and land owned by the Commissioners which they have identified as surplus to requirements, giving in each case their estimated value. [30328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 None. The Commissioners' property and land are investments held to support the ministry of the Church of England. They are kept under regular review and from time to time disposed of and acquired in the light of investment and other financial considerations. Details of such properties are commercially sensitive. The Commissioners are also the vendors of redundant Churches and a small number of these are vested in us at any one time for sale.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have made my views on the MAI public in response to Parliamentary Questions and in response to letters from Members of Parliament, enclosing inquiries for members of the public. Officials from my Department are also answering a large number of public inquiries about the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). My officials have agreed to speak about the MAI at a number of conferences and seminars organised by academic institutions and NGOs.

<P>
<a name="80223w01.html_wqn13"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the capacity of the Governments of developing countries to control the potentially adverse impacts of foreign investment under the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.  [30583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Foreign investment has an important role to play in economic development which is essential to meeting the international poverty eradication targets. The problem for many developing countries, particularly the poorest, is marginalisation from these global capital flows. The Government therefore support the establishment of a better international framework for investment through instruments such as the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). In our study of the development implications of the MAI, my Department is exploring how the needs of developing countries can best be taken into account.

<a name="80223w02.html_wqn7"><B> Sir Paul Beresford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the 30 English local authorities with the <i>(a)</i> worst and <i>(b)</i> best council house rent collection rates, (i) as a percentage of rent due net of benefit, (ii) as a percentage of gross rent due and (iii) as cash due, for the latest available year.

<P>
<a name="80223w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 February 1998]:</i> Information on rent arrears and rent collection is collected from local authorities in England on Housing Subsidy Forms. This information includes data on rent due (full rent available on all dwellings less rent reductions/refunds and rent lost on vacant dwellings) and the part of this rent that is outstanding at the end of the year. Not all authorities are able to provide the latter items, which requires dissaggregation of rent arrears for the current year from those for previous years. This means that collection rates for 1996-97 are not available for around 50 authorities.
<P>

<a name="80223w02.html_para7">The details requested for collection rates for gross rent are set out in percentage and cash terms. These data are as issued by News Release on 9 February 1998 and, as the footnote indicates, Islington has subsequently submitted revised figures.
<P>

<a name="80223w02.html_para8">No data are collected centrally on arrears of rent net of benefit.

 The London Borough of Greenwich, in co-operation with other partners, are progressing plans to complete and upgrade the Thames Path to enable cyclist and pedestrian access to the Millennium Experience. They are considering the results of a feasibility study and will be negotiating with owners and developers as necessary to pursue the project.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the answer of 22 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>617</i>, how much contaminated material has been buried beneath the Millennium Experience site; on which parts of the site this material has been buried; if contaminated material has been buried beneath the Millennium Dome; and what the contaminated material is composed of.  [30388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w03.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The remediation of contaminated soils on the Greenwich Peninsula, in accordance with current legislation and government policy, includes both the treatment and reuse of soils on-site and removal of wastes off-site. Contaminated soils have also been left in situ where they do not pose a risk to groundwater, and are capped using multi-layered engineered clean soils. This contaminated material is likely to exist over much of the peninsula including the area leased by the New Millennium Experience Company. However, site users are effectively isolated from it by the capping layers.
<P>

<a name="80223w03.html_para0">The contamination within these soils which have been left in situ and capped includes wastes from the production of gas and its by-products as well as carboniferous materials.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 22 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>617</i>, concerning re-use of material on the Millennium Experience site, what material has been re-used and in what way.  [30389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w03.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The materials which have been treated and re-used on the Greenwich Peninsula site, including the site to be used for the Millennium Experience, are principally the excavated soils.
<P>

<a name="80223w03.html_para1">Following wet and dry sieving to remove the more highly contaminated fine material, the coarser fraction is replaced and compacted for use as general fill. This reduces the need to import material from off-site, thus reducing cost and minimising environmental impact. In addition, trials are being undertaken to use the moderately contaminated materials for road construction by adding cement and lime.

 The Emergency Towing Study by Captain C.P.R. Belton published in 1995 included a year-round environmental and risk analysis of oil spills at sea. For the analysis, the UK coastline was divided into sixteen regions and ranked according to various environmental and risk factors. The Pembrokeshire coastline was contained within the region of West and North Wales which was ranked sixth overall and therefore was not designated a Primary or Secondary danger area. The West Country, where an Emergency Towing Vessel is stationed for the winter months and ranked third overall in the Study, was designated a Primary danger area. As a result of tug trials carried out during the winter months, I announced on 10 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>131-32</i>, that three tugs would continue to be sited in the Dover Strait, the Minches and the Western Approaches between October and March.

 No such estimates have been made.

 The Government support, in principle, the introduction of a tax on aviation fuel at an international level.

This report is expected to be presented to the ICAO Assembly in September. In addition, the European Commission is supporting a study of the environmental and competitive effects on the EU of an aviation fuel tax. This is due to be completed in August. We will consider how to take forward policy after we know the results of these studies.

 Statistics relating to road accidents involving dangerous substances are held by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). From these statistics, it is not possible to disaggregate those involving chemicals which are environmentally toxic.
<P>

<a name="80223w03.html_para5">Two types of dangerous occurrences involving the carriage of dangerous substances by road are required to be reported to HSE under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR). They are specified in sections 16 and 17 of Schedule 2 of RIDDOR 95. These relate to incidents where road tankers or tank containers overturn or are seriously damaged, where there is an uncontrolled release or escape of the dangerous substance, or where there is a fire involving the dangerous substance.
<P>

<a name="80223w03.html_para6">Accidents involving road vehicles other than road tankers or tank containers are also required to be reported if they result in an uncontrolled release or escape of the dangerous substance in such a quantity as to have the potential to cause the death of, or major injury to, any person. Accidents involving these vehicles are also reportable where they lead to a fire involving the dangerous substance.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimates, my Department's cash limits will change as follows:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) the cash limit for class V, vote 1--Highways Agency--will be reduced by &#163;5,645,000 from &#163;1,572,558,000 to &#163;1,566,913,000.

The increase reflects an inter-vote transfer from class V, vote 4 of &#163;336,000 running cost and &#163;154,000 programme provision for Central Transport Group and Government Office administration expenditure and an inter-vote transfer from this vote to class II, vote 2 of &#163;51,000 in respect of costs associated with the United Nations Convention on the law of the sea. In addition provision has been made for a receipt of &#163;650,000 from the European Community in respect of the cost of the return visit to the wreck of the tanker Derbyshire and associated payments of &#163;651,000. Provision of &#163;1,000 has also been made for Government Office administration receipts and there is a net increase in other voted receipts of &#163;438,000, reflecting expected outturn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) the cash limit on class V, vote 4--Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency--will be increased by &#163;416,000 from &#163;154,825,000. The increase involves a &#163;2,900,000 claim on the Reserve for higher business volumes under the terms of DVLA's demand financing regime. The cash limit is also increased by &#163;16,000 as a result of transfers of &#163;8,000 from the Scottish Office (class XIII, Vote 5) and &#163;8,000 from the Home Office (class VII, vote 1). These increases are offset by transfers of: &#163;490,000 to class V, vote 2 (&#163;336,000 of which is running costs); &#163;504,000 to class V, vote 6; &#163;160,000 to class VI, vote 5; and &#163;1,346,000 to the DOT/LACAP (Local Authority Capital) non-voted cash limit to provide assistance to the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority.

The increase reflects the take-up of &#163;650,000 capital end year flexibility as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 17 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>245-50</i>, and an inter-vote transfer from class VI, vote 2 of &#163;200,000 for the Rural Transport Development Fund.</FONT></UL>

 I discussed the water resource position with the Water Services Association in December. The water companies have the duty to maintain and develop water supplies to meet the needs of their areas. In accordance with guidelines issued last August by the Environment Agency, all water companies are currently preparing water resource plans to maintain a balance between demand and supply over the next 25 years. These plans will have to address projected demands such as housing need and will need to be agreed with the Environment Agency, which has the duty to secure the proper use of water resources in England and Wales.

 We have no plans to set targets for cleaning of pavements.

My Department issued a Code of Practice in 1991 to provide practical guidance on the discharge of this duty. In addition, the Audit Commission requires local authorities to publish performance indicators in relation to their street cleaning duty.

 Conventional petrol and diesel vehicles are becoming increasingly cleaner as a result of a progressive tightening of emissions standards and are expected to provide the primary motive sources for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, in well-engineered applications, alternative fuelled vehicles do have a role to play, especially in urban areas. In these circumstances the current limitations on their range and refuelling might not be too disadvantageous and they can bring worthwhile reductions in emissions, especially of particulates and NOx.

<P>
<a name="80223w06.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Environmental Agency is currently consulting on proposals for reducing polluting emissions from existing coal- and oil-fired power stations. The Agency's consultation paper contains a proposal to require that all coal-fired power stations which operate without flue gas desulphurisation equipment (FGD) should be required to use coal with a sulphur content of less than 1.2 per cent. from 1999. The closing date for responses is 10 March and I am sure that the Agency will reflect very carefully on the representations which it receives.
<P>

<a name="80223w06.html_para5">It would not be right for me to comment on the Agency's proposals, since the generators would have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against any decision to vary their authorisations in line with the consultation paper. Nevertheless, I can say that the Secretary of State has not estimated the impact of the 1.2 per cent. limit on employment levels either in power generation or housing. It seems particularly unlikely that there could be much of a direct effect on the housing market.

 The Government are committed to encouraging the use of water for carrying freight as an alternative to road transport where this is a practical and economic option. Freight Facilities Grants are also available to support the transfer of freight from roads to inland waterways or rail. The Department is considering the scope for encouraging greater use of inland waterways and estuarial rivers as part of the development of an integrated transport strategy. The White Paper on the strategy, setting out a strategic framework for sustainable transport policy, will be published in the Spring.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the checks proposed under the new single vehicle approval system will ensure that all cars manufactured and used in Japan and subsequently imported into the United Kingdom as second-hand cars will meet EU type approved regulations; and if such cars comply with United Kingdom safety standards.

<P>
<a name="80223w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The proposed Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) standards are broadly based on EU type approval requirements. The standards cannot be as stringent in every respect because of practical considerations; for example, SVA cannot apply the same standards for crashworthiness. The SVA scheme is under review, but the intention is that the majority of non-type approved cars entering Britain will be inspected before they can be licensed and registered here. The proposed exceptions are: any vehicle over 10 years old; and those vehicles over 3 years old being imported by individuals who have lived abroad for at least 12 months and used the vehicle abroad for at least 6 months. Cars manufactured to Japanese standards would normally require at least the following modifications to pass the proposed SVA inspection: the inclusion of an mph display on the speedometer; the addition of a rear fog light; and alteration of the fuel filler nozzle.

The review addresses a number of important issues connected with ecolabelling--including the question of whether the United Kingdom should have its own award scheme, which is attracting interest from those responding to consultation.

It is currently being considered by the Committee of the European Parliament. Last week the Proposal was tabled by the UK Presidency for consideration by the Environment Working Group. These processes have revealed several aspects of the Proposal which would need substantial review before agreement on a new Regulation could be reached.

No actual funds will pass from existing distributors to the New Opportunities Fund, unless and until the Lottery Bill receives Royal Assent. Meanwhile, the proceeds for good causes continue to be allocated between existing distributors' accounts in the National Lottery Distribution Fund exactly in line with the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 and Orders made under it.

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1998]:</i> The Treasury last year applied to the Commission for financial assistance towards the cost of producing and distributing their booklet "EMU: Practical Information for Business". Discussions with the Commission about further funding for practical information material on EMU are ongoing. No other Department has applied for EU money to support information activities.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate the cash limit for Class II, Vote 2 (Other External Relations) will be increased by &#163;17,945,000 from &#163;229,815,000 to &#163;247,760,000. The increase is required to cover UK contributions to certain OSCE, United Nations and WEU Missions of &#163;26,429,000. This will be partly offset by recoveries of &#163;5,000,000 from the United Nations. There is a reduction of &#163;3,788,000 because of a negative Overseas Price Movement. This will be partly offset by transfers in of &#163;304,000. A total of &#163;204,000 from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Class V, Vote 2 and Class VI, Vote 3), Department of Trade and Industry (Class IV, Vote 1) and the Ministry of Defence (Class I, Vote 1) in respect of their contributions to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea following UK accession and a further &#163;100,000 from the Ministry of Defence (Class I, Vote 1) in respect of their contribution to the grant-in-aid to the Atlantic Council of the UK.

This reduction takes account of negative Overseas Price Movements of &#163;20,742,000 (&#163;10,095,000 running costs, &#163;10,417,000 other current and &#163;230,000 capital) which has offset a

These have been partially offset by two transfers in: &#163;25,000 from the Ministry of Defence (Class I, Vote 1) and &#163;18,000 from the Northern Ireland Office (Class XV, Vote 1) for the Whitehall District Heating System.

 Iraq denies that it retains any biological weapons or missiles with a range over 150 kilometres, both of which are prohibited under UN Security Council Resolution 687. But the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) has reported that serious gaps still remain in Iraq's declarations relating to all of its proscribed activities. Without full, unhindered access to all sites of Mass Destruction programmes, UNSCOM cannot be sure that Iraq does not retain operational SCUD-type missiles, or chemical or biological warheads for these.

 The delay in decisions on the construction of a new building planned at Abbey Wood, which I referred to in a previous answer on 10 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 196, is the only spend to save decision identified as having been deferred by the Strategic Defence Review.

 In common with many other bases, the future of RAF Coltishall is being considered in the context of our wide-ranging work on the Strategic Defence Review. Once all work on the review has been considered by Ministers, we will publish a White Paper setting out our overall conclusions. It is too soon to comment on what those conclusions may be and the implications that they may have.

 As part of routine maintenance, the runway at RAF Coltishall has recently been refurbished at a cost of &#163;5.24 million. There have been no other significant improvements to the Station, which has been a Jaguar base for 24 years.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary token Supplementary Estimate, the cash limit for Class VII, Vote 1 (Home Office administration, police, probation, immigration and other services, England and Wales) will be reduced by &#163;4,538,000 from &#163;4,728,661,000 to &#163;4,724,123,000, the cash limit for Class VII, Vote 2 (Prisons, England and Wales) will be reduced by &#163;1,014,000 from &#163;1,756,845 to &#163;1,755,831 and the gross running costs limit will be reduced by &#163;4,552,000 from &#163;1,892,931,000 to &#163;1,888,379,000.
<P>

<a name="80223w12.html_para2">The changes in the cash limits are the net effect of the following transfers: between Vote 1 and 2 in respect of information technology provision, training and criminal justice initiatives, &#163;44,000 to the Privy Council Office, Class XVIII, Vote 3, as a contribution towards the costs of United Kingdom Anti Drugs Co-ordinator, &#163;8,000 to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Class V, Vote 4, in respect of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and &#163;5,500,000 to the Crown Prosecution Service, Class VIII, Vote 4, in respect of criminal justice initiatives.

<a name="80223w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Police officers commonly carry out road checks on commercial vehicles to detect those which are being driven in a dangerous condition, are overloaded, unlicensed or committing other road traffic offences. Such checks may be carried out using the power to stop vehicles in section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended). Where such checks are arranged, forces may invite other agencies to attend in case the police's inquiries reveal potential offences relevant to those agencies' responsibilities. Such multi-agency checks may include representatives from the Benefits Agency and the Immigration Service. No information is held centrally on the number of multi-agency checks which have taken place.

 The decision as to how resources are used within a police force area is a matter for the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable must deploy resources according to operational priorities and objectives, whilst trying to take account of local views whenever possible. Every force will, from time to time, face unexpected demands on its resources, such as major inquiries, sports events, pop concerts or demonstrations. Protests by farmers fall within this category.

 The Government believe that the issue of capital punishment for murder and the question of the abolition of the death penalty for those offences for which it is still available (such as piracy with violence and treason) are matters for Parliament to decide on a free vote. We do not believe it is right to deny Parliament the opportunity to consider the issue in future by signing any international instrument which requires the abolition of the death penalty. We can, and do, support international calls for the abolition of the death penalty, because Parliament has consistently voted against the re-introduction of capital punishment for murder, and in the current Parliament anticipate that any motion to re-introduce it would be defeated by a substantial majority. On 11 October 1997, at the Summit of the Council of Europe, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister therefore signed the Council of Europe Declaration calling for the abolition of the death penalty.

 The notebook containing the manuscript of the poem "In Excelsis" forms part of a Home Office file, H0144/21591. The decision to open the file, which had previously been marked for closure until 2043, was taken in the interests of open government, following a request from a member of the public. The authority for the opening of the file is contained in a Lord Chancellor's Instrument made under section 5(1) of the Public Records Act 1958.

 Home Office lawyers advised that there were defects in the Bill on 20 January 1998 and leave was given to instruct Parliamentary Counsel to improve the technical competence of this Private Member's Bill. A responsible Government have a duty to ensure that a defective Bill does not pass into law.
<P>

<a name="80223w14.html_para0">The first amendments, drafted by Parliamentary Counsel, were laid on 9 February by the sponsor of the Bill. Further amendments have been laid and prepared during Committee Stage.
<P>

<a name="80223w14.html_para1">The Government's position in relation to the Bill remains neutral. It neither supports nor opposes the Bill. As a member of the Standing Committee, therefore, I looked to the Committee to make improvements to the Private Member's Bill. When defects were not addressed, the Government sought to provide drafting expertise.
<P>

<a name="80223w14.html_para2">Following informal contacts, I met formally with my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) on 9 and 16 February to discuss the technical deficiencies in his Bill. Civil servants, including Home Office lawyers, were present at both meetings.
<P>

<a name="80223w14.html_para3">My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester also met with me and my noble Friend the Lord Williams of Mostyn on 19 November 1997. Civil servants were present on this occasion too. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester was informed at that meeting that the Government would not lay amendments to his Bill during Committee Stage and I explained this to the Committee on 17 December.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many landowners who have received conditional exemption from inheritance tax by virtue of public access to land have withdrawn from the scheme since its inception.  [26490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w15.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Conditional exemption ceases to apply when the owner of an exempt asset fails to observe the relevant undertakings in a material respect. The failure could be due to a number of reasons including, for example, an owner voluntarily withdrawing from the scheme. Since 1983 (the earliest year for which information is available), there have been 23 cases where land has ceased to be conditionally exempt from inheritance tax, or its predecessor, capital transfer tax.

 The Maastricht deficit measure is the general government financial deficit (GGFD), which covers only central government and local authorities and excludes public corporations.

<P>

 Levels of blood stocks are a matter for the Welsh Blood Service in conjunction with NHS trusts which make use of blood products. However, I understand that their stocks are satisfactory at present following a good collection during January.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what changes he proposes to make to the voted cash limits for his Department and the Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in Wales in 1997-98.  [30379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary supplementary estimates, I intend to make the following changes:
<P>

<a name="80223w19.html_para4">The cash limit on class XIV, vote 2 will be reduced by &#163;3,877,000 from &#163;799,326,000 to &#163;795,449,000 which mainly reflects a virement from cash limited resources into non-cash limited for the Further Education Funding Council to cover the increase in student numbers and 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 1998 : Column: 71</I><P>
&#163;360,000 of additional funding under the Welfare to Work initiative for the further education sector. This &#163;360,000 is outside of the control total.
<P>

<a name="80223w19.html_para5">The cash limit on class XIV, vote 3 will be increased by &#163;168,000 from &#163;441,270,000 to &#163;441,438,000 as the net result of an additional &#163;200,000 from the Reserve towards the costs of providing for asylum seekers; a transfer of &#163;7,000 to the Class XVIII, vote 3 for costs associated with the UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator and a transfer of &#163;25,000 to Class XI, vote 2 for the Review of Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors. The transfer of &#163;25,000 to Class XI, vote 2 also reduces the Department's running costs provision by &#163;25,000 from &#163;73,897,000 to &#163;73,872,000.
<P>

<a name="80223w19.html_para6">The cash limit on class XIV, vote 4 has been decreased by &#163;5,818,000 from &#163;2,007,810,000 to &#163;2,001,992,000 mainly as a net result of the take-up of &#163;3,978,000 of end-year flexibility entitlements (&#163;3,000,000 for NHS Trusts capital programme and &#163;978,000 for hospital, community health and family health services), and the transfer of &#163;10,000,000 from the cash limited general practitioner fundholder's drugs provision to the non-cash limited family health services provision. The external finance limit for NHS Trusts has been increased by &#163;8,886,000 from &#163;52,914,000 to &#163;61,800,000.
<P>

<a name="80223w19.html_para7">The cash limit on class XIV, vote 6 has been reduced by &#163;300,000 from &#163;9,705,000 to &#163;9,405,000 as a result of lower than expected expenditure on training courses.
<P>

<a name="80223w19.html_para8">The non-voted cash limit for expenditure on the European Regional Development Fund (WO/ERDF) has been increased by &#163;1,398,000 from &#163;44,750,000 to &#163;46,148,000 as a result of a transfer of resources from DETR/ERDF.
<P>

<a name="80223w19.html_para9">None of the above changes add to the overall level of public expenditure.

<a name="80223w20.html_para4">Information is collected nationally on the number of patients who were admitted to hospital from the waiting list with a cancer-related diagnosis and who were later discharged following a surgical procedure. However, cancer-related diagnosis covers a very wide range of surgical treatments, not all of which are of a serious nature. The relevant information for the year ending 31 March 1996 and the latest available for the year ending 31 March 1997 is set out in the table. It should be noted that in the year to 31 March 1997, nearly 60 per cent. of patients who waited more than one month had minor surgical procedures for the bladder or for skin lesions.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> Figures for applicants to non-UCAS Scottish institutions of further and higher education are not held centrally. Figures on applicants for 1997 and 1998 entry to Scottish higher education institutions derived from applications received by UCAS on or before the closing date (15 December 1997 for 1998 entry, and equivalent date for the previous year) are provided in the table. Figures are not available on a consistent basis for 1996 entry.

<a name="80223w20.html_para10">The small drop between 1997 and 1998 was expected because of the increase in admissions that took place this session when Scottish institutions exceeded their targets, compared with previous shortfalls.

 The tables show the numbers of deaths <i>(a)</i> where the underlying cause of death was epilepsy, and <i>(b)</i> where epilepsy was mentioned on the death certificate but not recorded as the underlying cause of death. In neither case is it possible to say how many of the deaths were sudden.

 The Government continue to be concerned about knife-related crime and, as an additional means of combating such crime, we implemented the main provisions of the Knives Act 1997 on 1 September 1997. These create an offence of marketing a knife in such a way as suggests it is suitable for combat, or which encourages violent behaviour. It is, as yet, too soon to establish what effect these provisions may have had on knife-related crime.

 Subject to legislation, the general practitioner fundholding scheme will be wound up and replaced by a system of Primary Care Groups and Primary Care Trusts who will be accountable to health authorities for the way in which they discharge their functions within the locally agreed Health Improvement Programme. Groups rather than individual practices will reach service agreements with National Health Service trusts. Over time, we expect that groups will extend indicative budgets to individual practices for the full range of services, but no individual element will be artificially capped.
<P>

<a name="80223w22.html_para5">It will be open to the group to agree practice level incentive arrangements associated with those budgets, with the approval of the health authority, where this helps promote best use of resources. Initially, every practice will have a prescribing budget, as most do now.

 We are not able to provide the information requested as it is not collected centrally. Deaths related to hepatitis C infection result from chronic liver disease. There are many causes of chronic liver disease, and data from death certificates are not classified by particular cause.

Hepatitis C may not therefore have been the main cause of that disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what steps he is taking to ensure the continuity of production and supply of essential drugs currently manufactured outside the United Kingdom in the years covered by millennium computer compliance problems; [29506]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions he has had with non-UK based companies who provide essential drugs and services to the National Health Service about their millennium compliance status.  [29507]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 February 1998]:</i> The responsibility for ensuring the continuity of supply of essential drugs and services to National Health Service organisations over the millennium date change rests with the chief executive of each organisation, who will be seeking assurances of continuity of supply from suppliers. Where those assurances are inadequate, alternative suppliers will be used or other contingency plans used.
<P>

<a name="80223w24.html_para4">To avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in liaising with suppliers, central organisations such as NHS Supplies will be contacting major suppliers and making the results known to all NHS organisations. Furthermore, a central contingency stock plan is being developed by NHS Supplies in conjunction with regional offices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are regulations to control environmental and public health risks from spreading of waste material on agricultural land. The use of sewage sludge on agricultural land is controlled by the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989 and spreading of other non-agricultural waste is controlled by the waste management licensing system in force under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and by the associated Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. These controls are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and are enforced by the Environment Agency in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="80223w24.html_para5">The Department complements these Regulations by providing farmers with free written guidance, e.g. the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Air, Soil and Water.

 The Department has advised the Environment Agency's Sussex Flood Defence Committee that it will provide grant to support a programme of capital defence works of &#163;3.9 million in 1998-99 (an increase over the provision for 1997-98). Within this total, it is for the Committee to decide which projects should be promoted and their timing. I understand that substantial works have already been completed at Shoreham/Lancing and that the current phase, estimated to cost &#163;1.6 million, is likely to be completed by the end of March 1998. The Committee has determined that the next phase should be promoted in 1999-2000 in the light of its urgency in comparison to works elsewhere in the area.

placed on the market. ACRE has also given similar advice for the marketing of maize tolerant to glyphosate or glufosinate ammonium herbicides and glyphosate tolerant fodder beet.
<P>

<a name="80223w25.html_para5">Experimental releases of glyphosate tolerant oilseed rape are also taking place in Great Britain, and in this case ACRE has advised that an isolation distance of 50m be imposed as a condition to consents until further information is provided to support the removal of the isolation distance. Glyphosate tolerant sugar beet has also been released for trials, but with the condition that all "bolters" are removed before they flower.

 The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 will be amended on 1 July this year to make clear that this exemption applies only to those single ingredient foods the name of which is identical to that of the name of the ingredient, or where the name enables the nature of the ingredient to be identified clearly. These changes--which we have supported--are as a result of new EC requirements which will become compulsory with effect from 14 February 2000.

The increase will be charged to the Reserve and will not therefore add to the total public expenditure.

 The latest figures available from Customs and Excise show that between January and October 1997, 1,654 used motor vehicles were imported into the UK directly from Japan. It is not possible from the figures to identify separately those which were manufactured in Japan, or to include those which came to the UK from Japan via a third country.

 I refer my hon. Friend to my reply of 19 December 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>342.</i>
<P>

<a name="80223w27.html_para0">Reports on the operation of Euratom safeguards, including information on typical Euratom safeguards inspection effort both by country and by type of installation, are published periodically by the European Commission. The most recent information available is for 1996. This information is available in the paper "Euratom Safeguards--An update on Present Developments", which has been placed in the library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80223w27.html_para1">The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) do not routinely publish similar figures, but the information they have provided to us, which is subject to validation within the IAEA, shows that the inspection effort in the United Kingdom in 1997 fell within the range indicated in my previous answer. The facilities inspected included parts of BNFL's Sellafield site, but at present no UKAEA facilities are designated for inspection by the IAEA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B>

<UL>(2) if she will list the occasions when her Department has used its powers against companies which have caused environmental damage during the seismic exploration for oil.  [23835]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Petroleum licences are granted under the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934. Neither this Act nor the Regulations made under it provide for the criminal prosecution or taking by the Secretary of State of civil action against a licence holder where environmental damage has been caused in the course of petroleum exploration, whether or not that licence is still in force. Where environmental damage on land results from activity which contravenes any environmental legislation, then it is for the appropriate body such as the Environment Agency or relevant local authority to take action.
<P>

<a name="80223w27.html_para2">However, where a licence is still in force, breaches of the terms and conditions may lead to its revocation. The President of the Board of Trade may also take any lack of efficiency and responsibility in operations under a licence into account in decisions about future petroleum licence awards.

 <i>[holding answer 19 February 1998]:</i> The Office of Fair Trading has twice reviewed the position of BSkyB in the wholesale programme supply market to cable, most recently in a review carried out in 1996. As a result of those reviews BSkyB have given certain undertakings to meet the Director General of Fair Trading's concerns. He continues to keep this market under review.

 <i>[holding answer 19 February 1998]:</i> As I stated in my earlier answer, on 24 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>416</i>, the Export Control Organisation of my Department does not record the average length of time it takes for an export licence application to be issued.

This is a result of machinery of government changes whereby provision for disability issues is being transferred from the Department of Social Security (Class XII, Vote 1) and the Scottish Office (Class XIII, Vote 3); and provision for Women's issues is being transferred to the Department of Social Security (Class XII, Vote 1). The Employment Service (Class IX, Vote 3) are to transfer &#163;25,000,000 to finance additional expenditure on section A, &#163;175,000 for work in connection with the New Deal for Young People to be done by Government Offices, and &#163;40,000 for Employment Zones. Transfers to that Vote comprise &#163;500,000 for a Challenge Fund publicity campaign, &#163;1,600,000 for restructuring costs, and &#163;90,000 for Central Dispatch. Section W will increase by &#163;6,050,000 for funding on the further education element of the Welfare to Work programme and &#163;125,000 for additional running costs on that programme.

The running cost provision (within the control total) on this Vote will be increased as a result of the following changes: a net transfer of &#163;4,498,000 in running cost provision from Class XII, Vote 3 (Department of Social Security: administration) due to the recalculation of the cost of the implementation of the jobseeker's allowance; transfers from Class IX, Vote 1 (Department for Education and Employment: programmes and central services) of &#163;1,600,000 in relation to restructuring costs and &#163;90,000 for Central Dispatch work now undertaken by the Employment Service (ES); the transfer of &#163;40,000 in running costs provision to that Vote to cover work Government Offices will undertake on Employment Zones; and the transfer of &#163;170,000 in running costs provision from Class XII, Vote 3 (Department of Social Security: administration), &#163;140,000 of which is to cover the cost of work undertaken by ES in preparation for New Deal for Lone Parents and &#163;30,000 for Decision Making Advice in connection with Adjudication work. In addition, "other current expenditure" will be reduced as a result of: a transfer of &#163;25,000,000 to Class IX, Vote 1 (Department for Education and Employment: programmes and central services) for additional spending on section A of that Vote, offset by a transfer of &#163;500,000 from Class IX, Vote 1 to the Challenge Fund publicity campaign.

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about Child Support Agency deductions from earnings orders and cases with arrears.
<BR>
The imposition of a deduction from earnings order is considered when the absent parent defaults on an agreement or refuses to come to an agreement. This step is taken as a last resort and every effort is made to secure the compliance of the absent parent before a deduction from earnings order is issued. From April 1998 to 30 November 1997 the number of deduction from earnings orders issued are as follows:
<BR>
1993-94: 2,600
<BR>
1994-95: 32,027
<BR>
1995-96: 52,931
<BR>
1996-97: 57,898
<BR>

<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>23 Feb 1998 : Column: 121</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
We are increasingly becoming more effective in issuing deduction from earnings orders where the absent parent fails to make a maintenance payment or reach an agreement for repayment.
<BR>
Information on the number of appeals against deductions from earnings orders is only available from April 1996, as are the number of successful appeals to Magistrate and Sheriff courts. From April 1996 to November 1997, of 103,171 deductions from earnings orders issued, 330 appeals were received 138 of which were successful.
<BR>
You have also asked for details of accounts with live assessments with arrears and details are available from the Agency's Financial Management System. These can be split into those cases with full maintenance assessments and those with interim maintenance assessments. As at 31st January 1998, 286,437 cases with full maintenance assessments had arrears and 65,182 cases with interim maintenance assessments had arrears.
<BR>
The House of Commons Library Report is intended to provide information on the performance of those activities which are considered key to the operation of the Agency. There are no plans at present to include further information.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about Mrs. Preston of Stockport and her claim for Disability Living Allowance (DLA).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DLA decisions are largely made on the basis of self reporting by the disabled person, that is on the judgment of those best placed to know the practical effects of their disabilities. Entitlement depends not on the fact that a person has a particular disability but on the day to day effects of that condition and the care and mobility needs that arise.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mrs. Preston's claim was looked at again as part of the Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) which is a programme of postal enquiries and home visits to seek up to date information about the care and mobility needs of DLA customers receiving the Higher Rate

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mobility Component with either the Middle or Highest Rate Care Component. This sort of enquiry is routine in most benefits. It does not necessarily mean an award will be changed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Mrs. Preston was in receipt of the highest rates of both components of DLA a visit was arranged and took place on 27 November 1997, where a questionnaire was completed. The information gathered from the visit was passed to an officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State who felt that there may have been a relevant change in Mrs. Preston's night time needs which could affect entitlement. The case was subsequently passed to an Adjudication Officer (AO) who made a decision to reduce the entitlement on review.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is the responsibility of AOs in each individual case to determine awards. Neither Ministers nor departmental officials can alter or influence an AO's decision. The correct procedures have been followed, therefore disciplinary action is inappropriate.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A request for a review of the decision to reduce Mrs. Preston's entitlement to DLA was received on 18 December 1997. In support of the review application, the local CAB provided more detailed information about Mrs. Preston's need for care at night. A different AO, from the one who had decided to reduce Mrs. Preston's benefit, took advice from a Benefits Agency Medical Officer who advised that it was unlikely that Mrs. Preston's needs would have decreased despite what was recorded in the questionnaire completed on 27 November 1997. The AO decided to re-instate benefit from 27 November 1997 on review. On 9 February 1998 Mrs. Preston was notified in person of the revised decision. This step was taken to minimise any delay and anxiety to Mrs. Preston following the further investigation into her case.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a number of measures in place to ensure that the decisions made by an AO are of a high standard. AOs can seek the advice of medically qualified personnel who can offer advice. A statistically valid sample of AO decisions is checked by an independent discrete team who report their findings to Benefits Agency managers and to the Chief Adjudication Officer. This is part of an ongoing process designed to maintain adjudication standards. Anyone whose benefit is reduced or disallowed is entitled to request a review by another AO, who will consider all available evidence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customers suffering from certain conditions will not be contacted as part of BIP. These include customers suffering from a terminal illness where life expectancy is likely to be under six months, quadriplegics, paraplegics, people who are both deaf and blind, double amputees and those within the definition of severe mental impairment. All efforts are taken to avoid contact in regard to the BIP exercise with customers in these categories.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To improve confidence in decisions on cases made by the BIP, an additional safeguard has been introduced from 9 February 1998. No decision to reduce or remove entitlement as a result of BIP will be taken on the basis of the claimant's statement alone, there will always be additional evidence to support the decision.</FONT></UL>

<a name="80223w34.html_para1"><i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Mr. David Winnick, dated 19 February 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about Miss A. Steed (DB502640).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Motability is an independent body which helps recipients of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) higher rate mobility component to use their benefit to obtain a car on the best possible terms, either on lease, or through a hire purchase agreement. It is a requirement of the Motability Scheme that a disabled person or their representative/appointee who wishes to obtain a car, must have an award of higher rate mobility component that will run throughout the period of the leasing or hire purchase agreement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would point out that the Adjudication authorities award DLA higher rate mobility component on the basis of whether the customer satisfies the medical conditions for the benefit. This principle equally applies to the duration of an award of DLA and the adjudicating authorities are not influenced by external factors, such as the qualifying conditions for entering into a Motability agreement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Motability Scheme is an independent body, the Benefits Agency would not have seen Miss A. Steed to assess the renewal of the Motability Scheme or the decision to end the Motability Scheme. The Department is not directly involved in operational issues concerning the Motability Scheme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If a review is requested within three months of the Adjudication Officer's decision being notified the decision can be reviewed on any grounds. If the review request is received outside the three months period a review can only take place on limited grounds, such as the decision being erroneous in law, based on a mistake, given in ignorance of a material fact or a relevant change in circumstances. Miss A. Steed asked for a review of her daughter's entitlement in April 1997 on the grounds that she wished to enter into a further agreement with Motability. Her daughter's case was passed to another Adjudication Officer who could not find any grounds to review the previous award.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will list the properties and land owned by her Department which she has identified as surplus to requirements, giving in each case their estimated value. [30322]<P>

 Final decisions on surplus properties and land have been taken only on three Benefits Agency outlets: Bishopsgate House in Manchester and the Todmorden and Eccles offices. These were closed in March 1997 with services provided through alternative outlets. Information about the estimated value of surplus properties and land is commercially confidential and has therefore not been included.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans she has to allow the disabled to continue to receive benefits when at work, while paying an increased level of tax.  [30922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80223w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are committed to modernising the Social Security system so that it helps people to work as far as they are able; provides appropriate support to those who cannot work; and makes the most effective use of the resources available. We want to encourage people who are disabled, or who have long-term health problems, to play a full part in society and to help them to help themselves wherever that is possible. This means being positive about people's abilities and their capacity, rather than negative about their disabilities and incapacity.
<P>

<a name="80223w35.html_para0">The main benefit available to contribute to the extra costs of disability for disabled people of working age, whether or not in work, is Disability Living Allowance.
<P>

<a name="80223w35.html_para1">No decisions have been made about any changes to benefits for disabled persons. When we have identified specific proposals we will consult disabled people, their organisations and others with an interest. We will not make any changes without consulting on them.

 All children are entitled to the financial and emotional support of both parents wherever they may live. Where benefit is not in payment it is already open to parents to make voluntary financial arrangements for their children. The Child Support Agency will become involved only where one or both parents so wish.
<P>
