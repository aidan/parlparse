It is a key element of the Government's pay policy that a proportion of the pay of Civil Servants is performance related. MOD meets this requirement by awarding one off, non-consolidated and non-pensionable bonuses which very clearly reward performance in any given year rather than by increasing base pay which has a consolidated on-going effect even if performance later tails off.

turning specifically to bonuses for Senior Civil Servants, the policy framework for awarding them to members of the Senior Civil Service is set by the Cabinet Office. MOD is responsible for implementing its own pay and bonus arrangements within this framework through an agreed pay strategy. Any bonus award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers and they are awarded to those individuals judged to have made the highest in-year contribution to MOD business objectives. There is no restriction on the nature of the contribution; the only requirement is that it benefits the Department or Defence more widely. Recommendations for bonuses&#151;which are considered by moderation committees&#151;must be linked to demonstrable evidence of delivery. Up to 70 per cent. of staff may receive a bonus and only 10 per cent. of those assessed as making the greatest contribution may receive a high category bonus.</p>

They are expected to deliver substantial benefits to the Department both in terms of outputs, delivering change programmes and skills transfer. As with the rest of the SCS the bonuses paid to those on Fixed Term Appointments are non-consolidated and non-pensionable.

On the basis of field assessments (including on foot to areas along the Indian border) in Paletwa, Matubi and Tanhtlang townships, UNDP has identified 80 villages housing around 27,500 people (6 per cent. of the total population of the State) that have been severely or partially affected by the rodent infestation.

 The Secretary of State has not had direct discussions with the United Nations on the subject of child labour. The Department for International Development (DFID) relies on, and provides support to, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) within the UN system to help countries implement core labour standards that include the elimination of child labour. DFID is also working with the ILO and civil society organisations to promote efforts to remove children from all hazardous labour. DFID has a &#163;20 million partnership framework for 2006-2009 with the ILO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80910w0011.htm_para5"><a name="08091018000197">DFID has no direct involvement with issues of child labour in heavy industries <i> (a)</i> or aluminium factories <i> (b).</i> With regard to mining <i> (c),</i> DFID supports and currently chairs the Communities and Small scale Mining (CASM) initiative. This is a network that includes mining communities and artisanal miners themselves as well as international experts. The network is based in the World Bank HQ in Washington DC and is active in Africa, Asia-Pacific, and South and Central America. As one of the four central themes of its work, Communities and Small-scale Mining (CASM) includes a focus on children working in dangerous and hazardous conditions in small-scale mining. CASM fully recognizes the extent and nature of child labour and is committed to its elimination from the mining industry.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not provide bilateral development assistance to Iran. Support to Afghan refugees in Iran is channelled through multilateral organisations, namely the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the European Commission (EC).

In particular, the Government are promoting healthy lifestyles to children and young people through the national healthy schools programme. The programme uses a whole school/whole child approach to health. Schools achieving healthy schools status have to satisfy criteria under four core themes: Physical Activity; Healthy Eating; Personal, Social, Health and Economics education; and Emotional Health and Well-Being. Currently, 65 per cent. of schools have achieved healthy schools status and in total nine out of 10 schools are participating in this voluntary programme.</p>

Through this comprehensive strategy we aim to enable everyone to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Everyone has a part to play and the strategy sets out a vision of what this means for schools, the food industry, employers, health services, local authorities and central Government to play their part in helping children, young people and their families to make healthy choices in food and physical activity. The initial focus is on children, and by 2020 the Government aim to reduce the proportion of overweight and obese children to 2000 levels.</p>

Following the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement in July 2007, we have an increased focus on engaging all children and young people in PE and sport with an ambition of providing up to five hours of PE and sport a week for all five to 16-year-olds, and three hours for young people aged 16-19. This ambition includes a drive to secure full participation in at least two hours of PE or sport as part of the working school day, combined with effective signposting to further physical activity opportunities outside of school.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. The coverage of the breast screening programme is the proportion of women resident and eligible that have had a test with a recorded result at least once in the previous 3 years.<br>
2. Coverage of the screening programme is currently best assessed using the 53-64 age group as women may be first called at any time between their 50th and 53rd birthdays.<br>
3. The breast screening programme covers women aged 50-64 but it was extended to invite women aged 65-70 in April 2001.<br>
4. The last unit began inviting women aged 65-70 in April 2006 and full coverage should be achieved by 2008-09.<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> This is the number of women in the resident population less those with recall ceased for clinical reasons.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Data for 2003 to 2006 have been aggregated to match current PCO boundaries and need to be treated as estimates. Data before 2003 are for health authority areas and are not directly comparable.<br>
<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. National policy for the cervical screening programme is that eligible women aged 25 to 64 should be screened every three or five years (women aged 25 to 49 are screened every three years, those aged 50 to 64 every five years).<br>
2. Data prior to 2002 are estimates, original data were based on last test with a result, not last adequate test (as used currently) and have been adjusted to allow for this.<br>
3. Data prior to 1999 has been revised from published data, to not exclude from the eligible population (denominator) women whose recall was ceased due to age or other non-clinical reasons.<br>

 The latest research by the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre shows that although practices in deprived areas have slightly higher exception rates for patients than practices in affluent areas, deprivation related variation in reported quality of care for measured activities reduced during the first three years of the quality outcomes framework resulting in more equitable delivery of health care for these activities.</p>

The GDC is responsible for the regulation of dentists and dental care professionals (DCPs) including dental hygienists. The GDC&#146;s rules currently require that dental hygienists work to a treatment plan prepared by a dentist. However, in the spring, the GDC issued a consultation paper on the scope of practice of DCPs which invited comments on what additional training would be required to allow dental hygienists to see patients directly.

1. The figures for 2007-08 are based on the average number of working days lost per member of staff due to sickness absence in that year, the average salary of staff at the middle of the year (September 2007) and the number of staff at the middle of the year (September 2007). Figures for 2006-07 and 2005 use the same average salaries and numbers of staff, but actual working days lost for the year in question. The use of average salaries will overestimate payments and expenditure since more senior (more highly paid) staff take less sickness absence than more junior (lower paid) staff, based on analysis of absence by grade in 2007-08.<br>
2. The change from calendar years to financial years between 2005 and 2006 represents a change in Cabinet Office sickness absence reporting periods. Information is not available for years before 2005.<br>
3. Providing information for other bodies reporting to the Department would incur disproportionate costs.<br>

Tier 1 refers to services provide by non-specialist drug services, e.g. accident and emergency departments and social care agencies. Tier 2 refers to open-access drug treatment and does not always include a care plan. Tier 3 refers to treatment, with a structured care plan, taken in the community and Tier 4 refers to residential drug treatment.</p>

 Under the national General Medical Services contract general practitioner practices are intended to receive income based on a weighted capitation, needs-based formula. However, the impact of the minimum practice income guarantee negates much of the agreed equitable funding incentive that rewards practices based on patients needs. That is why we remain committed to delivering a fair funding system to all primary medical care contractors.</p>

 No estimate has been made of the cost to the national health service of ending charges for car parking at all NHS hospitals.

 Vioxx (rofecoxib) was one of a group of anti-inflammatory medicines known as COX-2 selective inhibitors. It was licensed in the United Kingdom and many other countries for the treatment of arthritic conditions&#151;osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis&#151;and also for the short-term treatment of some painful conditions. COX-2 selective inhibitors are effective anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving medicines that are thought to have less risk of gastrointestinal side effects, for example stomach ulcers, than conventional anti-inflammatory medicines.</p>

The product information for healthcare professionals and patients, which lists all the known side effects of the medicine, was updated on a number of occasions to better reflect its cardiovascular safety, in accordance with CSM's advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80910w0031.htm_para8"><a name="08091018004294">Data are not available on which to base a valid estimate of the number of people with increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and other adverse cardiovascular effects that may have been associated with Vioxx and other COX-2 inhibitors. The underlying medical condition of many patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors means that they are already at higher risk of heart attack and stroke than the rest of the population, and it is not possible to calculate the impact of the COX-2 inhibitor on this risk. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to determine the rate at which cardiovascular risk reduces after cessation of treatment with Vioxx, but there is evidence from one study suggesting that the risk wanes after cessation of therapy, although the exact time course for the reduction in risk is uncertain, and it is not possible to exclude persistence of risk for several months after treatment has stopped.</p>

been carefully and intensively assessed in the UK and Europe. The latest evidence suggests that both NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are effective painkilling anti-inflammatory treatments but might pose a small increased risk of heart attacks or strokes, although the exact level of risk may vary between medicines. The MHRA has widely communicated the latest information and advice for healthcare professionals in letters and bulletins, and other publications through liaison with the British National Formulary and National Prescribing Centre. In addition, product information for healthcare professionals and patient information leaflets have been updated in order to support informed decision-making in relation to the choice of anti-inflammatory medicine.</p>

 No specific meetings or discussions have been held between Ministers in this Department and universities about the Gallagher Review. The Research Councils are responsible for providing funding for research at universities, including energy related research and post graduate training. The councils are considering the outcome of the review and will use the review to guide the development and support for research related to biofuels. For instance, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) bioenergy strategy shares many of the conclusions of the Gallagher Review by placing importance on basic science underpinning second generation biofuels, such as those that can utilise marginal land or crop residues or non-food crops.</p>

 Borrowers are liable to begin repaying their student loans from the April after they finish or leave their course. Student loans borrowers with income-contingent loans, which were introduced in 1998, repay at a rate of 9 per cent. of earnings above &#163;15,000 per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80910w0035.htm_para5"><a name="08091018004833">Those earning less than &#163;15,000 are not required to repay. Repayments are collected through the tax system, usually by employers, in the same way as income tax and National Insurance contributions and are therefore automatically deducted. Therefore borrowers covered by the PAYE UK tax system are not able to get into arrears. Self employed borrowers make repayments through the self assessment system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80910w0035.htm_para6"><a name="08091018004834">Borrowers with the older mortgage-style loans repay over a fixed term whenever their income exceeds the repayment threshold, usually through direct debits. The threshold for mortgage-style loans is 85 per cent. of national average earnings, &#163;25,287 from 1 September 2007. Borrowers who demonstrate that their income is below the threshold and for whom the Student Loans Company (SLC) has agreed a deferment of repayment will not make any repayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="80910w0035.htm_para9"><a name="08091018004851">The income-contingent loan scheme is still relatively young; the first cohort of borrowers completing three year courses became liable to begin repaying in April 2002 if their income was above the repayment threshold. Therefore a higher proportion of borrowers are new graduates, who will be new to the labour market, than will be the case in steady state. The figures also reflect the time delay of up to 18 months between graduates starting to repay, and when information on the repayments they have made is available to SLC. This is because repayments are made through the tax system. HMRC receives an annual P14 return from employers, setting out the deductions they have made in the past year, and passes on this information to SLC to update borrowers' accounts. Despite the inevitable time lags, collecting student loans through the tax system remains the most efficient and cost-effective method.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80910w0035.htm_para10"><a name="08091018004852">The vast majority of income-contingent borrowers who are not repaying (84 per cent. of those not repaying) earn below the &#163;15,000 threshold and are not therefore required to make any repayments. Repayments for a further 16 per cent. have not yet started because details are still being matched with employer's records or other information that is being collected.</p>

The Student Loans Company has arrangements in place for repayments to be scheduled from borrowers living overseas and these borrowers are made aware of the methods of repayment available to them. Effective collection across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the SLC to obtain judgements in UK courts, which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries.</p>

Therefore a higher proportion of borrowers are new graduates, who will be new to the labour market, than will be the case in steady state. The figures also reflect the time delay of up to 18 months between graduates starting to repay, and when information on the repayments they have made is available to SLC. This is because repayments are made through the tax system. HMRC receives an annual P14 return from employers, setting out the deductions they have made in the past year, and passes on this information to SLC to update borrowers' accounts. Despite the inevitable time lags, collecting student loans through the tax system remains the most efficient and cost-effective method.</p>

 No specific assessment has been made of the effectiveness of theatre and drama participation in improving the behaviour of violent offenders.

 The Government are keen to ensure that the electoral process is accessible to all electors. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 extends the duty placed on local authorities to review polling places to ensure that as far as is reasonable and practicable they are accessible for electors with disabilities. Under the Act, local authorities must carry out a full review of polling places at least every four years, and representations can be made to the Electoral Commission in respect of reviews carried out by local authorities. Further, the returning officer for an election must now provide at every polling station an enlarged hand-held sample copy of the ballot paper for the assistance of voters who are partially sighted. The Government also provide grant assistance to local authorities of up to 50 per cent. of the cost of temporary ramps to improve access to buildings which may need them for the purpose of elections.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many incidents involving violence or the threat of violence by prisoners have been recorded as motivated by racial or religious prejudice in each prison in England and Wales in each of the last 10 years for which figures are available; what the nature of the incident was in each case; and what measures he has put in place to reduce such occurrences.

 Information on the number of incidents involving violence or the threat of violence by prisoners which have been recorded as motivated by racial or religious prejudice is not held centrally and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="80910w0045.htm_para0"><a name="0809111001173">Ministers and the National Offender Management Service are committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy. This policy has recently been revised and from mid 2007 applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="80910w0045.htm_para1"><a name="0809111001174">The national Cell Sharing Risk Assessment measure was introduced in June 2002 in response to the death of Zahid Mubarek who was murdered by his cell-mate. The measure assists staff in assessing the risk a prisoner could pose to another prisoner in shared accommodation, based on the information that accompanies the prisoner and through a prisoner interview. The initial assessment will trigger a risk minimisation plan for those identified as high or medium risk followed by a review process.</p>

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) has offered or paid a full or interim payment to over 96 per cent. of eligible people who have applied for compensation for the 7/7 bombings.

<i>  [holding answer 14 July 2008]: </i>Information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level.</p>

CLG's quarterly homelessness Statistical Release refers to these duties as &#147;the main homelessness duties&#148; and relevant applicants are recorded as &#147;homeless acceptances&#148;.</p>

If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available, and the data submitted include &#145;snapshot&#146; information on the number of households in temporary accommodation at the end of each quarter. The PIE return does not include information on other forms of homelessness, for example rough sleeping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="80910w0047.htm_para6"><a name="0809111001502">The data validation process typically takes around six weeks, after which estimates for missing data are calculated.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government if she will re-examine the appropriateness of the level of registration fee charged under the independent Safeguarding Authorities scheme; and on what basis the present fee was calculated. [221540]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="80910w0048.htm_para0"><a name="0809111001810">The Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) Scheme is a new mandatory work force vetting scheme set up under the auspices of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 to improve protection for children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="80910w0048.htm_para1"><a name="0809111001811">This scheme, which replaces some existing work force checking procedures, will come into operation in October 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="80910w0048.htm_para2"><a name="0809111001812">The application fees referred to are additional to the existing Disclosure Service fees charged by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). It is envisaged that the total fee will be charged to users of the service by CRB, with a pass through of this element to ISA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="80910w0048.htm_para3"><a name="0809111001813">As a self-funding service, the proposed additional fee chargeable to users of the scheme has been calculated to recover the full economic costs of the service over the first 54 months of operation, based on the estimate of paying users. Fee levels have been calculated to fully fund the scheme but not to return a profit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="80910w0048.htm_para4"><a name="0809111001814">All employed applicants, whether in part-time or full-time employment and regardless of salary level, will be expected to pay to be checked to ensure that they do not pose a risk to vulnerable groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="80910w0048.htm_para5"><a name="0809111001815">Applicants will be required to pay a one-off fee of &#163;64 at point of initial application to join the scheme.

a current UK average water consumption of 153 litres per person per day. The three levels set in the code of 120, 105 and 80 litres per person per day were developed after various scenarios were tested by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) to illustrate the levels which should be achievable using various different combinations of technologies and approaches. The calculation for the scenarios is based upon usage assumptions within the Code Water Calculator, developed by the Water Research Council (WRC). The exemplary Code level 5/6 standard is demanding and requires significant change to specifications of fixtures and fittings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="80910w0049.htm_para0"><a name="0809111001821">The basis for the establishment of the 125 litres per person per day standard was the consultation undertaken by the Government in 2007 on water efficiency in new dwellings. Respondents strongly supported the introduction of a whole building performance standard within Building Regulations, which would allow flexibility in the choice of appliances, while still reducing water consumption. The 125 litres standard, which will be introduced through an amendment to Part G of the building regulation (Water Efficiency) in 2009, is in line with the Code Level 1/2 (120 litres per head per day) and uses a simplified version of the Code Water Calculator but includes a small allowance (five litres) for external water use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="80910w0049.htm_para1"><a name="0809111001822">Building to the Code for Sustainable Homes is not mandatory and the Government have made no assessment of the likely water efficiency levels of homes in 2021 as a result of its use. All new homes will need to meet the Part G water efficiency standard following its coming into force in 2009, subject to the relevant transitional arrangements.</p>

 The MCA&#146;s Hope Cove general purpose boat was introduced in 1993 to provide a search and rescue asset covering Hope Cove and neighbouring Bigbury Bay areas. The role of the boat was to support first line assets in a waterborne rescue capacity. However, since the Salcombe RNLI lifeboat was installed in 2003, that role has changed. The Salcombe lifeboat operates extensively in the Hope Cove and Bigbury Bay areas and the need for the Hope Cove boat to fulfil a rescue support role has subsequently diminished. This is especially true now that the RNLI have upgraded their boat at Bantham to carry out rescues in the Hope Cove area. The Bantham boat is capable of reaching Hope Cove in less time (under six minutes) than the MCA&#146;s general purpose boat.</p>

Furthermore, within the new recording system, the instrument used is linked to an occurrence which may contain one or more crimes.
