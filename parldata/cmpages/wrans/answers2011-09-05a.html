               <i>[holding answer 19 July 2011]:</i> Staff hospitality is defined as the provision of food and drink for meetings. I refer the hon. Member to my answer of 1 February 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> column 745W, which outlined spending from May to December 2010. From January to June 2011, provisional records estimate that £21,262 was spent.</p>

               <a name="1109062000235"> This compares with a comparable spend of £456,142 in 2009-10 under the last Administration. There has thus been a considerable reduction in spending as a consequence of cost-saving initiatives introduced under the new Government.</p>

This is because the London Fire Brigade expects to move into the building at the end of this year and will take over the running costs except for the rent during this period. The Department has also taken steps to reduce facilities management costs by 25 per cent through renegotiating the contract and utilities costs by 35 per cent through reduced usage in all the buildings.</p>

Our preference is for fire and rescue services to use the centres, as they are highly resilient and built for this purpose. We have already reached agreement with the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority to take over the control centre in Merton. The London Fire Brigade intends to move in later this year and will take over the running costs at that point. Those fire and rescue services hoping to move into the buildings are not expected to begin contributing to the rent during the period in question. Where we cannot reach agreement for fire and rescue services to move in, we are actively seeking suitable tenants for them. This will further reduce costs.</p>

 As unfunded schemes, neither the Firefighters' Pension Scheme 1992, nor the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme 2006, have any assets. The 2007 actuarial valuation of the two fire pension schemes found that the total liability for all accrued benefits was £13.8 billion as at 31 March 2007. Of this, current members of the Firefighters Pension Scheme 1992 accounted for £6.4 billion and pensions in payment for former members accounted for £6.9 billion. The remainder applied to members with deferred benefits, pensions in payment for dependents. The actuarial liability of the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme 2006 was valued at £0.0 billion in 2007.</p>

To 2015, the UK plans to support almost 3,000 community level Health Extension Workers who are providing a package of preventative and basic curative services to more than 7 million people in rural communities across the country.</p>

 Operators would be required to demonstrate competence and attend an approved training course in order to obtain a licence to carry out culling.

Additional marksmanship training and assessment would be required for those who may have experience but no formal qualification.

 Control policies for dealing with exotic disease are developed and reviewed in close partnership with delivery agents, core groups of stakeholders and specialists. This ensures they are proportionate and evidence based within the framework of European and national law. Our contingency plans for dealing with outbreaks, if they occur, are regularly reviewed. Plans are regularly tested at local and national level, working closely with delivery partners and industry. We closely monitor outbreaks of high impact disease around the world and assess the risk to the UK. All of these measures rely very much on vigilance by farmers and animal keepers in identifying and reporting possible disease. Monitoring animals for signs of disease and following good biosecurity and hygiene practices are essential ways of reducing risk of disease in the first place and then preventing spread.

 We would expect around 1,000 to 1,500 badgers to be culled in a 150km<sup>(2)</sup> area over four years. This is based on data available from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). The total number of badgers culled will depend on the number of licences issued, and the size of area being culled. The number of licences issued will be limited to a maximum of 10 per year. Natural England will work with licence co-ordinators to assess the badger population in the control area and will set an upper limit on the percentage of the estimated badger population that may be killed each year in each control area.</p>

 The average effects seen during and post culling in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) can be used to estimate the average net effect of culling over different sized areas over a nine year period (average five years' culling and four year post cull period). For example, the estimated average net benefit of culling over an area of 150 km<sup>(2)</sup> and the surrounding 2 km ring is a 16.0% reduction in confirmed TB incidence (95% confidence interval: 7.9% reduction to 24.2% reduction), equating to the prevention of 47 cattle herd breakdowns. What is seen in reality will vary greatly depending on local conditions including the size of the area, local background incidence of TB, the relative contribution that badgers make to the disease and the degree to which the culled area is surrounded by barriers or buffers to minimise the perturbation effect. Any estimates of overall beneficial effect are illustrative for a defined set of circumstances.</p>

 The only two culling methods that we are proposing to permit are cage-trapping and shooting and controlled shooting, on the basis that they are both considered to be humane. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) provided evidence on the humaneness of cage-trapping and shooting. No badgers were injured but not killed in this trial. Controlled shooting was not part of the RBCT, but has been effective in controlling other wild animal populations such as deer and foxes. This method has not been used to date in any trial or field test on badgers, which is why (if the Government decide to proceed with the policy following the current consultation) we intend to pilot it in two areas, to test our assumptions about its effectiveness (at removing badgers) and humaneness. These pilots would be overseen by an independent panel of scientific experts.</p>

 There is no reason to believe that controlled shooting will have any greater effect on perturbation than cage trapping and shooting.

 The Government's TB control programme is focused on reducing the incidence of TB in cattle (and other vulnerable livestock) across the whole of England. The proposed badger control policy aims to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle in areas with a reservoir of disease in badgers and where infection is cycling between the species. In such areas the transmission risks can be reduced by badger culling and/or badger vaccination. In areas without a reservoir of disease in badgers, the main TB risk is from cattle movements. DEFRA's recently published “TB Eradication Programme for England” outlines a comprehensive range of cattle measures to address bovine TB which remain the cornerstone of our efforts to control the disease right across the country.</p>

 The Rapid Response Forum, which is a body of senior officials, will respond to particular crises as and when they occur or threaten to occur. It is thus not possible to say in advance what measures might be considered, since particular measures are likely to be relevant to some situations and not others. However, the action plan agreed by G20 Agriculture Ministers provides for further work on the relationship between biofuels production and the response of agriculture to price increase and volatility, and I expect the results of that work to be available to the forum in due course.</p>

 The results of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) showed that incidence of TB in cattle on land immediately surrounding the culling area had a temporary increase, which then tailed off. With the latest post-trial analysis showing that 12-18 months after culling stopped the level of TB in cattle in the surrounding area was compatible with the survey-only areas. This is thought to be due to the disruption of the organisation of badger social groups, called perturbation, causing remaining badgers to range more widely. However, measures can be put in place to mitigate the negative effects seen in the surrounding area, including making use of barriers such as coastlines and major rivers, to limit badger movement. Vaccination could also be used to mitigate the negative effects of culling. Our proposal (on which we are currently consulting) therefore requires participants to take reasonable, proportionate and appropriate measures to minimise the risk of potential negative effects.</p>

 In the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), an average five years of proactive culling over 100 sq km was associated with an average 23.2% decrease in confirmed TB incidence in the culled area, and an average 24.5% increase in the surrounding 2 km-wide ring of land, relative to survey-only areas.</p>

Of this, 3.1% was being held by the PO itself on behalf of its members as a collective asset, 5.5% on behalf of individual active members of the PO, 4.4% held on behalf of vessel agents or salesmen, 2.0% held as part of Community Quota Schemes and 3.5% on behalf of other types of owner.</p>

 Although Government Buying Standards (GBS) will only be mandatory for central Government, GBS is also being promoted to the wider public sector including local authorities, who control procurement in many public bodies care homes and schools. There is a balance to be struck between the need to ensure food procured by the public sector is healthier and more sustainable and the need for local public sector bodies to make their own decisions on how best to spend the public money that they are allocated. Given the current financial pressures on all public expenditure it is essential that the measures are affordable and deliver real benefits in terms of sustainability and improved nutrition.</p>

               <a name="1109066000587"> There are many examples of public bodies finding good, healthy and sustainable food, that is no more expensive, right on their doorstep and I know that many people would like to see this happen more. In keeping with the Government's localism approach, we want to give people and communities power to make changes on issues like this that are important to them. We would like to see all public sector bodies procuring at least to GBS standards and we will encourage them to do so. But many people want to go further than this, and our approach to public sector procurement has been designed to support them. We want local people to be able to express their own preferences and for their voices to be heard.</p>

 We have made initial commitments to fund some community activity for Muck In4Life in 2011-12, but have not made any commitments on any other element of the Change4Life campaign over the next four years as this would be led by the Department of Health. It is possible that some further funding may be available in the future, but in keeping with the principles of big society and the commitments of the Natural Environment White Paper we will be looking to promote Muck In4Life using partner networks and sponsorship.</p>

               <b>Mr Paice:</b>
 Under the EU Plant Health Directive, the UK implements a series of measures to prevent the entry of plant pests and diseases. These include the requirement to inspect plant imports and for consignments of plants to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate. These certificates confirm that the exporting country has attested to the health of the plants and that they meet the EU's import requirements. Despite this regime of inspection and other statutory requirements, there are frequent findings of pests and diseases in imports both from within and outside the EU. The weaknesses of the current regime in providing adequate protection for the UK and other member states from plant pests and disease has prompted a review of the EU's plant health regime, which we are actively supporting.</p>

               <a name="1109066000766"> The UK and other member states are pressing for improved controls so that import inspections are focused on trades presenting the highest risks, and so that new trades, particularly those involving plants for planting, are subject to assessment of risk in advance of import. Other issues, such as the tightening of the concession which allows travellers to import limited quantities of plants and plant material for personal use are also under consideration. We anticipate these will be consulted on next year after the EU publishes its draft proposals for change.</p>

               <a name="1109066000767"> To strengthen controls at our borders, there is also a programme of research at the Food and Environment Research Agency to improve methods of detection of pests in consignments of plants. This includes the development of quick test kits to detect the DNA of plant pathogens and the use of acoustic technology to detect insect larvae within the stems of plants.</p>

The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague) asked my noble Friend Baroness Warsi, Minister without Portfolio, to represent the UK. Her presence at the event (which she also attended on behalf of the Government in July 2010) underlines the importance the UK attaches to marking the anniversary, to honouring the victims and to expressing sympathy with their friends and families. In addition, the Prime Minister issued a statement marking the occasion. He reiterated his conviction that the world must never again allow such atrocities to occur unopposed.</p>

The region is a substantial net importer of wheat and heavily subsidises consumption. Food price inflation was one contributory factor to the Tunisian and Egyptian unrest, and fuelled discontent across the region. Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt have all reassured citizens that food and commodity subsidies will be maintained amidst the recent unrest. Although allowing Governments to quell immediate discontent, this brings significant fiscal constraints, shoring up problems for the future. We believe Governments need to adopt sustainable economic and targeted social protection policies which deliver long-term benefits for the development of their societies and prospects for their people. Putting these policies in place will need to be carefully sequenced over time especially given the very high expectations of people to see tangible benefits from reforms.</p>

 We are actively seeking to identify women's groups and individuals and to engage with them on the future of Libya and their involvement in its development. I chaired a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Eye Witness event on 1 July 2011 with non-governmental organisations and women from both Libya and Tunisia, at which there was discussion of specific issues faced by women in those countries and consideration of the future. We are following up on that event.</p>

 We worked closely with partners in the UN Security Council to ensure that the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) was given a Chapter VII mandate and that an adequate number of troops were authorised. UNMISS will consist of up to 7,000 troops and 900 civilian police, as recommended by the UN Secretary-General. We will actively work to support the mandate and have encouraged the Government of South Sudan to do the same. The budget for UNMISS has yet to be agreed. When it is, the UK will contribute just over 8% of the total, as it does for all UN peacekeeping missions.</p>

Construction of 269 replacement service families' accommodation, costing £75 million, is due to be completed at Akrotiri by 2016. Decompression facilities are kept under constant review, with the most recent developments being a welfare facility providing accommodation, a briefing area, gym, wi-fi, bar and stage. We are considering further areas where amenities can be enhanced for troops returning from operations. As with all projects these plans are subject to funding.

 The Typhoon future capabilities programme is planned to provide enhancements to Typhoon in the air-to-air and air-to-ground roles. The first stage in the development programme for Typhoon's new weapons capabilities is the future capability programme contract, which was signed in 2007. Further weapons upgrades are under consideration to enable Typhoon to employ a greater variety of air-to-ground munitions in future. Project information about Typhoon, including cost and time, is available in the Major Projects Report. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

 The estimated relative cost of operating the Typhoon Force from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Leuchars over a 25 year period, including the costs of transferring from Leuchars to Lossiemouth, is approximately £604 million and £565 million respectively. The costs were refined and updated during the course of the basing review, as is usual in such a process. They will be refined further during detailed planning for the implementation of the Defence basing decisions.</p>

 The Government are in the process of developing the detailed criteria that will be used in the new assessment to determine eligibility for personal independence payment. We are currently carrying out an informal consultation on the draft criteria to seek the views of disabled people and their organisations on how they will work and how they might be improved. We are also testing them by carrying out around 1,000 sample assessments over the summer. The testing will help us to better understand the likely effect of the criteria, including the effect on those vulnerable adults with low to moderate needs.

               <a name="1109069000522"> The term 'habitual residence' is not defined in social security legislation. This means that each case is considered on its own merits, in the light of the person's individual circumstances. In deciding whether a person is actually habitually resident, decision-makers consider a wide variety of factors. These include reasons for coming to the United Kingdom, the length of their stay, future intentions, previous links with the country and, in the case of people returning to the United Kingdom, the reasons for their absence. DWP guidance, based on case law, suggests that a period of between one and three months is likely to be appropriate to demonstrate that a person's residence is habitual in nature.</p>

 EU nationals take the same steps to claim contribution-based benefits as UK nationals. If an EU migrant worker's UK national insurance record is not sufficient to meet the contribution conditions for benefit, the UK will use their social insurance payments in another EU member state to help. EU law requires us to ask benefit claimants about whether they have worked elsewhere in Europe.</p>

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest £0.1 billion, and may not sum due to rounding.
2. Figures are consistent with those published following the 2011 Budget. Figures for 2010-11 are estimates and are subject to further revision.
3. Figures cover only benefits for which DWP and its predecessors had responsibility, and some elements of expenditure are no longer included in the figures due to being transferred to other Government Departments.
4. “Working age benefits” are assumed to include those paid specifically in respect of children—principally Child Benefit (up to 2002-03, after which it was transferred to HM Revenue and Customs).

 We have strict rules in place to prevent abuse of the benefit system by benefit tourism. One of the principal measures is the Habitual Residence Test. People coming from abroad can claim income-related benefits only if they have a right to reside and are habitually resident in the Common Travel Area<sup>(1)</sup>. Claimants are required to show that they are habitually resident in this country and have a settled intention to remain. Any exceptions (refugees, for example) are linked to the immigration status awarded by the Home Office.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000 individuals. Figures may not sum due to rounding.
2. People reaching state pension age from 6 April 2010 need 30 qualifying years for a full basic state pension. Men reaching state pension age before 6 April 2010 usually need 44 qualifying years for a full basic state pension. Women reaching state pension age before 6 April 2010 usually need 39 qualifying years for a full basic state pension.
3. Data are only available on contributions up to and including the 2008-09 tax year. People reaching state pension age in 2010-11 could also be awarded a qualifying year for the 2009-10 tax year. Hence the estimates in the table for the 2010-11 cohort are based on incomplete data.
4. Because of the increase in the state pension age for women born from 6 April 1950, fewer women reached state pension age in 2010-11 than in 2009-10.

As we know that the assessment process may prove stressful for some customers we have taken a number of steps to ensure those affected are fully informed of what will happen and how it may affect them. Jobcentre Plus write to claimants when their benefit becomes due for reassessment (prompted by the date that they would have been due a Personal Capability Assessment) to tell them about the changes. We also phone the customer shortly after this to check they have received the letter and that they understand what action they need to take, and to find out if they need any extra help.

 The Department has issued no guidance to the national health service on the treatment of pernicious anaemia. Professional guidance for general practitioners (GPs) is available from “Clinical Knowledge Summaries” and is summarised in a number of other sources readily accessible to patients and to professionals, including “NHS Choices”, the “Map of Medicine” and the website “Patient UK”. Current guidance advises GPs to monitor the response to treatment with Vitamin B12 after 10 days, and subsequently after eight weeks to confirm a normal blood count. Subsequent monitoring is generally regarded as unnecessary unless anaemia recurs.</p>

 The Care Quality Commission (CQC) does not have responsibility for second stage complaints (the independent review stage). In order to get resolution on concerns about care services, complainants should contact the provider in the first instance. If a complainant is unhappy with the response received from the provider, the complainant may then take their complaint to the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman for consideration.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Figures are provisional.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. Advertising spend is defined as covering only media spend (inclusive of agency commissions but excluding production costs, COI commission and VAT).
2. These figures do not include the Department's recruitment/classified advertising costs and ad hoc spend under £10,000. All figures are rounded to the nearest £10,000.
3. These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by NHS organisations, to supplement national campaigns in their area. While this expenditure has been excluded as far as possible so that this spreadsheet reflects central departmental spend, it would incur disproportionate cost to validate that every item of NHS expenditure has been removed.

<i>Notes</i>:
1. Advertising spend is defined as covering only media spend (inclusive of agency commissions but excluding production costs, Central Office of Information (COI) commission and VAT).
2. These figures do not include the Department's recruitment/classified advertising costs and ad hoc spend under £10,000. All figures are rounded to the nearest £10,000.
3. These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by national health service organisations, to supplement national campaigns in their area. While this expenditure has been excluded as far as possible so that this spreadsheet reflects central departmental spend, it would incur disproportionate cost to validate that every item of NHS expenditure has been removed.

 The Department operates standard contractual payment terms of 30 days and any payments that are delayed beyond that date may be subject to interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. The Act states that suppliers who are not paid within 30 days of the receipt of the invoice by the party billed are entitled to claim interest on the delayed payment at a rate of 8% above the Bank of England base reference rate. Penalty payments may be due where a small or medium sized business obtains a ruling that any contract terms that were applied were grossly unfair.</p>

 The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) originates from European regulations concerning the free movement of migrant workers around Europe, and it is likely that any charge to the citizen that is over and above the cost of producing the card would be seen as a barrier to citizens accessing their rights in Europe.</p>

               <a name="1109069001573"> The Department's ‘Guidance on Implementing the Overseas visitors Hospital Charging Regulations’, makes clear that hospitals are obliged to recover debts and should pursue them to whatever extent they consider reasonable in the circumstances. They have the option to write off debts when it would not be reasonable to pursue them, such as when the patient is genuinely without funds or has died, or attempts to secure the debt are unsuccessful. I understand that most hospitals choose to make use of debt recovery companies if initial attempts at recovery prove unsuccessful.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Episode duration (FCE bed days)
Episode duration is calculated as the difference in days between the episode start date and the episode end date, where both are given. Episode duration is based on FCEs and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated).
<sup>(2)</sup> Method of admission
This is the sum of the episode duration for all FCEs that ended within the financial year. This field does not include bed days where the episode was unfinished at the end of the financial year. To identify bed days as emergency bed days we have filtered the total bed days figures by admission method indicating the admission was an emergency (codes 21 to 24 and 28).
21 = Emergency: via Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) services, including the casualty department of the provider
22 = Emergency: via general practitioner (GP)
23 = Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau
24 = Emergency: via consultant out-patient clinic
28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider
<sup>(3)</sup> Assessing growth through time
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
<i>Note</i>:
Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English IMHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>Emergency readmissions are defined as emergency admissions within 28 days of discharge from hospital from a previous admission. The two admissions do not have to be for the same condition or at the same hospital. Episodes coded as maternity or mental health, or episodes with a diagnosis of cancer, are excluded. See the NCHOD website for further detail on the definitions.
<sup>(2 )</sup>Figures for different years are not directly comparable because of changes in case mix. For a comparable run of figures, standardised to adjust for differences in age, sex, method of admission, diagnosis and procedure see the detailed tables on the NCHOD website.

               <b>Mr Simon Burns:</b>
 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for licensing medicines in the United Kingdom. Since May 2010 five medicines containing new active substances were licensed by the MHRA for the UK only. Since January 2010 another 56 medicines containing new active substances were licensed in the European Union by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) through the centralised procedure to which the MHRA contributed by providing scientific expertise. When a medicine containing a new active substance is licensed it does not mean it automatically becomes available on the national health service.</p>

Existing data show that in the year ending March 2011 the number of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bloodstream infections decreased by 22% and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infections decreased by 15% on the year before. These are positive outcomes in this domain, and we expect improvements to occur across all five domains.</p>

 Implementation of the Organ Donation Taskforce recommendations has seen donor rates rise by around 28% since 2008 and over 18 million people—some 28% of the United Kingdom population—have registered on the Organ Donor Register. Work continues at a local, regional and national level to increase donor rates still further to the 50% by 2013 anticipated by the Organ Donation Taskforce.</p>

This will be achieved through a variety of means, including through the clinical leads for organ donation, donation committees and donation chairs in acute trusts driving improvement locally; regional collaboration to share learning and ongoing work to raise the profile and benefits of organ donation and transplantation with the national health service, professional groups and with the public.</p>

 In 2008, the independent Organ Donation Taskforce examined the case for moving to a system of presumed consent for organ donation. It recommended against it, concluding that while such a system might have the potential to deliver benefits, it would present significant difficulties which might not bring about the desired increase in organ donation rates. Action has been taken to strengthen the donation infrastructure and since the publication of the taskforce's report in 2008, organ donor rates have increased by around 28%. We need to give time for these improvements to work through fully and assess their success, before looking to change the system further.</p>

This was selected for inclusion on the basis that falls account for the majority of admissions to hospital for unintentional injury among older people, and so falls prevention is a key public health priority. The response to the consultation was, in general, very supportive of the broad concept of the outcomes framework, its breadth and the focus on life-course and health inequalities, which are both particularly relevant to the rates of falls in older people.

 It is good practice to involve patients and the public in the development of information products and many information producers have developed highly effective ways of doing this. The Department has sponsored the establishment of The Information Standard scheme, which awards a quality mark to organisations that can show they have robust processes for developing high quality information. Before awarding the quality mark the scheme tests, among other things, how an information producer works with its audience to identify and meet its needs.</p>

 ‘Real-time’ patient feedback is a general term for the use of a variety of approaches to capturing feedback from patients and service users at the point of care level—this can include hand-held devices, texting, kiosks, and comment cards. The 2011-12 Operating Framework for the national health service states that systems should be in place to capture the views and experiences of patients, service users and carers, and this will include the collection of real-time feedback.</p>

1. The latest year for which data are currently available is 2009.
2. Three -year average numbers have been provided as the annual numbers per PCT are small and may vary year on year just by chance.
3. Exact figures are not provided where the number of cases was less than five due to a risk of deductive disclosure of a patient's identity.
4. All cases include those with an unknown age, so numbers in adults and children may not add up to the total.
5. Numbers of cases in Kent are defined as those residing in one of the three PCTs in Kent (Eastern and Coastal Kent, Medway and West Kent).

However, an independent evaluation of how the scheme operates and customer experiences has been carried out and is informing the development of the future energy company obligation.

 It is important for the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, my right hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) to have the best understanding possible of likely future emissions trends. For this reason the Secretary of State often discusses the assumptions and drivers regarding emissions projections with officials and other stakeholders.

The likely sustained reductions in energy consumption are based on the combined impact of the installation of smart meters, in-home displays and our consumer engagement strategy . Our energy savings assumptions are based on reviews of available international evidence and further informed by trials carried out in Great Britain.</p>

 The Government published their Response to the Prospectus Consultation<sup>(1)</sup> on smart metering on 30 March 2011. This stated that suppliers should provide domestic consumers with an in-home display that meets the relevant technical specifications, but that in addition we would expect to see the development of options for consumers to access smart metering information in other ways, for instance through the internet, mobile phones or locally via a personal computer. There is also potential to communicate energy consumption information and advice on paper, on or with energy bills or via a separate communication.</p>

This provided evidence specific to the GB context on the effectiveness of ways of communicating with consumers. The report concludes that the combination of smart meters and Real Time Displays consistently resulted in energy savings of around 3% but with some higher and lower savings, depending on fuel, customer group and period. The EDRP found that savings from generic written advice and historic feedback resulted in a reduction in consumption of up to 5%.</p>

 The Government's impact assessment estimates that the roll-out of smart meters to the domestic sector will deliver a net benefit of almost £5.1 billion, leading to an average bill saving of £23 per household in 2020 and £42 in 2030. This reflects an estimated total gross cost of the programme of £10.8 billion, offset by more than £15.8 billion in gross benefits. These benefits include the direct savings to households as they are able to use energy more efficiently and the cost savings achieved by energy suppliers which are expected to be passed through to consumers.</p>

 The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, established in 2005, is responsible for tackling the UK's historic civil and military legacy. It is funded by a combination of direct Government grant, and commercial income. The following table sets out what the NDA has spent since its formation on completing its core mission, excluding commercial operations, alongside its projected spending for each year of the next spending review period. Due to the integration of many of civil and military historic legacy facilities, it is not possible to separate expenditure on civil and military decommissioning. The NDA's mission is to decommission the whole nuclear legacy estate as efficiently as possible, and the most effective approach is to treat it as a whole—irrespective of origin.</p>

 Coal provides a valuable role in the UK’s energy mix, providing diversity and security of supply. We cannot, however, sustain investment in new, wholly unabated coal if we are to meet our carbon targets. Fossil fuels with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can play a vital role in our future energy mix, helping to balance baseload nuclear and intermittent renewables. CCS is the only technology that can significantly reduce C02 emissions from fossil fuel power stations—by as much as 90%. That is why the Government are committed to providing public funding for four CCS demonstration plants.</p>

 The Department does not currently have any plans to assess the likely effect on traffic volumes at the Dartford Crossing of a new crossing to the west to link the North and South Circular Roads. However, the Department did make clear in its spending review announcement last autumn that it would embark on a review of the options for future capacity in the Lower Thames area.

It makes clear that we do not believe that mandatory re-testing is the best way forward.

The proposal was subsequently split into smaller interventions to assist delivery. Two agreements were signed in March 2010 for the operation of a net total of 18 additional carriages.

 The proportions of adults worried about burglary, car crime and violent crime in 2009-10 and 2010-11 are at their lowest since questions on this were introduced into the British Crime Survey. Police forces, working with local partners, are responsible for tackling crime—including concerns of the local elderly population. The Government are freeing up the police from bureaucracy and red tape to do so. We have given the public the information they need about local crime through crime maps, and are introducing a national non-emergency police number (101) to enable the public to contact the police more easily. These developments, together with neighbourhood policing teams, beat meetings and, in due course, elected police and crime commissioners, will ensure all sections of the community (including the elderly) can hold their force to account.</p>

               <a name="11090680000576"> The Prevent strategy aims to mitigate the threat of terrorist use of the internet by restricting access to unlawful online content in specific premises, such as schools, public libraries and other public buildings; and ensuring that action is taken to try to remove unlawful content from the internet. The legal framework for this is provided by sections 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006 (TACT).</p>

Members of the public who encounter terrorist or extremist content online are able to anonymously refer it to the Metropolitan police's Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU). If the content breaches TACT, the CTIRU act to remove the content and where possible they mount prosecutions.</p>

 Charitable giving is strongly encouraged within the Home Office and across Government as a whole. This is demonstrated by all Government Ministers making a pledge to undertake a ‘one day challenge’ with a charity or community group of their choice.

 Information about the number of foreign nationals that the UK Border Agency is unable to remove from the UK on human rights grounds is not readily available on our electronic system and could be obtained only by reviewing individual cases. Many factors will be taken into account when consideration is given as to whether an individual should be allowed to remain in the UK, including the immigration rules, the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Human Rights Act. These often 'overlap' and are not mutually exclusive. An individual may be granted permission to stay for reasons relating to more than one of these provisions.</p>

 The Public Expenditure and Receipts Act 1968 requires the General Register Office for England and Wales to provide certified copies of certificates on a self-financing basis. A review of certificate fees is carried out on a regular basis to comply with the 1968 Act and the last review was conducted in 2010. The outcome of the review led to a revised fee structure being introduced on 6 April 2010.</p>

               <a name="11090680000850"> The revised fee structure was calculated through use of a full cost recovery model agreed with HM Treasury and in line with the principles and guidance to ensure full recovery of costs. Certificate fees were set to a standard fee of £9.25 and a priority fee of £23.40. This provides a much simpler approach for customers and a more efficient charging process.</p>

 The UK Border Agency's target is to clear 95% of non EEA passengers within 45 minutes. The measurement of this target is based on a sampling methodology. Queues are sampled on a daily basis at different times of the day. The figures below show that in over 95% of the samples the UK Border Agency met its target.</p>

 The escorting contract provides the transfer of detainees both within the UK and overseas and the management of both residential and non-residential short-term holding facilities around the country. It was held by G4S Care and Justice Services Ltd until 30 April with the use of alternative suppliers to meet peaks in demand for the service. All Services transferred to Reliance at midnight on 30 April.</p>

               <a name="11090680000909"> Prior to 30 April, the UK Border Agency paid a fixed fee for most elements of the escorting contract. We do not therefore hold sufficiently detailed information which demonstrates the cost of transferring detainees between places of detention. Although the agency now pays for each individual journey undertaken, it would be at disproportionate cost to examine individual invoices to provide the information since the contract changed.</p>

               <a name="11090680000910"> Around 80,000 journeys were undertaken in the year ending 30 April. These include transferring detainees from police stations, prisons and other places of detention into immigration removal centres, taking them to ports and airports for removal, to hospitals for medical appointments, courts for appeal hearings and embassies for documentation interviews. It also includes the transfer of detainees between different immigration removal centres.</p>

               <a name="11090680000911"> The UK Border Agency keeps the number of transfers to a minimum, but inevitably detainees are sometimes moved for operational reasons. These include where their behaviour requires them to be held in a more secure environment, because they are required for an interview at a particular centre, or because they are being moved close to an airport for their removal from the UK.</p>

 There are two pension schemes that apply to police officers. The police pension scheme 1987 does not provide an automatic lump sum on retirement, but allows officers to exchange up to a quarter of their pension for a lump sum. The police pension scheme 2006 provides a lump sum of up to twice the officer's salary on retirement. Lord Hutton's report on public service pensions recommends that all pension rights accrued to date should be protected.

Although we understand that the majority of forces currently use DASH, it is for individual forces to decide which risk assessment models to use and the training their officers and staff receive. However, ACPO continue to encourage forces to adopt DASH and HMIC inspections are carried out against DASH standards. Evidence from early adopter forces such as Sussex police suggests that the implementation of DASH has had a positive effect.</p>

 The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 already covers cyber-stalking. The Act was always intended to tackle stalking, but was drafted so that it could also include any form of persistent conduct which causes alarm or distress. A specific “cyber-stalking” offence or reference to cyber-stalking in the existing offence is therefore not necessary. Where an offender pursues a course of conduct which amounts to harassment, and the offender knows or ought to know their conduct amounts to harassment, it does not matter whether the course of conduct was committed online or offline. As long as the elements of the offence are met, the offence can be charged.</p>

The Home Secretary is responsible for issuing warrants on the application of the Security Service and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. In addition to the specific safeguards that apply in respect of the Warranty regime in Chapter 1, RIPA also sets out two important further sources of safeguards: a tribunal to investigate specific complaints; and an Interception of Communications Commissioner to oversee the operation of the system of interception as a whole. The only publicly available information on the number of intercept warrants issued is contained in the Commissioner's annual report. A link to the most recent report is at:</p>

 Organisations that promote or encourage terrorism, whether in the UK or abroad, can be proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. We keep the list of proscribed organisations under constant review. Where there are extremist organisations that do not meet the statutory test for proscription the Government have made clear that no funding or other forms of support will be provided.</p>

However the line between extremism and terrorism is not always precise. The relationship between terrorism and extremism is therefore complicated and directly relevant to the aim and objectives of Prevent, the part of the Government's counter-terrorism strategy that aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Prevent deals with extremism where terrorism draws on extremist ideas; and where people who are extremists are drawn towards terrorism-related activity.</p>

The Government's view is that reform of the coronial system can be delivered by transferring responsibilities to either the Lord Chief Justice or Lord Chancellor, without the additional expense of a Chief Coroner.

 The coalition Government have kept a very tight rein on the creation of unnecessary central Government websites. In line with the Public Accounts Committee recommendations of 2008, new sites are not approved except when necessary and with explicit permission. Since May 2010, only three new domains have been approved: a single machinery of government change (education.gov.uk), a change of name (for The Children’s Commissioner) and a temporary development site (alpha.gov.uk). The ERG marketing controls, which receive requests on behalf of the Efficiency Board, does not analyse requests for web activity separately and cannot provide the number of requests without incurring disproportionate cost. Good progress is also being made on reducing the number of central Government websites and a list is published quarterly on the Cabinet Office website.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Period life expectancy at age 65 is an estimate of the average number of years a 65-year-old would survive if he or she experienced the area's age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout the rest of his or her life. The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a 65-year-old living in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those currently living in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.
<sup>(2)</sup> Based on boundaries as of 2010.
<sup>(3)</sup> Three year rolling average, based on deaths registered in each year and mid-year population estimates.

 There are no current plans to commence part 3 of the Charities Act 2006, and make the necessary supporting regulations. The future licensing and regulation of public charitable collections will be considered as part of the review of the Charities Act 2006, due to begin later this year. In the current economic climate implementation of the Charities Act 2006 licensing provisions will have to be weighed against other priorities. Effectiveness, affordability and value for money will be important factors in determining whether the new licensing regime is implemented. Whatever the outcome of the review, we want to make it easier for charities to fundraise responsibly, whilst deterring bogus collectors and preventing nuisance for members of the public. Under the Police, Factories etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1916, and local street collections regulations, local licensing authorities already have the power to regulate most types of charitable street collections.</p>

<sup>(1 )</sup>The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(3)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.
<sup>(4)</sup> Cannabis was re-classified to a class B drug on 26 January 2009.

At the time of writing, the LSC has had indications from providers that there is capacity to take on an additional 28,000 case starts, against the 8,000 live files IAS had at the time they went into administration. The LSC and the administrators are also working to identify urgent matters, involving for example unaccompanied asylum seeking minors or those with hearings in the very near future, with the objective of allocating these cases as a priority.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(4)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(5)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.
<sup>(6)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.

<sup>(2)</sup> From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These figures have been included in the totals.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 All of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act listed in the question relate to the increase in magistrates sentencing powers required to deliver the unimplemented "custody plus" sentence. The Government have considered whether to implement these provisions but have concluded that they remain unaffordable. The Government therefore propose to repeal the provisions in order to simplify the law.</p>

 The closure of the Brockhill part of Hewell prison, is an important part of the Ministry of Justice's drive for greater efficiency by ensuring a modern, fit-for-purpose prison estate that can deliver high quality, cost-effective and secure regimes. This part of Hewell is in need of costly remedial work in the next 12 months, which is not currently financially viable.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice does encourage the production of energy from prison waste using a range of available technologies, including anaerobic digestion (AD). For example, an AD plant is in operation at Guys Marsh prison and the resultant bio-energy used to run a generator that supplements the power supply to the prison's kitchen complex and greenhouse. Additionally, the new prison being constructed at Featherstone, Staffordshire, will also incorporate a small-scale AD plant producing energy to supplement normal provision.</p>

               <a name="11090687000820"> The Prison Service has had for some time, robust waste management practices embedded within prisons' day-to-day operations with the primary objective of minimising waste. Therefore, volumes of organic waste generated are, in most cases, insufficient to warrant the considerable capital outlay required for AD plant. Where prisons are identified as having a need for a sustainable solution for organic waste disposal, locally available facilities, such as AD or sealed container composting, are considered within the mix of responsible waste disposal options. For example, the new prison being constructed at Featherstone, Staffordshire, will incorporate a small-scale AD plant producing energy to supplement normal provision.</p>

<sup>(5)</sup> Magistrates courts figures exclude those committed for trial or sentence at the Crown court and those who failed to appear.
<sup>(6)</sup> Percentages presented here represent the proportions of all juveniles who were remanded in custody, excluding those who failed to appear and where the magistrates court committed the defendant for trial or sentence to the Crown court.
<i>Notes</i>:
1. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
2. Some percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.

 The table presents information on number of sentencing occasions for indictable offences for offenders dealt with by police forces in the south-east and by Kent police force in each year between 2001 and 2010, and the number and proportion of offenders who had at least one previous conviction or caution. The equivalent figures for Chatham and Aylesford constituency are not available as the data source used by the MOJ does not enable us to identify offenders who are resident in this area.</p>

 The following tables show the numbers of claims leading to orders being made for the repossession of property in each ward in Dartford constituency by mortgage lenders in each year since 2000 and landlords in each year since 2003. Data for previous years are not available due to the lack of valid postcodes.</p>

               <a name="11090687000944"> These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made. This is more accurate than the number of orders, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. It is also a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions.</p>

               <a name="11090687000945"> These figures do not indicate how many properties have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order, such as where borrowers hand the keys back to the lender. Also, not all possession orders result in repossession. Many orders are suspended and if the borrower complies with the repayment arrangements set out in the suspended order the property will not be repossessed.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The mortgage data include all types of lenders.
<sup>(2)</sup> The court, following a judicial hearing, may grant an order for possession immediately. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted. However, even where a warrant for possession is issued, the parties can still negotiate a compromise to prevent eviction.
<sup>(3)</sup> Includes outright and suspended orders, the latter being where the court grants the claimant possession but suspends the operation of the order. Provided the defendant complies with the terms of suspension, which usually require the defendant to pay the current mortgage instalments plus some of the accrued arrears, the possession order cannot be enforced.
<sup>(4)</sup> The mortgage possession figures do not indicate how many houses have actually been repossessed through the courts. Repossessions can occur without a court order being made while not all court orders result in repossession.
<sup>(5)</sup> The number of claims that lead to an order includes all claims in which the first order, whether outright or suspended, is mad during the period.
6 The figures from 2000 up until the first quarter of 2010 (January to March) reflect the ward boundaries as of August 2009 and for the reset of 2010 the restructured ward boundaries as of August 2010.
<sup>(7)</sup> When interpreting these statistics please be mindful that the sum of the figures for the wards may be different to the total for Dartford constituency due to rounding and also because the ward boundaries may have been revised after the constituency boundaries have been fixed at the time of each general election.
<sup>(8)</sup> All figures are rounded to the nearest five and those with a value fellow eight are represented as ‘—’.

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The landlord data include all types of landlord whether social or private.
<sup>(2)</sup> Landlord actions include those made under both standard and accelerated procedures. Landlord actions via the accelerated procedure enable the orders to be made solely on the basis of written evidence for shorthold tenancies, when the fixed period of tenancy has come to an end.
<sup>(3)</sup> The court, following a judicial hearing, may grant an order for possession immediately. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted. However, even where a warrant for possession is issued, the parties can still negotiate a compromise to prevent eviction.
<sup>(4)</sup> Includes outright and suspended orders, the latter being where the court grants the claimant possession but suspends the operation of the order. Provided the defendant complies with the terms of suspension, which usually require the defendant to pay the current rent instalments plus some of the accrued arrears, the possession order cannot be enforced.
<sup>(5)</sup> The landlord possession figures do not indicate how many houses have actually been repossessed through the courts. Repossessions can occur without a court order being made while not all court orders result in repossession.
<sup>(6)</sup> The number of claims that lead to an order includes all claims in which the first order, whether outright or suspended, is made during the period.
<sup>(7)</sup> The figures from 2000 up until the first quarter of 2010 (January to March) reflect the ward boundaries as of August 2009 and for the rest of 2010 the restructured ward boundaries as of August 2010.
<sup>(8)</sup> When interpreting these statistics please be mindful that the sum of the figures for the wards may be different to the total for Dartford constituency due to rounding and also because the ward boundaries may have been revised after the constituency boundaries have been fixed at the time of each general election.
<sup>(9)</sup> All figures are rounded to the nearest five and those with a value below eight are represented as ‘—’.

 The Ministry of Justice holds statistical information in relation to the number of appeals received against sentences dealt with in the Crown court and the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. However, the central administrative databases for both courts do not store information concerning the plea of appellants in the original case. To obtain this information would require the manual inspection of court files held locally, which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

 Legislation in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 made local authorities responsible for securing suitable education and training for young people aged 10-17 in custody. This came into effect on 1 September 2010. The Act also contains duties on “home” local authorities to “take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote the person's fulfilment of his or her learning potential” while they are in custody, and to share information about the young person's education and any special educational needs they may have.</p>

These include the following themes: accommodation, planning, interventions and supervision, education, training and employment. Youth justice services are encouraged to make use of these documents in the design and delivery of their interventions.</p>

 Ofsted’s most recent inspection report on personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education, published in July 2010, was based on visits to 165 schools between September 2006 and July 2009. Ofsted found that the economic well-being and financial capability strand (introduced in September 2008) was still in its early stages and that achievement in this area was less strong than in other areas of PSHE. However, they also found that students in schools that were successfully delivering personal finance education showed a good understanding of personal finance, used financial terms correctly and were able to apply their knowledge in making financial decisions.</p>

 The Government provide considerable support to safeguard children from the risk of forced marriage, which is a serious form of child abuse. The joint Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), which was launched in January 2005, provides advice to teachers in schools. The FMU produced statutory guidance on forced marriage in 2008 (revised 2010); revised multi-agency practice guidelines on handling cases of forced marriage in 2009; and supplementary guidelines on handling cases of forced marriage involving persons with learning disabilities in 2010. In addition to these guidance documents which are targeted at frontline practitioners and volunteers, the FMU provide a helpline to support victims and potential victims of forced marriage.</p>

All schools have clear responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of their pupils. The inter-agency guidance, “Working Together to Safeguard Children (2010)” and guidance to schools and FE colleges, “Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education (2006)” set out how organisations and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people.</p>

 It is the responsibility of the local authority or school that has commissioned alternative provision for a pupil to determine the details of what should be covered in the curriculum for that pupil. Where a pupil has behavioural problems, and more particularly where they have a history of violence, the school or local authority may decide that it is appropriate for them to have Personal, Social and Health Education lessons and that those lessons should include these issues.</p>

 The review of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education, including sex and relationship education, is being carried out separately from the national curriculum review because PSHE education is not a national curriculum subject.

That action plan will take full account of the strong link between children going missing and children suffering from sexual exploitation.</p>

The 33,300 combined/general science teachers are teachers with combined/general science on their timetables; the figure does not include physics, biology and chemistry teachers unless they are teaching it as an additional subject and is marked as such on their timetables.

 The Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) is an unfunded scheme and consequently there are no investments to manage. Employer and employee contributions rates are generally set following periodic valuations of the TPS by the Government Actuary, although the Department is currently consulting on an increase in the employee contribution rate in 2012-13 to take account of recommendations by the Independent Public Service Pension Commission. This will not affect the contribution rate paid by all TPS employers, including academies, which is currently 14.1%.</p>

 The Land Registry creates and maintains a register of title to land in England and Wales.

This question relates to care home ownership, and in that context, no-one has questioned or challenged the accuracy of any ownership information, therefore no assessment has been carried out.</p>

 The Government wants to encourage new providers to enter the Higher Education market, to make a reality of student choice, incentivise efficiency and the best possible value for money for students. In our recent White Paper “Students at the Heart of the System” (Cm 8122) we set out our proposals to establish a regulatory system which allows all providers to enter and participate in the Higher Education market on an equitable basis. We have also said that, in addition to access to the student support system, not-for- profit institutions will be able to access grants from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), to fund additional costs and public policy priorities, such as those associated with high cost or specialist provision, which cannot be met by graduate contributions alone.</p>

HEFCE uses two different groupings of areas to define disadvantage: one based on the participation rates of young (19 and under) people in higher education (HE) (which is used by HEFCE when looking at young full-time entrants); and one based on the proportion of adults who hold HE qualifications (which is used by HEFCE when looking at part-time and mature full-time entrants). Because this table includes applicants and accepted applicants of all ages, disadvantage is defined by quintiles 1 and 2 of the HE qualified adults measure.

Anyone who believes that they are being underpaid should contact the Pay and Work Rights Helpline.

 The Department has not assessed the effect on small businesses of the licensing conditions of the Performing Rights Society (PRS) and Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL). The broader licensing and enforcement framework is set out in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The collecting society functions of PRS, PPL, and other collecting societies are not specifically regulated by the Government at present. However, the Government have recently accepted a recommendation made by Professor Ian Hargreaves, in his independent review of Intellectual Property and Growth, that collecting societies be regulated through codes of conduct that enshrine minimum standards of fairness and transparency and which govern their relations with licensees. The Government will consult on the implementation of this recommendation later this year.</p>

These figures do not include expenditure by students' dependents, nor do they include the amount generated by students and their dependents through part-time work while in study, which is not the same as the Post-Study Work route.

               <i>[holding answer 19 July 2011]:</i> The current reorganisation of the Skills Funding Agency (the Agency) started in autumn 2010 and will be complete by autumn 2011. It will result in the Agency reducing from 1,896 staff to below 1,264 staff and from 20 to 13 offices. The one-off cost is estimated at £48 million. This cost will generate an estimated £20 million savings in the 2011-12 financial year, followed by an expected annual saving by the end of the spending review period of £41 million (i.e. - a reduction of 33% of the baseline budget).</p>

Consistent with the UK's legislative guidelines, the Government have taken steps to domestically ratify this commitment by laying legislation in Parliament on the 13 June 2011. This process is also being undertaken by other IMF member countries. The G-20 countries have committed to completing the reforms by the Annual Meetings in October 2012.</p>

This will ensure the level of foreign currency reserves held is sufficient whilst meeting potential calls from the International Monetary Fund. Once the quota reforms are completed, members are initially required to deposit 25% of their quota at the fund in reserve assets. Aside from this, the amount of financing that the UK provides to the IMF will depend on the number, size and timing of IMF lending programmes and also, at a technical level, on exactly how the IMF chooses to manage the financing of these programmes.</p>

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) does not hesitate to use its criminal investigation powers to pursue a prosecution. However, cost-effective civil settlement procedures are used in the majority of tax avoidance and evasion cases. This represents excellent value for the Exchequer, as all undeclared tax is repaid and defaulters also pay a penalty, which can be up to 100% of the tax evaded, plus interest on the undeclared tax. Every year we collect millions of pounds of evaded tax using these well-established methods.</p>

 Staff are employed on offshore work in a number of different ways and the exact level of resource (i.e. the proportion of time spent on offshore work) cannot be meaningfully presented from readily available data held by the various directorates of HMRC. Going forward, the Government Spending Review Report made reference to the need for a dedicated team to address the problem of tax evasion facilitated by the use of offshore financial centres. HMRC has responded to the ministerial announcement by recruiting 25 investigators to a new offshore evasion team, to be in post by the autumn, increasing to 100 by 2015. The Offshore Co-ordination Unit will provide oversight to the activities undertaken throughout the Department dedicated to tackling offshore avoidance and evasion.</p>
