<P>
<a name="10301w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans the Government have to improve adult literacy and numeracy skills in England.  [152260]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10301w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The standard of literacy and numeracy skills in England has been too poor for too long. Claus Moser's report found that up to 7 million adults in England have weak literacy and numeracy skills. This is disastrous for the individuals concerned, weakens business competitiveness and places a huge burden on society.
<P>

<a name="10301w01.html_para0">The Government will shortly launch their strategy to tackle this problem. Our priority is to improve the skills of those groups where literacy and numeracy needs are greatest and where we can make most impact. We will spend &#163;1.5 billion over the next three years and focus the work of all relevant organisations on ensuring that 750,000 adults improve their literacy and numeracy by 2004, and that we reach the literacy and numeracy levels of our international competitors.
<P>

<a name="10301w01.html_para1">Our strategy will deliver radical quality improvements. New national standards, a common core curriculum and National Tests will make sure that best teaching and learning practice is adopted across the country. And we are training teachers, establishing a research centre and introducing more rigorous national inspections so that standards remain high.
<P>

<a name="10301w01.html_para2">The Government themselves will be setting an example with my Department working with other Government Departments and agencies such as the MOD and the Prison Service to bring about radical improvements in standards of adult skills.
<P>

<a name="10301w01.html_para3">Our literacy and numeracy strategy will mark a decisive step in addressing this country's poor literacy and numeracy skill levels and will give adults the opportunity to acquire the skills they need to participate in modern society.

<P>
<a name="10301w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B>

<a name="10301w01.html_para4">Statistics on New Deal for People with Disabilities are not available at constituency level. To date the New Deal for Disabled People has operated only in a limited number of locations, not including Copeland. 24 innovative schemes have been testing new ways of helping disabled people into work and 12 Personal Adviser pilots have helped disabled people to overcome their particular barriers to work.
<P>

<a name="10301w01.html_para5">The New Deal for Disabled People will be extended on a national basis, with services for disabled clients beginning from July 2001.
<P>

<a name="10301w01.html_para6">The approach which underpins the New Deal programmes is one which links equality of opportunity and investment in skills to economic prosperity and labour market expansion.

 Authorities may bid for additional major road, public transport or integrated transport schemes as part of the process of submitting their first annual progress reports (APRs) on their local transport plans. In certain circumstances, authorities will also be able to bid for additional funding for smaller-scale integrated transport schemes. Details will be provided in the guidance on APRs that we will issue to authorities shortly.

 Five representations have been received.
<P>

<a name="10301w02.html_para0">Following public consultation streamlined statutory procedures for handling planning appeals--on which guidance is given in DETR Circular 5/2000--were introduced last year. These require third parties to submit their comments or statements of case to the Secretary of State on the same timescale as that for local planning authorities and appellants. Thus third parties have the opportunity at both planning application stage and at planning appeal stage to comment on the proposed development.
<P>

<a name="10301w02.html_para1">The operation of the new procedures is being monitored and we shall review them in the light of experience, taking account of representations received.

The Department collects information on waste management and recycling from local authorities in England and Wales on an annual basis through the Municipal Waste Management Survey. National and regional level information for the financial year 1998-99 was published in the Municipal Waste Management 1998-99 Bulletin in September 2000. We expect to publish provisional results for 1999-2000 in early April 2001 and a more detailed analysis later in the year. We intend to publish figures showing the

 In August 2000, English Nature began public consultations on proposals for new and amended Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). Those proposals included new SACs at Bolton Fell Moss, Solway Moss and Hatfield Moor, boundary amendments to the existing candidate SACs at Thorne Moor and South Solway Mosses, plus the addition of a new qualifying interest on the site encompassing Wedholme Flow. English Nature is currently considering the scientific justification for each new or amended site. The Government will consider their recommendations as soon as they are made.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> The term "active service" is used wildly in connection with the Services, with various meanings in different contexts.

 It is very unlikely that the withdrawal of the Ministry of Defence police (MDP) from the five RO sites will lead to any compulsory redundancies, unless officers substantiate a case for a Limited Mobility Waiver, and there are no other employment opportunities with the MDP in the local area.

 Once Ministry of Defence police protection is withdrawn, the deployment of company guards will be the responsibility of the Royal Ordnance. The guards will not have constabulary powers.
<P>

<a name="10301w03.html_para1">Private security company guards will not be armed. Section 54 of the Firearms Act 1968 limits the authority to carry firearms on duty to Crown Servants (which includes Service personnel and the Ministry of Defence police). The Firearms Act Amendment 1997 lists pistols as prohibited items, the carriage of which requires a personal licence issued by the local Chief Constable; no such licences are issued to private security companies. Home Department police will provide an armed response force, as required, at the RO sites.

 Afghanistan is suffering its worst drought in 30 years, which has combined with continuing conflict to lead to a dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation. At least 12 million people are affected, 3-4 million of them seriously, and the number of displaced Afghans seeking relief from drought and conflict is now over 500,000. Winter weather conditions are reported to be severe, and a shortage of food, shelter and clothing has led to an increase in mortality rates.

 We believe that primary education should be free and that no child should be denied access to a basic education because the costs, direct or indirect, cannot be met by the household. School fees are an example of a direct cost, but there may be indirect charges for books, uniforms and exams which can make education unaffordable to many.
<P>

<a name="10301w04.html_para4">The equitable financing of education is a key issue for achieving universal primary education by 2015. Accordingly, assessments are made by DFID at country level of the extent to which fees or indirect costs are charged to primary school pupils. Support for the planned transition to free primary education is a priority for us. We have seen some progress. In Zambia, the Government have recently announced the abolition of fees for primary school children, including those for examination entry. Tanzania has committed to abolishing primary school fees by 2001, but there are still significant challenges. In Malawi, for example, primary schooling is nominally free but there are still hidden costs which need to be addressed. In Kenya parents do not pay primary school fees, but instead must pay for books, school levy, uniforms and examination fees.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2001]:</i> During the course of 2000, my noble Friend the Minister for Science reviewed the Department's existing policy on accreditation. He decided to re-confirm the existing policy of recognition for the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) as the sole national body for the accreditation, against the recognised international standards, of testing and calibration laboratories and certification and inspection bodies. He confirmed the terms of the memorandum of understanding which my Department, on behalf of the Government as a whole, has 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2001 : Column: 731W</I><P>
with UKAS and which sets out the activities for which UKAS is recognised along with a number of rights and obligations on both parties.
<P>

<a name="10301w04.html_para5">While my noble Friend concluded that no major structural changes to the UK accreditation system were desirable, he did agree that there would be benefit in a well-targeted, UKAS-driven publicity campaign to raise the profile of UKAS accredited conformity assessment to ensure that the benefits of using UKAS accredited conformity assessment services are properly understood.
<P>

<a name="10301w04.html_para6">Accreditation by UKAS ensures that conformity assessment bodies have been independently assessed to agreed international standards of competence and impartiality by a body which is itself subject to regular assessment and to oversight by Government. For these reasons, while there is no legal requirement for the providers of conformity assessment services to be accredited, the Government recommend the use of UKAS accredited conformity assessment wherever this is an option. The Government also advise purchasers to look for the National Accreditation Marks, which UKAS and UKAS accredited organisations are able to use under a licensing agreement with my Department, as a sign of Government recognition.
<P>

<a name="10301w04.html_para7">My Department and a number of other Government Departments are therefore supporting the UKAS Accreditation Awareness Campaign which was launched by my noble Friend on 27 November 2000. The campaign is expected to run for the next 18 months and is aimed at increasing the understanding of accreditation within Government itself and, through a series of briefings aimed at business support agencies, within the business community in general and SMEs in particular.

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 2001]:</i> Foreign and Commonwealth Office and United Nations officials routinely discuss a wide range of issues relating to Western Sahara in New York and the region.
<P>

<a name="10301w05.html_para6">As set out in the Secretary of State's evidence to the Quadripartite Committee on 30 January, in 1998 a British company applied for an export licence in order, inter alia, to refurbish Moroccan guns in Western Sahara.
<P>

<a name="10301w05.html_para7">In late 1998, as a result of contacts between Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials and MINURSO in the region, Ministers came to the preliminary view that, if Moroccan guns were refurbished, this would not violate the terms of the UN-sponsored cease-fire between Morocco and the Polisario Front which has been in place since 1991. The UN told FCO officials in April 1999 that refurbishment could be considered as neutral. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials also understand that, under the terms of the Military Agreement signed between 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2001 : Column: 736W</I><P>
MINURSO and Morocco and MINURSO and Polisario, MINURSO would play a role in monitoring the process of refurbishing the guns.
<P>

<a name="10301w05.html_para8">In discussions between Foreign and Commonwealth Office and United Nations officials in New York this subject was referred to on 1 February 1999, 16 February 1999, 23 February 1999, 3 March 1999, 21 and 28 May 1999 and 21 June 1999.
<P>

<a name="10301w05.html_para9">On 21 June 1999, the United Nations Department for Peace Keeping Operations in New York confirmed that refurbishment of the guns would not be in breach of the existing military arrangements between MINURSO and the two parties; and that, in accordance with these arrangements, MINURSO would be in a position to monitor the procedure of the refurbishment of the Moroccan guns on the ground. This is set out in Military Agreement between the two parties and MINURSO of 1997.
<P>

<a name="10301w05.html_para10">It is not for the United Nations to object or not to any refusal by HMG of an arms export licence. The United Nations role is to monitor the cease-fire between the two parties.
<P>

<a name="10301w05.html_para11">We are not aware of any direct approaches from the UK arms manufacturers to the United Nations concerning refurbishment of Moroccan guns in Western Sahara. However, in their letter of appeal of 1 October 1998, the applicant asserted that refurbishment did not contravene the cease-fire and that MINURSO could monitor any refurbishment.

 The European Union delivered demarches to the Government of Israel on Israeli obstacles to humanitarian assistance (5 February) and on the Israeli policy of targeted physical eliminations (21 January). The EU made a further statement on 13 February which deplored the practice of eliminations or extra judicial killings of Palestinians by the Israeli security forces. The General Affairs Council has repeatedly called for closures to be lifted, most recently on 26 February. Within the framework of the EU-Israel dialogue on the Palestinian economy, the EU has also urged Israel to lift the closures and resume the payment of revenues withheld from the Palestinian Authority.

<a name="10301w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The British Government have always condemned the appalling massacre of Armenians in 1915-16. Armenians already commemorate that tragic episode in their history on 24 April each year. This is not a national memorial day throughout Britain and we have no plans to make it one but this should not be seen as failing to acknowledge and sympathise with the victims and descendants of that atrocity.

 Prison Service guidance on visits does not define the term "family member", although it lists family members who should be regarded as "close relatives", whose visits to a prisoner should be refused only in exceptional circumstances. The position of grandchildren and grandparents, who do not currently fall within this definition, is being considered as part of the Prison Service's current review of visits policy.

information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office annual reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000, is available in the Library. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. 'Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000' and 'Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000' can be found in the Library. The recorded crime statistics include information on recorded crime by Basic Command Unit and Crime and Disorder partnerships.

<a name="10301w07.html_para10">The Norfolk YOT covers the constituency of Norwich, North. The YOT is making a full contribution to reducing delays within the court process for young offenders by producing 80 per cent. of all courts reports within agreed timescales. The YOT is also working in partnership with Youth Court Panels in order to establish a joint approach to tackling youth crime.
<P>

<a name="10301w07.html_para11">To ensure that the needs of victims of youth crime are met through restorative justice measures, the YOT is working in partnership with the Norfolk Victim Support Charitable Trust. A joint working protocol has been agreed and implemented benefiting victims and 70 per cent. of all intervention work with young offenders includes a focus on victim issues. The YOT is also working in partnership with the National Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Children in the delivery of programmes for parents of young offenders to assist them to manage difficult behaviour with confidence, consistency and reliability. Links have also been established by the YOT with the local Drug Action Team in order to commission services for young substance misusers. The YOT is already having a significant impact on youth crime in Norfolk as a whole: 60 per cent. of all young people referred to the YOT have completed court orders without reoffending, while 80 per cent. of all young offenders released from prison have not reoffended.
<P>

<a name="10301w07.html_para12">Norfolk (including the Norwich area) is benefiting from the Youth Justice Board's development fund which has awarded grants of approximately &#163;1.1 million over three years for one bail support scheme and four intervention programmes across the county.

 The policy on smoking in Prison Service premises is set out in "Instruction to Governors 16/1996", issued on 21 March 1996 (a copy of which can be found in the Library). It seeks to ensure that prisoners are not exposed to tobacco smoke against their will.
<P>

<a name="10301w08.html_para1">In particular, smoking is banned in all visits areas and governors are asked to consider bans in other communal areas and make arrangements to prevent smoking in consulting rooms in health care centres. There should also be provision for prisoners who smoke to smoke away from non-smoking prisoners within patient areas. So far as is reasonably practicable, non-smoking prisoners are not expected to share a cell with smokers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the economic benefits to Peterborough from the siting of a new prison in the city in terms of <i>(a)</i> direct and <i>(b)</i> indirect employment.  [151567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10301w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The assessment made in 1997 and reiterated at the public inquiry into the new prison in 1998 was that it would create an estimated 400 direct and 440 indirect jobs during construction and 350 direct and 190 indirect jobs once the prison opens. However, these can only be indicative estimates and precise staffing figures will be dependent on the design and operational policies of the contractor selected to design, build and run the prison.

 The DNA database is a national database which currently holds details of individuals suspected, cautioned and convicted of a recordable offence, together with their DNA profiles.
<P>

<a name="10301w09.html_para0">The Home Office Circular 16/95: National DNA Database sets out the general conditions relating to the establishment and use of the National DNA database.
<P>

<a name="10301w09.html_para1">DNA profiling technologies have developed rapidly over the last 10 years. Significant advances have been made resulting in improved sensitivity and these enable DNA to be extracted from increasingly smaller crime scene stains. The current technique, FSS SGMplus, analyses 11 areas on the DNA molecule. FSS SGMplus has been in use since September 1999 and has a discriminatory power of 1 in a billion. This has a considerable advantage over the SGM technique previously used, which had a discriminatory power of 1 in 50 million.
<P>

<a name="10301w09.html_para2">The reliability of DNA evidence is assured through the internal quality assurance measures adopted by the Forensic Science Service and through their external accreditation by the British Standards Institute and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service to the BS EN ISO 9000 and M10 National Standards. This independent accreditation of the DNA process involves regular audit to ensure the standards are maintained.

Friend the Prime Minister announced on 24 January that he had asked former Treasury Solicitor, Sir Anthony Hammond QC, to review the full circumstance surrounding approaches to the Home Office in connection with the possibility of an application for naturalisation by Mr. S. P. Hinduja in 1998. Sir Anthony started his review on Thursday 25 January. After an initial reading of the papers, Sir Anthony decided that, in order to fulfil the terms of reference of his review of the application for naturalisation of S. P. Hinduja, it is appropriate for him to look at the circumstances of the granting of naturalisation in respect of G. P. Hinduja because the circumstances of both applications are closely related. For the same reason, he also decided that it is appropriate for him to look at the circumstances surrounding the inquiries about naturalisation in respect of Prakesh Hinduja. I understand that Sir Anthony hopes to complete his review shortly. The report will be published and copies will be placed in the Vote Office and the Library. It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of this review.

 Each asylum application is considered individually on its merits. In cases where asylum has been refused, exceptional leave to remain may be granted on a discretionary basis in individual cases. Exceptional leave may be granted to a person for a wide number of reasons, but it is most usually granted for compassionate or humanitarian reasons, or to protect from ill treatment a person who does not otherwise qualify for asylum under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention.

<a name="10301w09.html_para5">The New Deals benefit the labour market because participants leave the programme better equipped, motivated and skilled for the rest of their working lives. For the period ending November 2000, 824 people have joined the New Deal 25+ programme, resulting in 122 jobs. Also, 47 people have started work with the New Deal 50+ employment credit. 540 people have started New Deal for Lone Parents in Jarrow, resulting in 275 jobs. We know that many other people will have left the New Deal for employment without telling the Employment Service--these people are not included in the figures. Figures for New Deal for Disabled People are not yet available at constituency level. The South Tyneside pilot area of the New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) includes the constituency of Jarrow. All the NDDP pilots are making a valuable contribution to our learning and experience of which forms of extra help and support work best.

<P>
<a name="10301w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the potential savings arising from the Community Legal Service receiving a portion of the damages awarded in civil cases funded by legal aid.  [151548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10301w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 A contingency fund was considered during the passage of the Access to Justice Act 1999, and the Act contains a power to create one. However, the Government have no plans to do so.
<P>

<a name="10301w10.html_para2">It would be virtually impossible to operate a contingency fund in relation to family litigation or cases where victims are seeking injunctions to prevent domestic violence. Costs are often not awarded at the end of these cases, or they are unlikely to be enforced, or there may be no damages out of which costs could be recovered from the funded client. Such a fund cannot operate where funding is provided for some Children Act cases, since funding is granted without a merits test. It would also be impossible to operate Legal Help (formerly Green Form advice) on a contingency fund basis, since cases rarely become formal proceedings where costs or damages would become recoverable.
<P>

<a name="10301w10.html_para3">The Government believe that, as far as possible, litigants should receive the full amount of compensation to which they are entitled. That would not be the case with a contingency fund.
<P>

<a name="10301w10.html_para4">The Government also doubt the practicality of operating a contingency fund where the private funding of litigation through conditional fee agreements and after-the-event insurance is possible. Adverse selection would result in cases with higher prospects of success funded privately on a conditional fee basis, leaving cases with weaker prospects of success to be supported by the contingency fund. That would leave the fund vulnerable to significant financial problems.
<P>

<a name="10301w10.html_para5">Accordingly, and while not ruling out the possibility of operating a contingency fund in any circumstances, the Government have no plans to introduce such a fund in England and Wales.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what his estimate is of the total financial awards from successful civil cases funded by legal aid in the latest financial year for which figures are available.  [151549]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10301w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Due to changes to the Legal Services Commission's computer systems the latest available figures are for 1997-98. The total amount of moneys awarded or agreed in publicly funded civil cases was &#163;1.37 billion. This information relates principally to one-off payments, and excludes most payments by instalment, whether in matrimonial or non-matrimonial cases.

 Neither I nor my officials have given any instructions to Deputy District Judges (Magistrates Courts), as they are now called, specifically in relation to political activity during the next General Election. However, the memorandum on conditions of appointment and terms of service issued to every Deputy District Judge (Magistrates Courts) states plainly that they are expected to refrain from any activity, political or otherwise, which would conflict with their judicial office or be seen to compromise their impartiality. They are advised that in the event of any doubt they should contact my officials in the Judicial Group for advice.

 No decision has yet been taken about merging ambulance trusts in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="10301w11.html_para1">The ambulance trusts have been reviewing the way in which ambulance services in the south-east are provided to ensure that they are delivered in a way which is consistent with the modernisation of the National Health Service and which ensures they can play a full role in the delivery of emergency and pre-hospital care. Proposals for the future of the service have been produced which will require public consultation. I will be meeting the chairs and chief executives of the ambulance trusts shortly to discuss these proposals.

 Funding for paramedic training, both new recruits and refresher training for qualified paramedics, is incorporated in the total budget for providing emergency ambulance services. For 2000-01 the total budget for Oxfordshire Ambulance National Health Service Trust was &#163;10 million.

<a name="10301w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 February 2001]:</i> Table one shows gross National Health Service expenditure for the United Kingdom as a percentage of gross domestic product from 1979-80 to 2003-04. This shows that, based on latest forecasts, public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP is set to rise to 6.6 per cent. by 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="10301w11.html_para3">The Department does not produce figures for expenditure on private healthcare. According to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data, private healthcare represents about 1 per cent. of GDP. Table two shows total healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP from 1979-99, using information from OECD. The OECD does not produce forecast data, but assuming that private healthcare spend as a proportion of GDP remains stable at around 1 per cent., then this percentage will rise to 7.6 per cent. by 2003-04.

<a name="10301w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Office is in regular contact with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on a range of issues, including the extent of its powers under the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Section 69(2) of the Act requires the Commission to submit to the Secretary of State at the end of its first two years of operation recommendations for improving the adequacy and effectiveness of its functions. We have not yet received these recommendations, but expect to do so shortly. We have made clear that we will give full consideration to the Commission's recommendations at that stage. Any subsequent proposals for change will be subject to consultation in the normal way.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what resources have been provided to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for the public consultation about the scope of the Bill of Rights.  [150645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10301w12.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The annual budget of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was initially set at &#163;750,000, three times that of the Commission's predecessor, to reflect its increased powers and functions. The consultation on the scope for a Bill of Rights was envisaged as an integral part of the Commission's functions and resources for the consultation have therefore been provided within the Commission's core budget. However, we made clear from the outset that we would be prepared to consider bids for increased funding, provided they were accompanied by a properly costed business case. The Commission's first bid for additional funds--including for the consultation on the scope for a Bill of Rights--was received during the Christmas break. It is currently under consideration, and we hope to meet the Commission shortly to discuss their bid more fully.

 Improving the employment prospects of lone parents is a key priority for the Government. The lone parent employment rate has risen from 44 per cent. in 1997 to over 50 per cent. now--the highest rate for 20 years. Many more lone parents say that they would like to work and so the Government has set a new objective: that 70 per cent. of lone parents are in employment by the end of the decade. Policies such as the New Deal for lone parents, the Working Families Tax Credit and the National Childcare Strategy are already helping the Government to achieve this aim.

<BR>
This improved methodology cannot be used to produce estimates before spring 1998 because it makes use of an LFS variable that is not available for earlier years. The introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has changed the distribution of pay rates across the lower pay bands. The NMW was introduced in April 1999 with an adult rate for workers aged 22 and over of &#163;3.60 per hour. The rate was increased to &#163;3.70 per hour in October 2000. The impact of this increase is not reflected in figures for spring 2000 as they relate to an earlier period.
<BR>
The estimates cannot be used as a measure of non-compliance with the NMW legislation because it is not possible from either the LFS or the NES to identify whether an individual is eligible for NMW rates. For example, it is not possible to identify people such as apprentices, those undergoing accredited training or those with accommodation supplied who are exempt from the NMW or are entitled to lower rates.
