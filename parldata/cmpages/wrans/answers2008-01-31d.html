 Crimes involving bogus callers can have a devastating effect on an individual&#146;s or even a whole community&#146;s quality of life. This is particularly the case with older and more vulnerable victims. That is why we continue in our work to confront and tackle crime and have been involved in a number of campaigns and initiatives relating to distraction burglary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80131w0003.htm_para0"><a name="08013168000107">The Government, working with third sector organisations, has produced a wide range of tools for practitioners (such as good practice guides) and information for potential victims, carers and those in regular contact with the vulnerable.

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80131w0003.htm_para1"><a name="08013168000108">To enhance the police response to distraction burglary, we have worked with the Association of Chief Police Officers to establish a national distraction burglary database and intelligence network to facilitate the sharing of intelligence and support joint operations between forces and with other enforcement bodies including Trading Standards. We are currently working with the water industry to explore what can be done to tackle crimes involving bogus water officials.</p>

All tenants were offered the opportunity to relocate to an assured tenancy or equivalent and the vast majority of tenants relocated to properties that they themselves had selected as best matching their requirements. Tenants were able to bid for social rented properties covered by local authority nominations and available through choice-based letting schemes, and were prioritised in the allocation procedures. They were also able to choose to relocate to properties owned by a wide range of registered social landlords. Direct offers were made to those tenants without an identified relocation property at the end of April 2007, based on an understanding of the individuals&#146; preferences for their relocation.</p>

The Scotland Office does not hold information on bonus payments under these annual performance appraisal systems. Under the Special Bonus Scheme of the SE and the Reward and Recognition Scheme of the MOJ, the Office may also directly authorise bonus payments for special effort, achievement and commitment; since 1999, the Office has made one bonus payment of &#163;150 to a press officer.</p>

 The European Commission is right to uphold the state aid rules: these are for the benefit of the whole fishing industry.

 DEFRA has a diversity team in place to develop and implement strategies that actively promote equality and diversity throughout the organisation. The team supports the business to ensure that the DEFRA work force is representative of the wider community and to improve organisational and people management performance as it relates to diversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80131w0014.htm_para1"><a name="08013174002067">The Department has a duty to comply with current equalities legislation to ensure fairness in our employment practices and in our dealings with those we serve.

As a part of the Department&#146;s restructuring staff resources available to work on diversity has been reduced. The number of staff employed in the diversity team has therefore reduced during 2007 from 12 to four. This reduction has been achieved by mainstreaming diversity throughout the organisation and ensuring that the new team adopts a strategic focus.</p>

 The quarantine period of six months is linked with the potential incubation period of rabies and was established in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry on Rabies in 1971 (The Waterhouse Report).

The fact sheets would also be issued to livestock keepers within CSF protection and surveillance zones should zones be imposed in an outbreak. The fact sheets, along with further comprehensive information for farmers on both the disease and our control policy, can be found on the CSF pages of the DEFRA website.

<i> [holding answer 19 November 2007]:</i> The new planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change will boost the use of local renewable and low carbon energy in new development. The PPS sets out our &#145;Merton-Plus&#146; approach. This (like existing Merton rules) expects a council-wide target and, additionally, tailored targets for sites where there is greater potential for using decentralised energy to supply new development. These targets should be flexible enough to consider community schemes (for example, wind turbines or CHP schemes serving more than one site) as well as building specific technologies. When there are clear carbon savings to be had from local energy sources, they should not be subject to a requirement for on-site options to be tested before they can be considered.</p>

 The treatment outcomes profile (TOP), a treatment outcomes monitoring instrument is used at the start, during and after substance misuse treatment, and is reported through the national drug treatment monitoring system. TOP comprises of a series of questions, asked by the key worker and answered by the client about the nature and extent of the client's substance use, crime, health and social functioning, in order to measure outcomes in a meaningful way that is sensitive to change over time.</p>

However, benzodiazepine use can be recorded on the TOP form as an &#147;other problem substance&#148; for clinical purposes and should always be included in comprehensive assessments and the resulting care plans.</p>

 We are introducing universal screening for methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus</i><i>  aureus</i> for all elective patients by March 2009 and for all emergency patients as soon as possible over the next three years, supported by funding of &#163;130 million per year by 2010-11. This will reduce the likelihood of a patient developing a clinical infection or passing it on to others in hospital who may be vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="80131w0028.htm_para4"><a name="08013188005840">We have considered whether universal screening of patients for <i> Clostridium difficile</i> (<i> C. difficile</i>) is the best way forward for the national health service. However, the current clinical evidence does not suggest that universal screening would be clinically, or cost, effective as universal screening would not identify the majority of patients who might be carrying <i> C. difficile</i> bacteria, and patients without symptoms are not considered to present an increased risk of infecting others. This is why we are targeting high risk patients for <i> C. difficile</i> screening. All over 65s in hospital with diarrhoea already should be screened for <i> C</i><i> .</i><i>  difficile</i> as set out in current guidance. This will ensure the infection is identified quickly and appropriate measures are taken to treat the patient and minimise infection of other patients.</p>

Additional investment of &#163;270 million funding per year by 2010-11 has been identified in the comprehensive spending review to support infection control and cleanliness in the NHS.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> 0n 1 October 1999 Royal Hull hospital NHS trust and East Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust merged to form the Hull and East Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust.<br>
<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Data quality:<br>
Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
2. Finished admission episodes:<br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
Admission method codes used:<br>
21 = Emergency: via accident and emergency (A and E) services, including the casualty department of the provider<br>
22 = Emergency: via general practitioner (GP)<br>
23 = Emergency: via bed bureau, including the central bureau<br>
24 = Emergency: via consultant out-patient clinic<br>
28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A and E department of another health care provider<br>
3. Assessing growth through time:<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
4. Low numbers:<br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146; (an asterisk).<br>
5. All diagnoses count of mentions:<br>
These figures represent a count of all mentions of a diagnosis in any of the 14 diagnosis fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field during an episode, all diagnoses are counted.<br>
Diagnosis codes used:<br>
F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>
K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>
T51&#151;Toxic effect of Alcohol<br>
6. Ungrossed Data:<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Much more needs to be done, however, particularly in maternal mortality, girls&#146; education, HIV/AIDs, malaria and other diseases, and accelerated improvements will be needed most urgently in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia if the MDGs targets are to be met.</p>

 The UK is the second largest government donor of AIDS-related assistance. In 2006-07 we provided &#163;481 million to help tackle HIV and AIDS and have a strong track record of translating G8 commitments into action. The UK has called on other G8 countries to play their part in meeting their commitments. The UK Government are in the process of updating our strategy on tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world. The needs and rights of children affected by AIDS will remain a UK priority, and this will be reflected in the update to Taking Action.</p>

 It is crucial that resources reach the communities most affected by HIV and AIDS.

DFID is supporting NASAs in several countries. DFID also supports national AIDS councils to monitor and evaluate the impact of their national AIDS strategies.</p>

 In line with our aim to get best value from the UK aid programme, DFID prioritises funding where it can make the greatest impact. Jordan is a middle-income country and does not have a bilateral DFID programme. DFID, however, continues to support Jordan through international institutions such as the European Commission, the United Nations and the World Bank. In 2005, we provided &#163;12 million through these organisations to promote good governance, economic growth and poverty reduction in Jordan. In light of this, DFID will not be directly supporting animal welfare programmes in Jordan.</p>
