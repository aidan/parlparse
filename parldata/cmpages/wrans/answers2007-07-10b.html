A graduated structure would allow more careful consideration of drivers who through lapses of concentration breach the speed limit by a relatively small amount and where even two penalty points are expected to act as a sufficient deterrent to prevent re-offending. It would also allow for a higher penalty of six penalty points to act as a strong deterrent against more extreme speeders who exceed the speed limit by large amounts.</p>

 When on training exercises at Westdown Camp (or any other training location), units have the option, during pre-exercise planning, to request that laundry facilities be secured via established contractual arrangements from service providers within the local area. Such services are publicly funded and therefore free of charge to the soldier. It is a matter for Units to decide whether or not to take advantage of these arrangements, they may either utilise the facilities available at Westdown Camp or they may hand-wash and dry their laundry themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="70710w0002.htm_para3"><a name="07071052000485">The facilities at Westdown Camp are self-operated facilities provided under contract for the convenience of soldiers. During the period January 2006 to June 2007 the income to the contractor arising from the use of the washing/drying machines at Westdown Camp was approximately &#163;7,500. A further &#163;1,500 was taken in commission by the Defence Training Estate Strategic Partner LANDMARC Support Services (LSS). Under established revenue sharing arrangements 70 per cent. of this total (&#163;1,050) was reinvested back into the maintenance of the training estate. The cost to each soldier to use these facilities is &#163;2.00 for washing and &#163;1.00 for drying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="70710w0002.htm_para4"><a name="07071052000486">Soldiers are responsible for maintaining their own personal hygiene, and this is instilled through effective training, leadership, education and example setting, particularly by Commanders. Personal hygiene is covered in soldiers Phase One training and reinforced annually through Military Annual Training Test 6 (Values and Standards). It is also covered in all pre-operational and exercise deployment health and hygiene presentations delivered by service environmental health staffs.</p>

 There are no plans to ban the use of electric shock collars. However, we recognise that future research into electric shock collars is a priority.

 No such discussions have taken place. However, I am aware that in Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), pupils learn to &#147;take and share responsibility&#148;, which can include looking after animals properly. In addition, many local authorities run their own animal welfare education schemes in schools. For example, both Coventry city council and the London borough of Lambeth give regular performances and presentations on animal welfare at primary and secondary schools. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also provides teaching resources for animal welfare education for use in classrooms.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 June 2007]: </i>Increased flood risk, from both rivers and the sea, is one of the top predicted impacts of climate change in the UK. We are considering the rising risk from climate change as part of our long-term strategy, &#145;Making Space for Water&#146;. The strategy takes a holistic approach to the management of risk across Government, together with increasing awareness and emergency preparedness within communities to help them better cope with flood events when they occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70710w0006.htm_para4"><a name="07071052000999">In January 2007, as part of &#145;Making Space for Water&#146;, we announced the start of 15 integrated urban drainage pilot studies around the country. The projects, made possible by &#163;1.7 million of funding from DEFRA, will test new approaches to reduce the risk of urban drainage flooding, both from sewers and storm water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="70710w0006.htm_para5"><a name="07071052001000">While the pilot projects will not directly fund capital improvements, they should bring greater clarity on responsibilities for funding urban drainage management between water companies, local authorities, the Environment Agency, internal drainage boards and the Highways Agency. Following completion of the pilot projects in the spring of 2008, DEFRA will produce new guidance on effective partnership working to deliver integrated drainage solutions in high-risk urban catchments and prepare a regulatory impact assessment for any proposed legislative changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="70710w0006.htm_para6"><a name="07071052001001">In addition, water companies' price limits for 2005-10 allowed a programme of nearly &#163;1 billion to safeguard homes against the risk of sewer flooding. This would resolve or mitigate every known high-risk problem of internal flooding from overloaded sewers where companies' plans said is needed by 2010. By then the proportion of properties at risk would reduce to 0.01 per cent. of households.</p>

In some exceptional cases, it is recognised that further treatment is needed. In such cases, only those products listed in Annex IIB of the Compendium of UK Organic Standards can be used, subject to the conditions set out therein.

 Levels of algal blooms are recorded continuously at one site in Liverpool Bay and less regularly elsewhere. Relatively high levels of algae occur in Liverpool Bay in spring and summer, in comparison to offshore regions or shallow regions not in the vicinity of major rivers. However, they do not cause a problem and are similar to other regions around the coast of England that are in the vicinity of major rivers. An exact comparison of levels is difficult due to differences in the frequency of measuring algal blooms. They also vary greatly from year to year.</p>

It excludes pathogen characterisation and epidemiology.</p>

Thus, the number of individuals on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. less than the number of subject profiles.

<i> [holding answer 9 July 2007]:</i> Currently all Waldorf Steiner kindergartens and Montessori pre-schools offering the free entitlement to 3 and 4-year-olds must comply with the Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage. No exemptions have been sought, or granted, from the Foundation Stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="70710w0010.htm_para13"><a name="07071052001997">From September 2008 the Foundation Stage will be superseded by the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) which will be a statutory requirement for all early years providers and will be legally enforceable. The Government carried out a formal public consultation between 1 March and 24 May 2007 on the circumstances under which exemptions to the Early Years Foundation Stage learning and development requirements might be granted and the process for such exemptions. I am considering the responses to the consultation exercise and the representations made by Waldorf Steiner and Montessori and expect to publish the Government's response to the consultation this month and regulations will follow in the autumn. The Early Years Foundation Stage is a very flexible set of requirements which is designed to be inclusive and compatible with the vast majority of educational philosophies.</p>

It provides specific advice on the supply, possession and administration for controlled drugs such as methylphenidate (commercial name Ritalin). Where a child has an ongoing health need, including medicines, schools are advised to produce an individual health care plan for a child with medical needs that identifies the level of support that is needed.</p>

Private build houses are not required to meet standards above building regulations.

 The provision of appropriate infrastructure is clearly critical to the effective delivery of the Sustainable Communities Plan.

 Whether planning permission is required for the merger of shop units depends on what work is proposed to be carried out. Unless a change of use is involved, planning permission will not usually be required if the merger involves only internal works. However, where works would affect the external appearance of a building, planning permission is likely to be required. Where planning permission is needed, local planning authorities can already prevent the merger of shop units through imposing planning conditions in the context of their planning strategy for their town centres. &#147;Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for town centres&#148; (PPS6) gives further advice on the effective use of planning conditions to ensure that the character of a development cannot subsequently be changed to create a form of development that a local authority would originally have refused.</p>

 The Implementation Group established by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to take forward the recommendations made by the independent Expert Scientific Group (ESG) held its first meeting on 27 September 2006 and has met a further four times since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_473"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para0"><a name="07071063000401">The MHRA assesses the starting doses to be administered to volunteers in clinical trials based on available toxicology and pharmacology data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para1"><a name="07071063000402">In general, the calculation of the first dose in man is based on the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) determined in non-clinical safety studies performed in the most sensitive and relevant animal species. However, a calculation of the minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) is also used and this approach is considered to be more appropriate than the NOAEL when the results of animal studies are thought less likely to predict the effect of the molecule in man.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para2"><a name="07071063000403">The MHRA has established an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) to advise on applications for clinical trials on higher risk substances, and it held its first meeting on 18 March 2007. Prior to this, and since the ESG formulated its interim advice in July 2006, advice on applications for clinical trials on higher risk substances was obtained from the CHM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para3"><a name="07071063000404">Progress is being made on implementing the ESG report recommendations as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para4"><a name="07071063000405">Recommendation one concerns the drug development process itself and the need for those involved in such programmes to be appropriately trained. The former will be addressed in the revised European Union guidance which we expect to be published by the end of July 2007. The MHRA is having discussions with relevant bodies on the latter with a view to developing a training and accreditation scheme for investigators for Phase 1 trials. We do not expect this recommendation to be implemented before 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para5"><a name="07071063000406">Recommendation two proposes a regular review of the regulatory process and has already been implemented as one of the responsibilities of the newly formed EAG.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para6"><a name="07071063000407">Recommendations three and four propose that clinical and pre-clinical unpublished studies relevant to the safety of human exposure need to be collected in a format that can be shared confidentially between regulators. Discussions on the proposal have taken place with the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and they will discuss the recommendations with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with the International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) to involve the wider regulatory population. The EMEA will also ask the European Commission about raising the issue of data sharing with other countries. The EU databases will need amendment to enable the information to be collected. We do not expect these recommendations to be implemented before 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para7"><a name="07071063000408">Recommendations five and eight recommend earlier dialogue between regulator and drug developer, and better communication between regulator and ethics committees. The recommendation on earlier dialogue has been implemented through establishing a procedure that allows for informal discussion and submission of data on higher risk substances in advance of submission of the formal clinical trial application. This will avoid the need to lengthen current formal approval times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para8"><a name="07071063000409">The recommendation on better communication was implemented in October 2006 through adoption of a Memorandum of Understanding between MHRA and ethics committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para10"><a name="07071063000411">Recommendations nine to 17 concern determining and administering the initial doses of a drug in man and are addressed in the guidance being developed by the EU scientific committee, which should be published by the end of July 2007.

<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para11"><a name="07071063000412">Recommendation 18 refers to the training of principal investigators and is being progressed with recommendation 1.</p>

The MHRA is developing a voluntary accreditation scheme for Phase 1 units which will provide assurances that they have appropriate facilities available. This scheme will be available from April 2008, although we expect an informal self assessment scheme to be implemented shortly, prior to the scheme being finalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"><a name="70710w0019.htm_para14"><a name="07071063000415">Recommendation 21 advocates widening availability of &#147;hands-on&#148; experience in the conduct of clinical trials and has wide-ranging implications for industry and those responsible for the training of medical personnel.
