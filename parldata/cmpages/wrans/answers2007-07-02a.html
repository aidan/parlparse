The Committee recommended the extension to Front-Bench speeches of the power to impose speaking limits, with certain safeguards.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 June 2007]:</i> There is a range of controls in the Firearms Act 1968 and related statutes controlling the possession and use of airguns. For example, a person must be aged 17 or over before they can buy an airgun or receive one as a gift. Anyone under 17 must normally be supervised by an adult when in possession of an airgun. It is an offence to carry an airgun in public without reasonable excuse. Other offences include possession with intent to injure, possession with intent to cause fear of violence and trespass with an airgun. Persons sentenced to three years imprisonment or longer for any offence are prohibited for life from possessing an airgun, and those sentenced to three months or more are prohibited for five years. High powered airguns are subject to certification and some are prohibited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70702w0004.htm_para17"><a name="07070238000491">The Government are further strengthening the controls on airguns through measures contained in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. It will soon become an offence for businesses to sell airguns unless they register with the police as firearms dealers. To guard against under-age sales, transactions by dealers will have to be completed in person. The Act will also increase to 18, the age limit for buying and possessing an airgun and will make it an offence for anyone of any age to fire an airgun beyond the boundary of premises.</p>

 Decisions about the selection, purchase and issue of body armour are for chief officers of police. All officers should have access to a range of body armour, either on an individual or shared basis, dependant on their role. In reaching decisions about what protective equipment to issue, chief officers have the benefit of expert advice provided by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) and the standards they produce. Body armour supplied to the vast majority of police officers in the UK now offers a dual protection level of knife and ballistic resistance as detailed in the HOSDB Standard.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Number of children lifted out of poverty is defined here as the number of children in households lifted above 60 per cent. of equivalised median household income before housing costs by increasing the level of the disregard.<br>
2. Estimates provided are indicative and should only be used to give some idea of scale, since there is uncertainty over future distributions of earnings and maintenance receipts, and figures are sensitive to the assumptions used and drawn from a sample of data.<br>
3. Figures for the number of children lifted out of poverty by a &#163;20 disregard are not available due to a small sample size.<br>
4. Poverty figures are based on analysis of 2004-05 Family Resources Survey and are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>
5. Costs are calculated to the nearest &#163;10 million and are based upon a combination of DWP administrative and survey data.<br>
6. Figures are for the extra number of children lifted out of poverty and extra costs compared to a position where there is a &#163;10 disregard in income support and a &#163;25 disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit.<br>

 It is not possible to accurately model the effect of increasing the &#163;5 flat rate payment to &#163;7 on the number of non resident parents in poverty. This is because we cannot identify with certainty which non resident parents are currently paying flat rate maintenance from the survey we use to measure poverty, the family resources survey.</p>

 We are continuing to look at ways to ensure non-resident parents meet their financial responsibilities to their children.
