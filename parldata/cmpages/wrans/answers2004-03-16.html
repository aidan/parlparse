 To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what recent discussions he has had with Network Rail Scotland on the Gourock Transport Interchange.  [160306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 I have regular discussions with Network Rail about various topics. However, the proposed Gourock Interchange is a matter for the Scottish Executive and Inverclyde Council.

<a name="40316w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 As I indicated during Second Reading of the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Bill on 9&nbsp;February, in setting out the proposals for a commission to review boundary differences and voting systems, I consulted the First Minister, who welcomed taking the debate forward.

 My right hon. Friend has discussions from time to time with the Chancellor on a range of matters. The Government look forward to Kate Barker's final report on the issues affecting housing supply and proposals for addressing these constraints.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 I regularly meet Scottish Executive colleagues to discuss matters relating to the Scottish economy. The financial services sector in Scotland remains of crucial importance to the health of the Scottish economy. Output has continued to grow in recent years and the sector currently employs over 100,000 people in Scotland.

<P>
<a name="40316w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Advocate-General for Scotland:</B> 
 Since 10&nbsp;February I received intimation of, and scrutinised, 39 devolution issues, all of which concerned Convention rights. They related to matters such as pre-trial delay, the system for setting the punishment part of life sentences, failure to communicate information required by sea fishing measures and self-incrimination. In the civil sphere, the issues of refusal of scheduled monument consent and breach of prison rules were considered. I also routinely consider Convention rights in the context of my other ministerial functions.

 The Government set out proposals to remove the remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords in the consultation paper issued in September. Without a consensus in Parliament on other issues, such as the wider composition of the second chamber, the Government will make progress where we can, keeping an open mind on proposals for further reform.

<a name="40316w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Government have announced their intention to abolish the Office of Lord Chancellor, and introduced legislation to do so on 24&nbsp;February. The Government believe that it is no longer tenable for a Cabinet Minister to head the judiciary. The Government see this, together with setting up a Supreme Court for the UK independent of the legislature and a new Judicial Appointments Commission, as important steps in the modernisation of our constitution and our judicial system.

<P>
28. <a name="40316w01.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B>

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what measures he plans to encourage witnesses and victims to come forward and give evidence in court.  [161270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Last July, the Government published a National Strategy setting out the steps we are taking to deliver improved services to victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="40316w01.html_para1">At its heart is the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, introduced last November and containing a number of measures aimed at encouraging more witnesses to come to court and give evidence.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what representations he has received on the law regarding access to bail in Northern Ireland.  [159555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40316w01.html_para2">During the course of the Government's public consultation on (what were then) proposals for a Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, several responses were received which included comments on the legislative proposals in respect of bail. In its recent report, 'The Illegal Drugs Trade and Drug Culture in Northern Ireland', the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee made recommendations in respect of the granting of bail in cases of drug trafficking and in cases where representations have been made against bail being granted. The Government have also been working closely with criminal justice agencies on the law and the operation of the bail process.
<P>

<a name="40316w01.html_para3">In recognising that bail is an important issue, the Government have brought forward a number of new measures including the creation of new offences of failing to surrender to bail, and a new power of arrest for breach of bail conditions in the aforementioned Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2004 : Column 155W</I><P>
Further provisions are being created under the Justice (NI) Bill to facilitate the police in bail enforcement. These new measures will provide the prosecution with a right of appeal against the granting of bail by a magistrates court, as well as the creation of new offences of failing to surrender to bail in Scheduled cases and an increased maximum sentence for the same offences in non-scheduled cases.

 We do not expect the proposed Animal Welfare Bill to set out detail on what equipment may or may not be used on animals.

Whether these powers will be used in respect of electronic dog collars has yet to be decided.

<P>
<a name="40316w02.html_wqn9"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the annual level of carbon emissions resulting from electrical appliances being left in standby mode.  [156342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The estimate of the Government's Market Transformation Programme is that consumer electronics, home computing equipment, domestic cooking equipment and office equipment left in stand-by mode accounted for approximately 600,000 tonnes of carbon (6.4TWh) in the UK in 2002.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para3">There is further energy consumption, for which we do not have firm estimates at present, from washing machines, dishwashers and other white goods which have a stand-by mode; from consumer electronic equipment using an external power supply that continues to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and from domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled. Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around one million tonnes of carbon.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para4">In order to try to tackle this problem the Market Transformation Programme (www.mtprog.com) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the "on" and the stand-by power consumption of household appliances through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets. This approach has been fairly successful in respect of televisions: an EU-wide voluntary agreement will mean that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK will soon consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&#150;8 watts consumed by older models. We expect this agreement to be extended to cover DVD players shortly. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2004 : Column 158W</I><P>
A similar agreement for external power supplies aims to encourage new power supplies consuming around half a watt in stand-by mode compared to the present average of just over 2 watts.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para5">In addition, the Government's initiative on sustainable procurement, announced last autumn, includes a requirement for government departments which purchase computers and televisions to specify low stand-by power requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department is taking to prevent the accidental deaths of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;dolphins and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;porpoises in UK fishing activities.  [160237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government have funded a number of research projects to identify fisheries in which accidental deaths of dolphin and porpoise bycatch occurs and to develop and trial measures to reduce this bycatch. This work has identified in particular a dolphin bycatch problem in the offshore pair trawl fishery for bass. Trials of an escape grid mechanism to reduce this bycatch are currently taking place. Work has also identified that acoustic devices known as pingers are effective in reducing bycatch of harbour porpoises in fixed gear fisheries.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para6">Building on this and other research work this Department, along with Devolved Administrations, published in March 2003 the UK Small Cetacean Bycatch Response Strategy which made a number of recommendations for measures to reduce bycatch. As EU measures will be most effective in reducing bycatch in community waters, the implementation of this strategy will need to take account of the outcome of current discussions on European Commission proposals to reduce bycatch. I welcome the Commission proposals and I am looking for their early implementation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Department provides funding for the Natural History Museum's Cetacean (and Turtle) Strandings Scheme, which monitors and investigates porpoise and dolphin strandings around the UK. The work is carried out in partnership with the Institute of Zoology and the Scottish Agricultural College.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para7">Defra and its predecessors have supported this work since 1990 and my Department is currently providing the Natural History Museum with funding of &#163;1,610,966.00 for the scheme (for the period 2000&#150;01 to 2005&#150;06). This brings our total support over the last 10 years to over &#163;2.7&nbsp;million.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para8">The work provides valuable information on causes of, and trends in, cetacean mortality around the British Isles. It involves maintaining records of stranded cetaceans and analysing tissue and bone samples to enable their physiology and reaction to various pollutants and chemicals to be assessed. The work has developed a number of methodologies which have 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2004 : Column 159W</I><P>
provided significant advances in the study of cetaceans. The maintenance of a tissue bank provides a useful source of material for many other organisations and individuals undertaking research into marine mammals. Data gleaned from this research have also been used within Defra to examine the impact on marine life of agricultural pesticides run-off, and to examine the impacts of pollutants on marine mammals.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para9">Investigation of cetacean strandings under this scheme contributes towards the UK's systems of monitoring bycatch under the requirements of the EC Habitats Directive, and to our commitments to study cetacean strandings under the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) requires member states to undertake surveillance of the conservation status of cetaceans, to monitor the incidental capture and killing of cetaceans and, in the light of information gathered, to take further research or conservation measures as required to ensure incidental capture and killing does not have a significant negative impact on the species. The Department implements these requirements through support for numerous research, data collection and surveillance projects.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para10">The UK was one of several EU member states that provided funding for the collaborative Small Cetacean Abundance in the North Sea (SCANS) survey in 1994. The Department is now committing further funds (&#163;275,000) to support another such survey (entitled SCANS II) to repeat and extend the work carried out in 1994.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para11">We have also provided funding amounting to over &#163;2.7&nbsp;million over 10 years for the Natural History Museum's long-term research into cetacean strandings in the UK. In addition, we have commissioned a number of specific research projects during the last decade monitoring bycatch levels in specific fisheries and researching potential measures to reduce bycatch. Last year the Department committed a further &#163;1&nbsp;million to more research in this area.
<P>

<a name="40316w02.html_para12">In 2003 the Department also produced the UK Small Cetacean Bycatch Response Strategy consultation paper. One of the recommendations contained in the Strategy in respect of the Habitats Directive is for the UK to develop an expanded bycatch monitoring scheme to assess levels of bycatch in UK fisheries at a statistically valid level. We shall now consider how best to develop such a scheme to also take into account recent European Commission proposals for the reduction of cetacean bycatch, including requirements for monitoring.

<P>
<a name="40316w03.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The model of decoupled payment instituted in England should not impact on milk prices, if farmers treat their payments as decoupled. Decoupled payments are by their nature not linked to production and should not therefore be used to offset the cost of production. If some farmers treat their payments as coupled and use them to subsidise production, this will tend to reduce prices for all dairy farmers. We believe that the transition to an area based payment will result in a purer form of decoupling that will more completely break the link between production and subsidy.

 The recommendations in DG (SANCO) 3367/2001 were: to improve official controls over the disposal of waste food from catering establishments, and, to improve official controls over the disposal of waste food from prohibited sources at point of entry and the safe destruction of seized products.
<P>

<a name="40316w03.html_para3">The report recognised that the action already taken to ban the feeding of swill to livestock that the UK introduced in May 2001, "greatly" reduced the risk of introducing and spreading FMD or CSF from waste food. Following the introduction of the ban former swill feeders and processors of waste from catering establishments were monitored. For the 12 month period after the ban visits were made to former swill feeder premises to check compliance with the new requirements. The visits took place after approximately 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months from the date of the ban.

The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your question concerning the change in size of parliamentary electorate for each South Yorkshire parliamentary constituency between 2001 and 2003. I am replying in his absence. (161336)
<BR>
Attached is a table showing the total and percentage change of the number of registered parliamentary electors in South Yorkshire over the period 1&nbsp;December 2001 to 1&nbsp;December 2003.
<BR>
It should be noted that these figures represent the number of registered electors. In many cases, larger decreases may be due to 'cleaning' the registers to ensure that they accurately reflect the electorate, rather than 'real' decreases in the number of electors.

The information provided by disclosures is used by law enforcement agencies in a range of ways to detect crime and trace the proceeds of crime. For example, such information may contribute to an ongoing investigation or be the trigger for a new one, or may be held on the relevant intelligence databases for use in future cases.<P>

<a name="40316w05.html_para6">Given the variety of ways in which this information is used, it is not possible to link particular disclosures with particular prosecutions and convictions. But the reporting system is a key element of the UK's defences against money laundering. In their 2003 review for the Government of the system, the consultants KPMG examined a sample of disclosures. Of those whose impact could be specifically identified, one-third were found to have contributed to a positive law enforcement outcome such as prosecution, confiscation of criminal proceeds or cash seizure. More recent analysis by NCIS in relation to the impact of one category of disclosures (those where an institution has sought consent to proceed with a transaction) suggests that in the last year &#163;25&nbsp;million of assets have been seized, restrained or returned to the victim.

<a name="40316w05.html_para8">The reporting system is a key element in the United Kingdom's defences against money laundering and an important source of intelligence on all types of acquisitive crime (drugs trafficking, theft, fraud, and all other types of crime committed for financial gain). It is crucial to ensure that the system is effective and that the costs it places on the private sector are proportionate. It was against this background that the Government commissioned the consultants KPMG to examine the reporting system and to make recommendations as to how it could be improved. The Home Office published KPMG's report on 8&nbsp;July 2003, and set up a Taskforce to support the process of modernising and streamlining the reporting system, as recommended in the report. The Taskforce's membership is drawn from key interested parties in the public and private sectors and the Financial Services Authority.
<P>

<a name="40316w05.html_para9">A major programme to improve the reporting system has been under way in recent months, which has led to substantial improvements in the timeliness and quality of the information NCIS provide to law enforcement agencies. We have received a number of representations from private sector institutions about ways in which the reporting system should be improved. These have been taken into consideration as part of the reform programme.
<P>

 Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) was introduced in October 1999. A time series of the number of families claiming the Child Care Tax Credit as part of WFTC is shown in Table 1.3 of "Working Families Tax Credit Statistics. Quarterly Enquiry. November 2002".
<P>

<a name="40316w05.html_para11">WFTC was replaced by working tax credit (WTC) at April 2003. The number of families benefiting from the child care element of WTC is shown in Table 4.4 of each issue of "Child and Working Tax Credits. Quarterly Statistics". The introduction of WTC has resulted in a large increase in the number of families benefiting from this help with their child care costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations the Government has made in the last year to the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;International Civil Aviation Organisation and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;its other member states regarding the possible removal of the exemption of aviation fuel from taxation.  [158954]<P>

<a name="40316w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 At a meeting of ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection in February 2004 the UK supported the use of economic instruments like emissions trading or charging to tackle the climate change impact of aviation. When the matter was raised formally at the ICAO 33rd Assembly in Autumn 2001, the overwhelming majority of states spoke out against the introduction of a tax on aviation fuel. The Government remains committed to finding alternative ways of applying the 'polluter pays' principle to civil aviation. Specific proposals were set out in the Future of Air Transport White Paper published on 16&nbsp;December 2003.

<P>

<a name="40316w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We keep our aviation security regime under regular review, consulting with the industry as necessary.

<a name="40316w07.html_para1">The Council was unable to reach a General Approach on the proposed amendment to Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of lorries for the use of certain roads (the 'Eurovignette' Directive). The Presidency tabled a compromise package in an attempt to reach agreement. Following some debate, there was a general willingness to accept most aspects of the compromise. However, the Commissioner insisted that compulsory hypothecation of toll revenues be part of the package.

The Presidency invited comments from Ministers, which would provide guidance for the next stage. In the Commission's view, the present US offer was inadequate and balanced in the US's favour. Nevertheless, the Commission believed that it would be appropriate to try to reach a partial agreement by the end of the year, accompanied by a strong commitment by the US to negotiate a further stage. I agreed that the present offer was unbalanced and argued that if it were agreed there would be no incentive for the US to engage in further negotiations. It would also set a bad precedent for the EU's aviation relations with other third countries. A genuine OAA offered enormous opportunities for both EU and US airlines and should be pursued with determination. Most member states agreed that the current offer was not balanced and that the Commission should continue negotiating for a better outcome. The Presidency concluded that COREPER and the Special Committee should monitor developments in the next round of negotiations.

Spain also noted that not all member states had yet transposed Vessel Traffic monitoring Directive 2002/59/EC, and that the lack of a uniform approach endangered maritime safety. Spain further insisted that a common approach was needed towards parties responsible for oil pollution, including owners.

 There are a range of applications for used tyres in both whole and shredded form, including engineering uses, incorporation into sports and safety surfaces and energy recovery in cement kilns. The number of tyres being put to such use is growing strongly as the industry anticipates the July 2006 ban on their disposal to landfill. There is legislation in place covering the handling and movement of used tyres, as with other wastes, but the Government are currently considering whether this existing framework needs to be strengthened in any way while the adjustment away from landfill disposal takes place. We continue to discuss these issues with the tyre industry and other interested parties.

The evaluation was commissioned to evaluate the Internet Proficiency Scheme which was designed to help Key Stage 2 pupils learn how to use the internet and other technologies safely and responsibly.
<P>

<a name="40316w09.html_para1">The CRU evaluation found that the number of children aged 8 to 11 years using chatrooms was decreasing. When questioned by researchers in 2002, two in 10 children of a group of 1,331 admitted to using chatrooms on more than one occasion. In 2003, the figure dropped to one in ten, when 330 children were asked the same question. Also in 2002, two out of a group of 100 children admitted to attending face-to-face meetings with people that they had met online. This number increased to three out of a group of 100 children in the same age range in 2003.
<P>

<a name="40316w09.html_para2">The evaluation suggests that over 90&nbsp;per cent. of primary schools did not let their students use internet chat facilities on their premises and that all schools had taken some action to keep children using the internet safe. This included using technology, such as content filtering software, and creating clear written policies that outline how children should use the internet at school.

 Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) can be made by magistrates courts and the Crown court where the court is satisfied that an offender aged 16 or over is dependent on or has a propensity to misuse drugs, and requires and may be susceptible to treatment. A court shall not make a DTTO unless it is satisfied that arrangements have been or can be made for the treatment intended to be specified in the order, and the offender expresses his willingness to comply with its requirements. To determine an offender's suitability for the order, the Probation Service will carry out an assessment in conjunction with treatment services, usually during an adjournment for a Pre Sentence Report.

 The cost assumptions and cost estimates which have been used in the preparation of the Home Office's business case have not been placed in the public domain for reasons of commercial confidentiality. These estimates are based on extensive research and consultation with stakeholders both within and outside Government, and will be the subject of further refinement as the programme progresses.

Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). Quick checks searches can be conducted by immigration officers anywhere and a result known within three minutes.
<P>

<a name="40316w10.html_para2">There are around 300 quick checks facilities within the Immigration Service including local enforcement offices around the country. Approximately 20 quick checks facilities have been placed in police stations to check identities of suspects if the Police think IND may have an interest in them.
<P>

<a name="40316w10.html_para3">Quick checks have also been used in a pilot visa application process in Sri Lanka, which is now being repeated in several east African countries in order to collect fingerprints of individuals requesting visas. These data are held on IAFS.
<P>

<a name="40316w10.html_para4">Some police forces use readers to check fingerprints in joint working with the Immigration Service. Finger print readers will also be used by Northamptonshire police in a pilot later this year involving automated number plate recognition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w10.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Home Office is working on designing a process which enables an individual to be registered in a convenient and timely manner. However, it is too early at present to specify the exact registration times that will be taken. Projects such as the UK Passport Service biometric trial will help to inform the estimates of the registration time.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of how DNA information might be used alongside other biometric data when identity cards are introduced.  [161223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w10.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 DNA has well-known applications in identification of people in a law enforcement context and is both universal and able to discriminate among a very large number of individuals. However, the requirements of an identity card scheme are for high-volume, real-time identity verification and so DNA would be unsuitable because of the specialist expertise and length of time needed in taking and analysing samples.

This will provide guidance to those working in the field on the issues that need to be considered in determining whether acts of "making" fall within the scope of the defence. We have consulted bodies representing internet service providers and other interested parties on the content of the document. It is intended that the final document will be published on the Crown Prosecution Service website when the Sexual Offences Act comes into force.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the Court of Appeal has powers to reduce a sentence if the sentence is not considered to be wrong in principle.  [156313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w11.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Sections 9(1) and 11(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 grant the Court of Appeal a very wide discretion to deal with appeals against sentence as it thinks fit, subject only to the proviso that it must not increase the sentence imposed by the Crown court. However, the criminal division of the Court of Appeal is generally bound by its own precedents. When considering an appeal against sentence on the ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle, the Court of Appeal has traditionally made it clear that it will not interfere with the Crown court's sentence if that sentence is right in principle (i.e. within the general reach of the Crown court's discretion and not manifestly excessive). The interpretation of legislation is, however, a matter for the courts.

<P>
<a name="40316w12.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government acknowledge the damaging impact that export subsidies have on the poor in developing countries by depressing world market prices and distorting trade. Evidence suggests that with elimination of all agricultural export subsidies from the expected levels in 2005, it is estimated that annual global incomes would be US$3.6 billion a year higher by 2010, than if expected levels of export subsidies persisted and there were no further reforms.
<P>

<a name="40316w12.html_para1">It is for this reason we have pressed for reductions in the use of export subsidies in Europe. We fully support the commitment made at the Doha ministerial meeting in 2001, which agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.
<P>

<a name="40316w12.html_para2">However, export subsidies cannot be tackled in isolation, as they are a consequence of high internal support prices and restricted access to the EU market for developing country exporters. While the Common Agricultural Policy reforms agreed in June last year don't deal explicitly with export subsidies, they will result in the de-linking of domestic support from production and this is expected to lead to real changes in output, by gradually reducing the incentives for EU farmers to over-produce. This in turn will reduce the need to dispose of surpluses onto the world market through the use of export subsidies. The reforms that have been made to the CAP mean that the EU is now able to reduce its export subsidies to about 25&nbsp;per cent. of the level that was paid 10 years ago.

<a name="40316w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The European Commission budget is approved annually. This approval process sets two distinct budget figures. The first is for commitments adopted and reflects the total value of all operations which the Commission expects to be approved over the financial year. The payments budget line on the other hand represents the aggregated spending forecast for the year, based on various approvals from previous years. There is therefore no one single identifiable country or thematic destination for the sum to which the questions refer.
<P>

<a name="40316w12.html_para3">There is no direct causal or operational linkage between the commitments and payments appropriations figures in external action or pre-accession budget lines. Individual projects or programmes may span several years from the date of commitment, stretching the spending horizon accordingly. In addition the actual rate of forecasted spend can be affected by project or programme-specific or wider external factors.

<P>
<a name="40316w13.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The European Union (EU) Common Market Organisation for sugar is highly distorted and discriminatory and is unsustainable in its current form. Using a system of quotas and prohibitively high tariffs access has been denied to the EU market for all but a handful of developing country suppliers for more than 30 years. In addition, those developing countries without preferential access to the EU sugar market 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2004 : Column 196W</I><P>
struggle to compete in third markets with the highly subsidised EU sugar exports. The price of sugar on the EU market is kept artificially high with the consumer ultimately paying through the high end price for sugar and products containing sugar. Estimates vary but put the cost to taxpayers at approximately $2 billion each year. Reform is much needed and long overdue.
<P>

<a name="40316w13.html_para0">The European Commission has not yet tabled any proposals but has set out three options for reform. The Government are still considering which of these specific options represents the best way ahead. Any change to such a highly distorted regime will bring some losers as well as winners. Some of the less efficient traditional preferential suppliers will be affected and may need some sort of transitional assistance to help them adapt. The precise nature and scale of this assistance will depend on the nature and scale of the reform itself. DFID is working closely with other Government Departments to look at the implications of these options for developing countries and identify what assistance might be necessary.

 Treatment of HIV is understood to mean treatment of AIDS retroviral infection, through Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), as well as treatment of the opportunistic infections it causes.
<P>

<a name="40316w13.html_para1">The number of people who have died of AIDS in Zambia in the last five years is not known; because of stigma and limited diagnostic capacity, AIDS is often not stated or acknowledged as a cause of death. However, from official Government of Zambia figures it is estimated that an average of 100,000 people have died from AIDS in the last five years.
<P>

<a name="40316w13.html_para2">ART was provided by provincial hospitals in Zambia for the first time in 2003. Over 1,000 clients are accessing this treatment at present. The quality of ART has yet to be assessed. However, while the health sector is under funded (with a resource gap of &#163;94&nbsp;million per year, or 50&nbsp;per cent. of the health funding needed), and numbers of health workers are falling (at an estimated 10&nbsp;per cent. per year) due to emigration and health problems, the quality of AIDS treatment is likely to remain poor.
<P>

<a name="40316w13.html_para3">Part of DFID's &#163;20&nbsp;million HIV/AIDS programme in Zambia provides monitoring and evaluation consultancy services in support of monitoring treatment quality. A further &#163;20&nbsp;million programme is supporting the strengthening of Zambia's health systems and financing the delivery of public health services, including to people living with HIV/AIDS and those affected by associated opportunistic infections.

<a name="40316w13.html_para4">Recent efforts to direct limited resources to where they are most needed have resulted in modest improvements.

 Details of procurement expenditure are not available broken down by service.

This division does not necessarily match the end destination of the equipment. For example not all aerospace equipment is used solely by the RAF. Since 1998&#150;99 the format for recording expenditure has changed following the introduction of Smart Acquisition and the move from cash to Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB). Expenditure on procurement is now subsumed within the Principal Headings of the Defence Budget (Table 1.3 of the 2003 UK Defence Statistics). The Government's most recent expenditure plans for Defence (Cm 5912) published in May 2003 also identify procurement expenditure under the RAB regime. The 2002&#150;03 accounts of the Defence Procurement Agency, HC2, are available in the Library of the House, and provide a summary of its expenditure on equipment procurement against the major Defence capability areas. Detail of equipment expenditure by region has not been included in the UK Defence Statistics since 2001.

 Any re-organisation would be based on the need to ensure that the Army is able to respond to the changing strategic environment and meet the operational challenges of the future. This is vital if the armed forces are to be prepared for the broad range of operational tasks that they are likely to be engaged in. However, history and tradition are, of course, also important and are always considered.

 We currently have a requirement to provide for the land environment accurate, timely and high quality imagery to UK commanders. To meet this requirement the Watchkeeper programme is on track to deliver from 2006 an intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (IS TAR) system using tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Watchkeeper will subsume the in-service Phoenix UAV capability. In response to an urgent operational requirement arising in Iraq, we have acquired Desert Hawk mini-UAVs from the United States. I am withholding details about their use in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information for reasons of operational security.

<a name="40316w15.html_para0">There are currently no plans to procure other operational UAVs. We have established the Joint UAV Experimentation Programme (JUEP) to explore the wider operational utility of UAV systems in the joint battlespace, including an investigation into the utility of UAVs for maritime operations. Under the Future Offensive Air System programme we expect to look at a potential mix of platforms, including Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs), to meet our future strike capability from around the end of the next decade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what further measures are being taken to reduce youth unemployment in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the Jarrow constituency, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;South Tyneside, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;Tyne and Wear and <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;the United Kingdom;  [159507]

<P>
<a name="40316w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Through a combination of economic stability and radical labour market reforms, more than 1.7&nbsp;million more people are in work now than in 1997 and unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975. Despite a period of global economic insecurity the UK has prospered so that both the UK employment rate and ILO unemployment rate are the best of the major industrialised (G7) countries.
<P>

<a name="40316w19.html_para0">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are providing everyone of working age&#151;the unemployed, lone parents, sick and disabled people&#151;with advice, guidance and a full range of support to help them move into work.
<P>

<a name="40316w19.html_para1">Jarrow has shared in this success. As well as the reductions in claimant unemployment in Jarrow since 1997, long term youth unemployment has been cut by 85&nbsp;per cent. The local Jobcentre has played an important part in these achievements, helping clients move into work and working closely with employers. By the end of December 2003, the New Deal, had helped over 479,500 young people move from welfare into work in the UK, including over 7,500 in the South Tyneside and Gateshead District and over 1,200 in Jarrow.

<P>
<a name="40316w19.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 excludes persons subject to immigration control (mainly asylum seekers) from income-related and other non-contributory social security benefits, from 3&nbsp;April 2000 the Home Office is responsible for supporting and accommodating asylum seekers awaiting a determination of their case. Therefore, asylum seekers would not be eligible for a Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment. However, those asylum seekers in receipt of income-related benefits prior to 3&nbsp;April 2000 continue to be entitled to social security benefits, including a Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment provided they have attained the age of 60 in the qualifying week.
<P>

<a name="40316w19.html_para5">Asylum seekers granted refugee status are no longer subject to immigration control and are entitled to social security benefits on the same basis as UK nationals. A person granted refugee status would therefore qualify for a winter fuel payment in the same way as other UK residents aged 60 or over.

 The Government commissioned the Independent Review of Supporting People after the resources required by local authorities increased substantially during the course of last year.

<a name="40316w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 There is a statutory requirement for drug education, including alcohol education in the National Curriculum Science Order. This represents the statutory minimum. In addition, schools are expected to use the non-statutory frameworks for Personal Social Health Education (PSHE) and Citizenship at key stages 1 and 2, PSHE at key stages 3 and 4 and the Citizenship programme of study at key stages 3 and 4 as the context for developing drug and alcohol education. We believe drug education in schools has an essential role to play in enabling pupils to develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes and understanding about drugs.
<P>

<a name="40316w21.html_para0">Since 1997, we have made over &#163;70&nbsp;million available to local education authorities to support drug alcohol and tobacco education and prevention in schools. For the last three years, we have supported the development of training packages to support professionals deliver effective drug and alcohol education. From April, we will be supporting up to 3,000 teachers in the PSHE certificate which sets standards in the teaching of drug and alcohol education.
<P>

<a name="40316w21.html_para1">Together with the Home Office and Department of Health, we are supporting a national five-year research programme called "Blueprint" to test the effectiveness of drug education initiatives in schools.

 We do not hold information in the form requested. Capital allocations are now largely made by formulae to local authorities and schools, linked to Asset Management Plans. In addition, all schools have, since 2000&#150;01, received Devolved Formula capital to use on their most urgent capital needs.

The aim of the pathfinders was to test out a variety of approaches used by schools and authorities in the development of family and community facilities and services on school premises. Evaluation findings will be made available shortly.

 The results from the 2003 National Curriculum tests showed that 75&nbsp;per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached Level 4 in English and 73&nbsp;per cent. in mathematics. These results represent a significant improvement in standards&#151;of 12 percentage points in English and 11 percentage points in mathematics&#151;since 1997, reflecting the impact of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies on primary schools. We remain absolutely committed, through our new Primary Strategy, to supporting schools to achieve the ambitious targets we have set for standards of literacy and numeracy.

 Information on the number of new child care places created in an individual constituency is available only from 1999. Buckinghamshire local authority reported that between April 1999 and December 2003, 1,166 new child care places opened in Buckingham constituency. A place typically helps more than one child, as not all children take up places full-time, and we estimate these places will help some 2,200 children. During the same period, Buckinghamshire reported that 100 child care places closed in Buckingham, so that the stock of child care places rose by 1,066.

 "Drugs: Guidance to Schools" will be sent to all schools this month. The guidance highlights the option for schools to employ drug testing. The guidance applies to all maintained schools and pupil referral units in England. It is for headteachers to decide whether to employ drug testing&#151;random or not.
<P>

<a name="40316w24.html_para0">A school's governing body decides on its behaviour policy. The head teacher has discretion to exclude pupils in response to serious breaches of this policy, taking individual circumstances into account.
<P>

<a name="40316w24.html_para1">Local education authorities and school governing bodies are responsible for deciding local school admission arrangements, but cannot make admission dependent on parents signing any form of parental declaration, which would include parental permission for random drug testing. Parental permission could form part of a home- school agreement between parents and schools. Home-school agreements cannot be made a condition of entry to any maintained school. Procedures on testing and sanctions should be contained in the school's drug policy and be developed through wide consultation with members of the school community.
<P>

<a name="40316w24.html_para2">Any costs of obtaining parental permission will of course depend on the decisions of individual heads as to how often, how and when to seek such permissions. For example if done through an existing system such as existing home-school contracts the costs will be close to zero. If a separate exercise were undertaken the costs would be likely to be higher. These will be matters for heads to consider in the light of their local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40316w24.html_para3">It will be for schools to decide on the scope of drug testing taking into account the school's drug policy and the employment contracts of those working in the school. A school's drug policy should make clear to which activities the policy applies, including after school and out of school activities, and the scope of any drug testing strategy contained in the policy.

 PFI contracts are usually between the local authority and a private contractor. It is therefore for the authority to ensure that negotiations include the use of sports facilities by community groups. My Department does not have a direct role in the negotiations themselves. The authority's Outline Business Case, which requires approval by the Treasury-chaired Project Review Group, must include a timetable which allows sufficient time for the consideration of key issues such as the community use of facilities. Projects which involve community use are encouraged; not only does the community benefit, but the annual fee payable by the local authority may be reduced, in recognition of the revenue that is generated by the facilities.

<P>
<a name="40316w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Proposals to close a school sixth form may be published by the LEA or Governing Body depending on the category of school. Proposals to close a school sixth form after two poor Ofsted reports may also be published by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). For both types of proposals the five stages in the process are consultation; publication; a six week representation period (one month in the case of LSC proposals); decision and implementation. LEAs may determine their own proposals to close schools sixth forms provided there are no objections to the proposals. Where there are objections&#151;including from the school concerned&#151;proposals fall to be considered by the School Organisation Committee (SOC) or schools adjudicator if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision. LEAs and LSCs are represented on SOCs along with other key groups.
<P>

<a name="40316w25.html_para0">As part of a reorganisation of 16&#150;19 provision, the LSC can also publish a proposal to close a school sixth form following recommendations in an Ofsted Area Inspection report, or where they can demonstrate that the proposals will improve participation, raise standards or broaden the range of provision. The steps in this process are to publish a preliminary notice and consult for at least two months; publish formal proposals with a further two-month objections period; and submit the proposals to the Secretary of State one month later for a decision.
<P>

<a name="40316w25.html_para1">Neither the SOC nor the school adjudicator is accountable to the LEA. Apart from judicial review, there is no statutory appeals process following decisions by the SOC, the adjudicator or Secretary of State.

 The information is not available in the form requested. In January 2003, there were 40 vacancies for full-time teachers in maintained schools in the Lancashire local education authority (LEA) area, which includes Chorley.
<P>

<a name="40316w25.html_para5">Like other areas, since 1997 Chorley has benefited from the initiatives that the Government have put in place to recruit and retain teachers and to increase the number of staff supporting them in schools. Since 1997, the number of full-time equivalent regular teachers in maintained schools in the former Lancashire LEA area has risen by 390, from 11,870 to 12,260 in 2003. Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalent school support staff in the area has grown by 2,870 from 3,620 to 6,490 in 2003.

 With respect to its annual reviews of English national health service bodies and cross-border strategic health authorities there is no statutory duty on the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI) to consult in relation to the criteria it devises under section 50 of the Act. However, we anticipate that CHAI will consult NHS bodies in relation to those criteria, continuing the current practice of the Commission for Health Improvement.

 The Government are committed to rebuilding and restoring national health service dentistry to improve oral health. New legislation in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service, properly integrated with the rest of the NHS. The aim is to deliver better access to services, better working lives for dentists and their teams, better oral health and an improved patient experience.
<P>

<a name="40316w26.html_para3">Under the proposals in the Act, primary care trusts (PCTs) will assume responsibility for providing primary care dental services. With these responsibilities will go the financial resources held centrally, which currently amount to &#163;1.2 billion.
<P>

<a name="40316w26.html_para4">As part of the new arrangements, the current remuneration system, which is based on item-of-service fees, will be abolished and replaced by a much simpler contract. Under transitional arrangements we are developing a simple but robust 'base contract' which all dentists and PCTs will be able to put in place from 2005. These transitional arrangements will provide protection of dentists gross earnings for three years to enable them to come off the treadmill of item of service fees, to see their patients at intervals appropriate to their oral health needs and to modernise and adjust their workload. These proposals are set out in "Framework proposals for primary dental services in England from 2005", which was published on 24&nbsp;February and on which we are currently seeking views from dental representative bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w26.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 We have undertaken a review of the dental primary care workforce in consultation with representatives of the dental profession&#151;professional bodies, dental academics, as well as the British Dental Association (BDA). The matters under consideration included the age structure of the dental profession, the increasing number of women dentists, our commitment to develop team-working in dentistry, and the impact of our reforms to the contractual and remuneration arrangements which are intended to make National Health Service dentistry more attractive to dental practices. We intend to publish the report shortly.
<P>

<a name="40316w26.html_para5">We have also worked closely with the BDA to draw up proposals for a new contract from April 2005, which will remove the treadmill of item of service. This links with the new duties primary care trusts (PCTs) will have from April 2005 to secure the provision of primary

dental care services. With these new responsibilities will go the financial resources currently held centrally, which by 2005&#150;06 are expected to total nearly &#163;1.5 billion.
<P>

<a name="40316w26.html_para6">These proposals, in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 in relation to primary dental services, represent the most radical reform of NHS dentistry since 1948. They will give a better deal for patients, for dentists and for the NHS and should lead to an increase in the number of NHS dentists.
<P>

<a name="40316w26.html_para7">In the meantime we have provided new investment totalling &#163;90&nbsp;million to NHS dentistry over the last year. This is aimed at increasing the number of NHS dentists and increasing access to NHS dentistry for patients. &#163;59&nbsp;million will support access, and strategic health authorities have been advised of their shares and are working with their PCTs to address access issues. &#163;30&nbsp;million is to support information technology and the balance of &#163;1&nbsp;million will support organisational development locally.

 The information on dentist numbers given in the reply of 28&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 399W, covered the numbers of principal and assistant dentists. These are dentists in the general dental service (GDS) at September 2003. These figures exclude groups of national health service dentists: vocational dental practitioners in the GDS; salaried dentists in the GDS, dentists in the personal dental service and dentists in the community dental service.
<P>

<a name="40316w26.html_para8">The source of the information in that reply is the Dental Practice Board. Information on which dentists are taking NHS patients is held on the NHS.UK website at www.nhs.uk. The information on that website is provided by primary care trusts. The information will cover all NHS dental providers; not just principals and assistants in the GDS. The information given in the reply of 14&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 800W, was for the situation on Thursday 4&nbsp;December. The figures counted dentists in surgeries which were taking new NHS patients.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w28.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Government acknowledges the importance and value of primary prevention of osteoporotic fracture. That is why the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has accepted the appraisal committee's recommendation to address the prevention of fractures in post-menopausal women who have not yet had a fracture through their technology appraisal for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. This will inform recommendations on the clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments for primary prevention.
<P>

<a name="40316w28.html_para5">NICE is also developing a clinical guideline to look at the assessment of fracture risk and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in individuals at high risk.

 Where general practitioners opt out, primary care trusts (PCTs) will be able to consider a range of alternative providers; for example: NHS Direct, ambulance services, national health service walk-in centres, GP co-operatives or their successor organisations, paramedics and deputising services.




<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2004 : Column 253W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40316w28.html_para6">This will allow the PCTs to plan and commission innovative and integrated services focusing on the most appropriate provider for the range of care required with an enhanced focus on the use of triage and skill-mix. The service is likely to be less reliant on doctors and make more use of nurses and others such as ambulance staff. Through this approach a flexible, more responsive service can be developed with staff trained to provide a range of interventions. This will provide a better service for patients.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Section 39(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that when the office of Speaker (Presiding Officer) is vacant, his functions may be exercised by a deputy. The functions of the Speaker may therefore be exercised by a Deputy Speaker, following the resignation of Lord Alderdice. During suspension those functions are confined to those arising under the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and relate principally to the resignation of members of the Assembly, and the notification of vacancies.

<a name="40316w32.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will estimate the cost resulting from teenage pregnancies in Northern Ireland in the last year for which figures are available.  [160627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The estimated annual cost of teenage pregnancies is &#163;27&nbsp;million. This is made up of an estimated &#163;24&nbsp;million in Social Security Benefits and administration plus tax revenue foregone over 1&#189; years, together with &#163;2.5&nbsp;million direct hospital delivery costs, and an estimated &#163;0.5&nbsp;million on actions aimed at reducing the number of teenage pregnancies.

<a name="40316w32.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Mallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the review of funding of the voluntary sector; and when policy emerging from that review is likely to be implemented.  [160363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In acknowledgment of the concerns around the longer term sustainability of the voluntary and community sector the Government established a Task Force on Resourcing the Voluntary and Community Sector in Northern Ireland in February 2003. Membership of the Task Force consists of representatives from the statutory sector and a number of independent members.
<P>

<a name="40316w32.html_para4">Under its Terms of Reference, the Task Force has been asked to identify action to be taken to ensure that the voluntary and community sector can continue to make a substantial contribution to the achievement of Government objectives and to the well-being of the Northern Ireland community. It will also seek to identify the impact of impending changes to funding programmes and actions which may be necessary to diversify support for the sector, in the context of an agreed definition of sustainability.
<P>

<a name="40316w32.html_para5">The Task Force established Working Groups comprising key stakeholders to consider themes important to both Government and the voluntary and community sector. It also took account of submissions received and commissioned research to compile their Position Paper, "Pathways for Change", which was published in December 2003. The document has been 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2004 : Column 266W</I><P>
the subject of widespread public consultation which will conclude on 26&nbsp;March 2004. Final recommendations from the Task Force will be available in early summer.
<P>

<a name="40316w32.html_para6">Until these recommendations have been received it is not possible to comment on any policy which may emerge or an implementation date.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for what reasons the basis for core funding of ethnic minority voluntary groups has been changed to a one year cycle.  [160364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Hull North (Mr. McNamara) on 4&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 945W.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Mallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether an equality impact assessment has been carried out on funding policy for ethnic minority voluntary groups.  [160457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40316w32.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The funding scheme for minority ethnic voluntary organisations was not the subject of an equality impact assessment when it was established in April 2001.
<P>

<a name="40316w32.html_para7">In the event of any change to the policy of the existing scheme, in light of the new Race Equality Strategy, it will be subject to assessment under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
