 Payments made to train operating companies by the Strategic Rail Authority under franchise agreements are automatically adjusted by the amount of any change in fixed track access charges determined by the Rail Regulator. For the current control period the amount of 10-year plan funding committed to the rail industry was set, and subsequently adjusted, to reflect the (October 2000) final conclusions of the Rail Regulator's periodic review of access charges. For future control periods, track access charges will be determined by future periodic reviews.

<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he makes of the environmental cost resulting from aviation industry use of UK airports.  [60432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The then DETR reported on available estimates of environmental costs in "Valuing the External Costs of Aviation", which was published in December 2000. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimates he has made of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions from aviation over the next 20 years.  [60430]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides forecasts of carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft over the next 20 years and beyond for a range of scenarios. They can be found in figure 1 on page 6 of their report "Aviation and the Global Atmosphere" (1999). These estimates are generally accepted to be the best currently available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the change in fuel efficiency of aircraft, using UK airports, over the last 30 years.  [60428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Specific information on fuel efficiency of aircraft using UK airports is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Aviation industry representatives estimate that global fuel consumption per passenger kilometre has been reduced by about 60 per cent. since 1970, largely through improvements in engine and airframe technology. Reasons for these improvements include more stringent standards as well as commercial initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the assumptions used to set the five-year price cap regime for NATS in 2001.  [60657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 National Air Traffic Services (NATS) is subject to price regulation by the RPI-X method, which is the standard model for monopoly regulation in the United Kingdom. The charge cap, or "X" factor, for the first five 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 2002 : Column 184W</I><P>
years of the public private partnership (PPP) was set by the Government, in the light of advice received from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para0">The CAA's advice on the charge cap was based on a well-considered and comprehensive analysis of NATS' operational and investment plans and the potential for efficiency savings. The advice fully reflected the Government's, and the CAA's, commitment to giving the highest priority to safety.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para1">The CAA recommended that the "X" factor for NATS' UK monopoly services be set at 5 per cent. per year for each of the first five years. The Government considered this advice carefully, alongside representations from NATS and the projections of bidders for the NATS PPP, and decided to set charge capping at 2.2 per cent. for 2001, 3.0 per cent. for 2002, 4.0 per cent. for 2003, and 5.0 per cent. for each of 2004 and 2005.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para2">Furthermore, since delays are a major concern to airlines, the Government decided that the charge cap should include a delay term, so that the "X" factor would automatically tighten, thereby reducing NATS' revenues, if delays increased.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para3">In reaching these decisions, the Government was concerned to achieve a smooth transition to the PPP and to enable NATS' management to focus on getting the change and investment programmes right during the early years of the PPP.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The number of passengers using UK airports has increased from 35 mppa in 1971 to 180 mppa in 2001. This corresponds to an average annual increase of 5.9 per cent. in passengers using UK airports over this 30 year period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department is considering the implementation of a national type approval procedure for all buses, including minibuses, by the end of 2003, as part of a current review of bus and coach construction and use requirements. Checks of seat belt installation would be part of that procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he will take to ensure that an <i>(a)</i> anti-lock braking system and <i>(b)</i> tachograph will be a mandatory safety feature for new buses.  [61808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All new buses are already required to be fitted with an anti-lock braking system.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para4">The fitting and use of tachographs is subject to a European Union (EU) Regulation from which there is an exemption for buses on routes of less than 50 kilometres. 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B>

<a name="20618w02.html_para5">The Finance Bill currently before Parliament includes enabling powers for changes to vehicle taxation, making possible a system of continuous registration which will ensure that the registered keeper of a vehicle cannot avoid responsibility for licensing it. There will be consultation with the motor trade and motorists' groups before any changes are implemented. The legislation will not affect the current system of Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN) under which keepers who tell DVLA that they are taking their vehicles off the road are not obliged to tax them.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para6">The Government has also recently announced that it has set up a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board which will take forward work on the recommendations of a review of the vehicle registration system that the Department undertook in partnership with the insurance industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether he intends to designate East Midlands airport under section 80 for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, in order to impose restrictions on night flying there.  [63190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State was asked by North West Leicestershire district council (and by others) to designate this airport in order to impose night restrictions using the powers by which operational noise is currently regulated at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para7">I have written to the council to inform them that the Secretary of State has decided, after careful consideration, not to designate the airport. Following local discussions, the airport management has produced its own proposals, to which it is committed, for the control of noise including night noise. The Secretary of State is satisfied that these controls are sufficient in all the circumstances of the case, including the broad long-standing policy that noise controls should be settled locally where possible, such that designation is not appropriate for the present.
<P>

<a name="20618w02.html_para8">I encourage East Midlands airport, as well as other airports, to continue discussions in consultation with local stakeholders, and to keep their noise control regulations under review with the aim of minimizing noise nuisance from the airport's legitimate operations.

<a name="20618w04.html_para20">We have no systems in place to track Brazilian mahogany in the UK. An exporter wishing to re-export unprocessed Brazilian mahogany outside the EU requires a re-export permit from my Department, and would need to present a stamped import notification form as proof of legal importation. Any cargo presented for re-export without the necessary documentation would be liable for seizure.
<P>

<a name="20618w04.html_para21">However, most Brazilian mahogany imported into the UK will be made into furniture and if re-exported will not require a re-export permit under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) because such permits are required only for logs, sawn woods and veneer sheets.

<a name="20618w05.html_spnew1"><B> Nigel Griffiths:  </B> 
The Government has put in place a number of measures to reduce the burden of regulations on small businesses, including:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Announced in January 2000 that employers with over four or fewer employees will be exempt from the requirements to provide access to stakeholder pensions and deduct pension contributions.
<P>
<BR>
Announced in April 2000 an increase in the statutory audit threshold for companies from &#163;350,000 to &#163;1 million. This measure will relieve up to 150,000 small firms from the burden of a statutory audit, saving small companies up to &#163;180 million a year.
<P>
<BR>
We have exempted small shops from the new EU unit pricing requirements.
<P>
<BR>
We have exempted employers with 20 or fewer employees from the trade union recognition procedures in the Employment Relations Act.
<P>
<BR>
The Small Business Service has produced clear guidance on a number of complex regulations.
<P>
<BR>
The Business Link Website is now attracting 80,000 users per month&#151;and businesses can register to receive alerts about regulations automatically.
<P>
<BR>
A 12 weeks period between regulations has been agreed and implemented allowing owner managers time to adapt to the new regulations.
<P>
<BR>
Ensured that the view of small business influenced Patrick Carter's review of payroll administration, a copy of which is in the Libraries of the House.
<P>
<BR>
In February we published the regulatory Reform Action Plan&#151;setting out over 250 proposals for better regulation and reform.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20618w05.html_para1">Further to these measures:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An estimated 900,000 SMEs benefit from measures announced in Budget 2002, including 485,000 businesses whose corporation tax bill has been cut or abolished, and 700,000 small businesses who will be able to benefit from our flat rate VAT scheme.
<P>
<BR>
Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) have to be produced for all regulations setting out clearly the costs and benefits with full recognition of small business concerns. The Department's policy is to 'think small first': the Small Business Service has to be consulted on all RIAs to ensure that the impact on small firms is not disproportionate.
<P>
<BR>
Following the recent review of the DTL, the regulatory challenge function within the Department has been strengthened. A new team has been created specifically to consider how the Department should challenge existing and future legislation as well as to how to ensure all policy makers fully consider alternatives to regulation at the outset of the policy making process.

The manpower requirement for each service reflects the necessity to deliver the capabilities and meet the commitments that were identified in the strategic defence review. The requirements, and the performance in meeting them, are reported by the Defence Analytical Services Agency both annually in UK defence statistics and quarterly under national statistics arrangements. Copies of these publications can be found in the Library of the House.

The Services' manpower requirements are dynamic and subject to annual review in light of evolving doctrine, new technology and equipment, and possible changes to the operating environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organisation (GAESO) is one of a number of ex-Gurkha organisations based in Nepal. Unfortunately, there have been reports in the past of GAESO activists using threats of violence to extort money from former Gurkha soldiers. This is unacceptable intimidation of sometimes weak and vulnerable pensioners who have provided this country with dedicated service over many generations. In light of these reports, the then Minister for the Armed Forces, my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar) wrote to the Prime Minister of Nepal in April 2000. Our concerns were also reinforced during subsequent visits to Nepal by my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Defence. The British Embassy in Kathmandu also maintain regular contact with the Nepalese Government and police authorities. There have been no reports of illicit fund raising since October 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We expect Sea Harrier FA2 pilots to undertake a course lasting approximately 12 weeks, comprising approximately 35 hours of flying, in order to convert to the Harrier GR7 aircraft. The content of the

<P>

<a name="20618w06.html_para3">It is anticipated that the conversion course will be cost neutral because Sea Harrier FA2 pilots would have flown approximately the same number of hours to retain currency in that aircraft during a similar period. No additional resources have therefore been needed for this training.

 At present there are no regulations covering specifically radioactively contaminated land. However, a consultation paper on the control and remediation of radioactively contaminated land was jointly published by the then Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Welsh and Scottish Offices in February 1998. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is considering the way forward on regulations concerning radioactively contaminated land in the light of the responses to that consultation.

 In 1995 the Ministry of Defence embarked on a prioritised programme to assess the land quality across the defence estate. More than 600 land quality assessments have been carried out across the defence estate since the start of the programme. The land quality assessment work carried out to date has indicated that the majority of the defence estate is free of contamination, and where contamination has been identified, it has been predominantly localised and confined to soil horizons. The common contaminants are metals, fuels, oils and lubricants, solvents, and to a lesser extent, asbestos and radionuclides from luminised instruments. Where contamination has been encountered, appropriate management actions have been taken.

Among other things, this contributes to the Home Office led, inter-departmental mechanisms that ensure the Government can prevent, and respond to the widest possible range of terrorist actions in the United Kingdom.

 I last had formal discussions with my counterpart, the Indian Defence Minister on 22 January 2002. Although we met briefly at the International Institute for Strategic Studies conference on Asian security held in Singapore between 31 May and 2 June 2000, it was not possible to hold substantive discussions.

<P>
<a name="20618w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The most recent figures published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) indicate that there are 9,044 civilian personnel and 14,460 service personnel directly employed by the Ministry of Defence in Scotland. The most recent figures for civilian and service personnel are from April 2002 and July 2001 respectively.
<P>

<a name="20618w07.html_para0">It is estimated that around 6,000 people are supported by the placement of MOD contracts in Scotland. This is the most recent figure available and relates to the year 1998&#150;99.

<P>

<a name="20618w07.html_para1">At present, we do not have any figures to suggest how many people are supported by MOD work that has been sub-contracted to Scottish firms.
<P>

<a name="20618w07.html_para2">It is difficult to estimate the indirect jobs that MOD generates and we are currently reviewing our multiplier methodology. As a rule of thumb, using a multiplier of 0.5, a further 14,752 people may be indirectly supported by the MOD presence in Scotland both through firms which supply goods and services to MOD/contractor establishments in Scotland (indirect jobs), and through consumer spending by MOD/contractor employees in the country (induced effects).

<a name="20618w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department has not made any direct representations to the Commission on this issue. However, my officials meet regularly with counterparts from other EC member states and the European Commission to discuss issues arising from EC Regulation 2037&#150;2000 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. They are taking an active part as members of the European Commission's "European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) Working Group Industry, Work Item Fluorinated Gases", which considers policies and 



<P>

measures on fluorinated gases such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to enable the European Community to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
<P>

<a name="20618w08.html_para0">On 23 October 2001, the Commission adopted the Communication on the implementation of the first phase of the ECCP. This includes a proposal to bring forward legislation designed to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases, including HFCs, along the lines recommended in the report of the Working Group. The Environment Council, at its meeting of 12 December 2001, supported the Commission's proposal for legislative action.
<P>

<a name="20618w08.html_para1">The European Commission expects to publish a first draft of the legislation this Autumn. By implementing regulatory action on ozone depleting substances, as well as on HFCs which replace them in applications such as refrigeration, I anticipate a greater use of refrigerants which have no ozone-depleting potential and do not significantly contribute to climate change.

 My officials meet regularly with counterparts from other EC member states and the European Commission to discuss issues arising from EC Regulation 2037&#150;2000 which implements the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Together with the European Commission, the UK and other member states consider possible EC proposals for improving and strengthening the Protocol.
<P>

<a name="20618w08.html_para2">EC Regulation 2037&#150;2000 already imposes on the UK and other member states significantly stricter controls on the production, sale and use of ozone-depleting substances than are required of other Parties to the Protocol. For example, the Regulation bans the use of CFCs in the servicing of existing equipment, where the Protocol only concerns itself with their production and supply to the market and imposes no use controls. Also, HCFCs are to be phased out under the Protocol by 2030, but under the Regulation they must be phased out by 2010 for newly-produced material and 2015 for recycled material.

 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced on 31 May that the Government considered that there should be a full and informed debate on GM issues, including GM crops. The Government want to start the debate as soon as possible. They are considering the timetable and expenditure for the debate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Weir: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what plans she has to change the procedure for approval of GM foods and seeds;  [58544]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans she has to alter the rights of members of the public who object to the approval of GM foods and seeds to protest against such moves.  [58546]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 All EU member states are in the process of implementing directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, which replaces and updates the old directive 90/220/EEC.
<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para0">The new directive introduces a more robust framework for taking decisions on whether or not to allow the release of GMOs, including GM seeds, in the UK and the EU. It clarifies and increases the level of scientific scrutiny required in assessing safety implications of proposed releases of GMOs. Risk assessments have been extended to cover 'indirect' and 'long-term' risks to the environment. It also introduces 'post-market monitoring', under which any GMO which is granted consent to be used commercially must be monitored for unanticipated effects on the environment.
<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para1">The new directive also introduces a new requirement for mandatory public consultation before decisions are taken on applications for consents to release GMOs. We propose that public consultations in England on research trial applications must last for a minimum of 48 days. Consultations on commercial applications (for which the European Commission is responsible) will consist of two separate periods of 30 days.
<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para2">The Department consulted the public on broad issues raised by the new directive in autumn 2001. We recently began a second public consultation on draft implementing regulations for England, and aim for the regulations to enter into force in October 2002. Copies of the consultation paper are being placed in the parliamentary Libraries.
<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para3">The Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department of Environment for Northern Ireland will make separate implementing regulations on issues for which they have devolved powers.
<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para4">GM foods are approved in Europe in accordance with the provisions of the EC Novel Foods and Novel Foods Ingredients Regulation (258/97). A European Commission proposal for a single GM food and feed regulation is currently under negotiation. The proposal aims to improve the involvement of the public in the authorisation process.

In addition, on 21 November 2000 the Government replied to a parliamentary question about changes to the arrangement for requesting a hearing on proposed national list decisions. In this reply, the Government said that they would wish to consider whether the current arrangements are satisfactory for all parties, in the light of the proposed addition of a genetically modified plant variety, Chardon LL, to the national list. The Chardon LL hearing will finish around mid-June this year and the time is right to review how those arrangements have worked. If changes are proposed, all interested parties will be fully consulted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w09.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The rural White Paper charged the Countryside Agency with evaluating existing Wheels to Work schemes and subsequent production of a good practice guide for their development and implementation. The evaluation does not include a specific environmental assessment or an assessment of the traffic implications of encouraging loans of mopeds or cash help for driving lessons for teenagers in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para6">Such assessments were not deemed to be necessary because the scale of Wheels to Work is fairly small: 21 schemes were identified and while new schemes will be set up, they are only ever likely to affect a small proportion of the population. The Countryside Agency will continue to monitor the number of new schemes developing to remain informed about possible environmental impacts.

 We are on course to meet our target to open up all open country and registered common land in England under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 by the end of 2005. Draft maps of open country and registered common land have been issued and consulted upon for the south-east and lower north-west regions, but no specific assessment by region has been carried out. An assessment of the condition of rights of way in England was published recently by the Countryside Agency, but the Government have not produced any information on rights of way nationally or regionally. Work is progressing to produce regulations for Part II of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 with an aim to have the majority of provisions in force by the end of 2003.

 A programme of care and maintenance visits is carried out by technical staff from DEFRA's Rural Development Service.

These visits are not part of the separate compliance monitoring programme, undertaken by staff from the Rural Payments Agency which inspects 5 per cent. of agreements annually. Prior to the creation of the Rural Development Service in April 2001, care and maintenance visits were carried out by technical staff from the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will examine the case for the protection of trickle irrigation in consultations on the draft water Bill; and if she will make it her policy that trickle irrigators are <i>(a)</i> granted time- limited licences equivalent to their current abstraction and <i>(b)</i> equally treated with other abstractors when licences are reviewed under the Environment Agency's Catchment Abstraction Management Strategy.  [60680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have examined the case for the protection of trickle irrigation before issuing the Government's response to the consultation on the water Bill. There will be a two-year transitional period during which trickle abstractors can apply for abstraction licences. During this time the Environment Agency will be required to ensure that there is no derogation of their abstractions.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 2002 : Column 216W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20618w09.html_para8">The Department is drawing up transitional provisions aiming to ensure that established use of trickle irrigation is not disadvantaged compared to other licensed abstractions for agricultural or horticultural purposes. In doing so, I shall consider whether present trickle irrigators should be automatically granted time limited licences equivalent to their current abstraction when the exemption is removed, to enable trickle licences to be reviewed on a par with other abstractions as part of the Catchment Abstraction Management Strategy (CAMS) process.

 The Government are convinced that ICT has a central role in broadening the economic base in rural areas. Stimulating broadband across the whole of the UK, especially outside of large towns and cities, is one of Government's top priorities. Measures to drive further roll-out will include:

 In February 2002 the Government published "UK Online: the Broadband Future" which set the target for the UK to have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005. The Government have put in place a &#163;30 million fund to allow regional development agencies and devolved Administrations to develop schemes for extending broadband into areas that appear commercially unattractive. Along with the Minister for Trade, I have discussed implementation with the regional development agencies in England and they are focusing on how best to target the needs of their region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EC) requires each member state to identify and select special areas of conservation that, together with special protection areas under the Birds Directive, will form a coherent European ecological network to be known as Natura 2000. However, the adoption of site lists across the whole EU has been delayed, with lists comprising the six biogeographic regions not expected to be finalised until next year. Following the adoption of the lists of sites it will be for the European Commission and member states collectively to ensure that the network is evaluated against its stated aim of maintaining or restoring the features concerned at a favourable conservation in their natural range.

<a name="20618w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Using powers contained in the Weeds Act 1959, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs can take statutory action to control the spread of five injurious weeds, including common ragwort.
<P>

<a name="20618w10.html_para7">Under the Act, the Secretary of State can serve an enforcement notice on an occupier of land on which any of the five injurious weeds are growing requiring the occupier to take action to prevent the weeds from spreading. The Act also permits officials to enter land to inspect whether an enforcement notice has been complied with. If an occupier has unreasonably failed to comply with the notice, he or she shall be guilty of an offence and, on conviction, is liable to a fine. The Act also contains additional powers, which enable the Secretary of State to take action to arrange for the weeds to be cleared and recover the cost of doing so from the occupier, if necessary through the courts. If the occupier of the land cannot be traced and he or she is not the owner of the land, the costs may be recovered from the owner, or failing that, a charge in respect of the costs may be placed on the land by order of the courts.
<P>

<a name="20618w10.html_para8">In practice, it is rarely necessary to invoke the formal powers of the Weeds Act. DEFRA investigates each complaint about injurious weeds on its merits, but gives priority to complaints where there is a threat to farmland, farming activities and on farm diversified equine activities. Once DEFRA officials have made the occupier of land aware of the presence of injurious weeds, the matter can usually be resolved satisfactorily through co-operation and advice, without taking statutory action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will exempt agricultural shows from the 20-day standstill period for animal movements.  [54346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w11.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> The rules applicable to the movement of livestock to and from agricultural shows will be kept under review to ensure that they are proportionate to the disease risks involved. For the time being veterinary advice is that it remains appropriate for stock moving to a show either to respect any standstill on the premises of departure, and to impose a 20-day standstill on their return, or for the show animal(s) to be isolated for 20 days on their home premises before departure and after their return.
<P>

<a name="20618w11.html_para8">The 20-day standstill is at the centre of the interim livestock movement restrictions currently in force to guard against a future outbreak. Scientific and veterinary advice is that it aids detection of disease and slows disease spread. A number of exemptions from the standstill have been introduced, on veterinary advice, in order to help livestock farmers without causing an unacceptable increase in disease risk. These interim arrangements are currently under review, but whatever changes may be made to the interim rules this summer, the Government intend to take full account of any relevant findings from the FMD inquiries before it reaches a final view on the role that a 20-day standstill might play in the long-term controls over livestock movements.

 Statutory performance standards for recycling and composting have been set to drive up performance by local authorities as part of the Government's waste strategy. The Government are committed to the achievement of these targets and will intervene if necessary to ensure they are delivered.
<P>

<a name="20618w11.html_para9">Local public service agreements provide opportunities for authorities to commit themselves to exceeding the statutory recycling targets and to be rewarded with additional resources for doing so.

 Under the Best Value Performance Indicators, local authorities in England make annual returns on the percentage of the total tonnage of household waste arisings which have been sent for recycling (BV82a) or composting (BV82b). In addition, my Department's annual Municipal Waste Management Survey collects information on different types of materials collected for recycling and composting. For example, the Municipal Waste Management Survey shows that recycling of household waste plastics increased to 13,000 tonnes in 1999&#150;2000, compared to 8,000 tonnes for the previous year.

The committee was composed of representatives of member states and was chaired by the European Commission. The terms of reference of the committee were as follows:

<a name="20618w12.html_para1">This was amended by Decision Number 85/208/EEC, which expanded the focus of the committee from "hydrocarbons discharged at sea" to "oil and other harmful substances discharged at sea".

The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February (Com (2001) 783 Final). As part of the review process, the UK Government has encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.

 We have put in place major cross-Government programmes of work to address the risk factors for cancer and tackle health inequalities.

We are taking this forward with a comprehensive programme to tackle smoking, including NHS smoking cessation services and a public information campaign. We are also running a Five-a-Day Programme to increase access to, and consumption of fruit and vegetables. The New Opportunities Fund is providing funding to set up 66 five-a-day community programmes led by primary care trusts based in deprived areas. We have also recently announced a new &#163;2.5 million programme of community physical activity pilots that will be set up in Neighbourhood Renewal areas. This work underpins the two national health inequalities targets in the areas of life expectancy and infant mortality, announced by the Secretary of State last year.

 No specific assessment has been made. There are national variations in chiropody services. This may be because local national health service organisations clinically prioritise access to their services to ensure they meet the needs of their most at risk patients. The clinical criteria used to prioritise will be determined locally by primary care trusts.

By 2003&#150;04, the Government will be spending an additional &#163;20 million a year on the new national health service infrastructure for cancer research. This will mean that more cancer patients will have access to new and experimental treatments. In April 2002, the Government set up the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) in partnership with charities and industry.

<P>
<a name="20618w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 All primary care trusts have a challenging agenda to deliver the NHS Plan. We are taking steps to ensure that they have the means to strengthen their management capacity by lifting the cap on primary care trust management costs. The Modernisation Agency has also in place a number of initiatives designed to support and strengthen the organisational development of primary care trusts as well as strengthening the management capacity through initiatives such as the national primary and care trust development programme and the chief executives development programme.
<P>

<a name="20618w16.html_para5">From 1 April 2002 legislation provides for primary care trusts to have a director of public health on their boards. The focus of their activity will be on local neighbourhoods and communities, leading and driving programmes to improve health and reduce inequalities. They will also play a powerful role in forging partnerships with, and influencing, all local agencies to ensure the widest possible participation in the health and health care agenda.

 If the services commissioned by a trust locally do not meet the needs of a particular patient, then general practitioners (GPs) do have freedom to refer elsewhere using the out of area arrangements. If a patient requires replacement of a national health service digital hearing aid, and the local service has not received the training and equipment to fit such aids, the GP could refer the patient back to the department from which the aid was supplied or to an other which does have the necessary infrastructure to fit digital hearing aids.

 It will be for the National Care Standards Commission to decide in the particular circumstances of each individual home whether the home conforms to the standards necessary to meet the assessed needs of its residents. The standards were extensively consulted on and the Department has no evidence to suggest that large numbers of care homes will be unable to meet them. The Commission will form a more detailed picture of care homes' compliance with the national standards as it completes its first cycle of inspections of providers in England during 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20618w17.html_para3">Care home closures may occur for many reasons. It is for local authorities, in their role as commissioners of care, to have contingency plans in place, drawn up in consultation with service providers, to deal with care home closures. Local authorities have a responsibility for making alternative arrangements for anyone that they place in a home which subsequently closes.
<P>

<a name="20618w17.html_para4">We have not allocated resources to social services departments specifically to meet any local short fall in care home provision. However, we are increasing total resources available for social services by an average of 6 per cent. a year in real terms over the next three years (2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06). These increases follow average annual real terms increases of more than 3 per cent. between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03 including a 3.6 per cent. real terms increase this year (2002&#150;03). These substantial increases in resources, in particular over the next three years, will enable local authorities to deliver the improvements to social services to which the Government are committed. Additional resources were also included in these budgets to help providers with the costs of meeting key national minimum standards. This means that local authorities have the resources they need to purchase services at realistic prices.

 Three phases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) are usually definable; the chronic phase, an accelerated phase and the blast phase.
<P>

<a name="20618w20.html_para0">The chronic phase is typically of three to five years duration from diagnosis. The majority of patients are in chronic phase at presentation. Clinically, in the chronic phase there are less than 10 per cent. immature blood cells (called blast cells) and promyelocytes (one of the series of cells that gives rise to granulocytes&#151;a type of white blood cell) in the bone marrow. There is an elevated white cell count and often an elevated platelet count.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 2002 : Column 254W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20618w20.html_para1">The accelerated phase of CML marks the transition to the blast phase typically lasting two to 15 months, but generally leading to a rapidly fatal blast crisis within six months. As the accelerated phase is associated with numerous haematological cytogenic and clinical signs and symptoms, no single set of criteria for its onset is accepted.
<P>

<a name="20618w20.html_para2">The blast phase is usually fatal within three to six months of onset. Clinically, the presence of 30 per cent. or more blast cells in the marrow or the presence of blast cells within the peripheral blood defines the blast phase.
<P>

<a name="20618w20.html_para3">There were 514 deaths due to chronic myeloid leukaemia occurring in 2000 and 465 deaths occurring in 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> Individual university medical schools determine their own undergraduate medical curriculum in the light of recommendations from the General Medical Council's education committee, which has the statutory responsibility to determine the extent and knowledge and skill required for the granting of primary medical qualifications in the UK. This includes the range of problems that are presented to doctors and the range of solutions that have been developed for their recognition, investigation, prevention and treatment.
<P>

<a name="20618w20.html_para6">The undergraduate medical course is the first step in the continuum of medical education, laying down the foundation for future professional life.

 The NHS Plan said that the Government would implement a national strategy to tackle alcohol misuse in England by 2004 and we are on course to achieve this. We will consult fully with the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as we develop this strategy. It is also the case that the devolved Administrations have consulted the Department in developing their own strategies for tackling alcohol misuse, including the strategy for Scotland that was published in January this year.

<a name="20618w20.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Details of all orthodontic treatment that can be made available through general dental services are included in the statement of dental remuneration (SDR), which is issued to all dental practitioners and health authorities annually, in April. The Department does not give specific advice on what treatment a dentist or orthodontist should provide for patients, as this is a matter for the individuals' clinical judgment. However, the range of treatments available in the SDR was introduced in consultation with the profession and is considered adequate to ensure the best treatment outcome for all patients.
<P>

<a name="20618w20.html_para11">Over recent months officials have had helpful discussions with the profession on possible changes to the current system and the Department will continue to work with the profession on this.

 We are in regular contact with the Government of Rwanda on all aspects of its policies in the Great Lakes region, including the presence of its soldiers in the DRC. The international community has recognised, in numerous Security Council resolutions and in the Lusaka Peace Agreements, that Rwanda has legitimate security concerns that have led to its military presence in the DRC. We are working actively as part of the international community to work for full implementation of the Lusaka Peace agreement, which will ensure that legitimate security concerns are addressed so that Rwanda can safely withdraw its forces from the DRC at the earliest possible date.

 There are a large number of international organisations whose activities influence developing countries, these include the World Trade Organisation (WTO), World bank and regional development banks and the UN Agencies. The WTO exists as an organisation whose members can agree the trade rules that they consider to be mutually beneficial, with decisions made through consensus; the formal regulatory environment for the World bank and the regional development banks is established through their Articles of Agreement; UN agencies are regulated through their mandates. The executive boards of the multilateral development banks and the UN agencies provide day to day policy direction, oversight and control. In the Government's 2000 White Paper "Making Globalisation Work for the Poor" we are committed to build a stronger, more open and accountable international system, including to increase the capacity of poor countries to negotiate in the WTO, and I am continuing to have discussions with other stakeholders on how best to take this work forward.

<a name="20618w21.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department is working with developing countries on poverty reduction strategies that will enable the poorest to lift themselves out of poverty. Three-quarters of the world's poorest people live in rural areas and depend significantly on agriculture. In many countries, therefore, this means attention to rural development and agriculture. Countries where we are already engaged in agricultural and rural reform processes include: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, India, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. My Department has recently issued a consultation paper, "Better Livelihoods for Poor People: the Role of Agriculture". This focuses on the livelihoods of small and medium producers and proposes action within developing countries, particularly with regard to the policy and institutional environment that will create opportunities for the poor; at international level with regard to trade, standard setting and international agricultural research; and domestically with regard to the distortions caused by EU agricultural subsidies and trade barriers.
<P>

<a name="20618w21.html_para4">We are also encouraging countries to mainstream environment within their poverty reduction strategies, recognising that more effective environmental management can contribute to sustained poverty reduction. Action is proceeding in four main areas: improving governance; enhancing the assets of the poor; improving the quality of growth; and reforming international and developed country policies. This broad agenda shows that the issue of environmental protection cannot be looked at in isolation, and that many decisions affecting the environment are not taken by those directly responsible for environmental issues.

<a name="20618w21.html_para5">My Department is focusing its efforts on two broad objectives: improving the overall effectiveness of EC development assistance and increasing its poverty focus. We welcome the positive steps that have been taken to reform EC development assistance and are pressing the EC to pursue its reform efforts vigorously in order to implement the November 2000 EC Development Policy, which for the first time, makes poverty reduction the central objective of EC development programmes. We are working for agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990.

<a name="20618w21.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In spite of renewed efforts to establish a lasting peace, fighting continues in many parts of southern Sudan. The humanitarian consequences for those affected by the conflict are devastating. The UK is supporting the latest round of IGAD peace talks in Nairobi this week through the DFID/FCO Sudan Unit and the UK Special Representative and with financial support to the IGAD Sudan secretariat. In addition to supporting the political process, we will continue to support the agencies and organisations in the field best placed to meet the humanitarian needs.

 Humanitarian access is based on a series of agreements dating from the 1988 Accords between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) coalition partners and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA). Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), agreed between the United Nations (UN), the Government of Sudan (GoS) and the SPLA followed this in 1989. OLS was based on unsigned informal agreements between UN officials and the GoS. In 1992, the UN Department for Humanitarian Affairs negotiated a new agreement with GoS and SPLA on access routes for humanitarian assistance. In 1993 the OLS Ground Rules were implemented. The Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) achieved agreement in May 1994 on the principles for a negotiated end to the conflict (the Declaration of Principles&#151;DoP). In addition to the DoP, an agreement on humanitarian access was also signed and ratified. The latter agreement remains the only signed access agreement between all the parties.

<a name="20618w21.html_para6">In <i>(a)</i> Bahr el-Ghazal, the total of denied locations is 38 out of 63 sought (25 granted). 17 locations are denied as the Government of Sudan (GoS) says they are insecure and therefore not safe, plus a further 21 locations as GoS cannot be sure where they are as WFP/UN will not give them the required coordinates.

<P>

<a name="20618w21.html_para8">In <i>(c)</i> Western Upper Nile (WUN), 13 locations are denied as GoS says they are not secure. 19 others are denied because no coordinates were provided and GoS says they cannot therefore verify the locations and give clearance. GoS has granted a further 45 clearances for WUN this week after representations were made by the United Nations: of these, 21 are new locations not requested by the UN.

<P>
<a name="20618w22.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Since September 2001, my Department has contributed over &#163;3 million to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for their programme of assistance to Afghan refugees, and over &#163;3.5 million to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees to Afghanistan. We are also supporting a number of other humanitarian programmes which will help to create an environment for the sustainable return of both refugees and IDPs, including the United Nations-led programme of mine clearance and mine awareness in Afghanistan. We are currently considering what further support to provide for refugees, IDPs and returnees.

 The Government's aim is to ensure that the limited spectrum available is distributed so as to satisfy as many viewers/listeners as possible, and to avoid giving one religion an unfair advantage over another so that everyone's beliefs are equally respected. The Government's position is set out in the document "The draft Communications Bill&#151;The Policy" which states that, where there is sufficient spectrum availability, restrictions on religious bodies holding licences will be removed (paragraph 9.3.3).
<P>

<a name="20618w23.html_para5">This means that religious bodies can hold none of the licences referred to in the question. However, the Radio Authority, which licences all independent radio services in the UK, is currently given discretion under the Broadcasting Act 1990 to award local analogue, satellite and cable licences to religious bodies, subject to compliance with the authority's codes on News, Current Affairs and Programming; Advertising and Sponsorship; and its Ownership Guidelines, and the ITC can also award cable and satellite TV licences to religious organisations. The draft Bill increases the number of types of licences which religious bodies can hold by giving Ofcom discretion to award a digital local sound programme service and a digital additional service licence to religious bodies. Further clauses are now being drafted which will give Ofcom discretion to award religious bodies digital additional service licences for TV and radio, TV licences for digital programme services and restricted service licences.

 &#163;100 million of lottery funding has been invested in ICT technical infrastructure and equipment to create a network of ICT learning centres in more than 4,000 public libraries across the UK. The programme is on target to connect all public libraries to the internet, wherever practical, by the end of 2002, and based on the

<P><I>18 Jun 2002 : Column 277W</I><P>
information we have received from local authorities we estimate that around 90 per cent. of these libraries will have broadband connections of 2 Mb or more. It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of providing broadband access to libraries, since it is the policy of many local authorities to procure broadband connectivity across the range of local services.

 My ministerial colleagues and I have met many representatives from industry in the course of our duties since 8 June 2001 as part of the process of policy development and analysis. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Code, the Civil Service Code and Guidance for Civil Servants: Contacts with Lobbyists. Some of these discussions take place on a confidential basis, and in order to preserve this confidentiality, it is not the normal practice of Government to release details of specific meetings with private individuals, organisations or companies.

 It is for the 149 library authorities to make their own operational decisions about library provision within the requirements of the 1964 Public Libraries and Museums Act. The public library standards, including a target for the numbers of static libraries per household within an authority area, help define but do not increase those requirements.

<a name="20618w26.html_para3">Separately to our consideration of the Expert Group report, we have taken a number of recent steps to improve the efficiency of the licensing of scientific procedures under the 1986 Act, mainly arising from discussions conducted in 2000&#150;2001 under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Pharmaceutical Industry Competitiveness Task Force. A review of the ethical review process was completed in November 2001 and best practice for more efficient working of the process is now being widely disseminated around establishments. New guidance has also been issued on completing project licence application forms, and industry has been given information on errors commonly found in licence application forms, which should help to reduce the number of applications submitted with such errors in future, and therefore reduce delays.
<P>

<a name="20618w26.html_para4">Most importantly, extra resources are starting to be devoted to the assessment and processing of licence applications. These include development of a new computer system, which is expected to enable electronic processing of all licence applications, in due course. There will also, as announced in March 2001, be a significant increase in the size of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate from 21 inspectors to 33 by March 2004. We have also improved the relevant section of the Home Office website to provide easier access for applicants and licence holders to reference documents and best practice material. The new website will go live shortly.

 The current work permit policy excludes issuing work permits to recruitment agencies, employment agencies and other similar businesses. However, as part of a review of this specific issue, Work Permits UK (WP(UK)) who administer the work permit arrangements, are currently undertaking a formal consultation, which began on 18 March 2002, with customers and stakeholders as to whether the scope of the work permit arrangements should be extended to agencies. The consultation ended on 14 June 2002.

 We consulted widely on the permitted work rules for people receiving incapacity benefits and the new arrangements which took effect from 8 April have been generally welcomed by disability organisations.
<P>

<a name="20618w28.html_para3">We want to give people on these benefits the opportunity to ease their way back into work without it affecting their benefit. Under the old rules, people had to show that the work would be beneficial to their medical condition. This was sometimes difficult to prove. The new rules help to open up employment opportunities for people of working age claiming a benefit because of their illness or disability. Both therapeutic work and the new permitted work rules allow people to try out some work without losing benefit.
<P>

<a name="20618w28.html_para4">We estimate that between 27,000 and 54,000 people receiving an incapacity benefit were undertaking therapeutic work at 8 April. People already doing therapeutic work when the rules changed can carry on doing it until April 2003, after which they can apply to do permitted work and will be subject to the new permitted work rules. These allow work for 16 hours a week on average and earnings of up to &#163;66 a week for a 26 week period which can be extended for a further 26 weeks in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20618w28.html_para5">We anticipate that the numbers doing permitted work will increase to around 70,000 in the first year of the new scheme and to around 110,000 over the next four years.

 In the period April 2001 to March 2002, Remploy has engaged 13 sets of consultants from 11 firms at a cost of &#163;723,000. This represents 0.3 per cent. of Remploy's turnover in that year. The consultants were engaged to assist Remploy in the delivery of its modernisation strategy. Remploy currently has no consultancy support.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Resource DEL (departmental expenditure limit) for 2002&#150;03 is &#163;1,318,597,000. Due to pay negotiations we are unable to say how much of that we expect to be attributed to staff costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w29.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The shortcomings relate to the failure to comply with the OPCW financial regulations. These regulations require the Director-General to "prudently manage appropriations . . . to ensure that expenditures can be kept within funds available". Expenditure in 2000 exceeded income by &#163;2.5 million. The OPCW external auditor's report on the 2000 financial statements confirmed that these provisions had not been complied with and recommended corrective action. The external auditor also drew attention to the failure to comply with regulations governing transfers of funds between appropriations, and recommended action to minimise excessive use of transfers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w29.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 A significant number of the members of the Executive Council expressed the view that they had lost confidence in the Director-General. As a result, the UK concluded that it would be in the best interests of the OPCW and the Chemical Weapons Convention if the Director-General were to step down voluntarily to make way for someone who could enjoy the full confidence of all the members of the organisation. The Director-General was informed of the UK's position prior to the vote of no confidence at the Executive Council meeting in March.

 In accordance with her mandate established by the UN General Assembly, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has a central role to play in ensuring that human rights are fully integrated in the work of the UN. Mrs. Robinson determines her own travel programme. Since she took office in 1997, she has visited a large number of countries in all regions of the world at the invitation of their Governments or other organisations (eg to attend a conference). It is rare for country resolutions at the Commission on Human Rights to include provision for a visit by the high commissioner. When that is the case, the UK voting position is determined by the merit of the resolution.

 The Department for Education and Skills aims to create, implement and support a dynamic framework for information and communications technology (ICT) skills. It has initiated a range of measures to increase computer literacy and widen access to the skills required for a modern knowledge economy.

 A wide range of research evidence about the teaching of reading was considered in the development of the National Literacy Strategy (NLS) as documented in the "Review of Research and other Related Evidence", published by the Department in 1998. National test results have shown that the NLS has improved the standards achieved in reading. In 2001, 84 per cent. of pupils achieved the expected level for their age (level 2) in the Key Stage 1 reading tests&#151;a rise of 4 percentage

<a name="20618w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Government have no policy to penalise children for being helped by their parents with their school work. Indeed, we strongly endorse parents playing an active part in supporting their children's learning at home. We believe that children's education really benefits when parents create a learning-friendly environment at home and have a positive attitude to school and to learning. We have helped them in this by providing a range of information, resources, and guidance on how to get involved in their children's education. These include the "Parents' Centre" website, which contains information for parents about education, as well as how they can get involved, and links to useful resources for learning at home; the "Learning Journey" booklets, a series of guides to the curriculum informing parents of what their children will learn and how they can help; and "Parents + Schools" magazine, a termly publication informing parents of developments in the field of education, and containing hints, tips, and suggestions for becoming involved.

 The Fire Services (Appointments and Promotion) Regulations 1978 (statutory instrument 436), as amended, set criteria for appointment to the rank of firefighter.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does, however, prepare recruitment literature for the fire service.

<a name="20618w32.html_para2">Responsibility for the efficient training of members of each fire service also rests with the local fire authority, under section 1(1)(b) of the Fire Services Act 1947. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister works closely with the fire service on training and development. The Fire Service College is an executive agency of the office. We are seeking, with the fire service, to implement an over-arching development strategy encompassing all fire service staff at every career stage. Our goal is to promote the development of a fire service which better reflects the communities it serves and which, through effective and relevant training and development, maintains its high standards of professionalism.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what <i>(a)</i> advice he has received from (i) local authorities, (ii) the Housing Corporation, (iii) other statutory agencies and (iv) Government Departments about and <i>(b)</i> estimate he has made of the level of unmet housing need in each of the districts of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in each of the last five years for which records are available.  [62593]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w32.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government do not make estimates of housing need. Because of the wide variation in need between different parts of the country, the Government believe that local authorities are best placed to carry out local housing needs assessments, which should be reflected in local authorities housing strategies, investment plans, and in the implementation of planning powers for affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="20618w32.html_para3">Ensuring an adequate supply of housing, and a suitable balance between general market and affordable housing, is a key priority for the Government. We regularly receive letters from local authorities and other bodies concerning the need for housing, and take an interest in all such communication. The Government have increased investment in affordable housing through the Housing Corporation to &#163;1.2 billion in 2003&#150;04, nearly double 2000&#150;01 levels.

 This Government do not produce national assessments of housing demand or targets for house building. Annual rates of housing provision to be kept under regular review are established through regional planning guidance and the spatial strategy it sets out. The strategy is prepared having regard to a number of matters including regional economic needs, the household projections produced by the ODPM, the capacity of urban areas to accommodate more housing, the physical and social infrastructure needed to support additional housing and the environmental implications of doing so.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps are being taken to increase the number of homes for homeless single mothers.  [61904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Under current legislation, local authorities have a statutory duty to provide accommodation for people who are homeless through not fault of their own and who have a priority need for accommodation. The priority need categories include households with dependent children or a pregnant woman.
<P>

<a name="20618w33.html_para1">The Government are committed to ensuring homeless families are provided with decent housing. The supply of affordable housing has a vital role to play in increasing the homes available to house homeless single mothers. The Government have raised investment in affordable housing through the Housing Corporation to over &#163;1.2 billion by 2003&#150;04, almost double 2000&#150;01 levels. In 2000&#150;01, the Corporation approved schemes to the value of &#163;4.5 million for vulnerable mothers with babies and &#163;418 million for homeless people. In addition, where a single mother has a support need that makes it difficult to sustain a tenancy, the Supporting People programme, to be launched in April 2003, will help prevent tenancy breakdown.
<P>

<a name="20618w33.html_para2">In March this year the Government announced a new approach to tackling homelessness backed by &#163;125 million. This includes ensuring that no homeless families with children have to live in bed-and-breakfast accommodation except in an emergency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20618w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For most tenancies landlords must give two months notice to end a let. If the tenant does not leave, repossession of the property involves a court order enforced by bailiffs. It is not for a landlord to carry out an eviction.
<P>

<a name="20618w33.html_para3">Local authorities have powers to investigate any complaints of illegal eviction and to caution or prosecute as appropriate. The then Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions published the research report "Harassment and Unlawful Eviction of Private Rented Sector Tenants and Park Home Residents" in 2000. At the same time separate guidance to local authorities was published. Copies of both documents are available in the House Library.

 In May 2002, the Standards Board for England sent copies of guidance on the operation of new codes of conduct to all local authorities within its remit, including parish councils. The total cost of this guidance, including the costs of despatch, was &#163;188,380, some 80 per cent. of which it is estimated relates to providing the material to the 8,500 parish councils in England. This indicates an average cost of a little under &#163;18 per parish council.

The determining factor underpinning any Government decision on membership of the single currency is the national economic interest and whether the economic case for joining is clear and unambiguous. The five economic tests will define whether a clear and unambiguous case can be made. The Government have said that the Treasury will complete an assessment of the five tests within two years of the start of this Parliament. The five tests will assess the economic case for entry of the whole of the UK, including Scotland.

The timetable for the Scottish Executive's work on the 2000&#150;01 report is a matter for the Scottish Executive as are the production costs, but I understand that the total cost of printing, publishing and distributing the GERS report for 1999&#150;2000 was &#163;6,200.

 As highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs) both Guinea-Bissau and Guinea are eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative. In December 2000 both countries reached Decision Point under the initiative and qualified for interim debt relief on any payments due. For its part the UK goes further than is required under the HIPC initiative and provides 100 per cent. debt relief. The UK Government are working with other donors, the World bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help both countries reach Completion Point under the HIPC initiative, at which point their debts will be irrevocably cancelled. To reach this point these countries will need to have demonstrated a clear commitment to poverty reduction and how their country-owned poverty reduction strategies will be able to use the resources released by debt relief to reduce poverty. The IMF and World bank estimate that Guinea-Bissau and Guinea could reach Completion Point as early as October 2003 and December 2002 respectively.

 Portsmouth Contact Centre was opened on 6 November 2001, therefore the 2001&#150;02 budget allocated to the site was for the period November 2001 to March 2002. The budgets for the two years to date are as follows:

 There is no longer any debt owing to the UK Government by Uganda. As a highly indebted poor country (HIPC) Uganda was eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative; for its part the UK goes further than is required and provides 100 per cent. debt relief to all qualifying countries such as Uganda. In February 2000 Uganda reached decision point under that initiative and qualified for interim debt relief on payments due, and in May 2000 Uganda reached completion point and its debts were irrevocably cancelled.

<P>
<a name="20618w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The UK will host the 2002 Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting (CFMM) from 24&#150;26 September. This is an annual event whose timing is intended to provide Finance Ministers with an opportunity to prepare for the annual meetings of the IMF and World bank.
<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para10">The overall theme of the 2002 CFMM is "Stability; Growth; Poverty Reduction". Within this theme, Finance Ministers will discuss the world economy, IMF/World bank issues and Commonwealth issues.
<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para11">They will also discuss the special theme which this year will be "Delivering the Monterrey Consensus". The International Conference on Financing for Development took place in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. The resulting 'Monterrey Consensus' achieved a significant breakthrough by recognising the mutual responsibilities of both donors and developing countries to advance the development process. But to impact on the lives of the poor, these commitments require effective follow-up. The aim of the special theme session is therefore to develop an action plan for Commonwealth Finance Ministers to take forward the Monterrey Conclusions.
<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para12">Prior to the ministerial meetings, senior officials only will discuss a technical theme. This year, the technical theme will be "Managing Resources for Development" and include such issues as budgetary systems and public expenditure management.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 2002 : Column 322W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para13">At the Chancellor's request, the 2002 CFMM will be the first to engage civil society, whose views will be sought on the special theme. The Commonwealth Foundation is facilitating this process. After an initial introductory meeting in Monterrey, a number of regional civil society consultations are planned. The first has already taken place in Ghana. Further consultations are scheduled for Jamaica, Fiji, Bangladesh and the UK. The outputs of these consultations will then be combined into a single paper at a larger civil society event in London in July. This paper will be presented to Finance Ministers at CFMM.
<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para14">The UK is hosting the 2002 CFMM to mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee year. In recognition of this, Her Majesty will open the meetings on 24 September.
<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para15">In addition, there will be a number of events taking place in the margins of the ministerial sessions:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An exhibition of UK/Commonwealth links in 2002 will run over the three days of CFMM. Exhibits are planned to cover the Commonwealth games, the Spirit of Friendship Festival and the Golden Jubilee celebrations;

<BR>
an evening event to showcase the diversity of the Commonwealth;
<P>
<BR>
a business forum immediately prior to the CFMM (23&#150;24 September). This is being organised by the Commonwealth Business Council and will include a pre-conference dinner at the Guildhall.
<P>

<a name="20618w37.html_para16">To help ensure that Commonwealth citizens have access to information about the CFMM and that preparations for the meeting are as transparent as possible, a CFMM website has been established (www.cfmm2002.org). The site has been designed to give people across the Commonwealth quick access to information about both the policy aims and logistics of CFMM.

<a name="20618w37.html_para17">The website design takes into account potential technological limitations that may affect many developing Commonwealth countries. It is simple, easy to navigate and has a fast download speed.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his estimate is of the total costs to the Exchequer of the recent UK developing world debt cancellation, as announced since 1 May 1997, in each year from 1997&#150;98 to 2020&#150;21; and if he will make a statement.  [62392]<P>

 Prior to 1 May 1997 the UK had already cancelled its aid loans to all the poorest countries and payments are written off as they become due. Remaining debts are owed to the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). The original highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative was launched in October 1996 and in 1999 the UK was at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief in helping to secure agreement for the enhanced HIPC initiative. In December 1999, the UK Government announced that we would provide 100 per cent. debt relief on all ECGD debt for qualifying HIPCs to free up more resources for poverty reduction. The table sets out, by country and calendar year, all developing country debts to ECGD that have been written off since May 1997.

relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative will depend upon the progress of the remaining countries towards decision point, when they begin to receive interim debt relief on any payments due, and the subsequent completion point when debts are irrevocably cancelled.
