<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The EC Farm Structure Survey is held across all member states of the European Union four times every decade, to assess the agricultural situation across the Community and to monitor trends in the structure of holdings.<P>

2. The holder of the holding is that (natural or legal) person in whose name the holding is operated. The holder can own the holding outright or rent it, or be a hereditary long-term leaseholder, or a usufructuary or a trustee. A natural person may be either a single individual or a group of individuals, for example married couples, siblings, joint beneficiaries under a will or intestacy.<P>





3. The data is collected by age bands and, to calculate the average age, the mid-point of each age band is used. The mid-point of 67 is assumed for the age band Aged 65 and over.<P>

 The planned reduction in grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency to fund its work on salmon and freshwater fisheries in England will come into effect in 2001-02. It will be for the Environment Agency to determine its spending priorities for that year in the light of the fall in grant-in-aid. Until it has done this it is not possible to assess the impact of the reduction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government are committed to making the best possible use of existing trunk road systems in tackling problems of traffic congestion. This may, at certain specific locations, involve the provision of designated lanes but I do not envisage their widespread use in the immediate future on the motorway and trunk road network outside urban areas. Where such lanes are appropriate, consideration needs to be given on a case by case basis as to what vehicles, including buses and heavy goods vehicles, may use them and at what times.

 The public were consulted on options for a road solution at Hindhead, including the proposed tunnel scheme, in 1992. As part of the study now under way the public are being involved on an on-going basis through a comprehensive programme of consultation and communication. This includes setting up local focus groups, a wider reference group, telephone interviews with longer distance travellers and a formal public consultation exercise. The commission for the study was awarded on the basis of a tender price of &#163;188,066. Mr. Peter Griffiths, Director of the National Trust for the South Region, is a member of the study's steering group.

 Under the PPP, the private sector will take over responsibility for delivering a massive programme of work on the Tube network, totalling around &#163;8 billion of investment and around &#163;5 billion of maintenance over the next 15 years.

 To test that the London Underground PPP represents value for money, London Underground, with their professional advisers, are developing a rigorous public sector comparator. A paper explaining the principles underlying the comparator will be published shortly. The cash values produced by the comparator will also be released, but only once negotiations with bidders are complete.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w01.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Under the PPP, we expect to see around &#163;8 billion invested in the Underground over the first 15 years with around a further &#163;5 billion spent on maintenance. It would not be sensible at this stage, before London Underground have received bids, to estimate how this will be funded. However, we have made clear that if it should prove value for money, then Transport for London will receive the appropriate level of central government grant to allow for London Underground's need to make any payments to the PPP contractors.
<P>

<a name="00320w01.html_para10">The PPP is about obtaining best value in the way that farebox revenue and any public subsidy is spent. The evidence indicates that the PPP will be better value than the wholly public sector alternatives, even if central government grant continues to be paid.

 Fares on the London Underground will be a matter for the Mayor. The economic analysis London Underground and their advisers have undertaken for the PPP assumes that fares will do no more than keep pace with inflation once the PPP is in place.

 The information requested is not held centrally by the Department. Our aim is to ensure that all vehicles comply with prescribed roadworthiness standards and that the tools are there to see they are enforced. Through its oversight of the MOT testing regime the Vehicle Inspectorate enforces the relevant roadworthiness requirements.

 New European Union rules on the level of finances required by holders of international operator licences came into effect in this country for new applications in October 1999. Existing operators have until October 2001 to meet the new requirements. They require an amount equal to or exceeding 9,000 euro for the first or only vehicle authorised under the operator's licence and 5,000 euro for each additional vehicle. This represents a significant increase over the previous financial requirements. Traffic Commissioners assess the level of financial resources required by domestic operators as a proportion of these figures. For standard national licences this is normally some 80 per cent. of the figure set for an international operator's licence and about 50 per cent. for Restricted licences. We are planning to carry out a consultation exercise seeking views on whether these remain appropriate levels of funding for domestic operators.

 The Government's Response was published in January 2000 (Cmnd 4550). It identified a number of recommendations to be considered further in the White Paper on urban policy. The White Paper will set out policies and proposals for improving the quality of life in our towns and cities. An important part of this will be our proposals for improving the management of the public realm, including our parks and open spaces.
<P>

<a name="00320w02.html_para3">Parks and open spaces are important to the quality of life in all our towns, cities and conurbations. The proposals set out in our Response and being developed in the White Paper are for national application.

 A large proportion of the open space surrounding the built up area of London is designated as Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land. As such it enjoys a high degree of protection from development, through existing national planning guidance and local planning policies. In addition, Strategic Guidance for London Planning Authorities (RPG3) issued in 1996 urges local planning authorities to encourage the maintenance and support of agriculture as a major economic activity in the Green Belt.
<P>

<a name="00320w02.html_para4">The new Mayor of London will be required to produce a number of important strategies including a spatial development strategy, a number of environmental strategies and biodiversity action plan.

<P>
<a name="00320w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have no plans to conduct such a review. Section 122 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 places a duty on local traffic authorities to exercise their functions under the Act so as to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of traffic, so far as practicable having regard to certain matters such as amenity and need for access to premises. This includes the exercise of their power under section 92 to place bollards to prevent vehicles from using roads from which

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take powers to require utility telecoms companies and local authorities to co-ordinate their work programmes so that disruptive excavations of the highway are minimised; and if he will make a statement.  [114996]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Street works undertakers are required under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 to co-operate with highway authorities and one another, and the authorities for their part are required to co-ordinate works in their streets. Section 66 of the 1991 Act provides that undertakers must carry on and complete works with all reasonable dispatch, and a street authority can require an undertaker obstructing the street more extensively or for longer than is reasonable necessary to comply with a restraining notice. Where there is a risk of serious traffic disruption from street works, section 56 enables the street authority to direct the undertaker to carry out work only at certain times, if the disruption can be avoided or reduced by this means.
<P>

<a name="00320w03.html_para0">In a further development, the 1998 Integrated Transport White Paper made a commitment to consult on options for an incentive system, with penalties, to minimise disruption to road users, and to encourage improved co-ordination of street works. A consultation was launched last October and my Department is considering the responses to the consultation in order to decide on the best way forward.
<P>

<a name="00320w03.html_para1">Finally, Regulations have been made under powers in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, and came into effect last year, to facilitate and encourage the electronic transfer of information about street works and other works in the highway between utilities such as telecoms companies and highway authorities. This will ensure greater consistency and speed in transferring and registering the information, which in turn will help authorities in their co-ordination role.

<a name="00320w04.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to improve the provision of public transport in <i>(a)</i> rural areas and <i>(b)</i> West Cumbria; and if he will make a statement.  [115144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Many of the measures within the Integrated Transport White Paper and the Transport Bill currently before Parliament benefit rural areas. We are also 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2000 : Column: 398W</I><P>
developing a Ten Year Plan for transport to set out a long-term investment programme and a Rural White Paper to set out our objectives for rural areas.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para0">The system of Local Transport Plans, which are five year integrated transport strategies prepared by local authorities, are the cornerstone of delivering better transport in local ares. Authorities are specifically required to address the accessibility needs of people in rural areas in their Plans and to recognise the interrelationship between rural and other areas.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2000 : Column: 399W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para1">We appreciate that rural areas have particular transport problems, which is why we have made &#163;170 million available for rural transport over the three years to March 2001. The bulk of this money is delivered through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant. In England this provides &#163;32.5 million a year to fund new or improved bus services for rural areas. In February we announced the extension of the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant until at least 2004.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para2">We are also conscious of the importance of rural railways. Our guidance to the Franchising Director seeks improvements through the re-negotiation of franchise agreements. We have also made available additional funding for a new Rail Passenger Partnership scheme aimed specifically at providing support for locally sponsored services that are not commercially viable.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para3">We look forward to receiving the full Local Transport Plan for Cumbria to be submitted in July. This will set out the authority's plans for transport in the area for the next five years. We have also been working with the many local bodies on the development of a Lake District Transport Strategy to improve and co-ordinate public transport provision across Cumbria. The strategy recognises the importance of links with both West Cumbria and the Furness area. A range of measures to improve public transport are under way, including upgrading information displays and new bus shelters. Further work is planned, including through ticketing, marketing and promotion, travel point information, improving existing interchange between bus and rail and new multi-modal interchanges.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para4">Cumbria has received &#163;957,300 a year in Rural Bus Subsidy Grant and has established 27 new and 64 improved services. The county has also recently been awarded &#163;722,000 under the Rural Bus Challenge for a project to enhance bus links between Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith. Feeder bus services to the core route (including one from Workington), interchange and waiting facilities and travel information are all to be improved. This work will complement the improvements achieved through the Local Transport Plan, particularly those planned for Penrith rail station to enhance linkages with bus services. A feasibility study is also being undertaken with interested companies and Railtrack to establish detailed proposals to improve the Furness and Cumbrian coast rail services.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para5">The Countryside Agency has provided grant to support three Rural Transport Partnerships, including one in West Cumbria, to secure additional resources for rural transport supporting local communities and in particular to reduce rural isolation and social exclusion through enhanced access to jobs and services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In the run-up to the London Referendum between May 1997 and 7 May 1998 the total publicity budget was &#163;1.6 million. There was no publicity budget for publicising the Greater London Authority between the Referendum and Royal Assent for the Greater London Authority Act 1999 in November 1999.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para6">The Government are currently running a multi-media information campaign to ensure that Londoners know about the new voting process on 4 May and understand how the Mayor and Assembly will affect their daily lives. The total budget for this campaign is &#163;4.1 million--about 81p per London elector. Approximately &#163;2.9 million will be spent in the current financial year and &#163;1.2 million in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00320w04.html_para7">In addition, following the recent amendment to the Greater London Authority Act 1999, the Government have agreed to spend &#163;1.7 million on a booklet prepared by the Greater London Returning Officer containing election addresses by Mayoral candidates.

 All executive and advisory NDPBs sponsored by our Department on 1 April 1999 were required to publish annual reports; to publish annual accounts (where they had significant expenditure of their own); to operate in accordance with the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information; and to draw up, and make publicly available on request, a Register of Members' Interests. All NDPBs were also encouraged to hold meetings in public and to release or otherwise make available records of meetings. There was, however, no statutory requirement or obligation for them to do so.

 We welcomed the bilateral agreement signed by Uganda and Sudan last December in Nairobi. Successful implementation will increase stability in the region and help secure the release and return of abducted children. We are encouraging the Governments in both Kampala and Khartoum to honour these commitments.
<P>

<a name="00320w06.html_para2">We have consistently urged the Government of Uganda to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Northern Uganda. I welcomed the Government's decision to pass amnesty legislation when I saw President Museveni last October. But this is just one element towards a negotiated settlement which must also involve commitment on all sides to reconciliation and rehabilitation. We continue to encourage the Government of Uganda to open direct dialogue with the Lords Resistance Army (LRA). The Department for International Development is also supporting a number of projects in the North aimed at promoting peace, rehabilitation and development, as well as responding to some humanitarian needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry by how much generation of electricity from nuclear sources would have to be increased over current levels to <i>(a)</i> save two million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and <i>(b)</i> meet all the Government's current carbon dioxide reduction targets.  [114819]<P>

<P>
<a name="00320w08.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The table sets out the required increase in nuclear generation to achieve savings of 2 MtC and 22 MtC. The latter figure represents the additional reduction required, based on existing policies, to achieve the domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in CO <sub>2</sub>  by 2010. The provisionally estimated generation from nuclear plants in 1999 was around 88 TWh. This amount of generation is estimated to be saving between about 10 and 21 MtC, depending on the mix of fuels assumed to be displaced.

<P>
<a name="00320w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Two written representations have been received following the withdrawal by the National Grid Company plc at the public inquiry on Thursday 2 March 2000 of the National Grid Company plc (Nunthorpe to Newby) Compulsory Purchase Order 1999. That inquiry related to the compulsory purchase of certain rights to underground part of the proposed 400 kV electrical connection between Lackenby, Picton and Shipton at privately owned land between Nunthorpe and Newby. The Secretary of State is now awaiting the Inspector's report on the proceedings, but understands that the company considered it had obtained all the necessary voluntary agreements from the landowners along the route of the proposed compulsory purchase order.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the average number of construction jobs which will be created by each of the gas-fired power stations for which approval has been sought but not yet granted.  [114156]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The actual number of construction jobs will vary according to the size of the power station and the stage reached in its construction. From information available to the Department, we estimate that construction of 1 Gigawatt could generate peak employment of around 800 jobs, including an allowance for employment in production of the gas turbines themselves.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government expect to be able to relax the stricter consents policy for new gas-fired power stations as soon as it concludes, on the basis of advice from the Director General of Electricity Supply, that the reform programme has been undertaken and the distortions in the electricity market have been removed. The Government expect the reforms to be substantially complete across the picture before the consents policy is relaxed.

<a name="00320w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 As was made clear in the October 1998 White Paper the Government intend to leave the initiative for proposals for new generation capacity entirely to developers. Power stations are run by private companies which must make market investment decisions, subject to the usual environmental and planning/consent constraints. It is therefore a matter for power station developers to consider where they wish to locate their stations.

 Information about the value of counterfeit goods seized by trading standards officers is available in a National Counterfeiting Survey compiled by Warwick University, but the latest figures available only cover the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999. The replies from 75 per cent. of Trading Standards Departments in England, Wales and Scotland show that during this period goods with an estimated street value of &#163;22,445,580 were seized, this being equivalent to a value of &#163;65,053,217 if they had been genuine goods. These figures are not, though, comprehensive, but it is hoped that better estimates covering the whole of the UK will be available in the future. One initiative that should, among other things, help to deliver an improved understanding of the extent of all intellectual property crime is the new Counterfeiting and Piracy Forum. The Forum will meet for the first time later this month bringing together industry, public sector enforcers, consumers, retailers and Internet service providers with Government. This Forum will be able to explore issues such as better record keeping of criminal activity, greater co-operation and co-ordination of enforcement effort and how to make consumers more knowledgeable about short and long term damage to both themselves and others caused by the purchase of fake goods.

 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2000]:</i> National Science Week launched on Friday, now annually attracts well over a million visitors to more than 7,000 events, and is the flagship project of our Public Understanding of Science, Engineering and Technology programme. This programme currently supports 15 pilot projects with a total value this financial year of &#163;1.46 million.
<P>

<a name="00320w09.html_para3">More generally, the Department grant-aids relevant activities throughout the year organised by the Royal Society, the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Research Councils.
<P>

<a name="00320w09.html_para4">We have also consistently supported the engineering community in its efforts to raise the profile of engineering in the mind of the public and past initiatives such as "Action for Engineering" have received substantial financial assistance. One of the key aims of the latest such initiative to receive DTI support, the "Campaign to Promote Engineering" is to present engineers and engineering as key contributors to the nation's wealth and quality of life. The campaign's patrons include Professional Engineering Institutions, Trade Associations and companies both large and small within all sectors of UK industry. DTI also continues its financial support for SETNET (Science Engineering Technology Mathematics Network) whose key objective is to bring coherence and co-ordination to the myriad schemes and resources aimed at fostering the teaching and learning of engineering related subjects in schools.

 The CVR(T) Life Extension Programme was a single source procurement for which only Alvis Vehicles Ltd. were invited to tender. Since Alvis are the Design Authority for CVR(T) and hold the Intellectual Property Rights for much of the vehicle, the MOD could not issue information to a third party to have the vehicle redesigned. There was therefore no practicable alternative but to contract with Alvis. However, this covered only the design of the modifications and the conversion of the first 200 vehicles and a limited competition is being run between Alvis and the MOD's Army Base Repair Organisation to convert the remaining vehicles.

<P>
<a name="00320w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has, at the request of the Department for International Development (DfID), provided four Puma helicopters with around 100 support personnel, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort George with an additional five helicopters to Mozambique to assist in the international flood relief efforts.
<P>

<a name="00320w11.html_para3">The current estimate of the MOD's additional costs, which the DfID agreed to reimburse, is around &#163;1.15 million for the four Puma aircraft and support personnel, which includes the cost of both deployment and recovery by civilian charter and RAF transport aircraft. The deployment of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort George is estimated at &#163;1.4 million. It would be highly misleading to refer to this as income; the DfID will merely make good the additional costs the Ministry of Defence incurs in giving assistance.

 The new ONE service provides a coherent and seamless service for people of working age, by providing a single point of access for help in finding the best way to work, and help in securing benefits. All advisers in the ONE pilots have been trained to work sensitively with all ONE clients, and have benefited from the expertise of stakeholders, e.g. with experience of working with people with mental illness, who participated in the training process.

This will enable us, in due course, to provide information on those in this group passing through ONE. However, this will only given an indication of the numbers of people using the ONE service who have a mental or behavioural disorder and have claimed a sickness or disability benefit as a consequence.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many claims and what percentage take-up of the working families tax credit he is assuming is necessary to meet his target of taking 800,000 children out of poverty.  [113786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00320w16.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2000]:</i> The estimate that 800,000 children will be lifted out of poverty is based on the combined effect of the tax and benefit changes announced in the last two Budgets--in particular the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, the 10p starting rate of tax, the introduction of the Children's Tax Credit, reforms to National Insurance and increases in Child Benefit and child premia within Income Support.
<P>

 If site operators had contributed to environmental bodies from the introduction of the tax on 1 October 1996 at a level entitling them to claim the maximum tax credit of 20 per cent. of their liability, the maximum credit that could have been claimed nationally, up to 29 February 2000, is &#163;292 million.

 The Treasury have received such representations from time to time. The Treasury Policy Action Team (PAT 14) report "Access to Financial Services" said that the way forward lies in developing new and alternative means to deliver and provide banking services, including through the Post Office network. A number of banks already have agreements with the Post Office to provide banking services through post offices.

 Hypothetical calculations of this kind are meaningless. A wholesale change in financing of this kind would have had a major effect on relative yields.

<a name="00320w19.html_para3">Improving educational attainment is an intrinsic part of our strategy for tackling the causes of poverty and social exclusion. In 1997 in Shropshire, 62 per cent. of students in English and 61 per cent. in Maths achieved Level 4 and above in Key Stage 2. By 1999 this had improved to 74 per cent. in English and 72 per cent. in Maths.The health of our children is also an important indicator of levels of poverty and social exclusion. In Shrewsbury and Atcham in 1997-98, the rate at which children (aged under 16) were admitted to hospital as a result of an unintentional injury resulting in a hospital stay of more than three days was 1.5 per thousand (to the nearest 0.5 per thousand). This is broadly unchanged from 1995-96.

 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is leading a fundamental review of local government finance, which is being carried out in partnership with local authorities. The review is looking at the distribution of revenue support grant for all local authority services, including the fire service, to investigate whether there is a way of distributing the grant which is simpler, more stable and fairer than the present arrangements. The review is also considering options for improving and simplifying the local authority capital finance system. The aim is to publish a Green Paper in the summer.

 As I stated in the reply I gave to the hon. Member on 21 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 813-14W, tenders for two new prisons have been let and these prisons are currently under construction at Rye Hill, at Onley near Rugby and Marchington in East Staffordshire. Later this year it is planned to issue tenders for the procurement of a further two prisons at Ashford in Middlesex and Peterborough. There is outline planning permission for both but detailed approval will be needed once the designs are finalised. The Prison Service also has outline planning permission for a new prison at Maghull on Merseyside and is discussing with the local planning authority the submission of a planning application for a new prison in Woolwich, South East London.

<P>

<a name="00320w21.html_para0">The Home Office recently acquired the site of the former Youth Training Centre at St. Charles in Brentwood for development as a Secure Training Centre (STC). An application for outline planning permission will be submitted to the local planning authority shortly. This, with the STCs already open at Medway near Rochester, Rainsbrook near Rugby and Hassockfield near Consett in Co. Durham, would bring the STC estate to four establishments with a fifth site yet to be identified.
<P>

<a name="00320w21.html_para1">Other secure facilities for which the Home Office is directly responsible are immigration detention centres. A planning application to redevelop the former Aldington prison near Ashford in Kent as a new purpose-built immigration detention centre has been submitted to the local planning authority. The Immigration and Nationality Department is also preparing a planning application to redevelop its Harmondsworth site near Heathrow Airport to provide another new purpose-built immigration detention centre. These form part of the proposals for implementing the recent White Paper about firmer, fairer and faster immigration controls.

<a name="00320w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 There is no formal requirement on Departments to either produce or publish full environmental appraisals. However, environmental appraisals have been published alongside two Government Bills this session, representing 5.5 per cent. of the number of Government Bills published in the current Session, including the Financial Services and Markets Bill which was published last Session but carried over to complete its passage in this.
<P>

<a name="00320w22.html_para5">The assessment of the environmental impacts of draft legislation should be integral to the broader appraisal of policy that takes place but may not be set out in a separate statement.
<P>

<a name="00320w22.html_para6">Environmental appraisals are part of the overall policy appraisal process and are therefore carried out alongside, for example, regulatory impact appraisals and health impact assessments where necessary.
