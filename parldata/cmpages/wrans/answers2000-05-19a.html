 The Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Robert May, and I held a series of meetings on biotechnology in Washington on 1 and 2 May. We met US Government representatives, including Dan Glickman, US Secretary of State of Agriculture; Mike McCabe, Deputy Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency; and

Sharon Smith Holston, Deputy Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration. We also met congressmen Dennis Kucinich and Calvin Dooley, representatives of interested non-governmental organisations and representatives from the Biotechnology Industry Organisation, in order to hear views from across the debate. In all these meetings I made clear the UK's commitment to a science-based approach to biotechnology which protects public health and the environment, explained developments in the biotechnology debate in the UK (including reform of our regulatory system and improved food labelling), and discussed American concerns in order to build a common understanding of the ways forward. As a result, in advance of the next G8 summit, we are taking forward discussions with G8 partners and developing countries on the recommendation of the OECD conference on GM food safety in Edinburgh for an international scientific advisory panel on GM food and environmental safety.

<P>
<P><I>19 May 2000 : Column: 283W</I><P>
policies on the historic environment can be put back by two months to 30 November 2000. This extension acknowledges the view which has been expressed in some quarters that English Heritage requires more time to prepare public discussion papers, analyse the responses to those papers and work up its final report. The Government now intends to issue its own statement on the historic environment by mid March 2001. In addition to setting out a strategy and action programme for the immediate future, I have agreed that this first part of the review being conducted by English Heritage should extend to considering how relevant policies might be developed over the longer term. I am laying copies of my letter in the Libraries of the House.

 We have already cancelled our aid debts for all of the poorest countries, not just for countries who qualify for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Their remaining bilateral debts to the UK are owed to the Export Credits Guarantee Department. These are being reduced under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. However, last December, it was announced that the UK will go further and provide 100 per cent. debt relief on all bilateral export credits for qualifying HIPC countries. This action will free up more resources in HIPC countries for investment in poverty reduction programmes.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if the Government will review the recommendation of the 1978 Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury on making a change in the law of tort so that parents of children who suffer brain damage following vaccination can take action for compensation on a balance of probabilities.  [122912]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00519w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Royal Commission recommended that the Government, or the local authority concerned, should be strictly liable in tort for severe damages suffered by anyone (adult or child) as a result of vaccination which has been recommended in the interests of the community. Following the work of the Commission, the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social Security, was established in 1978. Under the scheme, one-off payments of &#163;40,000 are made to people severely disabled by vaccination against certain diseases. The Government have no plans to make changes to the liability rules that apply to compensation claims through the courts for these cases.

 Since the Government announced its intention to review clusters policy in November 1999, it has commissioned a mapping study, to be completed by June, of existing cluster activity to inform the work of a new Clusters Policy Steering Group (CPSG) chaired by my noble Friend the Minister for Science. Membership of this group includes other Ministers, RDAs, the private sector, the CBI, TUC, academia, local government and cluster experts. The Group has an open remit to look at all aspects of cluster-related activity and recommended to Cabinet new policy initiatives intended to remove any barriers to the growth and the development of clusters. The Group will look at all cluster activity and will not concern itself exclusively with technology clusters. It will nevertheless take due account of the recommendations made by my noble Friend the Minister for Science's separate group which looked at bio-technology clusters and reported in August 1999.

<P>

<a name="00519w03.html_para1">

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the first two Type 45 destroyers. This matter falls to me to answer within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
As you are aware, the contract to complete Preparation for Demonstration (PFD) for the Type 45 was placed with Marconi Electronic System (MES, now BAE SYSTEMS) on 23 November 1999. BAE SYSTEMS was also appointed as the Prime Contractor for the Type 45 Programme. We are keen to ensure that we retain our ability to conduct effective competition for follow-on Type 45 destroyers. To this end, both BAE SYSTEMS Marine (YSL) Ltd and Vosper Thornycroft are involved in the PFD contract so that, from the outset, we have a design that has evolved with the active participation of both yards, enabling the efficient construction of Type 45s at either yard.
<BR>
It is currently planned to place the Demonstration and First-of-Class Manufacture (DFM) contract with the Prime Contractor later this year, to meet an in-service date for the first-of-class ship of 2007. The detailed contractual arrangements for the DFM contract remain under consideration with the Prime Contractor but out plans are that the first of class is assembled and launched at the BAE SYSTEMS Marine (YSL) yard on the Clyde. The timing of the contract for the second ship of the class and where it will be built are still under consideration but value for money will be the key factor.

Under the contract MBD will assume responsibility from MOD for the management, storage, repair and distribution of Rapier FSB2 spares until 2006-07 when the FSB2 goes out of service. The transfer of responsibility will take 12 months as the new arrangements are put in place. The contract was let for a maximum price of approximately &#163;24 million (including VAT) and includes an incentive arrangement whereby any savings made by MBD are shared with MOD.

 <i>[holding answer 18 May 2000]:</i> UK participation in Surgical Training Exercises in Denmark was suspended in 1998 and an internal review of MOD surgical training methods was set in hand.

They investigated the suitability and effectiveness of other training methods and witnessed a complete Surgical

Training Exercise. The study team were satisfied that the treatment of the animals was entirely humane and appropriate steps were taken to avoid suffering during all phases of the exercises. They could identify no equally effective alternative to the use of live animal models in order to prepare our surgical teams for the treatment of trauma under battlefield conditions. They concluded that to ensure the best possible treatment for injured Service personnel and civilians during conflict, it is entirely appropriate and necessary for our military surgical teams to resume participation in the Surgical Training Exercises. On the basis of this advice, we have decided that UK participation in the Danish Surgical Training Exercises should resume when we are invited.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00519w04.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The MOD adopts a 'zero tolerance' policy on all types of fraud and following Treasury guidance seeks to reduce risk, including that applying to procurement contracts, through effective controls and prompt investigation. Safeguards created to deter procurement fraud, including collusion and corruption, cover separation of duties, rotation of staff, hospitality books and quality checks. Good procurement practices are employed, such as effective competition, avoidance where possible of single source 'cost plus' arrangements, providing clear specifications, avoiding changes to requirement after contract award and authorising payment only when requirements have been met. These safeguards also naturally apply to the Smart Procurement process during the introduction of which the amount of fraud awareness training to procurement staff increased. Moreover, full guidance on fraud deterrence and detection is now available to all procurement staff on internal electronic mail systems as part of a Project Manager's toolkit. These specialist aspects of the procurement process are part of a wider range of fraud deterrence initiatives already in place or about to be introduced, including the creation in February 1999 of a Defence Fraud Analysis Unit. This unit now acts as the focus for MOD fraud matters including the promotion of risk awareness and uses the latest data mining and fraud detection techniques in a proactive response to fraud risk.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00519w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The estimate that 1.2 million children will be lifted out of poverty is based upon the number of children in low-income families who will no longer be living in households below 60 per cent. of median income after the combined effect of the personal tax and benefit changes announced in the four Budgets since May 1997. The calculation includes those households classified as self-employed and measures income after allowing for housing costs, as explained in Box 5.1 of the March 2000 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, HC 346. Consistent with the indicators chosen in "Opportunity for all", Box 5.1 also presents estimates of the number of children lifted above a number of low-income thresholds.

 Local authorities manage their debt corporately so there are no separate figures for debt in respect of housing. We do, however, make estimates of notional housing debt for the purposes of revenue subsidy calculations. The England total estimated housing debt for subsidy purposes for 2000-01 is &#163;19.3 billion. With regard to these matters in Scotland and Wales, the responsibility has been passed to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.

 The establishment of diplomatic relations between States takes place by mutual consent, and if either State withdraws that consent diplomatic relations are broken. There are no legal limitations on the right of a State to break diplomatic relations with another, but the action is now almost invariably taken for political reasons. A break in diplomatic relations often follows a sequence of reciprocal or retaliatory moves between two States to downgrade their relations or a collective political decision by a number of States directed against another State whose conduct is regarded as unacceptable. The reasons for the United Kingdom deciding to break off diplomatic relations in any particular instance depend very much on the circumstances of each case.

 The development of an effective judiciary remains a matter of priority for the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).

 The decision makers from the Disability Benefits Unit of the Benefits Agency have access to guidance in the Disability Handbook. This is written by the Department's Medical Policy Group and contains guidance on the care and mobility needs likely to arise from a range of medical conditions. It contains a specific section on Guillain-Barre syndrome which indicates that a factual report from the relevant hospital is likely to be important in establishing the severity of the condition. For this particular disease, the hospital is likely to be able to provide more relevant information than that normally contained in family doctor records. The examining medical practitioners also have access to this guidance. However, their role is usually to provide an independent professional assessment of the care and mobility needs and they are unlikely to need to have access to information from the claimant's medical records for this particular purpose in this particular type of case.
