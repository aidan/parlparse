 The track record of the private sector in delivering water in developing countries has been mixed which is why DFID is interested in what works. And what works varies from place to place so the public versus private debate is not a straightforward one. The UN Human Development Report recognises that &#147;the most obvious lesson from any review of public and private provision is that there are no hard and fast cross-country blueprints for success&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="70117w0001.htm_para5"><a name="07011767000084">Successful public water utilities include ONEA in Burkina Faso, SANASA in Brazil and the National Water and Sewerage Corporation in Uganda (NWSC). The NWSC provides consultancy and advisory services to other utilities in East Africa. The formation of this business unit has been partly due to the strength of the private sector environment in Uganda. On the other hand the UN Human Development Report also notes that &#147;many publicly owned utilities are failing the poor, combining inefficiency and lack of accountability in management with inequity in financing and pricing.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="70117w0001.htm_para6"><a name="07011767000085">In Cochabamba, Bolivia, the failure of private sector water provision led to rioting in the streets and the cancellation of the contract with the private provider. In Senegal on the other hand, private sector involvement helped create 81,000 new water connections and increased the country&#146;s water supply by 10 per cent. between 1996 and 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="70117w0001.htm_para7"><a name="07011767000086">The failure and success of both public and private utilities depends on more than ownership structure. Factors such as the level of inherited debt, the quality of regulation and the engagement of civil society are highly significant. The conclusion that DFID draws is to support what works best in each context in for the world&#146;s poorest people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="70117w0001.htm_para8"><a name="07011767000087">DFID&#146;s policy is that&#151;where we can&#151;we respond to requests from developing country governments for assistance to help improve the efficiency of their water utilities. Usually this involves DFID providing support to public bodies. In some cases, where the developing country government has a policy for participation of the private sector in service delivery, DFID may be asked to advise on how this might best be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="70117w0001.htm_para9"><a name="07011767000088">Nevertheless, the public sector continues to play  the leading role in providing water and sanitation throughout the world. This is why most of DFID&#146;s aid (about 95 per cent. of our bilateral country programme expenditure on water and sanitation) supports the delivery of water and sanitation through governments, not-for-profit or humanitarian agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="70117w0001.htm_para10"><a name="07011767000089">Assessments of public and private provision have been completed by a range of international and research organisations including the World Bank. These studies (including a DFID-funded assessment by WaterAid of the impact of private sector involvement on the poor) reinforce DFID&#146;s view that the polarised debate about public and private utility ownership fails to grasp the complexity of the current situation.

 The UK provides core financial support to the International Development Association, the arm of the World Bank which provides grants and concessional loans to the world&#146;s poorest countries. Donors pledge support to IDA for a three-year period. In February 2005, the UK pledged &#163;1.43 billion to the fourteenth replenishment of IDA. This was comprised of (i) a core contribution of &#163;1.33 billion, to be paid in three equal instalments of &#163;443 million in 2006-07, 2007-08  and 2008-09; and (ii) an additional contribution of &#163;100 million contingent on progress on harmonisation and conditionally, to be paid in two equal instalments of &#163;50 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08. Payment is by promissory note. Expenditure is charged to DFID&#146;s budget when the note is deposited with the IDA but notes will be encashed over a nine-year period. The UK will therefore spend &#163;493 million on IDA 14 in the current financial year. This represents approximately  10 per cent. of DFID&#146;s total budget in 2006-07.</p>

We committed &#163;200 million to the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF)&#151;part of the Bank&#146;s Africa Action Plan resulting from Gleneagles&#151;and &#163;50 million to the Education Fast Track Initiative (FTI), whose Catalytic Fund and Education Programme Development Fund are administered by the Bank.

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="70117w0004.htm_para15"><a name="07011790000098">London is the world&#146;s leading international financial centre, with unparalleled scale, scope and internationalism. 70 per cent. of global secondary bond market trading takes place in London, along with over 40 per cent. of over-the-counter derivatives trading, over 30 per cent. of world foreign exchange business, over 40 per cent. of global trade in foreign-listed equities, and 20 per cent. of cross-border bank lending. Over 250 foreign banks are based in the UK&#151;more than in any other financial centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_451"><a name="70117w0004.htm_para16"><a name="07011790000099">The success of the UK&#146;s financial sector depends on a number of factors, including our tradition of openness, innovation, high-level skills, world-class regulation and a competitive business environment. London has proved an attractive location for both EU and non-EU financial services providers, with non-EU providers benefiting not just from London&#146;s large pools of liquidity and broad international investor base but also from London&#146;s position as a gateway to European financial markets. The Government are working with the financial sector, including through the Chancellor&#146;s high-level group on financial services, to ensure its continued success.</p>

In the 2006 Budget the Government undertook to consider the legal and accounting issues surrounding unclaimed assets. Having done this, the Government believe that in order for the banking industry to set up an unclaimed assets scheme, where the rights and interests of both consumers and the industry are protected, it is necessary to bring forward enabling legislation. The Government intend to proceed with this and consult widely.</p>

 The remaining long-term liability of PFI credits for signed street lighting schemes, which is the outstanding revenue grant payable to local authorities as a result of the award of PFI credits, is &#163;1.9 billion. Buy back costs are essentially the voluntary termination terms. It is not possible to calculate the department&#146;s total PFI termination liability. The amount would vary from contract to contract, when the event occurred and may be subject to negotiation with the PFI Contractor. The Government contributes partly to the costs of a PFI street lighting scheme. The contractual liability rests with the local authority who carry out a value for money (vfm) assessment of the overall costs to the public sector before signing a contract. This vfm assessment takes account of both the financial costs and the expected value of risk transferred to the private sector.</p>

 The European Commission already has plans for a Directive on cross-border enforcement of traffic offences and is currently consulting on the subject. It is recognised that effective enforcement where an offender is not resident in the country where the offence was committed can benefit from co-operation with other member states, and that there is therefore a legitimate interest at European Union level. There will be careful scrutiny of any proposals that are brought forward and the timetable for their introduction will be dependent on that process.</p>

It provides for member states to recognise and enforce fines imposed on their nationals and residents by other member states. It will close the loophole that allows an offender to effectively evade punishment by leaving the member state that imposed the financial penalty. The Government are taking the necessary action to implement this measure in the United Kingdom as soon as practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_485"><a name="70117w0009.htm_para2"><a name="07011790000583">In addition, in the Road Safety Act 2006, we introduced provisions to enable the introduction of a Graduated Fixed Penalty and Deposit scheme to help enforce penalties against offenders for traffic and roadworthiness offences such as overloaded lorries, where the offender cannot prove they have a satisfactory United Kingdom address at which a summons could be served. A deposit could be taken by either the police or VOSA enforcement officers in lieu of a fixed penalty notice or in more serious cases in lieu of a Court hearing. The offenders will therefore not be able to avoid paying the appropriate penalty by simply leaving the country as the sum will already have been taken. The Act also allows, in any case where a prohibition has been issued and where either the driver or vehicle is deemed unfit to continue with the journey, that both the police and VOSA enforcement officers will in future be able to immobilise a vehicle if they believe there is a risk that a driver will continue with his journey whilst under prohibition. The details of the schemes will be subject to a consultation in 2007 with a view to implementation later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="70117w0009.htm_para3"><a name="07011790000584">I and the Irish Transport Minister jointly undertook in February 2006 to work together to initiate cooperation between the United Kingdom and Ireland on one another&#146;s driving disqualifications. Once initiated, this would mean that a resident of Ireland, disqualified from driving in the United Kingdom, would not escape the consequences of that disqualification when he returned home. It would also mean that similar measures applied to a resident of Great Britain or Northern Ireland disqualified in Ireland for a motoring offence committed there. We plan to take this step within the framework established by the 1998 European Union Convention on driving disqualifications. We had originally intended that this practice should be initiated in the early part of 2007. There has been some unavoidable delay to this work, but I remain committed to bringing such mutual recognition into effect as soon as practicable. Officials from all three jurisdictions are working closely together to this end and we expect to consult on details in the course of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_524"><a name="70117w0013.htm_para6"><a name="07011795000609">Digital transmission is more efficient than analogue in terms of power usage. Replacing the analogue terrestrial transmission network with a nationwide digital terrestrial television network will lead to a significant net reduction in energy usage by the transmission networks, estimated to be 186 GWh per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_525"><a name="70117w0013.htm_para7"><a name="07011795000610">Consumer power usage is expected to rise as a result of switchover, primarily because of the rapid increase in the take-up of set-top boxes, particularly for second sets, which would not be otherwise converted until replaced. The predicted level of the increase is dependent on a number of assumptions about the usage and the design of equipment in the market at the time of switchover. DCMS, DTI and DEFRA economists have estimated that the increase in consumer energy use attributable to switchover in 2012 is likely to be between 966 GWh and 2,816 GWh per annum. The increase is equivalent to a 0.37 per cent. increase in domestic electricity consumption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"><a name="70117w0013.htm_para8"><a name="07011795000611">The central estimate for the total impact of switchover is a net increase of 1,705 GWh per year, but this would be reduced if industry makes more energy-efficient products.

 It is not possible to answer the question in precisely the terms asked.

Approximately one-third of these are to do with village halls or other community facilities buildings which provide, among other functions, post office services. The other awards listed were made for a variety of purposes. For example, there are two awards to groups of post office pensioners, one to an adult education project also supported by Consignia plc, and several to projects which happen to be located near a post office.</p>

 Under powers given by section 6 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, the Secretary of State has issued operational guidance on penalty notices for disorder (PND) to all police forces in England and Wales. The guidance sets out, among other things, the circumstances in which it is appropriate to issue a PND and where it is not, for example when a victim may wish to seek compensation through the criminal courts. Although it is not legally binding, it is expected that officers will adhere to this guidance when considering whether or not to issue a PND.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 January 2007]:</i> Penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) were introduced under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Under the PND scheme, police may issue a fixed penalty of either &#163;50 or &#163;80 for a range of minor disorder offences. The recipient of a PND has 21 days from the date of issue in which either to pay the fine or to request a court hearing. Failure to do either will normally result in the PND being registered as a fine against the recipient at one and a half times the penalty amount or, in exceptional circumstances, in proceedings against them for the penalty offence. No other sanction is currently available to deal with non-compliance of a PND.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_559"><a name="70117w0016.htm_para4"><a name="07011795001028">As the PND scheme was introduced during 2004, data are only available for 2004 and 2005.

 On 7 March 2006, changes were announced to the immigration rules for postgraduate doctors and dentists to allow only those people who had done their undergraduate medical or dental study in the UK to be granted leave under those rules to complete a Foundation programme. Transitional arrangements were introduced for some categories of doctors who had already completed their undergraduate study. No additional measures were introduced for undergraduate medical students who had enrolled on a course in any part of the United Kingdom before the changes were announced, including in Northern Ireland. The changes do not affect undergraduate medical study.</p>

 Procedures for booking visits vary from prison to prison and remain at the discretion of governors. However, in response to the difficulties in booking prison visits at a number of prisons, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has actively sought to improve visits booking facilities and procedures. This has been partly through the development of an electronic system for booking visits, which is available to prisons, and the publication of guidelines on practical ways of improving the arrangements. NOMS is also looking into the booking of visits by e-mail and in the longer term, a national fully integrated IT system to meet a number of business needs such as the management of visits booking.</p>

 Assessment of the health risks of chemicals requires evaluation of the toxicological data in the context of the relevant amount and route of exposure. Authoritative reviews of the toxicological data for numerous chemicals are published by international organisations such as the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, a joint World Health Organisation (WHO)/International Labour Organisation/United Nations Environment Programme venture) and WHO (air and water quality guidelines). Various groups in the United Kingdom including expert advisory committees (the committee on carcinogenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, the committee on mutagenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, the committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, and the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants) and agencies (such as the Health Protection Agency) also make such assessments, as, indeed do agencies in other countries, such as the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in the United States of America.</p>

 The Department of Health and the other United Kingdom Health Departments have for the last three years commissioned Cancer Research UK to run SunSmart, the national skin cancer prevention and sun protection campaign. The campaign includes raising both public and professional awareness of skin cancer by providing information about skin cancer and its early detection, and by providing guidance on preventative measures to reduce its risk. The campaign raises awareness through support for health promotion events, the provision of printed resources, media briefings and the SunSmart website. By so doing, and by targeting specific at-risk groups, the campaign aims to reduce the prevalence of skin cancer.</p>

 There are at present no specific mechanisms or regulations that relate to the use of unsupervised/coin-operated sunbeds by under-16s. However the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has issued guidance which advises against use by those under 16. Cancer Research UK has also worked with representatives of the industry to help improve information for both staff and customers. That includes the displaying, of information specifically discouraging the use of sunbeds by young people under 16. In the light of concerns about unsupervised tanning salons and coin-operated sunbeds, the Department is planning further discussions with the HSE and other stakeholders to see whether the existing guidance aimed at sunbed operators and customers needs to be strengthened.</p>

 The Food Standards Agency welcomes and encourages the voluntary initiatives some businesses have undertaken to reduce the trans fats levels in their food products. However, any product reformulation to reduce the levels of trans fats (generally through the removal of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil) should not result in increases in the saturated fat levels in foods. Dietary intakes of trans fats are well within maximum recommended intakes, whereas saturated fat intakes currently exceed public health recommendations. Consequently saturated fat intakes represent the greater heart health risk and remain the priority.</p>
