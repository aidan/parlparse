The environment agencies would require any applicant wishing to develop a proposed disposal facility to assess impacts from a wide range of events and processes including those such as coastal erosion. This is in order to demonstrate that risks associated with radioactivity and other potential hazards would be acceptably low. Impacts from coastal erosion were considered in some detail during a recent review of the radioactive waste disposal authorisation for the LLWR near to Drigg in Cumbria.</p>

 A straight comparison of the cost between housing judges in hotels or accommodating them in lodgings is not easily made. Judges&#146; lodgings are an essential requirement for accommodating high court judges sitting outside of London. They provide a safe and secure environment and enable the judges to work in privacy and ensure confidentiality for extended periods, which hotels are unable to match except at prohibitive cost.</p>

 The international effort to achieve universal access has helped boost the numbers on anti-retroviral drugs (ARV) treatment. In sub-Saharan Africa, the numbers on treatment rose 10-fold from 2003 to 2006 from 100,000 to over 1 million. This is equivalent to 23 per cent. of those needing treatment. Similarly, the number of sites where people can receive treatment has increased significantly, including in Malawi and Zambia where there has been increases of 20 and 30-fold respectively. As of 1 December 2006, Global Fund-supported programmes have put 770,000 people on ARV treatment for HIV. This represents more than one-quarter of the 3 million people on ARV worldwide and is 28 per cent. greater than the Global Fund targets for 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="70313w0004.htm_para1"><a name="07031352000637">The UK has already pledged to spend &#163;1.5 billion on AIDS programmes between 2005 and 2008: this reflects our commitment to Universal Access. Despite this progress, much still needs to be done. In addition to funding AIDS programmes, we are supporting UNITAID, the new international drug purchasing facility, to fund second-line ARV, paediatric ARVs and TB and malaria drugs predominantly to low income countries. It is hoped that this mechanism will contribute to the necessary reductions in the prices of second-line drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir and tenofovir (Viread and Kaletra). The UK Government are also helping strengthen the World Health Organisation (WHO) medicines pre-qualification process through UNITAID, in order to speed up the availability of new second-line ARV products. WHO's pre-qualification process is a critical block for low income countries using new ARVs, with a long backlog of medicines seeking pre-approval. The additional funding will accelerate the process.</p>

DFID is currently the second major donor to the national HIV/AIDS programme, contributing 24 per cent. of the programme's resources from mid-2006 to mid-2008.

 A free packet scheme was first introduced on 17 April 2003, as a temporary measure unique to Iraq, at a time when service personnel did not have access to the welfare facilities that are now available in theatre. When the provision of goods and services in Iraq reached the required standard, the decision was taken to end the scheme on 8 April 2004. It was later re-introduced for a period of one month before Christmas 2004, and subsequently confirmed by the then Secretary of State for Defence, prior to Christmas 2005, that the pre-Christmas free packet scheme was to become a standard element of the operational welfare package. The free posting dates for Christmas 2006 were 10 November to 8 December inclusive, for which Royal Mail Group charged the Ministry of Defence &#163;577,000; this sum does not include the costs for additional air transport and onward distribution that were also paid for by the Department.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 March 2007]:</i> DTI 2007-08 budgets face significant pressures. In order to manage these, the Department has identified budget reductions that will allow savings to be recycled to pressures. However it has also been necessary to use some of the accumulated unspent funds within the science budget to seek to manage these pressures. The pressures that require funding include, but are not limited to, the rescue package for British Energy, costs associated with the MG Rover collapse, pan European space projects and the implementation of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. There will be no direct hypothecation of savings identified to individual pressures.</p>

The logs include personal data relating to requesters and other third parties, a brief summary of the request and an indication of any exemption that might have been applied. Rather than providing full details of each request and response, each log makes reference to documents held in electronic and paper format; it is these documents that provide information relating to the full text of the request and the exact nature of the response. Therefore, in their current form, the logs are not available for general inspection by hon. Members.

HIPs are designed to cut waste from home buying and selling as well as providing important energy information to help cut carbon emissions. The money has been spent on: developing and testing the home condition report and other components of the pack; putting in place a quality assurance framework to protect consumers and guarantee standards; developing the necessary systems; and explaining the changes to the public and industry stakeholders.</p>

In return, the parties have agreed to provide economic, energy and humanitarian assistance to the DPRK up to the equivalent of one million tons of heavy fuel oil. The agreement also establishes five working groups tasked with formulating plans to implement the Joint Statement.

 The US and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held bilateral talks earlier this week in New York as part of the agreement reached at the latest round of the six party talks on 13 February. The discussions provided an opportunity for both sides to discuss bilateral concerns in an attempt to move towards normalisation of relations between the two countries.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary clearly expressed our view that no party to the conflict will prevail through a military solution alone when she met the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister on 7 March. The availability of illegally-imported weaponry, while not a cause of the conflict in itself, is undoubtedly an aggravating factor and one which acts to prolong the conflict in Sri Lanka.

 We want all schools to offer access to extended services by 2010, providing a core offer of activities, with at least half of all primary and a third of secondary schools doing so by 2008. Primary schools are expected to provide, as part of the core offer, access to affordable child care at or through their school from 8 am to 6 pm all year round linked to a varied menu of activities. Secondary schools are not expected to offer formal child care but they are expected to provide access to a varied menu of activities (study support activities such as sports clubs, music tuition, dance, drama and art clubs) before and after school from 8 am to 6 pm and during the school holidays in response to demand. Our proposals for access to wraparound child care through schools were first published in our 10- year child care strategy &#147;Choice for parents, the best start for children&#148; in December 2004. We published further details in June 2005 in the Extended Schools Prospectus &#147;Extended schools: Access to opportunities and services for all&#148;. We have received a number of formal and informal representations on this, including a number of parliamentary questions on this subject over the past two years.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 March 2007]: </i>The general requirements relating to the procurement of goods and services are set out in the Academies Financial Handbook, which the Department issues to all academies. This includes the requirement for probity in procurement, to demonstrate that all parties are dealt with on a fair and equitable basis and to ensure that there is no private gain. In particular the Financial Handbook requires governors, including sponsor governors, to make formal declarations of their interests in external businesses and to withdraw from any discussions regarding potential contracting with that business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="70313w0017.htm_para2"><a name="07031379000113">In addition to any advice&#151;or indeed directions&#151;which the Department may give to academy trusts in relation to the procurement of goods and services, the law also precludes the payment of any charitable trustee&#151;including the governors of an academy, of which the sponsor is one&#151;unless legal authority for that payment is given in the charity's governing documents, or otherwise granted by a court or the Charity Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="70313w0017.htm_para3"><a name="07031379000114">The Charity Commission approves the governing documents of all companies proposed to be registered charities prior to granting registration, to ensure that any provisions conferring authority on the charity to make a payment to one of the trustees&#151;or a company associated with a trustee&#151;deal with conflicts of interest in a transparent manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_485"><a name="70313w0017.htm_para4"><a name="07031379000115">All academy trusts use the Department's model memorandum and articles of association as a basis for their own, and these include standard conflict of interest provisions recommended by the Charity Commission. These typically require any trustee of the company, who has an interest in a particular contract, to withdraw from discussions in relation to such a contract. In order to comply with these provisions, a sponsor of an academy trust would, for example, be required to withdraw from any meetings at which a discussion took place on the proposed remuneration of either themselves, or a company with which they are associated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="70313w0017.htm_para5"><a name="07031379000116">Furthermore, Charity Law places an obligation on charitable trustees to act in the best interests of their respective charities, and contracting with a company in the knowledge that this might not be at the best terms available to the charity, would obviously be contrary to this obligation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="70313w0018.htm_para0"><a name="07031379000201">Despite the claims that some have made that the variable fee system would put off those from less well off backgrounds, the latest UCAS figures for students applying for entry in autumn 2007 indicate that this has not happened. The figures indicate that although applicants from less affluent families are still in the minority, since 2005 there has been a bigger year-on-year percentage increase from applicants from the lower socio-economic groups than from applicants from more affluent backgrounds. As a result, the proportion of applicants who are from the lower socio-economic groups has risen from 30.9 per cent. in 2005 to 31.3 per cent. this year.</p>

1. The analysis is based on the reform proposals presented in the Pensions Bill rather than the White Paper. Some methodological improvements were made to the projections of basic state pension expenditure and revised data has been used between publication of the White Paper and the introduction of the Pensions Bill.<br>
2. Net costs include savings seen from reduced expenditure on other income related benefits (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit). They do not include any change in income tax revenue or national insurance. Annex A of the Pensions Bill RIA shows the cost of earnings uprating the BSP on a gross basis.<br>
3. Net costs assume the pension credit standard minimum guarantee is uprated by earnings from 2008.<br>
4. Figures do not include the effect of any other reform measures.<br>
5. Costs or savings presented in the table are based on long-term projections of United Kingdom benefit spend, consistent with the pre-Budget report 2006.<br>
6. Figures exclude the effect of personal accounts.<br>

 While advertising has been shown generally to influence individuals&#146; awareness and attitudes, there is no clear evidence that advertising contributes to criminal behaviour such as violence. However, in response to the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy (2004), both the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP) strengthened the non-broadcast and broadcast alcohol advertising code rules. The regulatory bodies; the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and Ofcom, are undertaking work, designed to assess the impact of these regulatory changes. CAP and BCAP are committed to robust evidence-based rules. If there were new evidence showing major harms, then the codes, or their interpretation, may be reviewed.</p>
