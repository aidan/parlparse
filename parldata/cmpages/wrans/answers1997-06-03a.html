<a name="70603w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Over the last 12 months, the Home Office has received proposals on wheel clamping from the Automobile Association the British Parking Association, and Legislation on Car Clamping. There have been four Parliamentary Questions, letters and suggestions for specific action to deal with the problem from 37 Members of Parliament, two letters from local authorities and 60 letters from members of the public. The Government consider the present situation on wheel clamping on private land to be unsatisfactory, and we will take a fresh look at the options for dealing with the problem.

 I intend to publish a White Paper in the autumn on our programme for the regeneration of government.

I have already announced my intention to publish a White Paper on Freedom of Information before the Summer Recess. I will bring forward proposals on the accountability, efficiency and transparency of Departments, Executive Agencies, and other public bodies. I will develop our commitment to more efficient and effective public services. My Department will consult widely with the general public on our plans to transform the existing programme of charters to deliver what people want from public services; to remove unnecessary bureaucracy from the daily lives of citizens and small business; and to use Information Technology in the delivery of enhanced and accessible services to the public.

 Universities are independent bodies and it is for them to determine levels of pay for their staff, including the vice-chancellor, in the light of their own particular needs and requirements. Other than requiring that universities take account of the Government priorities for public sector pay, the Department plays no part in considering or setting academic salary scales and does not collect information about the salaries of vice-chancellors.

<a name="70603w02.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Employers in the UK are estimated to have spent &#163;10.6 billion on formal training courses and supervised on-the-job training in 1993. This estimate is the latest available and was published in the report 'Employer Provided Training in the UK 1993'. An equivalent figure is not available from the 'Training in 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 1997 : Column: 124</I><P>
Britain' study because of differences in survey methods and the definitions of training used. The study estimated that total expenditure by employers in Great Britain in 1986-87 was &#163;14.4 billion.
<P>

<a name="70603w02.html_para4">Estimating employers' total expenditure on training is inherently difficult. While the latest survey provides a more accurate estimate of expenditure than that previously available, on its own the estimate does not convey much about training behaviour. More significantly, the survey shows a rising trend in the number of employees receiving training, both on and off-the-job. However we know that many companies--especially smaller ones--face difficulties in obtaining the training their businesses need. That is why we have pledged to help them, particularly by making the Investors in People Standard more accessible to small firms, and through the development of a University for Industry.

<P>
<a name="70603w04.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his Department's policy relating to the use of the anti-malarial drug lariam. [1485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70603w04.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Mefloquine (Lariam) is a highly effective drug in both preventing and treating malaria. It is particularly valuable where malaria is resistant to other medicines. The Department's policy relating to the use of mefloquine is outlined in the memorandum "Health Information for Overseas Travel" a free copy of which has been provided to all general practitioners. Further information was included in the Chief Medical Officer's Update 10 (May 1996) which was sent to all general practitioners. As with the use of all medicines, the benefits have to be weighed against the risk of adverse reactions.
<P>

<a name="70603w04.html_para3">We are aware of public concerns about the safety of mefloquine, particularly about the nature of the suspected serious adverse reactions reported. Guidelines for health professionals on the use of malaria prophylaxis, including mefloquine, are prepared by an informal group of experts convened by the Malaria Reference Laboratory of the Public Health Laboratory Service. The guidelines are published, most recently in the British Medical Journal in 1995. The group is presently producing a new set of guidelines which, once the consultation process is complete, will be published as soon as possible.

 The information requested is not held centrally. General practitioner fundholder managers are paid from the Practice Fund Management Allowance (PFMA) but their salary is not identified as a separate item within total PFMA allocations. The total PFMA expenditure for 1995-96 was &#163;109.6 million and allocations of PFMA for 1996-97 were &#163;153.3 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many parking fines were incurred by diplomatic missions in London during 1996. [2029]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70603w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 During 1996 the London diplomatic missions incurred a total of 1,676 unpaid parking fines, which is slightly more than the 1995 figure of 1,586. In February this year this department wrote to all diplomatic missions to give them an opportunity to pay off all outstanding parking tickets, or appeal to have the ticket cancelled. Since then payments totalling &#163;48,640.00 have been received, compared with &#163;11,600.00 in 1996. The table below shows only missions which have 11 or more fines outstanding.

The Order also abolishes the fee for the confirmation of the right of abode (now obsolete). The Order will come into effect on 10 June.

 The Government place great importance on ensuring equal opportunities for all groups, including disabled people.

No one argued for responsibility for the sector to remain at the Department of National Heritage and views expressed to the hon.

 The Armed Forces Pay Review Body has made recommendations on the pay of medical and dental officers in the Armed Forces. The Review Body recommends that the daily rate of basic pay should be increased by an average of 3.4 per cent. from 1 April. They have further proposed some significant changes to the pay structures of Service medical and dental officers which will see many forms of additional payments, such as consultant pay, consolidated into basic pay. The Review Body also mentioned that it welcomed the fact that the Ministry of Defence was, in future, proposing to base the pensions of Service medical and dental officers on representative rates of their own salaries rather than that of their combatant counterparts. These changes will

To ask the Secretary of State for National Heritage how many indemnity undertakings were given by departments under section 16 of the National Heritage Act 1980 for the six-month period ended 31 March; and what was the value of <i>(a)</i> any contingent liabilities in respect of such undertakings given at any time under that section which remain outstanding as at 31 March, <i>(b)</i> non-statutory Government indemnities in respect of loans handled by the Government Art Collection which remain outstanding as at 31 March and <i>(c)</i> non-statutory undertakings to Her Majesty in respect of loans from the Royal Collection which remain outstanding at 31 March.

<P>
<a name="70603w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan--for example through a scholarly publication.
<P>

<a name="70603w06.html_para1">In the six month period ended 31 March 1997, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The first part of your question asks about the average time taken to complete in assessment review. Under Child Support Agency legislation, there are a number of different reviews that can be requested by parties to an assessment. (which will include the absent parent, parent/person with care and child in Scotland). Any of the interested parties can ask for a review of their assessment by another child support officer if they disagree with the decision of the original child support officer. This is referred to as a second tier review. They may also request a change of circumstance review if a change has occurred that may affect their maintenance assessment. In addition, the Agency undertakes a periodic review of each case every two years.
<BR>
The Agency measures the number of individual reviews cleared within each of the time bands specified in Agency targets. The Agency does not measures average processing times for cases either within the time bands, or overall.
<BR>
The 1996-97 target for second tier reviews were;
<BR>
55% of second tier reviews to be cleared within 13 weeks;
<BR>
80% of second tier reviews to be cleared within 26 weeks;
<BR>
and no more than 15% to be older than 26 weeks as at 31 March 1997.
<BR>
The Agency met all elements of this target and performance was as follows;
<BR>
66% of second tier reviews cleared within 13 weeks;
<BR>
88% of second tier reviews to be cleared within 26 weeks;
<BR>
and 10% that were older than 26 weeks as at 31 March 1997.
<BR>
The 1996-97 target for change of circumstances were;
<BR>
Of those change of circumstances cleared
<BR>
-50% to be cleared within 13 weeks
<BR>
-60% to be cleared within 26 weeks
<BR>
Again the Agency met both elements of this target as follows;
<BR>
Of those change of circumstances cleared
<BR>
-63% were cleared within 13 weeks
<BR>
-78% were cleared within 26 weeks.
<BR>
Even though these targets were exceeded last year, this does not mean that we are complacent in these areas. We will be seeking to ensure that this years performance improves further.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about Child Support Agency maintenance assessments.
<BR>
The Agency does not collect information on average processing times, however, the Agency does have a Secretary of State target to clear 60% of new maintenance applications within 26 weeks, which has been in place for the years 1995/96 and 1996/97.
<BR>
In 1995/96, the Agency cleared 48% of new applications within 26 weeks; in 1996/97 the performance achieved was 54%. However in the last 2 months of 1996/97 the 60% target was exceeded overall A breakdown of the performance by Child Support Agency Centre is available for 1996/97 and is shown in the attached table.
<BR>
The intake of child maintenance applications is forecast to increase by 5% this year. Nevertheless, we will maintain this target.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about Child Support Agency maintenance assessments.
<BR>
You have asked about the number of maintenance assessments that are challenged by the absent parent. The Agency records information on the number of applications for a second tier review (STR) received from any party to the assessment. Along with absent parents this includes parents with care, persons (other than parents) with care, and a child in Scotland. The STR is the means by which any of the interested parties can ask for a review of their assessment by another child support officer (CSO) if they disagree with the decision of the original CSO.
<BR>
The attached tables therefore give the number of STR requests received by the Agency since inception, set against the total number of maintenance assessments made in each year.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about Child Support Agency interim maintenance assessments (IMAs).
<BR>
The Agency is unable to answer your question in the format requested, however set out below is an explanation of interim assessments together with the number we have imposed to date, I hope you find this helpful.
<BR>
An IMA is usually imposed where the absent parent, parent with care or their respective partners do not provide all the information required under Child Support legislation to make a full maintenance assessment (FMA).
<BR>
One of four different categories of IMA can be imposed depending on the nature of the missing information, ie category A, B, C or D IMA. Category A and D are intended to encourage compliance and will normally always be punitive and higher than the liability under a FMA. A category B may, or may not be punitive depending on the circumstances of the case, it generally will not take account of any new family. A category C IMA is non punitive and is imposed in self employed cases to allow the AP extra time to provide the necessary financial evidence.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 Jun 1997 : Column: 146</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Since April 1993 the Agency has imposed over 166,000 IMAs. I do not have break down by category, but the majority of IMAs will be category A where the liability is normally higher than the FMA.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to reply to your recent question asking how many young people under the age of 25 years have been unemployed for over six months in (a) Great Britain, (b) England, (c) Manchester, (d) Trafford and (e) Wythenshawe and Sale East.

The ONS produces two measures of unemployment. The first, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey, is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed, people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the past four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the UK administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as 



<P>

<BR>
Both measures are described and compared in the ONS booklet <i>How exactly is Unemployment Measured</i>. Please find a copy enclosed with this reply.
<BR>
Information on length of time ILO unemployed is generally available from the Labour Force Survey, a quarterly basis down to county, or former county, level. The most recent information available is for autumn 1996. Some information for local authorities is available from the annual LFS Local Area Database (LAD). However, in order to protect confidentiality the database only includes key data items and length of time unemployed is not among them. If it were available the figure for Trafford would be less than the threshold for reliable estimates. No figures less than this threshold can be released. Further information on the Local Area Database is available in the May 1996 edition of <i>Labour Market Trends</i> (pages 239-246) which is available in the House of Commons library. No information about parliamentary constituencies is available from the LFS. The latest available figures are shown in the table below:

<BR>
Both measures are described and compared in the ONS booklet <i>How Exactly is Unemployment Measured?,</i> a copy of which is enclosed with this reply. This booklet is also available in the House of Commons Library.
<BR>
A total of 421,656 18 to 24 year olds were registered unemployed (claimant unemployed) in the UK in April 1997. This compares with an estimate of 551,000 18-24 year olds ILO unemployed according to the autumn 1996 Labour Force Survey. The group you refer to in your first question "currently seeking and available for work" is broadly the same as the ILO definition of unemployment except that this also includes those who are waiting to start a job they have already obtained.
<BR>
No information is available from the claimant count about those registered unemployed who have never been employed. According to the autumn 1996 Labour Force Survey there were an estimated 179,000 18-24 year olds who were ILO unemployed and had never had a paid job. 38,000 of these were in full-time education and therefore not eligible to claim unemployment related benefits.
<BR>
An estimated total of 127,000 18-24 year olds not in employment had been seeking work within the past four weeks and undertaking full or part-time study according to the autumn 1996 UK LFS. Of these 95,000 were ILO unemployed (ie seeking and available to start work within the next two weeks or waiting to start a job already obtained). The rest are categorised as economically inactive because they were not available to start work within two weeks. 79,000 out of the above total of 127,000 said that they were looking for part-time work. It may be assumed that many of these would be planning to combine their studies with part-time work, although they cannot be separately identified.

<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as Director of the Office for National Statistics, to your recent Parliamentary question concerning questions about levels of income, poverty and wealth in the 2001 Census.
<BR>
The Census Offices have been consulting users about the need for questions in the 2001 Census, and a number of new questions are being trialled in the 1997 Census Test which will be held in June. The Test questionnaire includes questions which would provide statistics related to poverty and wealth. In particular, the Test will include a question about banded individual gross income.
<BR>
The Government will publish their proposals for questions to be included in the Census in a White Paper in mid-1998. These proposals will be based on users' substantial requirements for information, and on evidence gathered in the 1997 Census Test on the public's reaction to the possible questions. The White Paper will invite comment.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what policy objectives underlie the Government's purpose in raising nominal and real exchange rates; and if he will estimate by how much the public sector borrowing requirement increased as a result of the increase in nominal and real exchange rates since 1995. [1528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70603w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government do not have a policy of raising nominal or real exchange rates. The Government want a stable and competitive pound over the medium term, consistent with their objective of price stability. It is impossible to estimate the effects on the PSBR of the exchange rate appreciation since 1995, which will depend on the extent to which a higher exchange rate has affected the level and composition of gross domestic product.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the effect of rises in exchange rates on output and employment in <i>(a)</i> manufacturing industry and <i>(b)</i> the rest of the economy since 1994. [1558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70603w09.html_spnew13"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 There are many factors, in addition to changes in the exchange rate, which can affect output and employment in manufacturing industry and the rest of the economy; and it is difficult to isolate their separate effects.

 OPCS (now the Office for National Statistics) does not produce household estimates and projections which are the responsibility of my Department. These estimates and projections are, however, based, inter alia, on Office for National Statistics population estimates and projections. The latest household projections for mid-1996 for the five metropolitan districts of Tyne and Wear were published in March 1995 in "Projections of Households in England to 2016", a copy of which is in the Library of the House. These were compiled from the OPCS 1992-based sub-national population projections. Household projections were not produced for 1997. Planning has started for the next set of household projections, which 



<P>

will be based on 1996 sub-national population projections that the Office for National Statistics expects to complete in late 1998. The associated 1996-based household projections should be available a few months afterwards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70603w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The most recent household projections have been subject to considerable public scrutiny since their publication in March 1995, in particular by the Environment Select Committee in evidence for its report on Housing Need in 1996. Whilst generally endorsing the projections, the Committee recommended that the Department continues to examine the extent to which household formation is affected by economic and social factors. This is currently being addressed by the Department of Applied Economics, Cambridge University, as part of a wider research project for the Department on the modelling of the need for social housing. The project has been extended beyond its original completion date and should now be finalised by the Autumn.
<P>

<a name="70603w12.html_para1">Last year, the Department also commissioned Heriot-Watt University to undertake a detailed literature review on household formation, with particular emphasis on evaluating the available evidence on the extent to which economic factors affect the propensity for new households to form. This work has recently been completed, and I expect to see the results shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70603w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has undertaken no research as such on the impact of the International Passenger Survey statistics on the household projections. Projections of the future pattern of migration between England and the rest of the world are the responsibility of the Government Actuary's Department (GAD). In collaboration with other departments, GAD undertook a thorough review in 1992 of the methods used to set international migration assumptions. This led to a new methodology which was used for the first time in the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jun 1997 : Column: 164</I><P>
preparation of the 1991-based national population projections. As with previous projections, the assumed level of migration over the projection period takes into account information from a run of previous years in order to even out the fluctuations from year to year. The robustness of sources of information on migration, including the International Passenger Survey, is kept under regular review by the Office for National Statistics.
<P>

<a name="70603w12.html_para3">We are currently investigating the effects of large student populations on the household projections. However, any proposals for revisions to the methodology for handling students in the underlying sub-national population projections will need to be discussed with the Office for National Statistics before they can be implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the impact of reducing the sulphur content of petrol and diesel on vehicle emissions of pollutants. [1879]<P>

 The Department has not commissioned any research specifically aimed at determining the impact of the sulphur content of fuel on vehicle emissions since a number of studies have been carried out by a range of organisations that already enable assessments to be made. A comprehensive study was carried out by the European automotive and oil industries as an element of the Auto-Oil study undertaken by the European Commission. This has lead to proposals for

tighter fuel quality and vehicle emissions standards to come into effect from the year 2000. The studies show that sulphur can have an adverse effect on vehicle pollutants arising primarily through its detrimental effect on catalyst efficiency. For petrol vehicles fitted with catalytic convertors reductions in CO, HC and NOx can be achieved when using reduced sulphur fuels. For diesel vehicles, reduced sulphur fuel can lead to a reduction in particulate emissions, but the effect is enhanced in vehicles fitted with catalysts by reducing sulphate formation within the catalyst.
