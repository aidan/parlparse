 Basra and its environs are likely to contain a significant number of unexploded munitions from the Iran-Iraq war as well as mines laid by Iraqi forces, unexploded ordnance fired or dropped during recent hostilities and stores of ammunition and other ordnance left by Iraqi military and paramilitary forces.Providing a safe, secure and risk free environment for the Iraqi people is a key aspect of restoration activity for the Coalition. When unexploded munitions are discovered Coalition forces' mark the site and inform those in the vicinity. Their normal practice is then to destroy them in situ.

Umm Qasr is one of the key points of entry for humanitarian aid into Iraq, and RFA Sir Galahad, carrying food, water and medical supplies, arrived in the port on 28 March.

 The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) has been selected to meet our Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) requirement, to replace the current Harrier aircraft of Joint Force Harrier (JHF). FJCA will be flown by both Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel, from the new carriers and land bases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30516w04.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The interoperability of air launched weapons with our allies is one of a number of factors considered when procuring new systems.
<P>

<a name="30516w04.html_para2">The United Kingdom has a number of air launched weapons which could be inter-operable with United States aircraft and vice versa, such as Maverick, for example. However it is not usual practice to share stocks as notionally common weapons often have different national sub-systems, such as fuzes. Changes to these would therefore be required before the weapons could be used by other nations' aircraft.
<P>

<a name="30516w04.html_para3">During the acquisition of air launched weapons due consideration is given to their potential to operate effectively from JSF if they are likely to be in use when JSF is in service.

<P>
<a name="30516w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Aircraft do not generally fly at 150,000 ft and would not drop bombs from this altitude. I have therefore assumed an altitude of 15,000 ft. when answering this question. When dropped from this altitude, the average accuracy for non-precision weapons is as follows:

<P>

</FONT></UL>
<a name="30516w05.html_para0">This will of course depend on the weapon delivery profile and operational circumstances. The accuracy of both precision and non-precision weapons and the need to minimise, as far as possible, collateral damage is considered during the targeting process. We continue to make efforts to improve the accuracy of both precision and non-precision weapons by enhancements to aircraft navigation systems and through our ability to calculate more precise target co-ordinates.

<P>
<a name="30516w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In answer to a question tabled by the hon. Member himself, on 2 December I announced to parliament, the Government's intention to make available 450 million from 2003 to 2006, to help the rural post office network through the transition of benefit payment to ACT. The package will be funded from Royal Mail Holdings accumulated surpluses, as part of a package to put Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. on a commercial footing. There is therefore no requirement for parliamentary approval.
<P>

<a name="30516w08.html_para5">The funding is subject to State Aid approval and we submitted our notification to the Commission in December for clearance. The timetable for state aid clearance is a matter for the European Commission. DTI is working to ensure that the questions and issues raised by the Commission are responded to as quickly as possible. We are confident we have a strong case and we hope to have approval in due course.

 Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) provide a country-owned framework to strengthen the impact of public action on poverty, and to promote progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Water supply and sanitation are consistently identified as a priority for the poor in participatory poverty assessments, and all PRSPs generally recognise

the contribution of access to a safe water supply in reducing both income and non-income related dimensions of poverty.
<P>

<a name="30516w11.html_para5">A review of Full and Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers in Sub-Saharan Africa has found however that treatment of water supply and sanitation is not comprehensive and often inconsistent. In particular, sanitation and solid waste management received limited and inadequate attention. Also, despite the significant continuing work on sector reforms (in decentralisation, and rural and urban water supply and sanitation), their incorporation in the country PRSP initiatives requires considerable strengthening. The Uganda PRSP was a notable exception having good coverage of water and sanitation issues, and serves as an illustration of good practice.

In addition, through the Overseas Development Institute and WaterAid, we are supporting an in depth research and advocacy project which aims to address these issues in more detail.

 There is nothing to prevent former council tenants from selling the homes that they purchased under the Right to Buy scheme to whomever they wish. They must repay all or part of the discount they received if they resell within three years of buying. The Government's draft Housing Bill, published on 31 March 2003, proposes to extend this period to five years and to change the basis on which discount is to be repaid from the current flat rate to a percentage of the resale value of the property. This will act as a further disincentive to companies that are profiteering from the Right to Buy scheme.

<a name="30516w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The framework for allocation of capital resources to English local authorities no longer includes specific adjustments to reflect differences in authorities' capacity to fund capital expenditure from receipts arising from sales of housing and other assets. New arrangements are being introduced for allocation of resources for housing investment by local authorities and housing associations. These will increasingly be directed at regionally identified strategic housing priorities; decisions on allocations will reflect how the available resources can be best used to complement housing investment funded from authorities' own resources, including housing capital receipts, and from other funding streams.

 Planning Policy Guidance note 10, 'Planning and Waste Management', explains how the land-use planning system can contribute to sustainable waste management. The planning system should enable adequate provision to be made for waste management facilities in appropriate locations and waste planning authorities should carefully consider the siting of waste facilities in relation to existing and, where possible, potential surrounding land-uses.

For such "county matter" applications decided in the October 2002-December 2002 quarter, the refusal rate in relation to waste disposal applications was 7 per cent., compared to 8 per cent. for all "county matter" decisions. The overall refusal rate for all planning applications has been around 12 per cent. to 13 per cent. for several years.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 351W, on Command Paper 5778, which parts of the Children Act 1989 are failing to be implemented effectively in his Department as set out in paragraph 2.22 of Command Paper 5778.

<P>

<a name="30516w17.html_para0">Paragraph 2.22 of Command Paper 5778 does not state that the Children Act 1989 is not being implemented effectively, and neither is it meant to imply that this is the case.
<P>

<a name="30516w17.html_para1">As the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Hilary Benn) noted in the answer that he gave on 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 351&#150;52W, the Children Act is a shared responsibility across Government and our aim, as set out in the Command Paper, is to increase the range of family support provisions that can be made available through the Children Act, as part of our response to tackling anti-social behaviour.

<i>[holding answer 15 May 2003]:</i> It would not be appropriate to provide an asylum seeker with advice on any other applications they may wish to make at this stage. The Immigration Rules attach an entry clearance requirement to a number of categories of leave. Similarly, there will often be a requirement, where the period of leave is not in a category leading to settlement, that the applicant is willing to leave the United Kingdom at the expiry of the period of leave, which a person who has applied for asylum is unlikely to do.

<a name="30516w17.html_para2">Asylum seekers are not able to apply for work in the United Kingdom. Employers must seek work permits for individuals, and asylum seekers are not permitted to take up employment.

 The Prison Service does not hold information on the numbers of children and young people in each of its establishments who are subject to section 31 of the Children Act 1989 or who are accommodated by a local authority under section 20 of the Act before being received into custody. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the Department of Health collects aggregate figures annually for those subject to section 31 care orders and as of 31 March 2002 (the latest date for which figures are currently available) the Prison Service was accommodating 130 such children and young people.

 The information requested is not held centrally, but I understand that a decision to hold an inquest can normally be taken within a few days of the report of the death. In 2001, in 88 per cent. of cases where coroners decided to hold an inquest, they issued certificates for the burial or cremation of the deceased within a week. In a further 9 per cent. of cases, certificates were issued within a month. In the remaining 2.5 per cent. of cases, authorisation to bury or cremate took longer. Such certificates would not be issued until after a decision to hold an inquest had been taken.

These companies supply products on a national basis and in competition with each other. Both companies were awarded contracts as a result of a competitive tendering action undertaken in strict adherence to European Union procurement regulations. The award was made on the basis of best value for money to the Prison Service, which took account of a range of evaluation criteria including price, quality, availability and the ability of the bidders to provide the requirements of the Service.

 The Home Office is currently considering ways in which further support can be provided to victims of sexual crime. Possibilities under consideration include the use of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs); rape crisis and other counselling and support services; national or local telephone helplines; and some combination of these. The Home Office will consider with the Department of Health and other government departments how best to take these complex issues forward.
<P>

<a name="30516w19.html_para3">We believe there are currently at least six SARCs in England and Wales. Funding for these has been negotiated and agreed locally. For example, the pioneer SARC, St. Mary's Centre in Manchester, is funded jointly by the Greater Manchester Police and the Central Manchester and Children's University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust. The two REACH Centres in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland are jointly funded by Northumbria Police, the four local health authorities, and six local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30516w19.html_para4">At present, no agreed process and criteria exist for the funding or setting up of SARCs and no Home Office guidance has been published on these matters. Most SARCs are currently jointly funded by the police and local health authorities, and neither the Home Office (except as outlined below) nor the Department of Health has allocated specific funding for SARCs.

<P><I>16 May 2003 : Column 505W</I><P>
Programme (CRP) Violence against Women Initiative (VAWI) is an evidence-led programme which aims to find out which approaches and practices are effective in supporting victims and reducing incidents of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. As part of this programme, some funding was allocated to three existing SARCs (St. Mary's in Manchester, REACH in Newcastle and STAR in West Yorkshire) to enable them to implement additional interventions to help support victims of rape and to improve their services. The funding was provided in July 2002 up to the end of March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30516w19.html_para6">The Home Office commissioned Professor Liz Kelly from London Metropolitan University to evaluate the contribution of these three established SARCs towards supporting victims of rape and sexual assault and reducing attrition in the criminal justice system. An overview of the research is due to be published in the autumn of 2003. The Home Office will take Professor Kelly's findings into consideration when looking at ways in which further support can be provided to victims of sexual crime.
<P>

<a name="30516w19.html_para7">At a recent seminar we discussed with the Department of Health a range of issues around service for sexual assault victims, including SARCs. We plan to discuss further.
