<sup>(1)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>





The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in: Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

<a name="stpa_17">The Department has supported photovoltaics since 2000 through the PV Field Trials Programme and also through the &#163;31 million Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme. These programmes have contributed to the development of the microgeneration industry in the UK, including an installer base. We plan to continue support for photovoltaics and other building scale renewables through a low carbon buildings programme, which is currently under development. This was recommended in the Renewables Innovation Review (February 2004), which looked at the viability of photovoltaics and other renewable technologies. It suggested that the environmental benefits in buildings could be maximised by developing an appropriate mix of building integrated renewables and energy efficiency. The new programme will have a budget of &#163;30 million over three years and will start in April 2006 subject to EU state aids clearance.

 The definition of an animal for the purposes of the Animal Welfare Bill is limited to non-human vertebrates. This restriction to vertebrates is made on the basis that there is currently insufficient evidence to show conclusively that other types of animals, such as &quot;lobsters/crabs/squids&quot;, have the capacity for conscious awareness; a prerequisite for experiencing pain and suffering. However, there are powers within the Bill to extend the definition if future scientific evidence demonstrated that such animals can in fact experience pain and suffering.

 Licences for quarantine premises do not specify the maximum capacity of the centre or facility.

 The H5N1 isolates from the pooled parrot/mesia sample and from the mesia only samples may be classified as clade 2 by some authorities. While the Department uses advance molecular techniques to determine the linage and, by inference, the origin of avian influenza viruses, the classification by clade is unhelpful when considering the potential these viruses may have for human infection. On a precautionary principle any isolate of highly pathogenic Avian influenza should be considered as having a potential to infect man and appropriate precautions should be taken in every case.

<sup>(11)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.<br>

<a name="stpa_50">The Government have taken a very open approach to its consideration of what a new public body might deliver, engaging stakeholders at the very earliest stage in policy development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_51">A public consultation exercise in early 2006 will be an opportunity for the Government to offer more information on what role such a new public body might play, and for stakeholders to contribute to the policy development process on this and other elements of the Marine Bill.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51205w08.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is a legal requirement for all commercial premises with 50 or more poultry to register. This applies whether the 50 poultry are of a single species or a combination of species, which include pheasants and partridge. For game bird premises, which are included under this requirement, the information supplied should only relate to captive birds and those still under the control of the keeper, and not to birds that may remain on the premises (for example, in a woodland area on the premises) after release. If production is seasonal, as with partridges and pheasants, only the usual number of birds when production/stock is at peak capacity should be recorded.

In the six months before entering or returning to the UK they must not have travelled to countries other than those listed under EU Regulation 998/2003 on the movement of pet animals.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action she <i>(a)</i> is taking, and <i>(b)</i> plans to take to allow schools to run after-school clubs on their premises; and if she will make a statement.  [34218]</p>




<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51205w10.html_spnew0"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Many schools already provide a good range of after school clubs on their premises. The Education Act 2002 gave school governing bodies the power to provide community facilities on school premises which will enable those clubs to develop into formal child care offers where there is parental demand for those services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w10.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_63">The Government want all schools to provide access to extended services, including child care, a varied menu of study support, and before and after school clubs, by 2010, with half of all primaries and a third of all secondaries doing so by 2008.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_64">To support schools in setting up and embedding extended services, we have committed &#163;840 million up to 2008. These funds can be used flexibly to help address any practical issues that schools may be facing to develop extended services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">We have also asked the National Remodelling Team (NRT) within the Teacher Development Agency, working with voluntary sector partners such as Continyou and 4Children to support LAs and schools nationally as they implement extended services.

[34147]</p>

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51205w10.html_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 We have no plans to publish such guidelines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_66">It is for local authorities to decide how to deploy the funds available to them to meet the needs of children with special educational needs (SEN), including those children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Budgeted expenditure by local authorities on meeting children&#039;s SEN in 2005&#150;06 is &#163;4.1 billion, some 13 per cent. of all education spending. In 2004 the Department published guidance &quot;The management of SEN expenditure&quot; providing information and suggested approaches to managing this expenditure. In 2002 the Department, with the Department of Health, published Good Practice Guidance on ASDs which gave pointers to good practice, including pointers on funding and home-based provision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w10.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_67">Local authorities have a duty to keep their arrangements for special educational provision under review and it is for them to take decisions about SEN provision in their schools, in consultation with the schools including special schools, and fund that provision appropriately. Funding for individual pupils with autism in special schools is through their SEN statements, which set out their needs and the provision required to meet those needs.

 This Government wants all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010, with half of all primary and a third of all secondary schools doing so by 2008. We want to see at least 2,500 schools providing access to the core offer by September 2006. The core offer, which should be available to all parents and pupils of the school, comprises: high quality childcare; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support programmes; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialised support services; and wider community access. It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to the core offer through schools. This will include determining how many primary and secondary schools develop access to the core offer in each year. On 29 September 2005 my Department published its report on the baseline survey of extended services in schools which it commissioned earlier in the year. The survey showed that nationally the vast majority of schools were providing access to some form of extended activity. The survey did not provide figures at local authority level.

This is very timely given the need for schools to respond effectively to Government priorities in England such as greater personalisation, extended schools, Every Child Matters and the 14 to 19 agenda, and to initiatives in these and other areas in Wales. Schools will need to become more outward facing, more flexible and, as we have set out in the Schools White Paper for England, work far more collaboratively with others, including parents, if we are to make the next step change in raising attainment and opening opportunities. I want to make sure that we can support our leadership teams effectively and have the right people in place to take forward these changes. For this reason I will wish to explore with partners the extent to which the terms of reference for such a review should not only encompass but also go further than those outlined by the STRB. I will also wish to consider the arrangements for handling the review, including whether the proposed timetable is appropriate, or whether it should be run in parallel with a general review of teachers&#039; duties.

The first Excellent Teachers will be appointed from September 2006 and schools are already considering whether to include Excellent Teacher posts in their staffing structures and how many Excellent Teacher posts they need. It is important that schools have a clear understanding about the potential salary implications of Excellent Teacher posts so they can plan effectively; that the arrangements for determining Excellent Teacher salaries are unambiguous and can be implemented effectively; and that the approach to Excellent Teacher salaries is consistent with our approach to teachers&#039; pay more generally.

<a name="stpa_116">In the light of these considerations, I propose to defer introduction of the salary ranges proposed by the STRB until September 2008. I propose that in the interim there should be a single salary rate for each pay region for those holding excellent teacher posts. The level of these salaries should be those proposed by the STRB in its Fourteenth Report, increased in line with the general increases to teachers&#039; pay scales. I believe that this approach will give schools the early clarity they will need to help with the introduction of ETS posts. It will also allow us the opportunity to develop the guidance they will need to help introduce the greater flexibility which the STRB proposes&#151;and which in principle I welcome&#151;in the light of our ongoing review of the operation of the scheme and of further work to be done on standards and duties for the profession as a whole.

CPD should not be a &quot;bolt-on&quot;, short-term experience or narrowly defined as &quot;going on courses&quot; but a continuous planned series of activities designed to improved a teacher&#039;s knowledge and skills. Some of the most effective professional development is teachers learning from other teachers in the classroom and I want all teachers to be able to benefit from and contribute to coaching and mentoring as they progress in their careers as part of their professional development. I believe the approach recommended by the STRB will help to incentivise, recognise and reward teachers&#039; participation in effective CPD and help to ensure that the professional development activities are planned and evaluated in schools.

The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) only withdraw the family&#039;s support when this can be done without breaching any person&#039;s human rights. However, after support has been withdrawn, a family&#039;s circumstances can change in such a way that support needs to be reinstated to avoid a breach. This has happened in three cases.

 The Government keep their immigration and asylum policies under review. Our current assessment is that it would not be right to routinely allow asylum seekers access to paid employment. The immigration rules make clear that asylum seekers may seek permission to work if their claim for asylum remains outstanding for longer than 12 months without an initial decision being made on it and providing the reason for the delay cannot be attributed to the applicant.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he has put in place to ensure that his Department meets the quick win targets set by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that all <i>(a)</i> copying paper bought by the Department is 100 per cent. recycled with a minimum of 75 per cent. post-consumer waste content and <i>(b)</i> paper for printed publications bought by the Department is 60 per cent. recycled of which a minimum is 75 per cent. post-consumer waste.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Dec 2005 : Column 983W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51205w20.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The quick wins targets were introduced on 1 November 2003 by the inter-departmental Sustainable Procurement Group. From this date all government departments&#039; contracts were expected to apply the minimum environmental standards when purchasing certain types of product and services including paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w20.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_183">It has been recommended that the purchase of recycled paper products is phased in over a period of time and targets will be developed as part of the &quot;Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate&quot;. The Home Office will work with its current suppliers in order to meet these targets. The department&#039;s current three-year stationery contract to supply paper and paper products as well as other stationery products was awarded prior to 1 November, in September 2003. This followed a competitive tender exercise in line with Home Office policy that the procurement of goods and services is based on value for money principles. The provision of recycled paper is part of the agreed contract with Office depot.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_184">In June 2002 the Home Office mandated all offices within the Department to use A4 recycled paper which has an 80 per cent. unspecified recycled paper content in photocopiers, fax machines and printers, unless technical reasons precluded them from using this paper. The Prison Service mandated the use of the same A4 recycled paper from September 2003 and following successful trials are also procuring only A3 recycled paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51205w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_185">The Home Office makes use of various stocks of paper/board in our publications. Most of our internal facing material is printed on recycled paper and all of these are at least 60 per cent. recycled with a content of 75 per cent. post-consumer waste. The majority of our external facing work is printed on totally chlorine free paper/board. Although this is not made from recycled pulp, this is &#039;environmentally friendly&#039; because the pulp is bleached without the use of chlorine chemicals.

<p><a name="st_179"><a name="51205w20.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The Home Department does not hold this information centrally and it could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Advice on the opportunities for integrating environmental and sustainability issues in assessment during procurement is published in OGC/DEFRA guidance &quot;Environmental Issues in Purchasing&quot; (www.ogc.gov.uk/index.asp?id=400&#039;). Additional Home Office internal advice has been issued for use by procurement and project teams via procurement bulletins. Where appropriate assessments against both environmental impact and sustainable development criteria for bids made for contracts are carried out on a case by case basis. Environmental impact assessments and criteria for sustainable development are set and evaluated by the project team. These assessments are not published.

Currently, the identity cards programme is looking at various alternatives that allow the implementation of secure remote authentication including use of one-time password technology. These technologies offer a mechanism to obtain greater assurance of the identity of credit card or account holders when conducting transactions over the internet, telephone or post in the future.

<p>
<a name="51205w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_199">Work is continuing with representative groups from both private and public sectors to assess how these technologies might be used to supplement existing procedures in practice. However, no final decisions regarding these options have been taken. As a result, no quantifiable benefits connected with reducing card-not-present fraud for online, telephone or mail-order shopping or banking have, as yet, been claimed within the scheme&#039;s benefits case to date.

RIA requirements have developed over the years since its introduction in 1998 but now also cover a wider range of issues including competition and impact on small firms. This information is recorded in the individual RIAs and generally includes comments on the consultation process, both formal and informal. We also routinely consult publicly on our proposals, with an accompanying Partial RIA, and publish a summary of the views received and our response. The 65 individual RIAs are listed in a regular Command Paper House prepared by Cabinet Office and laid before the House.

 Since the Small Business Service was established in 2000, business start-ups have risen to record levels. The number of small businesses has risen by over 500,000, since 1997, to 4.3 million. In England the Business Link service is now supporting 170,000 pre-start ups each year. The Small Business Service&#039;s Public Sector Agreement target is to help to build an enterprise society in which small firms of all kinds thrive and achieve their potential with (i) an increase in the number of people considering going into business, (ii) an improvement in the overall productivity of small firms, and (iii) more enterprise in disadvantaged communities. Recent progress in achieving this target is available on the DTI website: www.dti.gov.uk/expenditureplan/report2005/pdfs/expenditure&#95;plan&#95;complete.pdf

Detailed progress is measured against five indicators and the PSA Technical Note sets out the various sources of data which underpin these indicators. It can be seen that the information required is drawn from authoritative international data series. Despite every effort to secure accurate data for all PSA focus countries, DFID recognises that there are limitations to the data available for reviewing progress. A detailed note on methodology and data issues is found as an annex to DFID&#039;s 2004 Autumn Performance Report (APR) and a similar annex is included within our 2005 APR, which will be published shortly.

 In both the 2003&#150;06 and 2005&#150;08 public sector agreements (PSAs), DFID has targets seeking progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) in countries in Africa and Asia. For the 2003&#150;06 PSA baseline positions were set out, however over time, the baselines were revised due to new data becoming available and ongoing work within the international statistical organisations who provide the data we use. In response to this, for the 2005&#150;08 PSA DFID has not published baseline figures, but rather has set percentage point changes, or directions of travel sought and will make an assessment of progress during the PSA focus period, based on the difference between the prevalence figure for the baseline year (in many cases 2000) given when the assessment is made, and the latest data available. This is explained in the Technical Note which accompanies our PSA.

<a name="qnpa_44">The Joint United Nations Programme of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), is the United Nations body which provides statistical data to measure progress in the area of HIV/AIDS and difficulties with these data are set out in DFID&#039;s PSA Technical Note. At the time the Technical Note was written, new data on HIV/AIDS were anticipated. These figures were supplied in 2004 and used in DFID&#039;s 2004 Autumn Performance Report. This stated that the average HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women aged 15&#150;24 years, in the 11 African countries for which data were available, was 14 per cent., although prevalence rates range from 4 per cent. in Ghana to more than 28 per cent. in Lesotho. Most data in this assessment dated from 2003 and it is likely that this will represent the best baseline position for monitoring against the 2005&#150;08 PSA. However DFID will continue to monitor methodological work in this area and seek the inclusion of data for the five PSA countries that were not included in the assessment made in 2004.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_293">Since 2003 Jobcentre Plus has been introducing a new process for taking claims for benefit, supported by CMS. Information to support claims for benefit is gathered from customers through Contact Centres and recorded in CMS, before being transferred, electronically for Income Support and Jobseekers Allowance, to benefit processing IT systems.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_294">When the system was first introduced, we experienced some difficulties with system performance and reliability. Following a series of &quot;performance releases&quot; designed to tackle these problems, the computer system now performs to agreed service levels. Since February 2005, there has only been one occasion where a CMS failure has affected all offices and made it necessary to invoke business continuity procedures.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_295">We have, however, experienced some difficulties in call handling in some of our Contact Centres. Some of our customers have found it difficult to get through on the telephone, and we have had to introduce clerical contingency procedures in a number of sites in order to maintain customer service. This has not been caused by any failure on the part of the computer system itself, but relates to the administrative processes that have been introduced alongside the new computer system.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_296">Since introducing a number of temporary adjustments to these processes and taking urgent measures to recruit and train staff, there have been encouraging signs of recovery in our call handling.

Notes:<br>

1. The total weekly benefit income includes pension credit but not income from private pensions.<br>

2. Data is taken from the Family Resources Survey for years: 2001&#150;02; 2002&#150;03; and 2003&#150;04. The Family Resources Survey is based on around 20,000 households, therefore there is a degree of sampling variation.<br>

3. Figures are provided using a three-year rolled average as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year-on-year changes.<br>

4. The standard minimum guarantee in pension credit is equal to &#163;109.45 per week for single pensioners and &#163;167.05 for couples deflated to the appropriate price level for each year of data.<br>

5. Pensioner couples are where the head of the household is above state pension age.<br>

6. Number of pensioner units are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>
