<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The New Deal 50 plus, announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget speech, 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report, </i>columns 173-90, will offer real and substantial support to people over 50 who wish to find jobs.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para0">The New Deal will be voluntary and will offer people 50 and over who have spent six months on either JSA, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance help with jobsearch through individual advice from an employment adviser and programme centre provision. When an eligible 50 plus client finds a job they can claim an employment credit of &#163;60 per week for full-time work or &#163;40 per week for part-time work for 52 weeks and training support of up to &#163;750. The Employment Credit, when taken with the minimum wage, will represent a minimum income guarantee of &#163;9,000 for people taking full-time jobs. I believe this represents a huge step in providing real help to older workers who face greater difficulties in finding sustainable employment.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para1">We have confirmed the following New Deal units of delivery as pathfinder areas for the launch of New Deal 50 plus in October:

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will provide a breakdown of the percentage of participants in each of the New Deal for Young People options who have left for unsubsidised employment up to the most recent date for which information is available; and what assessment 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 1999 : Column: 468</I><P>
he has made of the performance against Government targets on improving employability through undertaking New Deal options.  [87179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The latest Government Statistical Service figures to the end of April 1999 show that 23,900 young people have left one of the New Deal options. Of these 8,860 (37 per cent.) are known to have found sustained unsubsidised employment. This breaks down to 56 per cent. of young people leaving the Employer option, 35 per cent. from the FTET option, 41 per cent. from the Voluntary Sector option and 35 per cent. from the Environment Task Force.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para4">These figures under-estimate the true proportion of young people finding work because many of the clients recorded as having "unknown destinations" will, in fact, have found work although they have not notified the Employment Service.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para5">A recent large scale quantitative survey of young people who left the New Deal for unknown destinations showed that at least 43 per cent. have moved into work.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para6">A quantitative survey of individual participants was launched earlier this year which will assess improvements in employability. Initial results from this survey are expected in September 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will estimate how many participants in <i>(a)</i> the New Deal for Young People and <i>(b)</i> the New Deal for over 25s have left the New Deal to be transferred from unemployment benefits to incapacity benefit in the categories of those leaving for (i) other known destinations, (ii) unknown destinations and (iii) transfers to other benefits.  [87177]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 People who leave New Deal to transfer to Incapacity Benefit are recorded as "transfers to other benefits" in the published statistics as it is not currently possible to break the statistics down to specific types of benefit. The latest Government Statistical Service figures to the end of April 1999 show that 19,170 young people had left New Deal to transfer to other benefits and 7,100 clients left the New Deal for long term unemployed people aged 25 and over for other benefits.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para7">A quantitative survey of individual participants was launched earlier this year which will assess movements into other benefits. Initial results from this survey are expected in September 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will estimate the proportion of those individuals leaving the New Deal for Young People for unknown destinations who have left to work in the black economy.  [87178]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 It is difficult to make any reliable estimate of the number of young people who have left New Deal for unknown destinations who have left to work in the "black economy". People who were working and claiming benefit until caught out by the New Deal are unlikely to declare that when they cease claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. Anyone who attempts to reclaim Jobseeker's Allowance within 13 weeks of leaving New Deal will automatically re-enter the New Deal at the point which they left. That reduces significantly the risk of young people working and claiming benefits.

<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the implications for employment opportunities for the disabled of the withdrawal of the Green Card DP21, version 1/93.  [87493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The arrangements now in place to improve employment opportunities for disabled people are more effective than the previous system based on registration as a disabled person under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 giving access to a "quota" of jobs in larger organisations. Experience showed that the registration process leading to the issue of the Green Card (DP21) and quota system failed to secure job opportunities for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para8">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) provides a framework of rights for disabled people which are enforced through Employment Tribunals. We have already demonstrated our commitment to comprehensive enforceable civil rights for disabled people through a reduction in the threshold for employment rights to 15 bringing in an extra 70,000 disabled employees within the scope of the DDA; and by introducing the Bill to establish a Disability Rights Commission. The Disability Rights Task Force will be reporting on what further is needed to strengthen employment rights.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para9">Equally, many disabled people are benefiting from the New Deals introduced in the last two years. The New Deal for Disabled People is testing a range of initiatives, to help disabled people and those with long-term illness into work at a cost of &#163;195 million. We have also expanded the specialist disability employment programmes run by the Employment Service. These include help from Disability Employment Advisers, the Supported Employment Programme, Access to Work and the Job Introduction Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what consultations he had with trades unions in the preparation of the Remploy Corporate Plan;  [87491]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to review Remploy's Corporate Plan in respect of its potential effect on the skill levels of Remploy employment;  [87492]
<P>
(3) what guidelines exist to promote the replacement of employees of Remploy with other disabled persons.  [87501]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 There have been no discussions between the Remploy Trade Unions, which represent the weekly paid employees, and the Remploy Management in preparing the Remploy 1999-02 Corporate Plan. I understand that the Remploy Trade Unions were invited by the Remploy Board of Directors to a meeting to discuss the Plan in April this year. The Remploy Trade Union, MSF, which represents the majority of the monthly paid employees, was the sole union to attend the meeting. The Remploy Board have made clear that they would welcome discussions with the Trades Unions before, and during, the development of the next Corporate Plan.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 1999 : Column: 470</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para10">As the Corporate Plan 1999-02 has just been published, there are no plans to review it. I understand that Remploy are not expecting deskilling of employees as a result of planned changes. Remploy has necessarily had a long experience of retraining its disabled employees to adapt to changes in the labour market and increased competition from other countries. By taking the initiative in this way, Remploy continues to best protect the interests of its disabled workforce.
<P>

<a name="90625w01.htm_para11">The Government have set the Remploy Board of Directors a range of annual performance targets that are the parameters within which Remploy operates. The targets for 1999 have been announced recently in the House, and include a target to increase the number of disabled people employed by the Company. This year's target is to employ an overall total of 10,150 disabled people. How this will be achieved is a matter for the Remploy Board, but the chief means of doing this will be by recruitment through Remploy's interwork programme.

<a name="90625w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The Government's policy is to implement the Belfast Agreement in full. The Agreement requires the establishment of an Executive Committee on a proportionate basis dependent on the number of seats each party has in the Assembly. The Agreement also commits all parties to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations and to use whatever influence they may have to achieve decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years of the referendum and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement. Decommissioning, though not a prior pre- condition to the establishment of the Executive, is a requirement of the Agreement. In order to achieve the successful implementation of the Agreement, everyone must be confident that all aspects will be implemented.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department always keeps under review policies that impact significantly on the areas of transport, environment and other policy areas for which it is responsible, including on any specific sectors, and continues to monitor the impact of the fuel duty escalator. We are, of course, concerned to ensure that a balance is struck between legitimate environmental concerns and the transport needs of rural motorists. Increasing fuel taxation by itself will not be sufficient to achieve all our environmental objectives. People ultimately need real alternatives to the car, and this is one of the reasons behind our development of an integrated transport policy--the framework for which we published in July 1998 in our White Paper on the future of transport, <i>A New Deal for Transport</i>. We are also seeking to improve transport choice through the &#163;170 million of additional funding which we have made available for public transport in rural areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The carriage of warning triangles and first aid kits is already recommended in the Highway Code. However, as it would be dangerous to walk on some roads to place a warning triangle the recommended distance behind the vehicle, the Highway Code advised that they should never be used on motorways.
<P>

<a name="90625w02.htm_para0">Most fuel stations carry replacement bulbs and in many cases the motoring rescue and recovery organisations would be able to supply and fit replacements when necessary.
<P>

<a name="90625w02.htm_para1">We therefore have no plans to require the carriage of warning triangles, first aid kits or spare bulbs in cars.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on pollution caused by older cars, lorries and buses.  [87898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Research into the emission performance of older vehicles is regularly undertaken by my Department, to inform the National Atmospheric Emission Inventory and other air quality models. This involves the comprehensive testing of in-use vehicles of different ages, under different driving conditions. The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force has also been looking at the contribution of older vehicles to traffic pollution, in order to identify the most cost-effective options for reducing emissions from vehicles already in use.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make it his policy to support the development of new technologies which can be fitted to older vehicles to reduce their emissions; and if he will make a statement.  [87899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90625w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government are pleased to support the use of technologies to reduce the environmental impact of older vehicles. We provide a VED incentive of up to &#163;1,000 to hauliers and bus operators whose vehicles meet high environmental standards. These standards can be reached through conversion to run on alternative fuels, or the fitment of technologies like particulate traps. Through the Foresight Vehicle LINK programme, the Government are providing &#163;12 million to support the development of a wide range of automotive related technologies. These include exhaust after-treatment systems which can be retrofitted to existing vehicles, as well as hybrid drive systems and lightweight materials for use in the next generation of vehicles. The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force has also been looking at what the most cost-effective solutions for reducing emissions from vehicles in use are.

These capabilities are those most relevant to the UN and will enable the UK to make a more effective contribution to UN peacekeeping and humanitarian operations in future.

 We have stopped large scale sales of forest land by the Forestry Commission. Our policy is that the Commission may only sell agricultural land, land associated with houses and other buildings, unplantable land and relatively small and isolated blocks of forest land which do not make a significant contribution to its objectives and which are surplus to its requirements. The Commission may also sell areas for development where this is in the public interest. Areas of forest land which are important for public access will not be sold unless an access agreement is in place.

 The Medicines Control Agency undertakes its statutory role in the control of medicines advertising on behalf of Health Ministers. Any notice issued by the Agency is therefore issued for, and on behalf of Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90625w04.htm_para0">There are specific circumstances under which notices may be issued to advertisers under the procedures in the amending Regulations. These are:
<P>

<a name="90625w04.htm_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under paragraph 1--to request a copy of an advertisement,

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under paragraph 4--to advise an advertiser that an advertisement would not be in breach, and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90625w04.htm_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under paragraph 5--to advise an advertiser that, after consideration of the advice of the Independent Review Panel Health Ministers have decided an advertisement is in breach.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90625w04.htm_para5">Notices under paragraphs 1 or 3 may require an advertiser to cease advertising on an interim basis. At any stage the recipient of a notice can seek judicial review of the decision to issue that notice.
<P>

<a name="90625w04.htm_para6">The issue of notices under the Schedule will not be automatic--the Medicines Control Agency will continue, as now, to discuss problems with advertising with the company concerned so as to secure acceptable changes. The formal procedures will come into play only when informal negotiation fails to reach an appropriate outcome.
<P>

<a name="90625w04.htm_para7">The remit of the Independent Review Panel will be to consider written representations from advertisers who have been issued with a notice under paragraph 3 and advise Health Ministers on the compatibility of the advertisement in question with the Advertising Regulations. The panel will not consider the issue of notices or other procedural matters. The amending Regulations provide for the making of written representations by the company concerned but do not preclude oral hearings where these are considered appropriate by the Panel. We have no objection to the reports of the Review Panel meetings being made publicly available. Furthermore, the Medicines Control Agency has already established a working group, the Medicines Advertising Liaison Group, to provide a forum for all regulatory and self regulatory bodies concerned with the advertising of medicines to exchange information and opinions on advertising issues.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the tonnage of linseed fibre flax produced in the United Kingdom in each of the last three years; and what was the total financial subsidy paid on this crop in each of those years.  [87651]<P>

<a name="90625w06.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Payments made under the EU fibre flax scheme are based on the area of flax grown. The area of fibre flax grown in the United Kingdom in 1996, 1997 and 1998 was 20,200 hectares, 19,200 hectares and 16,800 hectares respectively. Based on the average yields achieved in those three years the tonnage of fibre flax produced would have been in the region of 27,000 tonnes in 1996, 16,000 tonnes in 1997 and 25,000 tonnes in 1998.
