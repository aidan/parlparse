<p><a name="40705w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 European Directive 2003/4, which ensures all member states have equal access to information and puts the Aarhus Convention into law, was published in January 2003. We have therefore had to ensure the EIRs are consistent with the Directive, which must be implemented by February 2005. In November 2003, Ministers agreed to align the EIRs with the Freedom of Information Act as far as possible.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that the civil justice system in England meets the requirements of <i>(a)</i> Article 9(4) of the Aarhus Convention that review procedures must not be prohibitively expensive, <i>(b)</i> Article 9(2) of the Aarhus Convention that organisations promoting environmental protection should have a guaranteed right of access to a review procedure before a court of law in environmental matters; and <i>(c)</i> Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention that members of the public have access to administrative or judicial procedures to challenge acts and omissions by private persons which contravene provisions of national law relating to the environment.  [180617]</p>









<p><a name="40705w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We believe that these requirements as expressed in the terms of Articles 9(2), 9(3) and 9(4) of the Convention are already reflected in the civil justice system in England and Wales.

 The Convention covers a field of shared competence between the European Community and its member states.

<p><a name="40705w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The report of the Environmental Justice Project was published in November 2003. It was one of five independent studies into justice in environmental matters, which were wholly or partially funded by Defra.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para5">
Its main conclusions are that the civil law system could be improved by the establishment of an environmental court, alteration of rules on costs and improved public access to information about environmental law. The report also concluded that under criminal law the punishment of environmental offences is too low and that more judicial guidance and training is needed, along with greater powers for enforcement agencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para6">
The Department is currently considering these conclusions alongside the findings of the other research undertaken.

<p><a name="40705w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department welcomes the proposals. They provide an opportunity to consider what more is needed to complete implementation in the European Community of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making, and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. They could also support general compliance with EC environmental law. The Government&#039;s general stance in further negotiations on the proposals will be to seek alignment of Community law with the Convention. At the -same time, we will aim to ensure that the Directive is flexible enough to suit the individual requirements of each member state, and in no way restricts access to justice where it currently exists.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what amount of antibiotics is used per 1000 tonnes of live pig in the UK; and what the average figure is in the whole EU.  [180371]</p>









<p><a name="40705w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) publishes an annual report on the sales of antimicrobial products in the UK. The latest report, for 2002, shows that 98 tonnes (active ingredient) of antibiotics were sold for products authorised only for use in pigs. 998,000 tonnes of pigs (liveweight) were slaughtered in the UK in 2002. However, 283 tonnes (active ingredient) of antibiotic were sold for multi-species products. It is not known how much of these were for pig use. Using the pig only sales tonnage, 98.2 kg (active ingredient) of antibiotic were sold per 1000 tonnes of pigs slaughtered liveweight. As some of the multi-species products may have been used in pigs this figure is likely to be an underestimate. The VMD is working on a system to collect data that will enable the multi-species tonnage to be broken down by species but this is not yet available.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2004 : Column 436W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para9">
The UK is one of a small number of EU member states that publish data on antibiotic sales. It is not, therefore, possible to give a whole EU equivalent.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what restrictions exist on the use of antibiotics in pigs; and if she will make a statement.  [180372]</p>








<p><a name="40705w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Antibiotics for use in animals are authorised either as veterinary medicinal products or as zootechnical feed additives (which include antimicrobial growth promoters). These work by increasing the efficiency of the absorption of feed in the animal&#039;s gut thereby allowing them to reach slaughter size more quickly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para10">
The use of zootechnical feed additives in the EU is subject to Directive 70/524/EC, as amended. No feed additive may be authorised unless it satisfies criteria set out in that Directive, including a requirement that at the level permitted in feedingstuffs it does not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. Such additives may be used only within the terms of their entry in the annexes in the Directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para11">
Antibiotics are also used as veterinary medicines but no antibiotic is authorised in the UK for the treatment of food producing animals unless it has first been considered by the independent, Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) which advises the Government on the safety, quality and efficacy of veterinary medicines. All such antibiotics authorised in the UK are classified as prescription only medicines. They may be administered only on the basis of a prescription issued by a veterinary surgeon who has the animals under his or her care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para12">
In addition anybody incorporating veterinary medicines or zootechnical feed additives into animal feedingstuffs, or distributing these products, must be inspected, approved and registered by the Animal Medicines Inspectorate (AMI) of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w01.html_para13">
A new EU Regulation 1831/2003/EC on additives for use in animal nutrition comes into force on 18 October 2004. Among other things this Regulation will ban the use of all veterinary antibiotic growth promoters from 1 January 2006.

<p><a name="40705w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 July 2004]:</i> As at 21 June 2004, there had been 182,770 confirmed cases of BSE in the UK. Due to stringent controls numbers of BSE cases are now significantly lower than in 1988, when the disease was first made notifiable.

<p><a name="40705w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Pet Animals Act 1951 is concerned with the sale of animals and is applicable only to events where sales take place and therefore exhibitions which are solely for competitive showing fall outside the scope of the 1951 Act.

<p><a name="40705w02.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government are engaged in a number of activities to encourage water conservation across different sectors. In relation to domestic water use, the recent report by the Sustainable Buildings Task Group, &quot;Better Buildings&#151;Better Lives&quot;, contained a number of recommendations to improve the water efficiency of new and existing buildings. These include tighter minimum standards for water fittings, development of best practice guidance and incentives to encourage the uptake of water efficient products. The Government are actively considering how it will take these forward. I am also looking into the feasibility of introducing a product labelling scheme to help domestic consumers identify water efficient fittings and appliances. These activities will complement the existing duty on water undertakers to promote the efficient use of water by their customers.

<p><a name="40705w02.html_spnew8"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government are taking action in line with its Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food to facilitate industry action to create a dairy sector that is attractive, sustainable and profitable for those engaged in it. For example:

As with all new entrants into farming, young farmers can obtain a range of business advice for start up businesses through the business links network and the Small Business Service. For full time farmers this includes access to the Farm Business Advice Service.

<p><a name="40705w02.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will reduce the administrative burden for farmers.  [180715]</p>








<p><a name="40705w02.html_spnew9"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government are indeed working hard to reduce administrative burdens on farmers not least through reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, reducing 10 main funding schemes to a Single Payment Scheme. This will remove much of the bureaucracy and paperwork associated with the old schemes and result in a streamlined and simplified application process for farmers. More than 100 pages of forms will be reduced to a fraction of this number. And through the Modernising Rural Delivery Rural Programme we aim to simplify access to rural funding streams.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w02.html_para2">
In addition, the Whole Farm Approach will be rolled out in late 2005. The whole farm appraisal is currently being widely piloted, and this will transform Defra&#039;s interactions with farmers on subsidies, regulation and advice by redesigning them around on-farm activities and saving farmers from repeated requests for regulatory data.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w02.html_para3">
The existing administrative burdens on farmers derive largely from regulations to achieve desirable outcomes for society such as protecting human and animal health, animal welfare and the environment. In addition, administrative checks are required to ensure proper disbursement of funds under CAP and other rural schemes. However, the Government are taking a broader approach to reducing administrative burdens on farmers; in response to the recent recommendations of the Regulation Taskforce set up by the Secretary of State. Along with a new unit developing a farm regulation strategy, this will help improve Defra&#039;s regulatory performance; achieving a coherent and holistic approach to the development of regulation and its impact on farmers.

Any vehicle taking livestock onto a farm and then off again as part of a multiple pick-up or drop-off movement risks spreading disease, either to the animals if disease is present on the farm, or to animals on the farm if disease is present in the animals on the vehicle.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 8 June 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 291W, on the Thames Barrier, what assessment she has made of the Chief Scientific Adviser&#039;s statement of 31 March that climate change is a reason for increased use of the Thames Barrier.  [180287]</p>








<p><a name="40705w04.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I am not aware that the Chief Scientific adviser made a statement on 31 March that climate change is a reason for increased use of the Thames Barrier. However, this issue was raised when he provided evidence to the EFRA Committee on Climate Change, Water Security and Flooding on 12 May, when he said that increased use of the Barrier is an indication of the influences of global warming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w04.html_para4">
The Barrier is closed to protect London from extreme high tidal waters generated by storm surges in the North Sea and to provide storage for extreme freshwater flows, which would threaten west London, and combinations of these phenomena.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2004 : Column 447W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w04.html_para5">
It is true that recent years have seen an increase in frequency of Barrier closures but whether this is attributable to changes in operational procedures, increased fluvial flows or climate change is difficult to accurately measure. One factor is that mean sea level and extreme tidal waters are expected to increase as the South East of England continues to fall relative to sea level. This was factored into the design of the Barrier.

<p><a name="40705w04.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Water treatment works in the UK which use either activated carbon filtration, or ozonation, or a combination of both processes are not readily identifiable. Granular activated carbon filtration is a standard part of the treatment process at many of the larger water treatment works in England and Wales, particularly where the raw water is derived from river and other surface water sources. In most cases ozonation may be used, either continuously or intermittently, in combination with the activated carbon filtration. A number of groundwater sources are also treated by activated carbon filtration alone, or ozonation followed by activated carbon filtration, depending on the type of contaminants that need to be removed.

 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer given on 17 June 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1045W. Detailed discussions for the provision of service are under way with Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT). These include discussion of service standards which will be an important part of the final contract. As I stated on 17 June, I understand it to be CWT&#039;s assessment that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations will apply. The jobs of existing staff will thus be protected and they have the opportunity to remain in the Travel Office. A range of measures will be put in place to check on the performance of CWT: these will be reflected in the service standards and monitored on a regular basis. Hon. Members and their staff are encouraged to provide feedback on the service through the Travel Office Consumers&#039; Panel, to the Director of Finance and Administration or to CWT itself. The contract has been let on a competitive basis, and represents best overall value to Parliament, taking account both of the cost of the contract itself, and also potential savings in the cost of travel.

 Shared ownership is designed to help social tenants and others on modest incomes who cannot afford to purchase a home without help but who can sustain the long-term financial commitment of owner occupation.

 Following the recommendations of the 2002 quinquennial review, English Heritage is strengthening its regional presence. In addition to retaining its nine regional offices, English Heritage is appointing four new Territory Directors (north, south, east and west). This is intended to improve the regional focus of English Heritage activities and strengthen the relationship between national objectives and the needs of regions. It will also create efficiencies by rationalising property management and support functions.

<p><a name="40705w06.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s position remains that the transitional funding should be repaid in full and within the Spending Review (SR2002) period. However, the Government recognises that there have been delays in the pay and modernisation process and that, among other things, this could mean that we will be seeking to recoup the transitional funding less than a year after it has been distributed to fire and rescue authorities. It is important that we get a clearer picture of the pressures fire and rescue authorities may face, and the extent to which they are making efficiency improvements. To this end the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Local Government Association and Chief Fire Officer Association officials are working to develop the evidence base.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the implementation of the modernisation of working practices in the Fire Service will lead to the elimination of the provision of beds in fire stations.  [181570]</p>

<p><a name="40705w06.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 All Fire and Rescue Authorities are in the process of implementing their first year action plans according to Integrated Risk Management (IRM) principles and will start consulting on their year two plans shortly. IRM replaces the former centrally determined standards of fire cover that sometimes bore little or no relation to the current pattern of risk in a given area. Each authority has to consider the range of risks faced by the communities it serves and then allocate available resources to maximum benefit. As part of that process, authorities have been considering whether current working patterns adequately match the occurrence of incidents over the course of the day. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not expect that there will be a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution and it will be for each authority to determine what use to make of downtime during the night hours and what rest facilities are appropriate.

 It is the Government&#039;s policy, set out in the White Paper &#039;Our Fire and Rescue Service&#039;, that union participation in negotiating arrangements for the Fire and Rescue Service should be widened. We hope that voluntary reforms will achieve this. However, Government is seeking reserve powers under the Fire and Rescue Services Bill which would enable it to set up new statutory arrangements if voluntary reforms do not result in improvement.

 The Housing Corporation&#039;s London Allocation Statement for 2004&#150;06 will be published shortly on the Housing Corporation&#039;s website www.housingcorp.gov.uk along with the allocation statements of the other regions. A copy will also be made available in the Library of the House.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what assessment he has made of the impact of the Housing Corporation&#039;s total cost indicator financing regime on the numbers of family-sized affordable homes being built in London;  [181636]

</p>



<p>(2) if he will make a statement on the Housing Corporation&#039;s new partnering regime for registered social landlords building new affordable housing; and what assessment he has made of the potential for greater flexibility in relation to total cost indicators.  [181637]</p>








<p><a name="40705w06.html_spnew10"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Housing Corporation introduced Partnering Programme Agreements (PPAs) into the main Approved Development Programme (ADP) for the 2004&#150;06 programme. PPAs do not use cost benchmarking (as in the TCI regime) and focus on levels of grant paid rather than overall costs to registered social landlords (RSLs). They are individually negotiated. Almost 80 per cent. of the ADP for 2004&#150;06 has been allocated to some 70 RSLs or groups of RSLs under partnering. The introduction of partnering in the 2004&#150;06 ADP encouraged RSLs to bring forward cost effective proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w06.html_para1">
Total Cost Indicators (TCIs) have been used for the 20 per cent. of the 2004&#150;06 ADP not allocated through partnering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w06.html_para2">
Within the TCI regime, there should be no disincentive to develop larger dwellings as the TCIs increase with the size of the dwellings. The TCIs only provide an indication of the &quot;norm&quot; costs of providing a dwelling of a certain size in a certain area. If more than eight people are to be housed in a dwelling, then RSLs can apply an additional multiplier to raise the TCI to take account of the increased costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w06.html_para3">
In the ADP for 2004&#150;06 the proportion on new build properties for rent of three beds or larger across London is around 26 per cent. of total dwellings.

 When dealing with dyslexia, as with other recognised special educational needs conditions, schools and local authorities are expected to have regard to the SEN Code of Practice, published in November 2001, which gives practical advice on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN.

The programme will support partnership projects involving education, health and social care, as well as a wide range of other partners, to develop and pilot effective practice.

<p><a name="40705w11.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s policy towards persons in the United Kingdom driving without insurance, driving without a licence, and driving without due care and attention, is to apply the requirements and sanctions contained in legislation. For Great Britain, that legislation is the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. The provisions apply to persons from the new EU member states as to other drivers. For Northern Ireland, similar provisions exist in Northern Ireland law.
</p>

As regards offenders with no fixed address in the United Kingdom, the Government recognise that there are practical difficulties relating to their prosecution, as they are likely to leave the UK to return to their home states and cannot be compelled to return. There are also practical difficulties relating to the application of the fixed penalty system to them. The Government are examining ways of improving the effectiveness of the system.

<p><a name="40705w12.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Assessments of this nature tend to be undertaken at the international level on account of the structure of the industry. The IPCC Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere (1999) noted that enhanced air traffic management had the potential to lead to a global fuel saving of between 6 per cent. and 12 per cent. of total fuel consumption. Estimates of fuel savings include inefficiencies linked to airspace structure and current management practices as well as the more local phenomenon of holding due to airport congestion. Implementation of the EC Single European Sky initiative, which came into force on the 20 April 2004, should lead to more direct routing and consequential fuel savings, estimated to be of the order of 10 per cent. The UK has also supported the production and promulgation of guidance from the International Civil Aviation Organisation entitled Operational Opportunities to Minimise Fuel Use and Reduce Emissions (Circular 303, February 2004).

 With effect from 1 July 2004, the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 provides the British Transport Police with a wholly statutory jurisdiction over railway property throughout Great Britain. It provides BTP constables with all the powers and privileges of a Home Office police constable when they are on the railways. The Act also provides for BTP&#039;s jurisdiction to extend outside railway property on all matters connected to the railways.

<p>
<a name="40705w12.html_para1">
The British Transport Police also have jurisdiction outside the railways on non-railway matters. This jurisdiction is provided by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This Act allows a British Transport Police officer to act as a constable anywhere in Great Britain when asked for assistance by a local police officer, or in an emergency. The Government has welcomed the endorsement of the provisions that extend BTP&#039;s jurisdiction in limited circumstances by the Privy Counsellor Committee which reviewed the Act. At this time, the Government does not consider it necessary to introduce any further legislation in respect of BTP&#039;s jurisdiction but, as recommended by the Committee, the Government is content to revisit, the BTP provisions in the Act when a suitable legislative vehicle becomes available.

In April 2004 the Government announced the award of Beacon Council status to six local authorities under the theme of Better Local Public Transport. Each of the six authorities has demonstrated excellence in improving public transport in its area, and partnership working with local bus operators accounts for a large part of this. The six authorities are undertaking a series of events with the support of the Improvement and Development Agency specifically designed to enable them to spread their good practice to other authorities.

 I regularly encourage local authorities and bus companies to work together in partnership and am pleased that the majority of local transport authorities in England are involved in one or more voluntary quality bus partnership agreements. Many such agreements comprise one or more bus corridor improvements. Because these agreements are voluntary there is no requirement to report them and the comprehensive information requested is not available. Local transport in Wales and Scotland is a matter for the devolved Administrations.

The Department provides funding to English local authorities for bus priority measures such as quality bus corridors. Funding provided in 2003&#150;04 was forecast to deliver over 1,300 kilometres of improved bus routes in that year.

Research shows that quality partnership schemes typically increase bus patronage by between 5 per cent. and 20 per cent. within the first 12 months of operation. These schemes also contribute towards modal shift, with surveys showing that around 33 per cent. of new users had previously undertaken their journey by car.

<p><a name="40705w15.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Grogan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many quality partnerships are in operation, broken down by local authority area.  [181270]</p>








<p><a name="40705w15.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 All quality partnerships currently in operation are voluntary agreements, which do not need to be notified to central Government, as distinct from statutory schemes made under the Transport Act 2000, which need to be registered with the traffic commissioner for the relevant area. There is no agreed definition of a non-statutory quality partnership and some partnership agreements cover more than one area or corridor. Comprehensive information is therefore not available. However, a survey in 2001 found that quality partnership schemes existed or were being developed in 65 of the 85 local transport authority areas of England. The number may well have increased since 2001.

<p>
<a name="40705w15.html_para2">
Train operating companies (TOCs) confirm to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) that their bid for timetabling paths delivers the passenger service requirement (PSR), which specifies maximum journey times. TOCs may seek derogations from the SRA where elements of the PSR cannot be delivered. The SRA reviews and considers each derogation request on its merits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w15.html_para3">
Minor compromises to the TOCs bids are also made by Network Rail which can extend the journey times by small amounts in defined circumstances. The SRA&#039;s contract with TOCs permits this to happen without permission and such incidences are numerous. On occasions this may cause a journey time to be extended beyond the maximum specified in the PSR.

 Neither the Rail Regulator nor the Strategic Rail Authority has specific powers to oblige operators to provide toilets on trains.

Operators will, however, make the most of their commercial opportunities only where they meet the demands of passengers.

The data is based on trains striking animals on the railway network, reportable by the railways to HSE&#039;s Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR 95). Under RIDDOR the railways are required to report all incidents of a train striking a cow or horse, and for all other animals, where the train sustains damage requiring immediate or temporary repairs. There is no requirement under RIDDOR to report if the animal was killed or injured or if retrieved from the line. Trains only resume their journeys when it is safe to do so.

Research also indicates that driver fatigue accounts for about 10 per cent. of all accidents on the road network in Great Britain. Under a pilot scheme some police forces have provided information on the factors that may have contributed to an accident. The data provided for 2003 indicates that in 1 per cent. of accidents within the pilot scheme driver fatigue was a contributory factor. This data is based on the opinions of police officers or, in the case of accidents reported by a member of the public at a police station, determined from the description of the accident. This pilot scheme also indicates that driver impairment due to drugs was a contributory factor in 1 per cent. of all accidents.

A number of factors have delayed work. There was a delay of three months owing to unexpected poor ground conditions which necessitated significant redesign work and the need for strengthening works. High winds have also restricted planned operations of the crane, further delaying the progress of the work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w16.html_para14">
The layout of the site is very confined. This dictates a strict sequence of operations and restricts the number of people that can work on the site at one time. For health and safety reasons, many tasks can only be carried out when both road and rail traffic are completely suspended. This relies on the agreement of Network Rail to close the railway line. To minimise disruption these closures only take place during off peak periods. The setting up and dismantling of heavy equipment on the road requires a length of time which is generally only available at weekends.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the overall change in the number of British seafarers employed in UK shipping has been as a result of the Government&#039;s measures introduced under their policy Charting a New Course.  [182021]</p>








<p><a name="40705w17.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 &quot;British Shipping: Charting a New Course&quot; was published in 1998. It led to the introduction of a number of innovative measures aimed at halting the decline in the UK shipping industry, including Tonnage Tax in 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w17.html_para0">
Shipping is a global, competitive industry and changes in UK seafarer numbers cannot be attributed to the Government&#039;s policy measures alone. However, the latest available figures (contained in the London Metropolitan University&#039;s &#039;United Kingdom Seafarer&#039;s Analysis 2003&#039;) show that although the number of UK active seafarers had declined from approximately 30,000 in 1997 to 25,000 in 2001, it had increased to 28,000 by 2003.

<p><a name="40705w17.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The tonnage tax, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2000, is part of the Government&#039;s strategy for halting the decline in the UK shipping industry. Around 12,500 seafarers (officers and ratings) are employed on ships in the tonnage tax. Approximately 39 per cent. of all of these seafarers, and nearly 50 per cent. of the officers, are UK nationals.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason speed cameras are not installed on motorways as a routine safety measure on the same basis as other roads.  [181441]</p>








<p><a name="40705w17.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The deployment of safety cameras on motorways is governed by the same rules as those on other parts of the network. Motorways, being relatively safer than the rest of the road network due to the separation of opposing traffic streams and the limited amount of vulnerable users, present fewer locations that meet the criteria. However, cameras are used at locations where the speed limit has been reduced for reasons of safety, including road maintenance sites where they enforce temporary speed limits put in place for the protection of road users and workers alike.

<p><a name="40705w17.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 We are planning to consult on a more flexible system of fines for speeding to reflect better the levels of risk to road safety. Changes to the penalty fine system for speeding offences would require legislation.

Notes:<br>

1. The net total figures represent the total of public and private investment and public resource expenditure plus public spending funded by local charging revenue. But to avoid double counting, public expenditure which directly supports private investment has been excluded from the net total.<br>





2. All figures are at outturn prices. Totals may not sum owing to rounding.<br>

3. The figures for public investment expenditure consist of expenditure within DfT&#039;s Capital Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) and capital grants to the private sector within DfT&#039;s Resource DEL. Figures for public resource expenditure consist of the remainder of DfT&#039;s Resource DEL and estimates of local authority revenue expenditure.<br>

4. Figures for public expenditure in 2001&#150;02 represent outturn expenditure; for 2002&#150;03 provision; for 2003&#150;04 plans under Spending Review 2002; and for later years, indicative allocations subject to future Spending Reviews.<br>

5. Local authority revenue figures are estimates of local authority transport spending, reflecting Highways Maintenance Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) and an estimated part of EPCS SSA in years up to 2002&#150;03. For later years, the figures represent plans for Highways Maintenance Formula Spending Share (FSS) and an estimated part of EPCS FSS.<br>

 Legislation under the European employment directive to outlaw age discrimination in employment and vocational training is on course to come into force on 1 October 2006.

The CEHR will be able to advise individuals of their rights under the legislation, and support some people to bring their cases before the courts. In addition, the CEHR will have powers to conduct an investigation into a named party where it has reasonable suspicion that the person is not complying with the statutory requirements of the age regulations. If unlawful discrimination or harassment is found, the CEHR will be able to require the discrimination to stop.

<p><a name="40705w20.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 This is primarily a matter for the generators.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w20.html_para9">
The introduction of a significant amount of intermittent renewable generation will require additional reserve capacity in the electricity market and the use of more short-term balancing services. The amount of reserve capacity that will be required depends on the overall mix of generation technologies and the approach taken to address intermittency in different timescales (for example, storage, demand side measures or flexible generation). The electricity trading arrangements give suppliers strong financial incentives to contract ahead to meet the demands of their customers and give generators strong financial incentives to deliver the power they have contracted to provide. It is a commercial matter for all generators, including those producing from the alternative renewable technologies, how they manage the risks associated with variability in the generation from their plant. Market participants are assisted by the information that NGC provides to the market in its role as System Operator about forecast future supply and demand for electricity.

When looking at the gender proportion within each occupational role, women tend to be less well represented in design and creation of technological systems&#151;just 12 per cent. of software professionals are women (17 per cent. in 2002).

On 15 December 2003, the Council agreed that the Declaration should be amended in line with the Court&#039;s judgment. This has no immediate bearing on nuclear safety decisions in the United Kingdom. These are still a matter for the national regulators. However, it remains to be seen how far, if at all, this Court judgment might lead to the development of Euratom measures on nuclear safety that previously would have been regarded as outside the field of Community competence. Any such measures, if agreed, would apply to all member states.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many 2MW wind turbines would be needed to reach the Government&#039;s renewable energy targets.  [182307]</p>








<p><a name="40705w22.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 If the Government&#039;s 2010 target were met only by 2MW wind turbines then we would need somewhere in the region of 6,000&#150;7,000 turbines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w22.html_para3">
However, it is more likely that wind will provide around three-quarters of the 10 per cent. target with the rest primarily from a mix of landfill gas, hydro and co-firing with biomass. If this is coupled with the development of significantly larger offshore turbines, (the Irish Arklow Bank site is already installing 3.6 MW turbines), then the number of turbines required is likely to be lower, around 5,000&#150;6,000, including both onshore and offshore installations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w22.html_para4">
To put this in context&#151;Denmark, a country one-fifth the size of the UK already has over 5,000 turbines installed.

<p><a name="40705w22.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The main forms of support that wind receives are via the Renewables Obligation and the Climate Change Levy. These currently amount to &#163;31.39 and &#163;4.30 respectively, for each MWh of electricity generated. Aside from this we have also provided &#163;117 million in capital grants as part of the Round 1 Offshore Wind Programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w22.html_para5">
Future capital grant funding for offshore wind is not yet available as it forms part of the ongoing SR04 spending review.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2004 : Column 517W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w22.html_para6">
Costs to 2010 from the Renewables Obligation and Climate Change Levy are difficult to estimate because they are dependent on the actual amount of wind energy generated. However, if we assume that wind accounts for around three quarters of our 10 per cent. target then support for wind could be in the region of &#163;800M/y by 2010.

<p><a name="40705w23.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 We are taking action in the pensions bill to promote future pension saving. The creation of the new Pensions Regulator and the Pensions Protection Fund will enhance protection for pension scheme members and improve confidence in pension provision in general. We are also introducing incentives to extend working lives through more generous rewards for deferring state pension.

<p><a name="40705w23.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 No. It would not be right for the child support formula to make an allowance for the child care and nursery costs of any working parent. To do so would provide an element of double provision for these costs, as help with child care costs is given in other schemes.


</p>







<p><a name="40705w23.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Hunter: </b>

This strikes a balance between recognising the additional costs to the non-resident parent of looking after a child while not being so generous as to discourage the parent with care from allowing care to be shared.

 DWP administers state retirement pension to almost one million customers in over 200 countries worldwide, via International Pension Centre (IPC).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w25.html_para0">
In response to an issue identified by National Audit Office in the mid 90s, a strategy was introduced to confirm eligibility for state pension, and provide an acceptable level of assurance to Ministers, by way of issue and subsequent check of a letter sent to all customers living aboard. The strategy is designed to ensure that all customers will receive a letter within a maximum five year period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w25.html_para1">
In the past five years, for period 1999 to 2003, IPC have issued a total of some 850,000 letters, known as life certificates. This represents an average issue of approximately 170,000 letters per year. These are sent to all customers who have entitlement to UK state pension, including, but not exclusively, British expatriate pensioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w25.html_para2">
The current strategy is to send out approximately 200,000 letters per year to check entitlement, to ensure that all of the one million customers are contacted within a five year period. This is expected to continue over the next five years.

<a name="40705w25.html_para3">
An average of 4,900 pensioners worldwide have had their pensions stopped as a result of the exercise each year, totalling 24,500 over the last five years. This has resulted in financial savings of &#163;26.5 million in the period 1999 to 2003, at an average of &#163;5.1 million per year.

1. Tamworth parliamentary constituency was part of the Staffordshire Social Fund District. In November 2002, Staffordshire Social Fund District was combined with parts of Burton Social Fund District to form Staffordshire Jobcentre Plus District. The two areas for which data is given are different, therefore the data is not comparable.<br>

2. A very small area of Tamworth parliamentary constituency falls into another Jobcentre Plus District for which data is not separately available.<br>

3. Sure Start Maternity Grants were introduced on 27 March 2000. There were no applications recorded in the Staffordshire district during 1999&#150;2000.<br>

4. Data is given for all applications and awards, irrespective of whether the application was made by the mother or her partner.<br>

 There is no Victims Commissioner for Northern Ireland. The idea of a Victims Commissioner was first put forward as a recommendation by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield in his report, &quot;We Will Remember Them&quot;, which looked at possible ways of recognising the pain and suffering of victims of the Troubles.

The role of Victims Commissioner as envisaged in the report was primarily that of a watchdog over the services and advice available to victims. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are taking much of this work forward in their cross-departmental strategy; the consultation exercise they carried out indicated no clear view on the establishment of such a post. Government are currently reviewing their strategy for addressing the needs of victims of the Troubles, including how we deal with the past.

<i>[holding answer 7 June 2004]:</i> The Asylum Intake Reduction/ Secure Borders sub-programme board was established in February 2003 under the chairmanship of the Senior Director, Operations of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Initially it was intended that Ken Sutton should be included as a second Senior Director member, given his responsibility for Asylum Support, Casework and Appeals. However by April 2003 it was decided that, as Mr. Sutton already chaired or co-chaired two of the other sub-programme boards, he should not continue to be a member. Mr. Sutton has never attended any meetings of the board.

The Board takes the view that custodial provision has an important place in the criminal justice system for young people, but believes that with the provision of robust and highly intensive new community sentencing alternatives, such as the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP), it is possible and desirable to reduce the use of custody and ensure that it is used only for those who clearly need it.

aims to reduce custody for children by 10 per cent. over the next three years. Custody for under 18s did fall by 11 per cent. between October 2002 and October 2003 and although there has been a recent increase, the Board does anticipate further reductions over time.

The Youth Justice Board and Prison Service are committed to improving the child protection and safeguards arrangements within the Prison Service juvenile estate.

Prior to 2003, data on the location where the self-harm incident occurred were not collated centrally. The following table provides the information requested with respect to 2003 only.

A number of intervention strategies have been introduced into prisons, young offender and juvenile establishments for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. While evaluation of these interventions is, at present, very limited, evidence from research in non-prison settings suggests that male and female adolescents who self-harm repeatedly may benefit from group therapy. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice. Guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has also been circulated to establishments.

Responsibility for granting and revoking liquor licenses currently rests with licensing justices though this will be transferred to licensing authorities (district or county councils or London boroughs) under the new Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented in 2005. The police can make representations to licensing justices including applications to revoke existing licenses.

 A wide range of research on what impacts on driver behaviour and road safety is already undertaken on behalf of the Department for Transport.

A Home Office study published in 2003 (Home Office Research Findings No. 184) of the two year reconviction rates of the three drug treatment and testing order (DTTO) pilots sites showed an overall reconviction rate of 80 per cent. for the 174 DTTO offenders for whom criminal records were located on the Home Office&#039;s offenders index database.

 One of the key principles underpinning the establishment of the National Offender Management Service is the use of contestability to improve the quality and efficiency of services to offenders.

<sup>(21)</sup> A prisoner may test positive for more than one drug in each test.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what target he has been set for the number of hours of purposeful activity to be completed by prisoners in 2004&#150;05.  [181492]</p>









<p><a name="40705w35.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 29 June 2004]:</i> No annual target for the number of hours of purposeful activity has been set for 2004&#150;05. However, individual prisons will still agree a specific target for the average number of hours of purposeful activity per prisoner, per week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w35.html_para1">
Purposeful activity remains an important measure. However, the introduction of specific Key Performance Indicators for prisoner educational achievement, rehabilitation and resettlement provides a more focussed measure of the work being undertaken in prisons to reduce re-offending.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what evaluations are carried out, upon entry to prison, of the learning abilities of individual prisoners; and whether they can identify conditions such as dyslexia.  [169134]</p>








<p><a name="40705w35.html_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Past research suggests that the proportion of prisoners suffering from dyslexia could range from four to over 17 per cent. The new prison dyslexia project, currently under way in Yorkshire and Humberside, is designed to provide an authoritative answer to the question of the incidence of dyslexia and related learning disabilities among the prison population. A full report is expected at the end of the summer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w35.html_para2">
All establishments provide screening and initial assessment for prisoners. Potential dyslexia indicators can be identified through them. New diagnostic assessments for prisoners, to be administered after initial assessment by a specialist teacher, will offer guidance on when to refer learners for a full dyslexia assessment with an educational psychologist or other appropriately trained person.

<p><a name="40705w35.html_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 All telephone calls made on PIN phones by prisoners have been intercepted under Prison Rule 35A since the phased introduction of the PIN phone system at establishments over the period June 2001 to December 2003. Figures for the number of calls made in each of the last three years are not available but, as an indication of the volume, 55,261 calls were made on the PIN phone system on 21 June 2004. Numbers would have been progressively lower in earlier years as the PIN phone system was installed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w35.html_para3">
A small proportion of PIN phone calls are listened to. Prior to the introduction of the PIN phone system at each establishment a small proportion of the calls made by prisoners were listened to, and that remains the case for three establishments not on the PIN phone system today.

 Kingston prison currently holds 120 prisoners under the age of 65, 119 of whom are employed. There are 14 prisoners aged 65 or over, nine of whom are employed. Employment is available at Kingston for all those who wish to work and are fit enough to do so.

 The information sought is not available. The Prison Service collates data by prison establishment, rather than at individual prisoner level.

PSOs now perform much of the low risk work previously carried out by probation officers, which has in turn allowed probation officers to concentrate on high risk offenders and the completion of those reports that require their level of developed competence. While overall responsibility rests with the supervising probation officer, PSOs frequently contribute to parole assessments. They are also involved in the completion of short format reports.

<p><a name="40705w40.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 30 June 2004]:</i> For many years, national health service hospital contracting for pharmaceuticals in England has been organised on a group basis. Hospital pharmacists, on behalf of their NHS trusts, aggregate their hospital business which is then competitively tendered by the NHS Purchasing and Supply and Agency (NHS PASA). The groups adjudicate the framework agreements that are then awarded and managed, on their behalf, by NHS PASA. The approach is highly structured in terms of timing and management, and the groups share

information and develop shared strategies through arrangements co-ordinated at the national level, by NHS PASA, to optimise performance.

<p>
<a name="40705w40.html_para5">
The 2003 review of the group contracts, commissioned by the Department, will lead to the introduction of national contracts for near patent expiry and generic medicines. These contracts are scheduled to start on 1 November 2004.

 In line with the principles of &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, it is for local primary care trusts to decide whether extra surgeries are needed and if they are, where they should be located and how they should be funded in order to meet national and local priorities. Since 1 April 2004, premises growth funding has been allocated to the national health service, rather than being held centrally.

In 2002, the European Commission estimated that EU GDP had increased by 1.8 per cent. thanks to the Internal Market.

Estimates for the numbers of jobs in the UK linked, directly and indirectly, to the export of goods and services to the European Union, range upwards of 3 million.

Academics have estimated that the number of jobs is as high as 3.5 million, once secondary, eg consumption, effects have been included.

<p><a name="40705w46.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what definition he uses of the term near cash.  [181774]</p>








<p><a name="40705w46.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 Departmental budgets are set on an accruals basis and therefore reflect the full economic costs of service delivery. The term near cash was introduced in the 2002 Spending Review (paragraph B14 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2004 : Column 601W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of the 2002 Spending Review White Papers, Cm 5570) as a means of allowing readers to reconcile the announced plans to the previous budgeting regime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40705w46.html_para0">
Its definition has now evolved to simply describe departmental resource budgets less non-cash charges. The main non-cash charges currently included in budgets are depreciation and impairments, cost of capital, stock write-off, national audit fees, bad debts, profit and loss on disposal of fixed assets and movement in provisions. The term near cash is used rather than cash because it remains on an accruals basis and does not reflect the timing of actual cash payments.

<p><a name="40705w46.html_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b>

<p><a name="40705w46.html_spnew2"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Smokies, taken to be singed carcases of sheep and goats with the skin attached, are among meat products whose importation is prohibited under the Products of Animal Origin (Third Country Imports) (England) Regulations 2004. Equivalent legislation exists in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. HM Customs and Excise have no records of declared imports and their records of illegal meat seizures do not separately identify smokies.

 For the year ended 31 March 2004, flights to and from Northern Ireland under the Treasury&#039;s travel management contract cost &#163;18,961, of which &#163;1,068 was for Ministers&#039; travel and &#163;17,893 was for officials.
