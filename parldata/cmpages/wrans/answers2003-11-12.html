 During the Danish and Greek presidencies the Committee of Directive 99/94/EC met on one occasion, on 13 December 2002. On the agenda were a review of the state of play of legal implementation of the Directive in member states, a draft Directive adapting the base Directive with relation to displaying of CO2 information in car showrooms, a recommendation to extend the Directive to other media, and a discussion of segmentation of the vehicle fleet for CO2 labelling purposes.
<P>

<a name="31112w01.html_para2">Fuel consumption and CO2 labelling are a reserved issue and the Committee meeting was attended by officials of the Department for Transport only.

<P>
<a name="31112w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department for Transport was established following machinery of Government changes in May 2002. For the period 2002&#150;03 there have been 16 cases of alleged work-related stress in the Department for Transport (excluding its Agencies). There have been no compensation claims for work-related stress. The Department does not have details of the days lost and associated cost for work-related absence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the use of antibiotics in imported meats.  [137288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Residues of antibiotics, other veterinary medicines and banned substances in meats imported from third countries are controlled at two levels. First, the European Commission requires all third countries wishing to export food products to the EU to submit annual residue monitoring plans. These must demonstrate that the third country understands that exports to Member States should not contain substances banned in the EU, or authorised veterinary medicines in excess of the EC Maximum Residue Limit. These arrangements replicate the obligations placed on Member States to ensure that any residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs produced in the EU are at a level safe for consumers. The European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office also carries out missions to third countries to inspect and audit the arrangements they have in place to meet this requirement. Secondly, imports into the UK are randomly sampled at Border Inspection Posts and, to a lesser extent, at retail outlets. These samples are tested for a range of residues, including antibiotics. Any positives are considered for their consumer safety implications by toxicologists and the importing country's authorities are asked to investigate. Results of all the tests are reported on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate's website and in their quarterly newsletter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The European Commission withdrew its case in the European Court of Justice seeking a daily fine on France after France lifted its ban. Therefore, no fines were payable, but the Commission asked the Court to order that costs of the case be borne by France. The UK Government regretted the decision by the European Commission not to pursue the case for penalties against France. The UK supported the Commission throughout and believed that pressing this case would have sent a firm message to member states that no one country can avoid its obligations and responsibilities.

<P>
<a name="31112w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have made no specific assessment of the impact on dairy farmers of the contractual and price setting behaviour of the largest five UK supermarket chains. However, a detailed investigation into the supply of groceries from supermarkets was carried out by the Competition Commission in 1999&#150;2000. The Commission concluded that, taking all matters into consideration, the industry was broadly competitive. It did, however, identify three situations where competition was distorted and operates against the public interest. These concerned the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers and certain pricing practices. The Commission's report, which was published in October 2000, can be found at http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/inquiries/completed/2000/index.htm

<a name="31112w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 When fully implemented, the reforms agreed in June in Luxembourg will reduce the support price for butter by 10 per cent. more than the 15 per cent. reduction originally agreed for both butter and skimmed milk powder under Agenda 2000 (ie a 25 per cent. cut in the support price for butter). If farmgate prices were to fall to the same extent, the price per litre might be reduced by a further 0.95p beyond the impact of Agenda 2000. However, we share the European Commission's assessment that farmgate prices are unlikely to settle at this level: indeed, the overall package of compensation agreed reflects this. (Producers will be compensated through an increase in the level of direct payments of a further 0.74ppl over and above the compensation originally agreed in Agenda 2000.) The figures quoted above are based on an exchange rate of 70p/euro.
<P>

<a name="31112w02.html_para6">Our economic assessment indicates that decoupling of direct payments from production will have a beneficial effect on farm incomes; we would expect the main dairy-specific price impact to be in relation to the value of milk quota.

<a name="31112w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Following earlier complaints about the cost of veterinary medicines from both farmers and other animal owners, MAFF Ministers referred the issue to the Office of Fair Trading. The Competition Commission then carried out an inquiry into the distribution of prescription only veterinary medicines in the UK. The Competition Commission published their Report on 11 April 2003 which included 9 remedies addressed to the Office of Fair Trading and 11 recommendations addressed to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The Government response to the Report was issued on 9 July 2003.
<P>

<a name="31112w03.html_para12">I met with representatives of the BVA on 9 September 2003 to hear their views on the Competition Commission's recommendations and I have received 8 letters following the Commission's Report from veterinary surgeons and veterinary organisations about the cost of farm medicines.

 Overall income from farming in the UK rose 15 per cent. in 2002, with the average full-time farmer earning &#163;11,107. This was the second year running that there was an increase in farm incomes. This upward trend looks set to continue due to a recovery in the euro so far in 2003, which has led to a rise in prices across a range of commodities and will result in higher direct sterling subsidy payments.
<P>

<a name="31112w03.html_para13">It is important to note that for most farm households, incomes will be enhanced by other sources of income. Furthermore, for a significant number of these households diversified income is at present higher than the income earned from farming.
<P>

<a name="31112w03.html_para14">Government policy is not to attempt to intervene in the market to try and artificially increase incomes, but to facilitate the right economic framework to enable farmers to succeed, compete successfully internationally and have a profitable future.

<a name="31112w03.html_para15">The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food, launched on 12 December 2002, sets out how Government, industry and consumers will work with the whole of the food chain to secure a sustainable future for English farming and food industries, as viable industries contributing to a better environment and healthy and prosperous communities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the viability of the farming industry in East Sussex.  [137275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government wants the whole country's farming industry to succeed. That is why we launched the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food on 12 December 2002. The Strategy builds on the work of Sir Don Curry's Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food and provides a clear and strategic long-term direction towards a more sustainable future. The Government will work in partnership with industry and other stakeholders to implement the strategy, providing the leadership to allow farmers to flourish by their own efforts and to become better connected to markets and consumer requirements.
<P>

<a name="31112w04.html_para12">We are making good progress towards delivering these objectives. Most recently through June's CAP reform agreement which represents a real shift in agricultural policy. It sets out a new course for agriculture in Europe: a sustainable future where farmers do not farm for subsidy but produce what consumers want to buy, delivering a key aim of the Strategy&#151;reconnecting farmers to the market.
<P>

<a name="31112w04.html_para13">The Government has also established an Implementation Group of nine senior independent members, chaired by Sir Don Curry, to oversee delivery. Regional delivery plans have been drawn up to co-ordinate the approach within and between different areas of the country and the delivery plan for the south-east is now in the final stages of development.

<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_wqn0"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of farmers she expects to leave agricultural production in the next five years.  [137289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is no estimate made of the number of farmers expected to leave the industry in the future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Martlew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans there are to reintroduce the great bustard in England; and if she will make a statement.  [137122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 On the 31 October, I approved a 10-year trial reintroduction of the Great Bustard onto Salisbury Plain. This species has been extinct from England since 1832.
<P>

<a name="31112w05.html_para0">The Licence permits the Great Bustard Consortium, a conservation group, to release up to 40 chicks per year onto Salisbury Plain. The first releases are not likely to be before September 2004. A further licence under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) will be required to permit the import of the chicks from Russia.
<P>

<a name="31112w05.html_para1">The Department will review the trial on an annual basis in consultation with, among others, English Nature, the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It will be terminated in the event of evidence of harm to the donor population in Russia, or to native biodiversity.

<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to restrict the use of growth promoters in <i>(a)</i> animals and <i>(b)</i> fish destined for human consumption.  [137558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The authorisation and use of antimicrobials used in farming to promote growth is subject to strict controls set down by the European Union (Council Directive 70/524/EC amended). Under these rules such products cannot be authorised unless they satisfy statutory criteria designed to ensure that, at the level permitted in feedstuffs they will not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 2003 : Column 297W</I><P>
Additionally they may only be used in accordance with the terms set out in an annex to the Directive, which specifies the species in which they may be used, authorised dosage rates and the withdrawal periods that must be applied before animals can be slaughtered for human consumption.
<P>

<a name="31112w05.html_para2">The UK Government supported the recent adoption of a new Regulation that will replace Directive 70/524/EEC from September next year. One of the major consequences of this change will be the phasing out, across the EU, of all remaining antimicrobial growth promoters by 1 January 2006, as a precautionary measure.
<P>

<a name="31112w05.html_para3">In the meantime the Government are continuing to work closely with the industry's Responsible Use of Medicines Alliance (RUMA) both to promote the responsible use of these products and in drawing up plans to assist industry to adjust to their use being banned from January 2006.

<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make it her policy to amend the Wildlife and Countryside 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 2003 : Column 298W</I><P>
Act 1981 to make it a legal obligation on landowners to clear Japanese knotweed when it spreads within a site.  [134227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence for any person to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any plant listed in Schedule 9 of the Act, including Japanese knotweed. I have no current plans to amend the Act as the hon. Gentleman proposes.
<P>

<a name="31112w05.html_para4">The Rural White Paper for England "Our Countryside; Our Future" made a commitment to review the provisions of Part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 with a view to rationalising the identification and protection of rare and endangered species. This Department aims to consult on this in the near future.

The report concluded that the lower prices were the result of the structure of the UK dairy sector, the comparatively low value of the mix of dairy products in the UK and a low level of innovation. It also suggested a number of areas where the efficiency of the dairy supply chain could be improved.

<sup>(6)</sup> The figure for 2003&#150;04 represents the current total as at 29 October. It is significantly lower than previous years, in part because the figure is not for a complete year, but also because of the effects of the Thomsen ECJ judgment (which has meant that non-producing quota holders will no longer be able to lease out their quota indefinitely). Quota holders who are no longer in active milk production will, by 31 March 2004, have to sell their milk quota, resume production, or otherwise have their quota confiscated.<P>

<P>
<a name="31112w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The table gives the total amount of quota in the national reserve for each quota year from 1998&#150;99 to 2003&#150;04. The national reserve quota is divided between two 'pots'&#151;the confiscated reserve holding quota to which the right to restoration applies, and the remainder holding quota which is currently used in the Temporary Reallocation of Quota scheme (designed to help producers who exceed their quota due to herd movement restrictions). Where quota is confiscated, the quota holder from whom the quota is taken reserves the right to apply for the restoration of the confiscated quota within a certain period if production recommences on the holding. At present, the period in which quota can be restored is six years; however, this has been reduced to two years under the new EU Council Regulation which comes into force on 1 April 2004.

 We have made it clear that we would like to see the milk quota system abolished. It is a bureaucratic constraint on production, it distorts the market, and it adds to the industry's costs. It was, therefore, disappointing that the Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform extended the quota system to 2014/15.
<P>

<a name="31112w05.html_para11">We carried out a consultation exercise on proposed amendments to our national Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 2002 earlier this year. The proposals related to the possible introduction of two discretionary elements of the Council Regulation on milk quotas, breaking the link between quota and land and a 70 per cent. usage rule, and also some administrative changes. A summary of the responses we received is available on our website at www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/responses.htm. We intend to make an announcement shortly on how we will proceed.

 It is not possible to comment on the direct level of financial support available in other member states since the mix of land types and crops on which aid is based varies so greatly. The latest information we have on aid available elsewhere in the European Union however suggests that the recent increase in support payments being made available under the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS), which is part of the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) and which encourages the expansion of organic production, is generally comparable to what is available elsewhere in the Community.
<P>

<a name="31112w06.html_para0">Under the OFS, farmers moving from conventional to organic farming methods receive financial help during the conversion process. From 30 May, assistance is now also being made available under the scheme for existing organic farmers who comply with certain environmental measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The provisional results of the June 2003 survey of agriculture show that the UK pig herd had fallen to 5,039 thousand head. This is a 38 per cent. decline in the size of the UK pig herd since June 1998 (five years ago) when the UK pig herd was 8,146 thousand head. The future size of the pig herd will depend on the profitability of the sector. Profitability will be influenced by several factors, including exchange rates, the expansion of the EU and the ability of the industry to deal with diseases that are currently affecting sow productivity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Profitability in the pig sector typically fluctuates over time as market prices follow a cyclical path. Productivity and performance also vary considerably within the sector. Average profitability has generally been positive in 2003 largely due to weaker sterling and stronger prices. Raising the average level of performance across the industry will be key to sustaining industry profitability over the longer term. Estimates of 2003 net margins in the pig sector are found in the report 'Economic Position of the farming industry', published on the Defra Website at http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/repfi.pdf.

<a name="31112w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the principal source of legislation which offers protection for native wildife. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which came into force in January 2001, also introduced stronger enforcement powers for police officers investigating native species wildlife offences, and tougher penalties&#151;including prison sentences&#151;for people found guilty of committing offences under the 1981 Act.
<P>

<a name="31112w07.html_para0">Protection of wildlife often involves the protection of their habitat. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 introduced substantial improvements to the legislative regime protecting our nationally important designated areas for wildlife and geology, more commonly known as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).
<P>

<a name="31112w07.html_para1">The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 1994, implements the EC Habitats Directive in Great Britain, and provides further protection to various species and their habitats. The Government has consulted on a number of further improvements to the Habitat Regulations and on regulations to transpose the Habitats Directive to cover an area offshore. To date the Government has classified 242 Special Protection Areas under the EC Birds Directive and submitted 601 candidate Special Areas of Conservation to the European Commission under the EC Habitats Directive in the UK. Additionally 27 new Ramsar sites in the UK have been notified since 1999.
<P>

<a name="31112w07.html_para2">In addition to species protection through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Habitats Regulations 1994 this Government also puts great effort into supporting the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES). This regulates trade in endangered or vulnerable animals and plants, and products derived from them, to ensure that the trade is sustainable. For example, at last year's Conference of Parties in Chile, the UK successfully proposed the listing of basking sharks on Appendix II of the Convention, protecting them from unsustainable and unregulated international trade.
<P>

<a name="31112w07.html_para3">The Department, together with HM Customs and Excise and the police, rigorously enforces the UK's commitments under CITES, campaigns vigorously to increase public awareness of the CITES controls, and takes firm action against anyone caught illegally importing endangered species in breach of the European CITES Regulations.
<P>

<a name="31112w07.html_para4">The Government also launched the National Wildlife Crime Intelligence Unit in 2002.

<a name="31112w07.html_para7">Section 74 (3) of the Act requires the Secretary of State to take or promote the taking by others of steps to further the conservation of the habitats and species of principal importance in England. In October 2002 the Government published Working with the grain of nature&#151;a biodiversity strategy for England. The strategy aims to ensure that consideration of biodiversity is embedded into all relevant areas of public and private policy. It is the principal means by which we will comply with the duty under section 74 (3), including through continued implementation of the habitat and species action plans. The strategy can be viewed at http://defraweb/wildlife-countryside/ewd/biostrat/index.htm

We also support HIV/AIDS prevention and care, reproductive health care, malaria prevention, private sector development, public sector reform and initiatives to promote civic education and improved access to justice for poor people. In addition Britain contributes substantially through multilateral agencies, including over &#163;4 million towards EC budget support for Kenya provided in June 2003.

DFID has offered &#163;3 million towards UN security measures in response to an appeal following the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad in August.

 Working closely with other donors, and maintaining flexibility, are key ways in which we seek to maintain effectiveness in the current volatile political, social and economic environment. Lately the international development effort has moved towards shorter-term support for the immediate needs of the Palestinian people. According to World Bank analysis, direct budget support has proved to be the most effective aid instrument in the current circumstances, allowing the Palestinian Authority to maintain basic service delivery, while providing significant macro-economic benefits. The welfare impact of this support has been significant: as poverty and unemployment levels have risen, the extended coverage of public sector salaries has provided an essential safety net for many families and communities. Our support for service delivery through

In addition to this, the British Ambassador to Indonesia wrote to the Indonesian Government in August 2003 requesting that NGOs be granted permission to return to Aceh, and my right hon.

 Since 1998, the UK has been co-financing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Capacity Building Programme (CBP) with four other donors; two further donors have since joined the consortium. The Programme aims to build the capacity of HIPC countries to analyse and manage their debt position, and to negotiate debt relief with creditors and the International Financial Institutions. The CBP works with four regional organisations&#151;three based in Africa and one in Latin America. The Programme is now in its third phase. One of the main objectives of this phase is to turn these organisations into centres of excellence, so that they are able to provide lasting high quality training, advisory and advocacy support to their HIPC member states in key issues of debt management. DFID

has committed over &#163;4 million to the Project and, through its bilateral programmes, has also funded individual activities under the CBP, such as Debt Advisers for Guyana and Rwanda and strategy workshops in Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda. To date, 36 out of a total of 42 HIPC countries have benefited from the Programme.

 Ghana qualified for relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in February 2002, when it started to receive debt relief. Under the Initiative, countries qualify for relief in two stages. The first stage is Decision Point, when they start to receive interim relief on their "flow" of payments. During this interim period, countries such as Ghana are not required to service their debt and cease to make debt service payments. The second stage, Completion Point, is reached when HIPC governments have demonstrated progress in tackling poverty. At this final stage they receive an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt. HIPC countries spend the savings from debt relief on their poverty reduction programmes, thereby increasing resources for social expenditure. Ghana is expected to reach its Completion Point in mid 2004, provided its poverty reduction strategy is implemented satisfactorily.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment his Department has made of progress towards the Millennium Development Goal to halve the proportion of people in the world without safe access to water and sanitation by 2015; and what additional funds will be made available to water and sanitation projects to reach the Millennium Development Goal.

 The Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000, produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO)/United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)) Joint Monitoring Programme, provides baseline figures on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Among the main findings are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The percentage of people served with some form of improved water supply rose from 79 per cent. in 1990 to 82 per cent. in 2000. Over the same period the proportion of the world's population with access to sanitation facilities increased from 55 per cent. to 60 per cent.;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> At the beginning of 2000 one-sixth (1.1 billion people) of the world's population was without access to improved water supply and two fifths (2.4 billion people) lacked access to improved sanitation The majority of these people lived in Asia and Africa;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> Although an enormous number of people gained access to services between 1990 and 2000, with approximately 816 million additional people gaining access to water supplies and 747 million people gaining access to sanitation facilities, the percentage increases appear modest because of global population growth during that time;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(d)</i> The water supply and sanitation sector will face enormous challenges over the coming decades. The assessment estimates that, to achieve the 2015 target in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean alone, an additional 2.2 billion people will need access to sanitation and 1.5 billion will need access to water supply by that date.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="31112w10.html_para0">The Joint Monitoring Programme is continuing. DFID has provided substantial financial support and technical assistance to this initiative from the outset. The Government remains firmly committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDG targets for water and sanitation are central to DFID's approach to poverty reduction and sustainable development and they remain important priorities for DFID.

 We are addressing HIV/AIDS in Uganda through an HIV Umbrella Programme, which has an allocation of &#163;6.2 million for 2002&#150;2005. Our Programme's purpose is to improve the coordination and monitoring of the Uganda's Strategic HIV/AIDS Framework. This Framework is an important component of Uganda's overall Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), and aims to: monitor HIV prevalence; provide guidance for activities aimed at preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigating its effects; and help mobilise resources to implement national AIDS programmes. UK assistance also supports the Government of Uganda's improving its own capacity to take effective action against HIV/AIDS, plus service delivery and research on HIV/AIDS by civil society organisations.

 The majority of the world's poor are women. Women's empowerment and equality are central preconditions for sustainable poverty elimination.
<P>

<a name="31112w10.html_para3">The elimination of women's poverty, and the pursuit of gender equality in all areas of development, lie at the heart of DFID's work. The focus is on supporting changes in policy, laws and attitudes, while maintaining links with work at the grassroots. This combines specific activities aimed at empowering women with a commitment to put concerns about gender equality into the mainstream of development programmes. DFID supports action through three channels; support to government, civil society and the private sector; collaboration and coordination with international development organisations such as the United Nations; and through building capacity and information through research and knowledge development.

 During the inquiry into the implementation of the Byelaws at Lake Windermere, Sport England along with the British Water Ski Federation considered the issue of the displacement of motorised watersports from the Lake. Sport England and the British Water Ski Federation continue to work together with those affected by the Byelaws to negotiate access to suitable areas of water for the continuation of these sports.
<P>

<a name="31112w11.html_para5">The Government would not seek to impose specific alternative venues on those affected by the Navigation Byelaws on Lake Windermere. We believe it is for individuals to find convenient sites that will enable them to pursue water skiing and the other motorised water sports that will be affected by the Byelaws.

 It is already the Ministry of Defence policy to carry out environmental impact assessments of all new projects and training activities. To this end, the MOD commissioned some time ago from independent consultants an Environmental and Land Use Report on the planned upgrade of the RAF Fylingdales radar for missile defence purposes. This report was passed to the local planning authorities in June 2003 and can be accessed on the MOD website. It confirms our view that nothing in the package of work involves an environmental impact or change of use, and that radar emissions are well within health guidelines. Nevertheless, in order to reassure the public, monitoring of the radar emissions will continue and the data made available publicly. Separately, an epidemiological study is being undertaken by the local NHS Primary Care Trust to determine if there is any evidence of increased rates of disease in the area which might warrant further investigation.

 <i>[holding answer 3 November 2003]:</i> Implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance has already begun. Patients are already receiving photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment on the national health service and we expect the implementation of the NICE guidance to have been fully implemented by the middle of 2004. We will be working with the NHS to facilitate the implementation to give patients increased access to PDT during this time.

We have previously varied the direction on five occasions when it was required to implement effectively the guidance to provide the service to patients.
<P>

<a name="31112w13.html_para5">The extension was given because of concerns about the lack of capacity, for example, in reading centres, to implement the recommendations. Within the nine months allowed for full implementation, commissioners are expected to expand the service in a planned way to ensure there is sufficient capacity which is appropriately located to meet patient need, a fully trained workforce

<a name="31112w13.html_para6">The guidance issued to primary care trusts (PCTs) on PDT asks that PCTs should make funds available within nine months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what evaluation his Department has made of the long term effects of the EU Clinical Trial Directive on clinical research in the UK.  [132585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w15.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 October 2003]:</i> The European Directive on the conduct of clinical trials was adopted in February 2001. The main aim of the Directive is to simplify and harmonise procedures across the Community whilst ensuring the protection of trial subjects and providing a safe environment for the development of new medicines. Member states are required to implement the Directive fully by 1 May 2004.
<P>

<a name="31112w15.html_para0">The scope of the Directive is wide and the UK Regulations will apply to all clinical trials on medicinal products for human use conducted in the UK, including academic and healthy volunteer studies, with the exception of non-interventional trials.
<P>

<a name="31112w15.html_para1">The former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, invited the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Academy of Medical Sciences to co-ordinate a report on the impact of the Directive on academic studies. The impact assessment, prepared by the MRC with the active support of others including Cancer Research UK, the National Co-ordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment and a number of academic experts formed the basis for a response to the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) consultation on the draft regulations to implement the Directive into UK law earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="31112w15.html_para2">In responding to concerns, and to provide an environment in which patients are protected but high quality research is not inhibited, the Government have taken steps to attempt to influence the Commission in its consideration of a Commission Directive on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and also in reviewing guidance that the Commission published earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="31112w15.html_para3">In another initiative, the Department and the MRC have announced a joint project to work with experts to find practical solutions to the issues identified in the impact assessment. Details of the project can be found on www.ncchta.org/eudirective/index.asp.
<P>

<a name="31112w15.html_para4">With our careful exploration of the impact on publicly-funded research and organisations that support it and delays in the Commission finalising the GCP Directive and other guidance, the United Kingdom's implementing regulations are not expected to be made until early in 2004.

<a name="31112w15.html_para10">The Government is implementing a range of measures to recruit and retain more healthcare professionals, including health visitors. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the National Health Service to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, increasing training, investing in childcare and continuing professional development, attracting back returners and running national recruitment campaigns.

 The information is not available in the format requested. Bath and North East Somerset Primary Care Trust (PCT) did not come into existence until 2001&#150;02. Therefore, figures are provided for the Somerset Health Authority (HA) area for 1996&#150;97, and for the Bath and North East Somerset PCT area for 2002&#150;03. These figures are not, therefore, comparable.

Expenditure per head is normally expressed by weighted head of population, but this is not possible for 2002&#150;03, because weighted population data are not available for PCT areas. Therefore, in this case, resident population figures have been used.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In many HAs there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include: the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts. For these reasons, expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between HAs.<P>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs.<P>

3. Expenditure is taken from audited health HA accounts and PCT summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the Somerset HA for 1997 and the net operating commissioner costs of the Bath and North East Somerset PCT for 2002&#150;03. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in HA accounts or PCT summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by HAs or PCTs.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> In vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. It is provided by the national health service and by the private sector. In England, access to NHS infertility treatment varies according to location. Therefore, the Government has asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to prepare a guideline on the assessment and treatment of people with fertility problems. The guideline is due for publication in February 2004.

 The national tariff is adjusted to give a local tariff for each provider. This is done using a market forces factor (MFF). The MFF takes account of unavoidable differences across the country in the costs of staff, land and buildings. Other running costs are assumed not to vary. The MFF is not a regional adjustment, but is specific to each provider. A table listing the MFF adjustment for each provider has been placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what consultation he has had with <i>(a)</i> ophthalmologists in Buckinghamshire, <i>(b)</i> the Buckinghamshire Association for the Blind, <i>(c)</i> primary care trusts in Buckinghamshire and <i>(d)</i> the Buckinghamshire hospitals NHS Trust about his plans for a diagnostic and treatment centre for ophthalmology in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire;  [130808]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answers 18 September 2003]:</i> Local primary care trusts (PCTs) have met with ophthalmologists and they have been actively involved in refining the proposal for a treatment centre for cataract surgery in Buckinghamshire and will continue to be involved in further developing the plans. Buckinghamshire hospitals trust has also been involved and will continue to be. Links are also being developed with local groups including patient support groups and the PCTs will be looking to work with them as the treatment centre plans progress.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para1">Treatment centres in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire will provide more choice for patients and provide services closer to home. Existing local services are held in high regard and an important outcome for local hospitals will be the opportunity of developing further their specialist service and chronic disease management. Clinicians and managers at Buckinghamshire hospitals trusts are involved in these discussions.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para2">Discussions have taken place with Stoke Mandeville hospital to ensure that the viability and quality of the current service will not be adversely affected.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para3">The treatment centre will offer additional opportunities for care of patients by increasing capacity and bringing down wait times and are a service enhancement to the PCT population.




<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 2003 : Column 344W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para4">Treatment centres will be expected to be able to deal with typical surgical problems to at least the same standard as national health service providers. Local trusts, PCTs and new providers will agree protocols for referring and transferring patients who require emergency or urgent care that cannot be provided by the treatment centres.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para5">In autumn 2002, the NHS undertook a national capacity planning process led by local NHS commissioners. This identified a range of capacity gaps that needed to be met for the NHS to meet the waiting time target set for 2005. Where the NHS was not able to demonstrate robust plans to meet this demand the residual activity was included in the independent sector treatment centre programme.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para6">Advice and guidance has been made available to local NHS sponsors who are responsible for running an appropriate consultation with the patients and staff. I have been assured by the Thames Valley Strategic health authority that the treatment centre offers the opportunity to reduce waiting lists for cataract surgery further, with all the benefits that cataract surgery brings to the quality of life for older people. It also creates capacity in the ophthalmology departments of local trusts to enable more complex eye surgery to be carried out.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para7">The details of the scheme, together with a wider review of ophthalmology services generally, will be worked out locally with clinicians and other stakeholders. The specific issues raised in these questions will be managed locally as the NHS makes these new units a success.
<P>

<a name="31112w17.html_para8">Letters have been received at the SHA from ophthalmologists in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire outlining local concerns. These have been addressed in meetings with clinicians and managers.

<P>
<a name="31112w17.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 We have made no such estimates. It is for prescribers to determine the duration of prescriptions, based on their clinical assessment of patients and other relevant factors, including the minimisation of waste. We have not issued guidance on the duration of prescriptions. However, it is common practice for general practitioner prescriptions to be issued for one month or 28 days at a time.

<a name="31112w17.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999, &#163;105 million was recovered and paid to national health services hospitals in England and Wales and Scotland for treating those injured in road traffic accidents in 2002&#150;03. This amount is not the full cost of treating road traffic casualties. However, as costs are recovered only where the injured person receives personal injury compensation, it includes only hospital treatment costs, and the tariff system under which the scheme operates reflects average costs rather than actual costs.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 2003]:</i> The Government is aware of the difficulties in enforcing the existing age limit for smoking. We are not convinced that raising the minimum age to 18 or 21 will resolve the problem of teenage smoking. The key is to improve enforcement of existing legislation. The Department continues to work closely with representatives of Trading Standards and the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services to achieve this.

 Research conducted by the Department into the area in question consists of the Projections of Occupations and Qualifications 2000/2001 commissioned from the University of Warwick Institute for Employment Research and Cambridge Econometrics and covering estimates for the period 1999 to 2010. New projections have been commissioned by the Sector Skills Development Agency and will be published in early 2004.

 Our strategy for science, engineering and technology was set out in "Investing in Innovation" published in July 2002 in response to the recommendations made in Sir Gareth Roberts' report "SET for Success". Our response to Baroness Greenfield's report "SET Fair" outlines our strategy to tackle under-representation of women in science. Both of these included looking at the promotion of science careers. We are working closely with colleagues at the DTI and the Promoting SET for Women Unit to take forward the recommendations in those reports.
<P>

<a name="31112w19.html_para2">We believe that a good way of promoting science, including careers, in schools is by introducing current scientific developments into the classroom. As well as making science both exciting and relevant this will give young people an understanding of the role of science in society. We are working with a range of bodies, including professional bodies, to achieve this. We have consulted on the programme of study for science at Key Stage 4, following a review by the QCA. The new programme of study will set out a core for science, suitable for all learners, to increase flexibility of qualifications at Key Stage 4. From September 2003, a new science GCSE, "Science in the 21st Century" will be piloted in 50 schools. It aims to provide a sound and stimulating science education that will engage all students with contemporary science issues; and to increase the number of young people studying science subjects post-16. Connexions Personal Advisers provide independent advice to students on all careers, including scientific careers.
<P>

<a name="31112w19.html_para3">The Science and Engineering Ambassadors' scheme (SEAs) launched jointly by this Department and the DTI in January 2002, aims to show young people the links between what they learn at school and the world of work.

 The Charter for Higher Education was published in 1993 by the last Government and an addendum was produced in 1997. The document is now obsolete and no longer issued by the Department. Information about students' general entitlements and responsibilities while at university is best prepared at a local level, allowing it to be tailored to reflect the circumstances of the particular institution. Many universities do publish charter-type documents of their own and there are no plans to republish a central document. In addition, our proposals for improving student information mean that institutions will be publishing far more information than ever before about the quality and standards of their provision.

 Pay for support staff including teaching assistants is a matter for local determination: the government believes that this is the best way of ensuring a flexible system that can respond to local needs and circumstances.

 I can assure my hon. Friend that the &#163;3,000 fee cap will not be raised by more than the rate of inflation for the lifetime of the next Parliament.
<P>

<a name="31112w20.html_para4">The precise mechanism for raising the fee cap will be established under the proposed legislation. Under the current arrangements, the standard fee can be uprated for inflation by negative resolution of the House. However, it can only be increased by more than inflation by affirmative resolution, which would require a debate and vote in both Houses.

<a name="31112w20.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government have made a number of proposals to safeguard access to higher education for those from low income families. Such students will continue, as now, to have the cost of the standard tuition fee (&#163;1,125 in 2003/04) met by the Government. Around three in 10 students will also receive means tested Higher Education Grants of &#163;1,000 and, in addition, many students from lower income families will be eligible for partial fee remission and HE grant as well as bursaries and other support from universities under arrangements agreed by the Office of Fair Access.
<P>

<a name="31112w20.html_para6">Fees for English domiciled medical students in years five and six are currently paid by the Department of Health. These students also qualify for means tested NHS bursaries in their fifth and subsequent years of study. Department of Health Ministers have indicated that they will, if necessary, take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.

Repayments will then be made at a rate of 9 per cent. of income above &#163;15,000. Figures collected in March 2003 show that 73 per cent. of newly qualified medical graduates in hospital posts earn &#163;34,533 per annum.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed continuing settlement expansion with his EU counterparts at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg on 13 October. The European Council Declarations of 17 October called on Israel to reverse its settlement policy and dismantle settlement outposts.
<P>

<a name="31112w22.html_para3">We fully support the roadmap's requirement that Israel should immediately freeze all settlement activity, including "natural growth" and dismantle the outposts erected since March 2001. The continuing expansion of settlements in the Occupied Territories threatens the basis for a viable Palestinian state and makes a negotiated settlement more difficult to reach.

<P>

<a name="31112w22.html_para4">Regions of Knowledge is a pilot initiative of the European Parliament which is being administered by the Commission. It invited regional consortia to bid for funds, and consequently it was not appropriate for Her Majesty's Government to apply directly. We are aware that several bids including UK participants were prepared, but those submitted are currently confidential.
<P>

<a name="31112w22.html_para5">Science research and innovation are key drivers of regional development. The potential value added of this initiative is considerable in comparison to the modest Euro2.5 million funding proposed.

 We are concerned about reports of discrimination against religious minorities (including Christians) in Sri Lanka and regularly raise this, and other human rights issues, with the Sri Lankan Government. Our High Commission monitors the situation closely, and is in regular contact with religious leaders. The right to freedom of religion is enshrined in the Sri Lankan Constitution, and there are dedicated ministries for Christian as well as Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim affairs.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had discussions with both Indian Foreign Minister Sinha and Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri in the last week. Both the Foreign Secretary and I met Foreign Minister Kasuri on 4 November in London during which we discussed the measures proposed by India and Pakistan to further improve relations between the two countries. He urged both sides to implement quickly the steps on which they agreed and work together to close the gap on those where there is less common ground. In particular, he urged both governments to find a way forward on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route, a proposal that was welcomed by Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control. The Foreign Secretary also encouraged both governments to continue to work together towards normalising their relations and resolving their differences, including over Kashmir.

The teams will comprise staff from the police, National Crime Squad, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, National Criminal Intelligence Service, Crown Prosecution Service, Assets Recovery Agency and Inland Revenue. The balance of the Fund will be spent on asset recovery projects managed respectively by the Crown Prosecution Service, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and the Assets Recovery Agency.

[132519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w26.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Detective Sergeant Doherty became aware that questions in the House had been asked shortly after they had been tabled. As the family liaison officer he spoke to Private Green's wife and his mother, to inform them that these matters were of interest to hon. Members.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what rank of officer was responsible for liaison with the family of Private Anthony Green following the fatal shooting on 24 January 2001; what the reasons were for the cancellation of the meeting with the mother of the deceased arranged for 24 September; what measures are planned to compensate Mrs. Green financially for the costs incurred in taking off time from work and arranging travel to Northern Ireland; and if he will ensure that arrangements are made for a new appointment.  [132521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w26.html_spnew8"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Detective Sergeant Doherty was the deputy senior investigation officer in this case and also acted in the role of family liaison officer updating the family on a regular basis. On 12 September 2003 the police were contacted by the Northern Echo newspaper and asked to respond to what appeared to be a complaint that police had failed to fully investigate her son's death. It was decided to postpone the meeting until it was clear what the precise nature of the allegations were. The meeting with Private Anthony Green's mother was postponed on 22 September, through her solicitors who undertook to inform their client.
<P>

<a name="31112w26.html_para1">I am advised by the Chief Constable of the PSNI that no request for a further meeting has been received, and that the police are available to discuss any outstanding matters of concern with the family. I understand that they have been in touch with Mrs. Green's solicitors in October with a view to arranging a meeting. The matter of compensation has not previously been raised by Mrs. Green or her solicitors but will certainly be

<P>
<a name="31112w27.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The policy on smoking in public houses in Northern Ireland is driven by the Public Places Charter, launched by the Federation of the Retail Licensed Trade in October 2000. To date, over 700 licensed premises have signed up to the Charter which aims to encourage venues to improve provision for non-smokers as well as overall air quality. Potential customers are able to make informed choice by identifying the smoking policies in public houses and restaurants through appropriate signage.
<P>

<a name="31112w27.html_para0">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety published a five year Tobacco Action Plan in July 2003. The Plan identifies 24 separate action points which are being taken forward by an Implementation Group. These include actions to promote the provision of smoke-free public places.

 Junk e-mail or spam is a nuisance to all internet users and may slow down and impair the efficiency of networks. There will be new regulatory controls here on the sending of unsolicited direct marketing e-mail under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which come into force on 11 December. The UK is also active in international discussions on how to tackle the problem of cross border spam, both in fora like the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and bilaterally with the US and other national governments (in October this year, for instance, Andrew Finder, the E-Envoy, took part in a visit to Washington to talk to US legislators and officials about spam issues).

<i>[holding answer 29 October 2003]:</i> Legal aid payments are made by the Legal Services Commission, and for criminal legal aid in the higher courts, by the Court Service. Information about such payments will include work done outside the area and will also include payments to practitioners based outside the area. It is therefore not possible readily to identify separately payments relating to work done within a particular region. The figures given for the East Midlands are therefore estimates based on payments processed by the relevant Legal Services Commission Area Office and Court Service Office.

 The performance of the Merseyside Magistrates Courts (MCCs) in the collection of fines has not been satisfactory.

 Detailed sick absence statistics are derived from medical and self-certificates, which are completed by staff or their GPs. While certain illnesses, such as "depression", "anxiety", "general debility" and even "stress" may be indicated on certificates, it is not possible to determine levels of "work-related stress". Consequently, we have no details on the number of working days lost due to work-related stress or the cost to the Department.
<P>

<a name="31112w28.html_para1">However, we know from recent staff opinion surveys that undue stress at work is a problem for some staff.

It was necessary to use data from three years of the Survey of English Housing because the number of households statutorily overcrowded is so small, just over 0.1 per cent., that it would not have been possible to derive an estimate using data for a single year. Even combining years the estimate remains very tentative, and for this reason it is not possible to provide a regional breakdown.

 Working families and disabled person's tax credit awards were fixed for 26 weeks, based on a snapshot of income and circumstances around the time of claim, and were not amended to reflect changes in the recipients' circumstances or incomes during this period. Provided the award was based on accurate information, overpayments did not arise. Children's tax credit is not a payment; it is a tax allowance which reduces a taxpayer's overall tax liability for the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31112w30.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 During the tax year, a tax credit award can be amended to reflect changes in claimants' circumstances or because an overpayment is likely to arise at the end of the year. This may mean that payments are reduced or that no further payments are made because too much has been paid out already. To make sure that payments are not reduced to a level that would cause hardship, however, the Inland Revenue makes additional payments if that would be the case.
<P>

<a name="31112w30.html_para8">Overpayments of tax credit are identified when tax credit entitlement is finalised after the end of that year. In addition, overpayments can be identified when, as part of their compliance activities, the Inland Revenue terminate a tax credits award because the claimant had never in fact been entitled to tax credit. In these cases, the overpayment may be recovered as soon as the award is terminated. Around 700 requests for payment in such cases had been made by the end of October, including around 100 to families in Scotland.
