 There are no plans to amend procurement legislation. The Equality Bill contains a Regulation making power to introduce specific duties via secondary legislation, which will require contracting authorities to use public procurement to promote equality wherever possible. The specific duties will be formulated in a way that is compatible with procurement legislation, so there should be no need to amend either the Public Contract Regulations 2006, or the Utilities Contract Regulations 2006.</p>

They are required to follow up all reports of mistreatment whether they come from the individual themselves, from their friends, family or representatives, or from other sources. What form this follow up action will take will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Most obviously, we can raise our concerns with the relevant authorities.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has been following events closely but the full economic and social impacts will not be known for some time. Therefore making an assessment of the impact of the crisis on the millennium development goals (MDGs) is extremely difficult and indicative at best. Based on revised growth forecasts, we estimate that up to 90 million more people will be living in extreme poverty by 2010 as a result of the crisis than previously anticipated. This is expected to delay the achievement of MDG1&#151;eradicate extreme poverty and hunger&#151;by up to three years. Other goals, such as increased educational enrolment and reduced child mortality, are also likely to be affected due to falling household incomes, but the severity of such effects depend on government policy in the particular developing country.</p>

 Human rights principles underpin the UK Government's aid to developing countries. The policy of the Department for International Development (DFID) is to consider a country's human rights record when deciding whether to provide bi-lateral aid. DFID assesses a country's human rights record in its three yearly 'Country Governance Analysis'. This provides an analysis of the human rights situation in each country and is used in developing the Country Plan and the Development Partnership Agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="91012w0018.htm_para8"><a name="0910137000322">This approach is reinforced by the Conditionality Policy, which bases UK aid partnerships on shared commitments to respect human rights, to poverty reduction and to good financial management. Where a country government do not share these commitments, UK aid can still be provided to poor people through other routes such as multi-lateral agencies and civil society. Where a partner government have breached their commitment to human rights, UK aid to the government may be suspended, as it was in Kenya and Pakistan in 2007-08.</p>

We remain concerned about high malnutrition levels among sections of the IDP population, the lack of freedom of movement and the restrictions put on activities such as registration of the population and the reunification of families. Recent flooding in the camps following heavy rain highlights the importance of safely returning as many people as possible to their homes before the monsoon season.

Since September 2008, the Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated &#163;12.5 million of humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka.

 There are significant advantages to issue on the street in appropriate circumstances: officers do not need to return to the police station in order to process the matter and they are able to return to patrol much more quickly, resulting in efficiency savings and a better service to the public. In 2007, 115,939 PNDs were issued in a police station and 91,605 on the street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="91012w0019.htm_para0"><a name="0910139000101">The operational guidance to the police sets out the criteria which should be considered by officers in deciding where to issue a PND. For example, a ticket must not be issued to a suspect who is drunk, which means that issue will take place in a police station once the individual has sobered up.</p>

Neither of these figures is broken down by resident type, and so will include residents who are on bail or serving a community sentence.

 Ministers and senior officials hold regular reviews with departmental leads to ensure that the policy is being implemented consistently in all probation areas. Community Payback was launched in November 2005 to promote public awareness and confidence in the unpaid work community sentence. To increase visibility, distinctive clothing in the form of orange high visibility jackets has been required to be worn by offenders on most work sites, which are in view of the public, since December 2008. The use of distinctive clothing has been monitored. During the quarter April to June 2009 over one million hours of Community Payback were undertaken by offenders wearing distinctive clothing. If the hon. Member has specific concerns I would be glad to hear from him.</p>

Offenders sentenced to Community Payback (unpaid work) during this period had a 25.8 per cent. rate of reoffending. This is the lowest rate of reoffending of the top five commonly used community orders, though it may only reflect the characteristics of offenders sentenced to Community Payback rather than simply the effectiveness of Community Payback in reducing the likelihood of reoffending.</p>

The GPC is a credit card operated by Barclays bank designed to limit transaction processing costs for low value, ad-hoc expenses. Expense claim records and log books detailing expenditure on the GPC card are held locally across the organisation, including by courts and prisons across the country.

 In accordance with the legislation which governs the release of prisoners, no prisoner serving a determinate sentence is required to serve the entire sentence in prison. Successive legislation on this, since 1967, has maintained the approach that prisoners should serve a proportion of their sentence in custody and the rest in the community, often subject to licence conditions on release. This approach is vital for the purposes of safely reintegrating prisoners back into the community and to reduce the risk of further offending. If prisoners were to serve their whole sentence in prison they would have to be released without any supervision or restrictions, which would put the public at risk.</p>

 Escapes involve a prisoner absenting himself from prison custody without lawful authority by overcoming a physical security restraint such as that provided by fences, locks, bolts and bars, a secure vehicle or handcuffs. Absconds occur where a prisoner absents himself or herself from prison custody without lawful authority and without overcoming physical security barriers or restraints, conditions typically found in open prisons.

2004. Data are not available centrally prior to this period and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="91012w0026.htm_para8"><a name="0910139001389">All those located in open conditions have been risk assessed and categorised as being of low risk to the public. Time spent in open prisons affords prisoners the opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties, reintegrate into the community and ensure housing needs are met. For long-term prisoners these are essential components for successful resettlement and an important factor in protecting the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="91012w0026.htm_para9"><a name="0910139001390">Prisons can and do take a variety of actions to try and reduce absconds. Open prisons operate intelligence systems to try and spot those who might be planning to abscond; prisoners are screened and those who are at significant risk of absconding are sent back to closed conditions; in many areas the prison, police and CPS are working together to maximise the prosecution of absconders to provide a deterrent to others who may be thinking of doing the same.</p>

 Control and restraint (C&amp;R) is a system of techniques used within both prisons and young offender institutions in order to bring a violent or non-compliant prisoner under control. C&amp;R is only applied in circumstances where it is necessary to do so and any force used is applied for as short a time as possible and only in proportion to the violence shown by the prisoner. Staff are instructed to avoid use of force wherever possible and instead to use persuasion or negotiation to end such incidents, however, this is not always possible.</p>

 Prisons in England and Wales are asked to send mobile phones and SIM cards they find to a central unit for analysis. In the last 12 months (from July 2008-June 2009), 8,648 mobile phones and SIM cards were analysed. 255 were from the high security estate and 8,393 were from the non-high security estate. These figures include items discovered within prison perimeters and on entry to establishments. We do not keep central records of mobile phones found in the possession of prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="91012w0031.htm_para4"><a name="0910139004800">We believe that these figures may understate the actual number of finds, because they do not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes, and because in some instances prisons have not sent items for analysis. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to ensure that we have a more comprehensive picture in future. While the numbers of phones found indicates the scale of the challenge in tackling illicit mobile phones, it is also a reflection of prisons&#146; increasing success in finding them and better reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="91012w0031.htm_para5"><a name="0910139004801">NOMS is implementing a strategy to minimise the number of phones entering prisons, and to find or disrupt those that do enter. As part of the strategy, prisons have been provided with technologies to strengthen local security and searching strategies, in line with the recommendations in the Blakey report, &#147;Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons&#148;, published in July 2008. This includes the roll out of &#147;BOSS&#148; chairs to all prisons, and the deployment of other detection and disruption technologies, including mobile phone signal blockers.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the cost to his Department was of <i> (a)</i> all mandatory drug testing in prisons in England and Wales in 2008-09 and <i> (b) </i>one mandatory drug test of an individual prisoner on the latest date for which figures are available. [290290]</p>

 Many staff responsible for the mandatory drug testing (MDT) process do not work exclusively on the testing of prisoners. The cost of MDT staff resources cannot be disaggregated from the overall prison running costs.</p>

 Information on the street value of drugs used illegally in prisons is not routinely available. Covert activity such as drug taking, by its nature, is very difficult to quantify. A report published in 2001 by the Home Office titled &#145;Sizing the UK market for illicit drugs&#146; focused on a few specific drugs and estimated the value of the drugs trade in prisons as worth up to &#163;24 million. Since that report, the level of drug misuse evidenced by the random drug testing positive rate has fallen by 36 per cent.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not stipulate energy efficiency standards for circulator pumps. However, in existing Prison Service buildings, it is recommended that variable speed pump motors are fitted where it is practical to do so and where savings can be made within a suitable payback period.</p>

 The core regional structure has been developed to deliver offender management at regional level.

We have been recruiting existing staff into the new posts via a job matching process; ring-fenced competition; and internal competition. An external recruitment process has been undertaken for a small number of specialist posts where no suitable internal candidates were found. Surpluses arising from the exercise are being managed robustly via the redeployment strategy. The overall staffing figure in the pre-existing Area and ROM offices prior to restructure was 576. On completion of the restructure, staffing in regional offices will be reduced by a total of 180 at an eventual saving of approximately &#163;10 million.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many times restraint has been used on a child in <i> (a)</i> secure children's homes, <i> (b)</i> secure training centres and <i> (c)</i> young offender institutions for the purposes of (i) preventing a criminal offence, (ii) preventing injury, (iii) preventing damage to property and (iv) maintaining good order and discipline in each month of the last three years.

 Physical restraint is only ever to be used by staff in the under-18 secure estate as a last resort, when all other approaches have either not succeeded or would not be appropriate.</p>

They relate to use of restraint in secure training centres.</p>

The categories in the table relate to the purposes for which restraint was permitted under Rule 38(1) of the Secure Training Centre Rules 1998 during all or part of the period in question. Those purposes are: to prevent a trainee from escaping from custody; to prevent a trainee from injuring himself or others; to prevent damage to property; to prevent a trainee from inciting another trainee to cause injury or damage property; and to ensure good order and discipline. Prevention of a criminal offence is not, in itself, a purpose for which restraint is or was authorised under Rule 38(1). Ensuring good order and discipline ceased, at the end of July 2008, to be an approved purpose for using restraint.</p>

This encompasses a wide spectrum of Prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. Most self harm is not directly life threatening, but nevertheless can be extremely distressing for those who have to deal with it. A prisoner focused care planning system for those at risk, ACCT, has helped prisons manage self harm. There are no easy answers to managing self-harming behaviour but we remain committed to finding ways to reduce it.</p>

 It is assumed the hon. Member is asking about Sharia councils. Sharia councils do not describe themselves as Sharia &#145;courts&#146; because they do not have powers to enforce their decisions. Sharia councils are not part of the court system in England and Wales. There are a number of Sharia councils in England and Wales that, on a private basis, when the parties consent, apply Sharia principles to reach resolution of personal and contractual disputes. Some councils have several branches in major cities but councils are not unified under one system governing their approach to issues or their administration so their processes and even their interpretation of Sharia principles may differ.</p>

 It is not appropriate to use the term &#145;illiterate&#146; to describe primary school pupils who are still learning. Primary school standards have never been higher. In 2009 92 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved level 3 or above in reading, and 94 per cent. in writing. This means they can read a range of texts accurately and independently and their writing is organised, legible and clear. Many of those working below test level at age 11 will have a range of learning difficulties.

 All organisations using ContactPoint must complete organisational accreditation before their staff can be granted access to ContactPoint.

If unusual activity by users within a local authority area or a national partner organisation were to be detected by regular auditing, or was suspected or reported, the local authority or national partner ContactPoint Management Team must suspend the user account, notify the user&#146;s manager and carry out an immediate investigation using local policies and procedures.</p>

No one has been disciplined for misuse of data, however, through DCSF auditing, we have identified five instances where correct procedures were not followed by ContactPoint users. Typically, these were users who searched for records, for example, those of family members, in order to &#145;test&#146; the system, in what they believed was a &#145;safe&#146; way, before undertaking work such as apply shields to records that need them. All cases were immediately investigated and appropriate action has been taken. One of these five instances resulted in an individual being disciplined. The incident, although inappropriate, did not lead to ContactPoint data being compromised and there is no evidence that any of these instances indicated malicious intent, posed any risk to the security of children&#146;s records or constituted misuse of data on ContactPoint.</p>

</ul><a name="91012w0043.htm_brev2"><a name="09101322004957"><ul><p class="tabletext">The figures for each period are taken from a snapshot of data at the end of each financial year. These data only include providers that were active at this point. Additionally, the figures only count the most recent inspection outcome for each provision at the time of the snapshot, provided their inspection reports had been published or quality assured and not withdrawn from publication.</p>
</ul><a name="91012w0043.htm_brev3"><a name="09101322004958"><ul><p class="tabletext">Please note that the inspection judgements requested cover three inspection cycles. Those inspections carried out in the inspection cycle from April 2003 to end-March 2005 inspected the quality of provision against the National Standards for under-eights and were graded on a three point scale. Those from April 2005 to end-August 2008 were also inspected against the National Standards, but graded on the four point scale outlined in the question. It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a three-to a four-point scale. Care should be taken when interpreting data for &#145;childcare on domestic premises&#146; as the numbers are so small.</p>
</ul><a name="91012w0043.htm_brev4"><a name="09101322004959"><ul><p class="tabletext">There was a further change of inspection framework following the introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in September 2008. At this point, Ofsted also changed the way in which we record day-care provision, categorising providers as childcare on domestic and non-domestic premises. These categories broadly relate to the previous category of group day-care provision. The data for September 2008 to March 2009 are presented separately and, as above, it is not possible to operate a simple read-across between inspection frameworks.</p>
</ul><a name="91012w0043.htm_brev5"><a name="09101322004960"><ul><p class="tabletext">Please note that the selection of provision for inspection each year is not random, so care needs to be taken when using the data.</p>

There are now two registers: the Early Years Register (EYR) and the Childcare Register. The Childcare Register is subdivided into two parts, the compulsory part (CCR) and the voluntary part (VCR). Childcare providers may be registered on any combination of the EYR, CCR and VCR, depending on the age of the children in their care and the type of care offered. Those providers who care for children from birth to the 31 August following their fifth birthday must register on the EYR, unless they are in a category that is exempt from registration. Providers who care for older children who are under eight must be registered on the CCR. Other childcare providers, for example those caring for children over the age of eight, or caring for a child in the child&#146;s own home, are not required to register with Ofsted, but may join the VCR.</p>
</ul><a name="91012w0044.htm_brev3"><a name="09101322004965"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ofsted only sets the maximum number of places for childcare provision registered on the EYR and the CCR. Numbers of registered places therefore indicate the maximum number of children aged under eight that may be present at any one time. The figures are not the number of places occupied, nor the number of children who may benefit from receiving places through providers offering sessions at different times of the day.</p>
</ul><a name="91012w0044.htm_brev4"><a name="09101322004966"><ul><p class="tabletext">The maximum number of places figures as at 31 March 2009 were calculated by combining the maximum number of places recorded individually for both the Early Years Register (EYR) and the compulsory part of the Childcare Register (CCR) for each provider. As explained when Ofsted published the March 2009 figures, there is a strong possibility that these figures may be higher than the true overall maximum number of places, due to the duplication of places on both registers for some providers. Ofsted omitted the maximum numbers of childcare places as at 30 June 2009 from the figures published in July 2009, explaining that work was underway to improve the quality of these data. Ofsted will publish the maximum number of childcare places in the next childcare providers and places statistical release in October 2009, and in my Annual Report 2008/09, which will be published in November 2009.</p>

 Local authorities do not retain unspent allocation of the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG). The Department claws back any unspent allocation of revenue following receipt of audited statements of expenditure. The Department also does this for capital allocations but offers carry-forward of unspent capital each year until the end of March 2011 (2010-11 financial year).</p>

The grant structure is detailed in the Memorandum of Grant which was sent to local authorities&#146; chief executives and directors of children&#146;s services on 19 February 2009.</p>

 Funding for the national roll out of the Primary Capital Programme commenced in April 2009. It follows that very few of the projects to be funded wholly or partly through the programme have actually commenced on site at this stage. I am pleased to confirm, however, that North Yorkshire's county council's Primary Strategy for Change has been approved and funding of &#163;11.97 million to support local delivery over the two year period 2009-11 has been duly confirmed. Decisions about the prioritisation of individual projects are rightly matters for local determination. My officials have been advised following inquiries made to officers at North Yorkshire that building work is expected to commence shortly at the following schools:</p>

 On 15 July, we announced that we would make up to &#163;200 million available for authorities which are experiencing and forecasting exceptionally high rates of growth in demand for reception places to 2011, to support the provision of permanent places where there is greatest need. Our guidance on this funding includes that authorities which do not have high growth in reception class demand overall, may still apply where they have areas within their borders where there is high growth. We would, however, expect authorities which have high levels of surplus places to justify why these cannot be used to accommodate the additional children.</p>

They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_686"><a name="91012w0054.htm_para1"><a name="09101322003426">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>

1. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the ROI form collected by the CLG to the Section 52 form from the DCSF. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the R01 form previously.<br>
3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years.<br>
4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DCSF Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
5. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
6. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br>
7. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and cash terms figures.<br>

 The Consultation on Coastal Change Policy was launched alongside the pathfinder competition on 15 June 2009. It included a number of criteria against which bids from local authorities interested in becoming pathfinders will be assessed. The number of pathfinders that are created will depend on the nature of the bids received and how well they meet the published criteria.</p>

These are now being assessed against the published criteria and I expect to announce the selected pathfinders later in the autumn.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 September 2009]:</i> Mushroom composting operations which produce compost for sale are regulated under the local authority pollution control regime. It is intended shortly to extend this form of regulation to all mushroom composting operations. A key focus of such regulation is on the control of odour emissions, which can be particularly offensive. No assessment has been made of the effect of the odour emission on public health.</p>

The CEFAS performance related pay (PRP) scheme has varied in recent years. It comprises a &#147;corporate performance pay&#148; element payable to eligible staff as well as an &#147;individual performance related pay&#148; (iPRP) element for a smaller proportion of staff. In 2008-09 the weighting of the iPRP element was increased while the corporate pay element decreased. The table shows total costs charged, including CEFAS NI contributions, for both the corporate and iPRP elements. A summary of the 2008-09 scheme allows for:<br>
A Corporate performance element for eligible staff (as per total staff) of 2.2 per cent. of salary, explicitly linked to achievement of agreed agency targets. A further corporate performance &#147;growth&#148; element for all eligible staff of up to 1.3 per cent. of salary could be awarded, this must be self-funded and is explicitly linked to generation of additional income from sources other than DEFRA.<br>
An iPRP element awarded at two levels, 4 per cent. or 8 per cent., for approximately 25 per cent. and 15 per cent. of staff respectively.<br>

 We will not defer making regulations to implement the review of waste exemptions from environmental permitting. We propose to lay regulations to come into force in April 2010 that will provide new and amended waste exemptions from the need for an environmental permit for a range of waste operations that pose a low environmental risk. Exemptions provide 'lighter touch' regulation and will encourage more businesses to take up waste recycling and recovery. At the same time, we will limit the extent of the exemptions for some higher risk waste operations that will in the future be subject to increased controls through an environmental permit.</p>

We are also proposing a three and a half year transitional period for existing metal recycling operators to obtain a permit where they will no longer benefit from an exemption.</p>

 In April 2008 responsibility for dealing with stray dogs was removed from the police who had shared this role with local authorities.

 We will not defer making regulations to implement the review of waste exemptions from environmental permitting. We propose to lay regulations to come into force in April 2010 that will provide new and amended waste exemptions from the need for an environmental permit for a range of waste operations that pose a low environmental risk. Exemptions provide 'lighter touch' regulation and will encourage more businesses to take up waste recycling and recovery. At the same time, we will limit the extent of the exemptions for some higher risk waste operations that will in the future be subject to increased controls through an environmental permit.</p>

 In April 2008, the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2007 came into force. The regulations replaced and brought together the previous waste management licensing and Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) systems under one environmental permitting regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_857"><a name="91012w0069.htm_para2"><a name="09101346001985">A consequence of this regulatory change is that local authorities now require the consent of the Secretary of State before instituting proceedings for statutory nuisances such as odour, noise, smoke, dust, artificial light and accumulations from a waste operation (i.e. a site regulated by the Environment Agency under an environmental permit or requiring registration as an exempt waste operation). Prior to April 2008, the Secretary of State&#146;s consent was only required in respect of the PPC regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_858"><a name="91012w0069.htm_para3"><a name="09101346001986">The changes to the statutory nuisance provisions were made to avoid an operator being subject to &#145;double jeopardy&#146;; i.e. to ensure a local authority may not begin summary proceedings against an operator for nuisance, where proceedings can be brought by the Environment Agency under the Environmental Permitting Regulations. DEFRA officials are currently working with relevant stakeholders (i.e. the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) and the Environment Agency) on the provision of future supplementary guidance on the factors to be taken into consideration in dealing with applications for the Secretary of State&#146;s consent.</p>

 To date, 27 Interim Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service (RPTS) since the legislation came into effect in April 2006.

We always intended that the legislation should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. We want to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 September 2009]:</i> The provision of emergency fire cover during local and national strikes is the statutory responsibility of fire and rescue authorities. Past experience has shown that fire and rescue authorities utilise a range of personnel to provide emergency fire cover, including officers and whole time duty system firefighters who are not in the union which is in dispute. In London, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority have entered into a contract with AssetCo plc, for the provision of an Emergency Fire Crew Capability Service to the London Fire Brigade.</p>

Staff employed in the London Regional Control Centre are eligible for the medal as they continue to be employed by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. Staff in the other Regional Control Centres, which are controlled by local authority owned companies, will not be in Fire Brigade employment and will therefore not be eligible for the medal under the terms of the Royal Warrant.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government if he will place in the Library a copy of the data on rateable values used as the basis for the statement in his Department's press releases of 8 July 2009, Government consults on help with business rate bills, that as a result of revaluation and the relief arrangements one million businesses will see an average decrease of &#163;770 in 2010-11. [289913]</p>

 The 2010 business rates revaluation will reduce the rates bill for 1,028,500 properties. In total their rates bill will fall by &#163;787,660,000 in 2010-11 after transitional relief but before inflation. That is an average, after rounding, of &#163;770 per property. These figures are based on the same ratings list as used for the consultation document &#147;The Transitional Arrangements for the Non-domestic Rating Revaluation 2010 in England&#148; published on 8 July 2009. The ratings list is a live database and is continually being updated (to reflect appeals, deletions, additions, physical alterations, splits and mergers).</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government how much of the costs to Government of the Non-Domestic Rating (Deferred Payments) (England) Regulations 2009, referred to in the impact assessment for those Regulations are attributable to <i> (a)</i> bad debt and <i> (b)</i> the value of the discounted repayments being less than the value of the deferred amount.

 The Impact Assessment to accompany the Non-Domestic Rating (Deferred Payments) (England) Regulations estimated that between 50 per cent. and 90 per cent. of businesses will choose to defer the increase in their rates bill in 2009-10; and the percentage of revenue that could be written off as bad debt could be between 1 per cent. and 5 per cent. of the total amount deferred. On this basis, the amount of bad debt is estimated to be between &#163;2 million and &#163;20 million in both 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_918"><a name="91012w0080.htm_para0"><a name="09101346004303">Using the standard discount rate of 3.5 per cent. and assuming between 50 per cent. and 90 per cent. of businesses take up the option to defer the increase in business rates in 2009-10 and that between 1 per cent. and 5 per cent. of payments will be written off as bad debt, the final net present value of the deferral scheme to Government is estimated at between &#163;20 million and &#163;80 million. The rationale behind the standard discount rate can be found in Annex 6 of HM Treasury's Green Book.</p>

 The cost of a scrappage scheme would vary depending on the design, for example what age of bus it would apply to and the size of the incentive, as well as the market response to the scheme. Rather than introduce a scrappage scheme, we have announced a fund to support the purchase of new low carbon buses. The Green Bus Fund will provide government funding of &#163;30 million over the next two years and is expected to lead to the introduction and operation of several hundred new low carbon buses in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_969"><a name="91012w0084.htm_para6"><a name="09101362000175">In June 2008, Cycling England announced Greater Bristol as the England's first official Cycling City, together with a further 11 Cycling Towns across England. The new city and towns, together with the original six, will benefit from a share of &#163;50 million of departmental funding (match funded by the local authority) to pioneer innovative ways to increase cycling in their areas.</p>

The average annual distance travelled was 28,500 miles for rigid vehicles, and 73,000 miles for articulated vehicles. Within these averages, however, data from road freight surveys suggest there is significant variation with vehicle age, with newer vehicles in general having higher annual mileages than older ones. Consequently the contribution of vehicles at lower Euro standards to total mileage will be lower than the fleet proportions alone would suggest.</p>

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Transport what recent assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the MOT test in identifying vehicles which may be dangerous due to blacking out or tinting of windows. [291634]</p>

 The MOT test does not include a check of the level of light transmittance through tinted vehicle windows. To include this item in the MOT test would require all 19,000 MOT test stations to incur expenditure on special test equipment. This could involve a cost of around &#163;10 million and there would be additional costs associated with calibrating and maintaining the equipment. Given that relatively few vehicles appear to have excessively tinted front windows we consider that the issue is best addressed through enforcement at the roadside.</p>

 The Civil Service West Midlands Pilot (CSWM) is a programme of work aimed at improving the culture, identity and brand of the civil service. Answerable through a cross-departmental board to permanent secretaries, it seeks to improve the visibility and attractiveness of the civil service to people from all backgrounds, and allow staff to develop their careers locally rather than having to move to London.</p>

Organisations will open their vacancies to members of the public if the internal process fails to yield a suitable candidate. Also, if Departments are conducting a larger scale recruitment campaign indicating a need to go simultaneously to the wider market, this will be done.</p>

 The requirements of vehicles for Afghanistan are primarily determined by the specific task the vehicle is to carry out and the threat it is expected to face. This means we need to find the right balance between capability, survivability, mobility and the physical protection that operational commanders demand. I cannot comment on the specific types and levels of protection, as disclosure could prejudice the security of the armed forces.</p>

 Age related criteria for the resettlement grant only apply to those service leavers who are members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) 75 and there are no plans to review this at present. Under AFPS 75 there is a time served eligibility criterion of nine years from the age of 21 and for other ranks 12 years service from the age of 18. If these criteria are satisfied payment is made as soon after a discharge date as possible. No application for a resettlement grant is required, although a form is completed to confirm where payment is to be made. As a consequence none have been declined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1069"><a name="91012w0095.htm_para3"><a name="09101367002005">Reckonable service for other ranks was deemed to be from the date of joining or the age of 18 whichever is the latest. Historically, those who joined the armed forces under the age of 18 were boy soldiers, sailors, airmen or apprentices. They had rights to discharge prior to their 18th birthday different to those who were older. Conversion to reckonable service took place automatically for those that were serving on their 18th birthday. For officers, reckonable service commenced from age 21 to reflect the career pattern of those that normally joined after university. Like other ranks, officers who joined under the age of 21 had different conditions of service which automatically transferred to reckonable service on reaching their 21st birthday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1070"><a name="91012w0095.htm_para4"><a name="09101367002006">Following the introduction of Armed Forces Pension Scheme 05 on 6 April 2005, service personnel were given the option to transfer from AFPS 75 to the new scheme. For those that did and all new joiners to the armed forces, regardless of age, reckonable service commences from the date of joining. The time served criteria for resettlement grant of 12 years now applies to both groups and is widely accepted to be much fairer.</p>

In the majority of cases a positive CDT result will lead to an immediate administrative discharge. In very exceptional circumstances service personnel may be retained if their drug use is considered to be uncharacteristic and their retention would be in the interest of the service. In these cases retention is subject to the successful completion of a special programme, which is designed to re-educate and give training in cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>

The MOD, the four health departments and the Combat Stress charity have been working together with clinical experts and the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (HASCAS) to develop a new model of community based mental health care that will address assessment and treatment of veterans&#146; mental health problems in the long term.</p>

Evaluation of the pilot areas is now under way; early results from all six are encouraging, with evidence that veterans feel able to access and use the service with confidence. Informed by the results of the evaluation the service will be rolled out across the UK. In the interim, for areas not yet involved in the pilots, veterans with operational service after 1982 who are concerned about their mental health can attend our Medical Assessment Programme based at St. Thomas&#146; hospital, for specialist mental health assessment by a consultant psychiatrist with extensive military experience.</p>

The Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2008-09 described the wide range of programmes in place to deliver efficiency and value for money savings. A specific public service reform team has not been formed and the work is coordinated by the Defence Board and the Value for Money Minister.</p>

 We have recently extended the out of service date for the Gazelle from 2012 to 2018. This change to our planning assumptions is based on a revised assessment of the need to provide a capability in support of domestic commitments, and can be safely provided from the remaining fatigue life of the airframes. This decision has no impact for operations in Afghanistan as the Gazelle is not used in the battlefield helicopter role; its former battlefield communications and ISTAR roles are all now performed by other helicopters and non-rotary wing assets.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence has no reason, or plans, to amend the terms of the Gurkha Pension Scheme (GPS), which is now a closed scheme. New entrants to the Army join Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) 2005. The MOD will continue to operate the present GPS for those 25,000 members in the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1107"><a name="91012w0098.htm_para1"><a name="09101367002315">The GPS was designed for retirement in Nepal and provides an income that equates to a good working wage there. Gurkhas who served as members of the GPS were able to retire on an immediate pension after only 15 years service, at an age as young as 33 years. They may therefore receive benefits under the scheme for many years while still of working age. The early age from which Gurkhas take their pension compared with their British counterparts means that over a lifetime most Gurkhas will receive equivalent or better pension value than those in AFPS 75.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1108"><a name="91012w0098.htm_para2"><a name="09101367002316">The value of the GPS pension has been maintained over time through annual uplifts for inflation in Nepal and by reference to the Indian Central Pay Commission 10-yearly reports. Gurkha pension rates are maintained at levels that are at least double the rates of the Indian Army pension scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1109"><a name="91012w0098.htm_para3"><a name="09101367002317">Gurkha soldiers today serve on the same terms and conditions of service as the wider Army. Gurkhas who served on or after 1 July 1997 have also been given the option to transfer to the AFPS and many have chosen to do so. Service on or after 1 July 1997 was given a year-for-year value, while service before 1 July 1997 was converted using an actuarial factor to give broadly equivalent pension value in AFPS for that period. This is normal practice across the public sector for those transferring between pension schemes.</p>

 The Met Office is a World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) designated centre for long-range forecasts and carries out assessments of its forecasts using procedures required by WMO. The most recent assessment for the Europe/UK region was carried out in September 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1110"><a name="91012w0098.htm_para4"><a name="09101367002324">There are limits on predictability at long-range, however seasonal forecasting is a developing science and the Met Office expects substantive improvements to follow from current research programs. Results show that, for the Europe/UK region, forecasts correctly discriminate below or above normal temperature and rainfall levels by about 60 per cent. of the time, with percentages somewhat better for temperature. This reflects state-of-the-art skill for seasonal forecasting in the extratropical regions and is thus similar to that available from other leading WMO centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1111"><a name="91012w0098.htm_para5"><a name="09101367002325">The nature of influences on seasonal conditions means that forecast skill is considerably higher in tropical regions than in the middle latitudes.

 Currently, within the armed forces, the level of aircrew manning is sufficient to meet the tasks that they are required to undertake.

For example, the Royal Navy screened a television advertisement campaign for pilots incorporating an online game which simulated an aircrew aptitude test. Within the Army and RAF, recruitment of aircrew is robust and no specifically targeted recruitment initiatives are currently running for aircrew.</p>

 The primary aim of the Carbon Emission Reduction Target (CERT, 2008-11) is to reduce carbon emissions in the household sector to contribute to national and international climate change targets. CERT and its predecessor the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC, 2002-08) has shown to be very effective, with EEC saving some 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2008 and CERT expected to add a further 5.6 million tonnes of CO2 savings by 2011. This mechanism has also proved to be very effective at getting measures into homes&#151;for instance, some six million households have benefited from subsidised or free insulation since 2002, one million of these in the first year of CERT alone.

<i> [holding answer 16 September 2009]:</i> We have used the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report as a primary reference for relating global emissions to our 2C goal. We have also extensively used the Stern Review. In addition the Government are funding a major research programme on the science of climate change called the AVOID programme. AVOID is a DECC/DEFRA funded research programme led by the Met Office in a consortium with the Walker Institute, Tyndall Centre and Grantham Institute. For further information see:</p>

The most recent, by Project Catalyst (a philanthropically funded project to develop analysis for the UNFCCC), put the total at &#8364;65-100 billion per year on average from 2010-2020 (&#8364;55-80 billion mitigation; &#8364;10-20 billion adaptation). The figure that the Prime Minister announced in a speech on 26 June 2009 of around $100 billion by 2020 is within this range. However, we also recognised that we must distinguish between research studies and the actual finance that countries might need for their low carbon and climate resilient growth and development. Therefore, we have proposed $100 billion a year by 2020 as a working figure for the world to focus on.</p>

 The Department of Energy and Climate Change has been working with Carbon Trust to develop and deliver a wide-reaching energy reduction and carbon management programme focusing on our London HQ. A number of significant changes have already been made, with visible reductions in energy consumption. Many of the changes relate to the Building Management System, to optimise the operation of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant, by adjusting time schedules and rationalising temperature set points. We are also upgrading lighting to energy efficient systems, replacing tungsten halogen bulbs with LEDs, and installing and enabling daylight and occupancy sensing.

 The Department has taken a number of actions to increase consumer awareness of the benefits of using domestic heating controls. Our Building Regulations require a minimum set of controls to be installed when a boiler is replaced. In addition, we have ensured heating controls are an eligible measure under the obligation on energy suppliers to help households save carbon and energy and over 2 million heating controls have been distributed since 2005 through this scheme. The Energy Saving Trust (EST) includes the proper installation and use of heating controls as part of its core package of free energy efficiency advice to consumers, which DECC grant funds. The EST is also monitoring some advanced controls, as part of an extension to an on-going boiler performance project. More recently, the Government have acted to include Home Energy Advice as a qualifying measure under the existing supplier obligation. The Home Energy Advice package will be delivered to householders face to face in their home and encompasses a specific set of energy using behaviours, including how heating controls can be used more effectively to achieve energy savings.</p>

 The Government have not made a formal assessment of the number of new jobs created by specific measures announced in the pre-Budget report. However, independent research (Innovas, March 2009, &#147;Low Carbon and Environmental Goods and Services: an industry analysis&#148;) estimated that the low carbon and environmental goods and services sector employs 880,000 people in the UK and is expected to grow to over one million by the middle of the next decade. The accelerated capital spending and additional resources announced in the pre-Budget report to support low carbon growth, and the &#163;1.4 billion of additional targeted support for the low carbon sector announced in Budget 2009, will be key to driving investment and employment in these sectors.</p>

 The Sustainable Development Commission's report contains one recommendation on which DECC leads: &#147;Imposing Clearly Defined Resource/emission Caps&#148;. The Climate Change Act commits the Government to reductions in emissions of at least 80 per cent. by 2050, and creates a system of five-year carbon budgets to ensure this target is delivered. The level of the first three carbon budgets (2008-22) was set through secondary legislation in May 2009. The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan, published in July 2009, sets out how the first three carbon budgets will be delivered. Delivery of the carbon budgets is enabled by policies including trading schemes which set specific caps, in particular the European Emissions Trading System which covers about half of UK emissions, and the forthcoming Carbon Reduction Commitment.</p>

The facility operator, Magnox North Ltd, is legally obliged by its nuclear site licence to provide adequate arrangements for investigating incidents on the site and conducted an investigation into the August 2008 incident. In line with its established policy for such incidents, the Nuclear Directorate's investigation consisted of a review of Magnox North Ltd's own investigation, which it supplemented with further scrutiny of the cause of the incident during the 2009 planned outage of the facility. The Directorate's conclusion was that Magnox North Ltd had dealt with the incident satisfactorily.

 The Asylum Instruction entitled &#147;Gender Issues in the Asylum Claim&#148; was introduced in early 2004. The instruction provides guidance to caseworkers considering claims for asylum where sexual or gender identity-related issues have been raised. The UKBA quality audit team checks compliance with all UKBA instructions in a proportion of decisions. This includes where relevant, whether the decision maker has followed the instruction on gender. The result of each audit is fed back to decision makers and managers to ensure quality of decisions improves and the quality team make additional recommendations on any issues which they feel impact on quality at national level to ensure these can be addressed.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 September 2009]:</i> The Immigration Case Work programme stems from the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) review in 2006, which identified that the business has had to operate with systems that were not designed to cope with the scale of change and business volumes experienced in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1313"><a name="91012w0116.htm_para9"><a name="09101417001235">The programme&#146;s vision is to deliver a new immigration case working capability that will enable the UK Border Agency to operate with the levels of efficiency and service found in leading case working organisations. This will be achieved by delivering radical changes to business processes and improvements to the enabling IT systems. The programme has adopted recognised leading practice by scheduling the development and roll-out of the new systems over time; from the first pilot release in March 2009 to replacement of the legacy systems for protection in 2013 (as discussed with the Committee for Public Accounts earlier this year). The phased approach also ensures that the Agency can afford to fund the programme as part of its business plan. The programme is within budget.</p>

available towards the end of 2009. The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

This led to a G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Statement on &#147;The risk to children posed by child pornography offenders&#148;. The experts concluded that there was a relationship between viewing and contact offending, although more work was required to determine the exact nature of that relationship. Additionally there was a recognition that, based on conviction evidence a significant proportion of &#147;image&#148; offenders had committed some form of contact offence; and the exchange of child abuse images and communication between child sexual offenders was used by them to legitimise and normalise their beliefs and behaviours providing a social context which encourages the further exploitation of children.</p>

 Comparisons between 2007-08 and 2008-09 are possible for the offences of homicide (figures for 2008-09 are provisional), attempted murder and robbery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1432"><a name="91012w0131.htm_para6"><a name="09101417005025">Homicides and attempted murders are rare and account for less than one per cent of all knife offences. As such, comparisons should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1435"><a name="91012w0131.htm_para9"><a name="09101417005028">For GBH offences, it is not possible to compare between 2007-08 and 2008-09. This is due to a change in the clarification rules for recording GBH with intent, and a change in the definition of GBH without intent. Under advice from the National Statistician the offences of GBH with and without intent and ABH and other injury were combined when published. Further information is given in Box 2.1 on page 14 of Crime in England and Wales, 2008-09: Volume 1.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 September 2009]:</i> The introduction by the UK of the e-Passport containing the holder&#146;s personal details and facial image on a contactless chip was part of a major international drive to make travel documents more secure. The UK e-Passport&#146;s physical and electronic security features are a significant impediment to forgers and counterfeiters. The UK e-Passport is recognised as a high integrity document, and there is no evidence that anyone has modified or changed the data within the chip on the e-Passport in a way that would pass through the checks made at UK border control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1442"><a name="91012w0133.htm_para0"><a name="09101417005944">In terms of security, if the UK had not introduced the e-Passport then there was a risk that the UK passport would have received greater attention from fraudsters and counterfeiters. Also, UK nationals would have been treated less favourably than those of other nations at border controls and not have been able to travel visa free to the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1443"><a name="91012w0133.htm_para1"><a name="09101417005945">The greater assurance and integrity offered by the e-Passport enables border control authorities worldwide to spend more time dealing with higher risk passengers. Accessing the data held on the e-Passport automatically, enables UK Border Force Officers to use their time more efficiently on improved security and fraud checks, making our border even more secure. Additionally, the UK Border Agency is encouraging e-Passport holders to use the facial recognition gates currently being trialled in the UK, providing the travelling public with an easier passage through the controls.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 September 2009]:</i> The UK originally committed to connecting to the first generation Schengen Information System (SIS). However, during the development stage of the UK's national system, the European Commission proposed developing an upgraded central system, known as SIS II. The latter system is capable of handling with European partners additional useful functions for law enforcement such as biometric data and would represent an improvement over the original SIS system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1460"><a name="91012w0135.htm_para2"><a name="09101417006466">We therefore took the decision that the UK should refocus its development resources to connect to SIS II. This remains the case.</p>

However, the scheduled launch date for the central SIS II system has been put back by the European Commission from April 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to technical difficulties experienced by the Commission's contractor. This means that the UK SIS II service will not be able to connect to the EU central system until December 2011 at the earliest.</p>

 Implementation of the Vetting and Barring Scheme includes a programme of consultation with the voluntary sector through a specific consultation group and a wide range of stakeholder events. The free application for unpaid volunteers has been welcomed along with the reduction in bureaucracy arising from the continuous monitoring element of the scheme. Consultation has not indicated that the scheme is likely to damage levels of volunteering. A number of voluntary sector organisations including Children England, Volunteering England and the Children's Society have indicated that they believe the scheme to be an appropriate response to safeguarding concerns that should not impact adversely on volunteer numbers.</p>
