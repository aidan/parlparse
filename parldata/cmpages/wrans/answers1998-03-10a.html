<a name="80310w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Inspector who conducted the public local inquiry into the called in planning applications for an extension to the park and ride scheme at Bar End, Winchester, has now submitted his report to the Secretary of State. Representations were made at the inquiry by Hampshire County Council and others. The Secretary of State received some 145 letters about the proposals and these were submitted to the Inquiry. The Secretary of State is considering the Inspector's report and will announce his decision as soon as possible.

<a name="80310w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance he has given to <i>(a)</i> local authorities and <i>(b)</i> other housing organisations concerning minimum standards for the (i) construction and (ii) renovation and (iii) size of rooms of dwellings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Building Regulations apply to the construction of new buildings, including dwellings, and require that they provide reasonable standards of health and safety for the occupants, and also include reasonable provision for the conservation of fuel and power. Guidance on ways of meeting the requirements of the Regulations is given in the Approved Documents which support the Regulations.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para2">Guidance on the current Housing Fitness Standard and home renovation grants is given in Circular 17/96, although major renovation work could also be subject to the Building Regulations. We are currently reviewing the Housing Fitness Standard and, on 10 February 1998, a consultation document was issued which invited comments on proposals and options for change. Copies of this consultation are in the Libraries of each House.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para3">The Government do not issue guidance on room sizes. However in Housing Associations' dwellings, the Housing Corporation requires that rooms are large enough to accommodate appropriate furniture and normal activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he is taking to ensure a consistent approach by local authorities towards the removal of obstructions from pavements with particular reference to goods for sale. [33102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Anything placed on the highway is capable of being deemed an obstruction that the highway authority is under a duty to have removed. The highway includes the pavement. Whether an offence is actually committed in a given case is, however, a matter to be proved. Case law has established that there must be proof that placing the thing in question on the highway is unreasonable. This depends on the circumstances of the particular case. The Government have concluded that these can vary to such a degree that it is not possible to offer meaningful detailed advice to local highway authorities on the exercise of their powers, but encourage them to follow policies that place emphasis on the need to maintain unobstructed passage along the pavement for passers-by, but also take account of the interests of shoppers and retailers.

<a name="80310w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Hazardous Waste</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Basel Convention on transfrontier movement of hazardous waste, held in Malaysia in February.  [33111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Conference was held in Kuching, Malaysia from 23-27 February. I attended the High Level segment from 26-27 February representing the Presidency of the European Union. This was a successful conference both for the UK and for the European Union.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para4">The Conference adopted an amendment to the Convention based on a joint proposal by Chile and the European Community which added new annexes listing hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The UK has been closely associated with the development of this proposal from its inception and was particularly active, as 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 1998 : Column: 97</I><P>
a member of the Troika, in support of the Luxembourg Presidency's negotiations with Chile to merge their proposal with the Community's. The new amendment will give legal clarity to the scope of the earlier 'ban' amendment (Decision III/1) adopted by the Third Conference of Parties. The latter will ban exports of hazardous waste from Annexe VII Parties (OECD countries, the EC and Liechtenstein) to non-Annexe VII countries. The Chile/EC amendment should therefore add considerably to the prospects for securing enough ratifications to bring the ban amendment into force. It will not require ratification, but will enter into force within six months except for any Party notifying the United Nations that it does not accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para5">Proposals from Israel, Monaco and Slovenia to be added to Annexe VII were unsuccessful. Instead, the Parties decided that Annexe VII should not be amended until the ban amendment has entered into force. To date, nine Parties have ratified of the 65 required. The UK ratified on 13 October 1997. The conference also decided that an analysis should be prepared highlighting the issues related to Annexe VII.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para6">The Conference extended the mandate of the legal group which is charged with developing a Protocol on liability and compensation for damage arising from transboundary movements of hazardous waste. The group was, however, instructed to consider the implications of the ban amendment and other relevant international conventions for the proposed Protocol.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para7">The Conference adopted a number of other decisions including one aimed at enhancing the capability of Parties to detect and enforce against illegal traffic and others concerned with capacity building in developing countries. The UK has recently agreed to fund two such projects forming part of an Action programme for the Caribbean.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list those establishments which have received a licence to carry out investigations into genetically modified organisms.  [33217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992, as amended in 1996, control all activities involving the contained use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Regulations require that all premises where such activities are to be undertaken must be notified to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). For higher risk activities work cannot proceed until HSE has issued a consent. Low risk activities may proceed unless HSE objects.
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para8">I have arranged for a list of the establishments where contained use of GMOs is undertaken to be placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the sources of <i>(a)</i> borrowed funds and <i>(b)</i> capital funds for the extension of the Jubilee Line; what sums relate to agreements with private developers entered into as part of the initial construction agreements; and what parts of such borrowing (i) count and (ii) do not count against the 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 1998 : Column: 98</I><P>
borrowing ceilings for public fund investment required in respect of the convergence criteria for entering the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union.  [33236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Some &#163;2 billion of the total cost of the Jubilee Line Extension is being directly funded by ring-fenced Government grant, of which over &#163;400 million is being provided by private sector contributions. In excess of &#163;100 million of the private sector contributions has already been received; the balance will be paid in stages over a 25 year period. Remaining costs will be met from London Transport's core resources (which include substantial Government grant).
<P>

<a name="80310w01.html_para9">The general government financial deficit (GGFD) used under the Maastricht Treaty's excessive deficits procedure includes central Government grants to public corporations. It does not include borrowing undertaken by public corporations, which are outside of general government. However, as noted above, the JLE is not being financed by any such borrowing.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State discussed property in British Rail (BR) ownership with the Chairman of the BR Board soon after taking office. Officials discuss with Rail Property Ltd. (RPL) any such sites which are brought to their attention as having possible future rail freight use. RPL informs Railtrack and industry members of such sites available for sale.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on light dues.  [34005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that there will be no changes to the light dues rates for 1998-99. Current rates were set in 1997, when charges were reduced by an average of 4.6%, following four years of stability. Rates are now below 1992 levels in cash terms. The ability to maintain light dues at current levels is an indication of the General Lighthouse Authorities' continuing efforts to achieve greater efficiency.
<P>

<a name="80310w02.html_para2">I am also announcing a minor amendment to the Light Dues Regulations which provides an exemption for vessels engaged solely in harbour maintenance or dredging, on behalf of a statutory or harbour authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what his plans are regarding the future administration of the EC Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.  [34126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have decided that from 1 May this year, the Institute of Environmental Assessment will take over this function from my Department, which has administered EMAS in the United Kingdom since it came into operation in April 1995. The Institute will be the official Competent Body responsible for registering sites under the scheme on a fee charging basis in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A separate announcement will be made later about Scotland.
<P>

<a name="80310w02.html_para3">When my Department was designated as the Competent Body in 1994, the declared intention was to keep the arrangements simple by limiting the number of key players involved, particularly in the initial stages of setting up EMAS. EMAS has now moved beyond this developmental stage, with nearly 50 registered sites in the United Kingdom. Its effectiveness in helping industry to manage its impacts on the environment and publicise its results is becoming increasingly recognised, alongside ISO 14001, the international environmental management systems standard, which has been achieved by over 430 companies in the United Kingdom--more than anywhere else in Europe--and which can be used by any organisation, either as the environmental management system for EMAS or on its own.
<P>

<a name="80310w02.html_para4">My decision therefore reflects the importance which the Government attach to motivating businesses to adopt externally verified environmental management systems. The Environment Agency is firmly committed to encouraging the use of such systems because of their value in improving the environment, and I welcome its work in this respect. I will be looking to all leading companies to respond by committing themselves to EMAS and ISO 14001.

 <i>[holding answer 3 March 1998]:</i> The main cost of the Council, which advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the design and implementation of policies for the achievement of the Government's Economic objectives, relates to the salaries of the two members, whose appointments took effect from last September, and the cost of the secretarial support they receive. It is not the practice to give details of what individuals earn.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1998]:</i> The table shows the number of Civil Service recruits joining the Treasury in the period 1993-97. It excludes special advisers and casual appointments. The numbers recruited through the fast stream competition and through other fair and open competitions include people who previously worked in the private sector. There was no recruitment competition restricted to applicants from the private sector. Information about universities attended by Treasury staff cannot be retrieved without disproportionate cost.

The new terms will apply retrospectively from 1 January 1998. The EU has agreed to look at ways to further improve and extend preferential access to all the LDCs. The UK sees this as a priority and will continue to press within the EU and multilaterally for bound duty free access for all LDC products.

At this meeting the EU reaffirmed its commitment to offer Lome equivalent terms to the nine non-Africa, Caribbean, Pacific LDCs, and terms were agreed in February under the UK Presidency. Progress on implementation of market access commitments will be reviewed at the WTO Ministerial which will take place in Geneva from 18-19 May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Government's strategy to ensure that there are sufficient qualified doctors in the future is to increase training levels and address concerns about recruitment and retention. Our initiatives in this area include: new student funding arrangements, which reflect the special features of undergraduate medical education; further investment in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education, which should ensure future increases in doctor numbers; flexible and family-friendly training arrangements; continued attention to equal employment opportunities; the salaried doctors and improved retainer schemes within general practice; and opportunities within the Primary Care Act pilots.
<P>

<a name="80310w06.html_para0">Also, we are taking steps to ensure that doctors feel valued and involved. For example, the recent White Paper <i>The New NHS</i> promotes greater involvement of hospital doctors in the management of National Health Service trusts, and increases all doctors' influence over management decisions.

<a name="80310w06.html_para2">In the case of most non European Economic Area (EEA) nationals the GMC and GDC must be satisfied that the practitioner meets the required level of professional and language competence before they are registered.

 National Health Service trusts were asked in December 1997 to ensure that steps were taken to maximise income from the existing scheme to recoup the cost of treatment for certain road traffic accident victims. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health also announced that, when time permits, legislation will be introduced to revise the current arrangements.

 The information requested is not collected centrally. However, it is possible to provide the numbers of residents in the electoral constituency of Warrington, North treated as an inpatient or day case in any hospital with the diagnosis of asthma--see table. This means that the reason for admission may not be asthma, but the patients were diagnosed as having asthma when treated on admission. The vast majority of asthma sufferers are treated by health services in the community and few require hospital treatment. My hon. Friend may, therefore, wish to contact Mr. Colin Hamer, Chairman at North Cheshire Health Authority, for further information.

 Advertisements made in connection with a business and placed on the Internet are subject to essentially the same regime throughout the European Union as advertisements in other media. In the United Kingdom, the British Codes of Advertising and Sales Promotion, operated by the Advertising Standards Authority, require all advertisements to be legal, decent, honest and truthful. Where an advertiser persistently disregards the adjudications of the Authority, the Director General of Fair Trading may take action in the Courts. Additionally, the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, enforced by local authority trading standards departments, makes it an offence for a trader knowingly or recklessly to make false or misleading statements about services, accommodation or facilities. Neither the Advertising Standards Authority nor trading standards officers can take action abroad.

<a name="80310w07.html_para7">Tourism in Staffordshire and the West Midlands also benefits from the work of the ETB, whose purpose is to assist the industry in increasing tourism expenditure in England, and the British Tourist Authority (BTA) which helps market the British tourism product abroad. My Department gives grant-in-aid to the ETB and BTA. This year the ETB received &#163;9.9 million from my Department (&#163;5.1 million of which it gives as grants to the Regional Tourist Boards), in addition to &#163;2.9 million from the industry, and the BTA received &#163;35 million in grant-in-aid plus &#163;16 million from the industry.

<a name="80310w07.html_para8">As far as local authority spending is concerned, tourism promotion is not a mandatory local authority function but a discretionary one and funds are not allocated "per head" of population. Local authorities are free to make decisions on tourism funding as they see fit, on the basis of local needs and priorities. Estimates for local authority expenditure on tourism promotion, county by county, appear in the "English Heritage Monitor", published annually by English Heritage and the English Tourist Board.

 Officials in my Department are currently considering the areas in which concordats may be required between the Scottish Executive and Departments of the UK Government. It is too early to say how many such agreements, which cannot be made until the Scottish Executive is established, might be required. The guidance which I placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament on 27 February 1998 made clear that the range and subject matter of each concordat would depend upon the needs of the business area. The aim will be to ensure that the business of government in Scotland and at the United Kingdom level is conducted smoothly, by setting the ground rules for administrative co-operation, consultation and exchange of information. The guidance also indicated that all concordats should be published unless publication would cause substantial harm on one of the clearly defined grounds set out in the White Paper "Your Right to Know: Freedom of Information" (Cm.3818).

 This is a matter for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, whose Chief Executive has advised me that formal applications are not normally made until there is a reasonable expectation that grant aid will be available. The number of applicants, therefore, can be regarded as almost synonymous with the number of grant approvals. The earliest stage in the process is the Preliminary Inquiry state, which gauges the number of potential applicants. There are a number of reasons why potential applicants do not become actual applicants including the failure of the property or the applicant to meet the criteria for particular grants, but no statistics are kept which would show the numbers of potential applications which do not progress. The numbers of Preliminary Inquiries received since October 1992 is 100,511. Figures have been recorded by district council area only since 1 April 1994 and these are as follows.

 Existing Northern Ireland civil law on the preliminaries to and the celebration of marriage is based on nineteenth century legislation and is complex to administer. This, together with recent changes in the law in England and Wales and consultation on possible change in Scotland indicates a need to consider reform here. Accordingly, I have asked the Law Reform Advisory Committee, whose role is to keep the civil law of Northern Ireland under review, to examine the subject and to bring forward proposals as appropriate.

[32581]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Home Office has chosen to direct funding towards national initiatives designed to support and encourage the sort of activity which Watch schemes represent rather than funding local schemes. It would not be possible to fund every local scheme and, in any event, the essence of partnership is people getting together with the police to solve local problems at a local level. The Government do provide &#163;0.75 million a year in core funding to Crime Concern, one of whose main activities is advising and developing crime prevention activities.
<P>

<a name="80310w09.html_para15">As both farm and rural watch schemes are run in conjunction with local police forces, the Home Office does not keep records of either the total number of schemes which are currently running throughout the country, or the estimated average number of people involved in each scheme.

<a name="80310w09.html_para16">The Crime and Disorder Bill will help to extend partnership activities by providing for new statutory duties for local authorities and the police to create an effective results-oriented framework for local action to tackle local problems. The nature of these problems will vary significantly from one area to another, and it is the Government's intention to allow maximum flexibility to reflect this. Rural areas, in common with urban and inner city areas, will benefit from this approach.

 The recent changes to the law on handguns have not changed the law on signal flares. Firearms designed as signalling apparatus are specifically exempted from the ban on handguns.

<a name="80310w10.html_para0">Our firearms controls have always divided signalling equipment into two categories. Ordinary flares can be possessed by anyone, and are commonly used by sailors and hill walkers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> All passengers are potentially liable to a form of departure check. Under the Immigration Act 1971, an immigration officer may seek to establish whether or not a person leaving the country is a British citizen and, if he is not, his identity.
<P>

<a name="80310w10.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> In practice, about 40% of embarking passengers do not see an immigration officer. In 1994, embarkation checks were withdrawn from passengers departing from ferry ports and small airports for destinations within the European Union.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No system would be totally comprehensive because there is no embarkation control between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The cost of information technology for the most comprehensive system possible is likely to be about &#163;73 million over a ten year period. The additional staffing cost, for ports, is estimated at about &#163;7.2 million a year.
<P>

<a name="80310w10.html_para4">Such a system would provide better statistical information on overstaying but would not assist to any significant degree in the apprehension of immigration offenders, because they rarely remain at the address given on arrival. It would not help at all in respect of those who enter clandestinely.
<P>

<a name="80310w10.html_para5">It would, therefore, be expensive and not the most cost effective way of tackling abuse of the immigration control.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The immigration officer undertakes departure checks to identify persons subject to control under the Immigration Act 1971 and, where necessary, records that departure. Under the Immigration Act, an immigration officer has the power to require the presentation of a passport or equivalent document, but has no express power to prevent departure.

<P>

<a name="80310w10.html_para7">I have decided that I will not order Roisin McAliskey's return to Germany because I consider that the medical evidence in her case would make extradition unjust or oppressive.

 We are working closely with EU and other partners to press the Burmese regime (now called the State Peace and Development Council) to improve its record on human rights. In December, we co-sponsored a UN Resolution on human rights in Burma. This month, we shall introduce a resolution on Burma at the UN Commission on Human Rights. We are also using our EU Presidency to renew a tough package of EU-wide measures against the Burmese Government. We continue to urge EU partners to extend these measures. We have also secured EU consensus for a programme of positive measures aimed at strengthening civil society and delivering humanitarian aid in Burma.

A shelter Implementation Plan (SIP) has now been agreed between Ukraine and G7 countries. Its aim is to stabilise the current shelter over the remains of the destroyed Unit 4 at Chernobyl; to remove the danger of a further explosion and finally to construct a temporary confinement to facilitate the removal of the most unstable parts. Implementation of the SIP has already started and efforts to ensure sufficient funding are underway.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what criteria determine the composition of Magistrates Courts Committees; and how they are appointed.  [33718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCC) are composed of local magistrates who are appointed by their colleagues, on the basis of the skills and experience they bring to the committee.
<P>

<a name="80310w13.html_para2">The framework for the appointment of MCC members is set out in the Magistrates' Courts Committees (Constitution) Regulations 1994. Broadly, each bench in an MCC area elects a prescribed number of its members to operate as a Selection Panel. The selection panel is informed by the incumbent MCC how many new members are required for the following year. A written notice of application is required, containing details of qualifications and experience. Candidates for appointment to the committee must be nominated by a justice and seconded by three other justices. Each selection panel 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 1998 : Column: 143</I><P>
determines its own method of selecting members to the MCC (whether through selection or election). Where a committee believes that additional skills are required which can only be provided by an individual who is not a magistrate, it is open to them to seek the Lord Chancellor's approval for a co-option to take place.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Under section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997, decisions concerning the future of a magistrates court are for the relevant magistrates courts committee to determine, after consultation with the paying authority or authorities. The local authorities that contribute financially to the running of the service may appeal to the Lord Chancellor against a proposed closure. The procedure for such appeals is set out in section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997.

[33717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Justices of the Peace Act 1997 requires a magistrates courts committee to consult its local paying authority before making a determination to close a courthouse.
<P>

<a name="80310w13.html_para3">My Department does, however, encourage magistrates courts committees to extend their consultation processes wider than that required by the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 and to consider all representations received before making a final determination.

<a name="80310w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B>

<P><I>10 Mar 1998 : Column: 144</I><P>
lawyers are experienced in taking cases on a conditional fee basis and there is a developed insurance market to provide protective insurance for clients.

<P>
<a name="80310w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 If a case has a reasonable prospect of success, a solicitor would be prepared to undertake it on a conditional fee. We do not believe that cases ought to be brought unless they have a strong prospect of success. I do not see that the legal aid budget, paid for by the taxpayer, should pay for a case if a solicitor does not think it has strong enough prospects to take it on under a conditional fee.

<a name="80310w14.html_para0">The comparable figures for non-departmental public bodies not included in the Departmental totals have been recalculated and the figures are now assessed to be &#163;77,503 during 1995-96 and &#163;183,109 in 1996-97.

<a name="80310w14.html_para1">This year's exercise to calculate expenditure on external consultancy within MOD during financial year 1997-98 will be complete by early summer, when I will write to the hon. Member. I will also place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80310w14.html_para2">Individual budget holders in the MOD have delegated powers to employ external consultants as they judge necessary, consistent with requirements for propriety and value for money. External consultants are engaged for assistance on a wide range of problems, but very seldom with the sole aim of securing financial savings. We do not, therefore, specifically assess cost savings as a result of the employment of external consultants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in compiling his report on the pay of prisoners of war during World War II, what account the Government took of whether or not the terms of the 1929 Geneva Convention were fulfilled in respect of reimbursing enemy Governments for payments by them to the British prisoners of war during the Second World War.

 The Review was fully aware of, and the Report covers, the 1929 Geneva Convention on the treatment of Prisoners of War of an enemy power and the question of the settlement of national debts between belligerents at the end of hostilities.
<P>

<a name="80310w14.html_para3">The Convention provided for the provision by the Detaining Power of some pay for officer Prisoners of War in the camps and that after the war this money would be refunded to each Detaining Power by the officers' own country. These matters were however subject to any special arrangements or agreements which the belligerent powers might make during and after the war.
<P>

<a name="80310w14.html_para4">At the time of the Peace Treaty with Italy, a mutual waiver of all claims in respect of Prisoners of War was agreed. Since for Germany no national authority existed with whom a settlement of this kind could be made, there was de facto a mutual waiver of claims, including those relating on both sides to Prisoners of War.
<P>

<a name="80310w14.html_para5">As the Report makes clear, the administration of servicemen's pay matters was a subject for their own Government. Deductions from home pay accounts in respect of payments made under the Geneva Conventions were not governed by these Conventions, but were a matter of British service pay policy.

<a name="80310w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Neither the Mason and Hanger Corporation nor any other United States organisation carries out Trident weapons assembly for the United Kingdom. Without a more specific reference it is not possible to identify the report to which my hon. Friend refers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the responsibility for the millennium compliance of computer-reliant military equipment supplied by the United States of America lies with the vendors; and if she will make a statement.  [33314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 When MOD purchases direct from a US company, it prefers to place contracts under English Law, which places the vendor under the same obligations as a UK company. In all such contracts with US companies it is a requirement that they be contractually bound to meet the MOD's Year 2000 compliance requirements and to provide an express warranty to this effect. When MOD contracts directly with US companies under US laws for the procurement of computer systems and software, a similar compliance requirement is included.
<P>

<a name="80310w14.html_para6">In cases where MOD procures on a Government to Government basis through the Foreign Military Sales, FMS, route with the US, the vendors are required to comply with the relevant US Government criteria. The US Government are committed to achieving Year 2000 compliance of Defence equipment.

 Since 1 May 1997 to date RAF Leeming has hosted 104 non-defence visits which serve to generate a constructive relationship with the local community, including raising funds for local charities. Such visits have a minimal impact on the Station and its personnel and are conducted at no cost to the public purse.

<a name="80310w15.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions is also taking measures to prevent accidental spills. These include the rigorous enforcement of international rules and standards and the funding of three emergency towing vessels, including one in the South Western Approaches. In addition, international agreement has been obtained to a ban on virtually all operational discharges in UK waters, penalties for offenders have been increased, and port waste management planning is now mandatory for all ports, harbours and marinas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many companies in Wales the industry section of the Welsh Office has assisted to act as suppliers to the new LG factory in Gwent; and if he will make a statement. [32977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Current information available from the Welsh Development Agency's Source Wales, which itself has matched Wales-based suppliers to LG, shows that there are twenty two Wales-based suppliers to the company. However, we know that there are many other suppliers dealing direct with the company and with AMEC, Tarmac and their sub-contractors, which do not yet feature on the Source Wales database. The Agency is endeavouring to gather this information to provide a more complete picture.
<P>

<a name="80310w15.html_para2">Of the twenty two suppliers identified, a number have been supported under the Regional Selective Assistance Scheme or the Regional Innovation Grant Scheme, most of which pre-date the LG announcement. None of these have been supported for projects specifically to supply LG although the impact of that earlier support could well have helped the companies provide a service to LG.
<P>

<a name="80310w15.html_para3">I would not expect there to be many requests for support specifically to supply LG. Experience shows that businesses, whether they be indigenous or inward investors, want a diverse customer and supply base. While LG is already in production, that production is limited at this stage. I am confident that other Wales-based companies will do business with LG as the project progresses and develops and I am doing all I can to encourage this.

 The Official Secrets Act 1989 makes it an offence for a Crown servant to make a damaging disclosure without authorisation of information relating to security and intelligence, defence, international relations, crime and special investigation powers of information entrusted in confidence to other states.
<P>

<a name="80310w17.html_para4">Clause 79 of the Government of Wales Bill seeks to apply the provisions of the 1989 Act, which apply to Ministers of the Crown (including Welsh Office Ministers) to those who will exercise corresponding functions within the National Assembly. Functions of the Assembly could be delegated to the Executive Committee, and also to subject committees. Clause 79 is drafted to enable those who exercise relevant functions to be in receipt of information subject to the Official Secrets Act on the same terms as Ministers are now.

 Footnote 4 to the table in Commission Decision 98/121/EC, approving the new MAGP IV objectives for the fishing fleet of the Netherlands, refers to compensation for a decrease in efficiency resulting from a reduction in beam length. I understand that this reflects the outcome of discussions between the Commission and the Netherlands about the Dutch MAGP III figures. Similar discussions took place about certain aspects of the UK MAGP III figures, which also resulted in adjustments in MAGP IV though these did not cover the question of beam length in our case. I am not aware of any other adjustments relating to beam length for any other Member State.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what will be the position of a fisherman who exhausts his effort allocation before he has caught his quota; and if he will make a statement.  [32182]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w17.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 As the Parliamentary Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), has already made clear, the Government's preference is for controls on fishing effort to be managed by the industry itself, along the lines of existing quota management arrangements. Following discussions with industry representatives the available fishing effort in the pelagic and beam trawl segments has accordingly been allocated between the various producers' organisations (POs) and groups concerned. They have been invited to manage their uptake of effort to stay within these allocations on whatever basis they and their members consider appropriate. The Government are not seeking to impose any particular formula for this and are not making any allocations of effort to individual vessels. POs and groups will therefore have the flexibility to respond to local circumstances and, within their allocations, to take account of any special factors affecting particular members.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w17.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under what legislative power he will impose effort targets on producer organisations.  [32185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w17.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The legal obligation to reduce fishing effort by the UK fleet is contained in Commission Decision 98/124/EC which in turn is based on Council Decision 97/413/EC. As with management of catch quotas, the rules under which effort allocations have been made to producers' organisations are administrative and have been drawn up after full consultation with industry representatives. Any action to prevent further fishing by members of a producers' organisation which has exceeded its effort allocation will be taken by a licence variation under Section 4 of the Sea Fish Conservation Act 1967.

[33038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w17.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the terms of Council Decision 97/413/EC, all maritime Member States had until 30 June 1997 to submit to the European Commission national fishing effort limitation programmes for achieving the objectives fixed in MAGP IV, identifying and quantifying the means by which this is to be done. The Commission then had until 30 November 1997 to discuss these plans in detail with the Member States concerned and subsequently to approve them, with whatever modifications were found to be necessary.

 <i>[holding answer 27 February 1998]:</i> At the Standing Veterinary Committee on 4 March, ten member states supported the Commission's proposal for the Export Certified Herds Scheme. One member state abstained, pending further clarification of technical concerns, while supporting the principle of resuming exports under the arrangements laid down in the Florence Agreement. Four member states remain concerned about the controls governing eligibility for the scheme despite the fact that it had the Commission's full support. Because the proposal was not adopted by qualified majority, it has been referred to the Agriculture Council for a decision on 16-17 March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No. It would not be possible to derive such estimates without making a large number of assumptions. Restructuring of the agriculture industry is a continuous process. Currently, there are about 30,000 agricultural holdings in the United Kingdom classified as dairying and about 90,000 classified as cattle and sheep holdings. These do not include holdings where dairy herds or cattle and sheep are not the main enterprise.

<a name="80310w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 This recommendation of the Agriculture Committee was carefully reviewed by a Group convened by Professor D. H. Lawson, Chairman of the Medicines Commission. The Group concluded in November 1996 that it could not identify any independent body capable of taking over the Suspected Adverse Reactions Surveillance Scheme (SARSS). However the Group made a number of recommendations designed to improve public confidence in the objectivity of the Scheme's administration, including the reconstruction of the SARSS Appraisal Panel with an exclusively independent membership, all of which were accepted by the Government.

 The Specified Risk Material Order 1997, which came into force on 1 January, prohibits the importation of ox-heads from animals more than 12 months of age (except those born, reared and slaughtered in Australia or New Zealand) for use in any food or animal feed because they contain Specified Risk Material as defined in Commission Decision 97/534/EC.

[33002]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Council Directive 85/73/EEC, as amended, lays down minimum fees for veterinary checks at Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) on fresh meat and meat products imported into the Community from third countries. At present, for imports from all countries other than New Zealand, the minimum fee is 5 ECU a tonne and 30 ECU per consignment. The real costs of inspections are charged to importers, by the local authorities responsible for the BIPs, where these exceed the minimum fee. For New Zealand, in accordance with the Veterinary Equivalence Agreement between the EC and New Zealand, standard fees of 1.5 ECU a tonne and 30 ECU per consignment apply.
<P>

<a name="80310w19.html_para0">Directive 85/73/EEC also requires Member States to recover the costs of those hygiene inspections conducted at licensed fresh meat premises in accordance with harmonised EC meat hygiene rules. The Directive lays down standard charges (in ECUs) for hygiene inspections of red meat, poultry meat and game meat. Where the actual costs of inspection exceeds the standard charge, the Directive provides for actual costs to be charged. Thus both imported and domestically produced fresh meat is subject to hygiene inspection to ensure compliance with

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B>

No record has been kept of the number of representations which have either favoured or opposed the proposed controls.

[33736]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It is important that the culling experiment recommended in the Krebs report on TB in Cattle and Badgers is capable of providing scientifically robust conclusions.

 Departmental provision, including for bovine TB, for 1999-2000 and beyond is under review as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80310w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We see no grounds for asking taxpayers to meet a larger share of farmers' losses. We are assessing the implications of implementation of the Krebs report for the enhanced compensation arrangements which currently apply at Woodchester Park (100 per cent. of either the animal's market value or 125 per cent. of the average monthly market price two months before valuation, whichever is less, plus consequential losses).

 We are currently considering our TB research requirements in the light of the Krebs recommendations. We intend to publish a research requirements document in early April. This approach to commissioning research represents a significant move in the direction of open competition to ensure research is conducted by groups with the best expertise. However, elements of the programme that require particular facilities and expertise may be placed directly with commissioned contractors.

The volume of coal actually burnt is, in part, influenced by the weather and variations against planned levels of burn may be reflected in the level of coal stocks held by the generators. The relationship between the weather and stock levels is not straightforward. Stock levels have fallen in recent months despite the mild weather.

<P>

<a name="80310w22.html_para1">The Child Support Agency aims to clear 60 per cent. of new maintenance applications within 26 weeks of receipt. In the current year, performance has been affected by the clearance of a substantial number of older cases. Nevertheless, in the months from April to the end of December 1997, 72 per cent. of maintenance applications were cleared within 26 weeks. A special exercise carried out by Departmental statisticians indicated that, including cases from the backlog, the median clearance time for those that resulted in a maintenance assessment for the three months ending 30 November 1997 was 37 weeks. Currently, around a third of all applications cleared by the Agency result in a maintenance assessment.

<a name="80310w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Where there are two or more parents with care in respect of the same absent parent, applications for maintenance are normally dealt with in the order they are received. The non-resident parent's liability to pay maintenance for his children is then shared out between the parents with care based on their respective maintenance requirements.
<P>

<a name="80310w22.html_para3">Child support regulations that came into effect on 5 August 1996 cater for maintenance applications being processed other than in the normal order. However applications from more than one parent with care for maintenance from the same non-resident parent which were received before 5 August 1996 are not covered by these regulations.

 Contributions to the State pension scheme including the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme or a contracted out second pension are compulsory for most people in employment.

We are currently considering all of the representations we have received.

(18) In August 1996, President Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Bill giving States considerable power to create their own welfare programmes. The transfer of responsibility from the Federal Government to individual States for the design of welfare systems has created variations in the implementation of these Federal guidelines among States. For example, in the state of Wisconsin long parents are expected to satisfy the work requirement once their youngest child reaches 12 weeks old.<P>

 Steps have been taken to protect work incentives for existing lone parents. Existing recipients will continue to receive the higher rate of Child Benefit and lone parents will be able to claim the higher rate of Child Benefit when they leave Income Support for work.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures are for 1995-96.<P>

2. The data comes from the Department's Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series, based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and covering Great Britain. The FRS data were used to achieve a large enough sample size to provide more robust information. All results are subject to sampling error, and numbers may not sum due to rounding.<P>

3. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised income. The definition of income used follows that in the published HBAI series for FRS based results.<P>

4. Figures include 0.6 million children in the bottom three deciles in families classified as self-employed; the reported income of these families may not be an accurate guide to their living standards. Comparisons with household expenditure also suggests that households in the bottom income decile may not have the lowest living standards.<P>
