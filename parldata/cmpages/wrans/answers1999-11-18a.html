<P>
<a name="91118w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The role of the Defence Communication Services Agency is to provide information transfer services to Defence. The Key Targets for the Agency for the 12 months from 1 April 1999 are:

<P>
<P>
<a name="91118w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what changes are to be made to the reserve service liability of non-commissioned Royal Air Force personnel. [98663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91118w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Currently, on completion of a period of regular service which does not attract an immediate pension, non-commissioned Royal Air Force personnel are liable for up to six years service in either Category 1 or Category 2 of the RAF Reserve of Airmen. The majority of these reservists are placed in Category 1 and have a liability for 15 days annual training, in return for which they receive a small annual payment. Those in Category 2 have no such training liability and, therefore, do not receive payment.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para0">The reason for this annual training liability dates back to the Cold War and was intended to ensure that sufficient trained personnel would be available to provide, at relatively short notice, key point guards in the event of an anticipated attack on the United Kingdom. In the current strategic environment, however, any requirement for reinforcement could be met within the longer period that the Royal Air Force would have to achieve its required readiness states. Moreover, current planning assumptions indicate that, although there is a continuing need for volunteer reservists, there is little likelihood of the Royal 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1999 : Column: 2W</I><P>
Air Force Reserve of Airmen being required to meet Royal Air Force outputs short of regeneration. Indeed, lessons learned from the operations in Kosovo are expected to further emphasise the need for volunteer reserves, rather than ex-regular reserves.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para1">It has therefore been decided that non-commissioned personnel who have a commitment beginning on or after 1 February 2000 to serve in the Royal Air Force Reserve of Airmen, will be placed in Category 2 and will have no annual training liability. Ex-regular personnel currently serving in Category 1 will be invited to forego their annual training liability for the remainder of their reserve service commitment.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para2">This decision will not affect the requirement for all members of the Royal Air Force Reserve of Airmen to keep the Service authorities informed of their contact addresses, and they will still retain their liability for call-out.

<a name="91118w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 As part of my Department's programme of quinquennial reviews of its public bodies, I have today announced the start of our Review of the British Library.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para3">The British Library is the national centre for reference, study and bibliographical and other information services, in relation both to scientific and technological matters and to the humanities. The Review of the Library will include an evaluation of its role and functions and how those functions can best be carried out, and a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the way in which the Library delivers services to its users. We aim to complete the Review during the Spring of 2000. A copy of the Terms of Reference has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 As part of the Government's commitment to achieve better public services, as set out in its Modernising Government White Paper, my Department is today beginning a Quinquennial Review of Remploy. Its aim will be to consider Remploy's contribution to the changing economy and within the new framework for civil rights for disabled people.

<P>
<a name="91118w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 A consultation document on proposals for new arrangements for the structure and delivery of police training in England and Wales has been published today. Copies have been placed in the Library and are also being sent to police forces, police authorities, police staff associations and other interested parties. They have been invited to comment by 8 January 2000.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para13">The consultation period reflects the discussion and debate we have had during the extensive examination of police training in recent months. There has been an 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1999 : Column: 4W</I><P>
inquiry by the Home Affairs Committee, a thematic inspection of training by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, a report by Sir William Stubbs and Roger McClure of the London Institute and two reports by the Police Federation. I am grateful to all those who have carried out these surveys and to all those who contributed their time and views during their preparation.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para14">The consultation paper published today is firmly based on these studies. The paper describes the changes which the Government believe will deliver real improvements. There are numerous examples of good practice and indeed excellence under present arrangements and the proposals will build on those. The proposals, however, also represent an opportunity for a fresh start in police training: I believe that the police service and all the stakeholders in police training in England and Wales are ready to take action in this important area.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para15">The proposed new arrangements will enable the police service to benefit from new development in education and training and in information and communications technology to achieve professional excellence.
<P>

<a name="91118w01.html_para16">The proposals published today provide an unprecedented opportunity to raise standards in police training across the board, to provide relevant profession-long training and development for all staff and to translate effective training into real outcomes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the preparations of the international aviation industry towards achieving millennium compliance. [98438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91118w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The aviation industry in this country--airlines, airports and air traffic control--has been independently assessed and been declared by the Civil Aviation Authority to be millennium compliant.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para4">Internationally, the aviation industry has adopted a comprehensive approach towards the Y2k problem. The major international aviation organisations--the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) representing the world airlines, and other organisations covering the world's airports and air traffic control systems--have all conducted detailed surveys. Compliance programmes are in the final stages of completion. Current information shows that the international aviation industry is on track for compliance and that airlines will be able to operate services as normal over the Millennium period, should they wish to do so.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para5">As regards foreign aircraft operating to the UK, permits are only granted to airlines if they comply with international safety standards. The Government have advised foreign airlines that permits may be suspended over the Millennium if they are not satisfied there are no Y2k safety related risks.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para6">The Government will not, for Y2k reasons, try to prevent any UK airlines from operating to particular destinations or flying over particular regions. IATA's worldwide project on behalf of its member airlines has 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1999 : Column: 6W</I><P>
produced an exhaustive database to provide its member airlines with an authoritative basis upon which to make informed decisions about the services they provide.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para7">The industry is also engaged on the preparation of national and global contingency plans to deal with any unexpected Y2k problems over the Millennium. On the night of 31 December, special procedures will be in place across the world to monitor the situation and provide for rapid and effective communications between government and industry. Although traffic levels over the period are expected to be considerably reduced compared with previous years, the industry is formulating contingency plans to provide capacity as if air traffic was operating at peak levels, even though it is likely to be one twentieth of this volume. Key facilities such as air traffic control centres will be staffed at higher levels than normal to deal with any unexpected problems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91118w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I have given very careful consideration to DPTAC's report and to the further information which we sought from local authorities about the administration of the Scheme. I have also taken the opportunity to consult my colleagues in the devolved administrations and in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para8">We have concluded that a review of the Scheme is necessary to ensure it continues to serve its fundamental purpose: to enable severely disabled people to park close to their destinations. Without the badge the mobility of those who are most disabled would be greatly restricted. We will be starting the process in the New Year and will be reporting further progress to the House at that time. For now, I can confirm that the review will look at the eligibility criteria, as well as the administration and enforcement of the Scheme.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para9">Although the Scheme in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved administrations, and in Northern Ireland for the DOE Northern Ireland, I have agreed with my colleagues that the review will be carried out on a UK-wide basis. That arrangement will not, however, prevent changes being introduced on a devolved basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he has received from the Health and Safety Executive the first of the monthly reports which he requested on signals passed at danger; and if he will make a statement.  [98608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91118w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 Following the train crash at Ladbroke Grove on 5 October, a number of urgent actions were put in hand to achieve a more open, more responsive and more rigorous culture of safety across the rail industry. As part of these, I asked the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) to let me have regular reports for publication monthly, on all signals passed at danger (SPADs). I received the first of those reports on Tuesday and have now placed a copy in the House Library. I will ensure that future reports are also placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para13">This first report includes some background information on SPADs and how they are dealt with by the industry and HSE's Railways Inspectorate. It gives statistics for SPADs for the last 10 years and splits the figures by month. The annual figures show that the totals have been falling gradually since 1993-94 until the 8 per cent. rise in 1998-99, which prompted HSE to demand improvements from the industry on how they responded to SPADs. The monthly figures demonstrate the cyclical nature of the problem, with SPADs tending to peak in October/November, when damp conditions and falling leaves can lead to poor braking performance.




<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 1999 : Column: 8W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para14">This October there were five serious incidents (which for instance, breached the 200 yard safety overlap usually allowed at signals), comprising 7 per cent. of the total for the month. As well as the industry investigation of every SPAD, HSE will also investigate thoroughly these more serious SPADs. We should not read too much into one month's figures but the October total was significantly lower than last year.
<P>

<a name="91118w02.html_para15">The October SPAD figure has only been bettered once in the last 10 years. We must not be complacent however. The Ladbroke Grove accident demonstrated all too clearly how a single SPAD can result in catastrophe. That is why it is so important that the rail industry commit to reducing the number of SPADs. I sought this commitment from the industry at the rail summit which I held last month. When the industry reports back to me on 30 November I shall expect nothing less from them than a detailed programme of action.

These funds together with a substantial commitment of the CPS's existing resources, will help transform and modernise working practices to deliver better performance. The CPS can start catching-up with IT developments in the criminal justice system and build on its successes in Durham and elsewhere.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when the Government will publish the quinquennial review of the Public Trust Office.  [99046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91118w03.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has today published the Quinquennial Review of the Public Trust Office, an Executive Agency of the Lord Chancellor's Department established in 1994.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para14">The Review found strong support for the Government offering protection for the financial affairs of people who are mentally incapable of managing them for themselves.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para15">The Review recommends that the delivery of the Public Trust Office's key services should be carried out by organisations operating in the voluntary and public sectors, and private sector suppliers. The Lord Chancellor would remain ultimately responsible for the services provided. The Public Trust Office would focus on monitoring the provision of such services and ensuring that the needs of vulnerable people were met. The Review recommends that the Public Trust Office's refinanced and refocused operations should be performed by other parts of the Lord Chancellor's Department: the Court Service and the Official Solicitor's Office. The current Public Trust Office would then be phased out as a separate executive agency.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para16">The Lord Chancellor has welcomed the Review's clear diagnosis of the challenges faced by the Public Trust Office. He agrees that radical change is required and he, together with colleagues, will wish to explore the Review's recommendations in a programme of change for the Public Trust Office. In doing so, he will want to be satisfied that reform does not entail placing a greater financial burden on some of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. The Lord Chancellor will announce, in February 2000, how he will take forward reform.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para17">The Government's overriding objective will be to ensure that the interests of the Public Trust Office's clients are fully protected. To this end the recently established Consultative Forum representing the users of Public Trust Office services will be closely involved in considering how practical improvements to client services can be effected in working up the proposals for change that the Lord Chancellor considers necessary.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para18">Copies of the Review have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

 The Food Chain Group comprised senior figures from the National Farmers Union, Food and Drink Federation, British Retail Consortium, IGD (formerly the Institute of Grocery Distribution) and MAFF, under the chairmanship of a senior MAFF official. The Group was invited to review the opportunities for working together and increasing understanding amongst the players in the food chain, and between the industry and consumers.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para19">The Group has reported to me on the challengers and opportunities facing the food chain. The report stresses the vital importance of a viable and competitive food chain and identifies the need for action by industry and government to underpin consumer confidence in the quality and value of our food. The key messages include calls to: enhance the dialogue between partners in the food chain; improve communications with consumers; strengthen consumer confidence; and understand and act upon consumer concerns. The need for joined-up help from the Government to improve the industry's competitiveness is also identified.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para20">I have asked the Policy Issues Council of IGD, which has senior representation across the supply chain, to consider how industry could best take the issues forward. We intend to review progress next Summer.
<P>

<a name="91118w03.html_para21">The report is being sent to a wide range of agri-food organisations and interests, and further copies are available from my Department. Copies have also been placed in the Library of the House.
