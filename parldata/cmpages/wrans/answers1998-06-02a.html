To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the current backlog in road maintenance on <i>(a)</i> trunk roads and <i>(b)</i> other adopted roads.  [43188]<P>

<P>
<a name="80602w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In December last year, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced an increase of 50% in the Highways Agency's provision of capital maintenance on trunk roads and motorways to &#163;300m for 1998-99. It is estimated that this will overcome underfunding in recent years and hold the trunk road network in a steady state condition. There is currently no central government estimate of maintenance backlog for local authority roads. Road maintenance for the future is an issue which we are considering in the Comprehensive Spending Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on Government policy in relation to proposals from the Water Companies Association to increase abstraction to meet demand in areas of water shortage.  [43548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80602w01.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Proposals for new or increased abstractions of water to serve the needs created by development must be discussed with the Environment Agency which regulates abstractions through its licensing system. A review of that licensing system was announced at the water Summit last May and we shall shortly be publishing a consultation paper on a range of proposals for change. Water companies have duties to maintain and develop efficient and economical water supply systems to meet the needs of their areas, and to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. They are currently preparing water resource plans to maintain a balance between demand and supply over the next 25 years.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency regularly reviews the operation of its trunk roads and last year commissioned its agent, at that time, Shropshire County Council, to carry out a number of safety and traffic calming studies on the A49.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80602w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In the last year I have received representations concerning some 35 cases involving the NHBC Buildmark warranty scheme, some of which also involved NHBC in its capacity as an approved building control inspector. From these representations and other sources I am aware of the dissatisfaction with the way the Buildmark scheme sometimes operates. That is why, on three occasions in the past year, I have met the Chief Executive and other senior staff of the NHBC to hear progress with their Buildmark review. I am awaiting a further update from them on action to improve the operation of the scheme. As regards building control, I have welcomed the setting up by the Construction Industry Council, the Local Government Association and the Association of Corporate Approved Inspectors of a steering group to draw up recommendations on a common performance standard applicable to private sector approved inspectors and to local authority building control officers.

 The Highway Code contains advice for road users and aims to help prevent accidents by ensuring that all road users follow the same rules. The Code is being revised. We are considering how to highlight the need for motorists to be aware of vulnerable road users. In July there will be a 25 per cent. increase in the number of questions on driver awareness of all vulnerable road users in the driving theory test question bank. We also provide a wide range of publicity and information material for use by Road Safety Officers, police, schools and others to promote consideration for vulnerable road users. Examples include the Horse Sense for Motorists and the Drive Safe Cycle Safe leaflets.

 I am today placing in the Library copies of a summary of the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation. The Index of Local Deprivation combines 12 up to date measures on different aspects of deprivation into a single indicator for all local authority districts in England. The Index will be used as background information for the development of regeneration policy and programmes. A further review of the Index will be commissioned later this year to take account of new data sources relevant to deprivation which will include income support statistics for areas smaller than local authority districts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action the Government are proposing to take to control and eradicate the infestation of termites at Saunton, North Devon; and if he will make a statement.  [44136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80602w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government are determined to do everything possible to contain and destroy the termite infestation at two properties in Saunton, North Devon. Our priority is to stop the infestation spreading and to destroy it at source.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para0">I can therefore announce that the Government will fully fund a 12 year eradication and control programme, costing some &#163;190,000, which will start immediately the consent of the affected owners has been received.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para1">As my noble Friend Baroness Hayman indicated in Another Place on 28 April 1998, <i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, columns <i>150-53</i>, when the presence of this reinfestation became known the Government asked the Building Research Establishment (BRE) to explore, as a matter of urgency, the optimum means of eradicating the termites. The programme--which has been drawn up at my request by the Building Research Establishment together with experts from agencies including the Pest Management Unit of Imperial College (London), the Natural Resources Institute and CTBA-BIOTEC, France--will be based on close monitoring within 500 metres of the affected properties followed by baiting using an insect growth regulator which will prevent the developing insects from maturing.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para2">The Government have accepted these proposals as the best way forward, and the consortium led by the BRE has been asked to implement the eradication strategy forthwith. The proposal, based on the existing knowledge of the extent of the infestation, is to survey and monitor an area within a 500m radius of the known infestation, but to install a more intensive monitoring grid in the 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1998 : Column: 158</I><P>
grounds of the two affected properties and within a 200m radius of them. If surveys show that the activity extends beyond this area, it will be extended. Once activity is detected within the growth regulator hexaflumuron is proposed to be installed. Bait stations would also be installed at suitable locations within affected timbers in the infested properties. Monitoring will continue for up to ten years after activity has ceased in order to ensure that the treatment has indeed been effective. This work is dependent upon the co-operation of all property and land owners within this area, and officials in my Department are seeking their permissions as a matter of urgency.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para3">It should be stated that it is not possible to be certain of the outcome. The BRE report stresses that total eradication of a termite population is not normally considered feasible in other countries where the termite is endemic. However, since the population appears to be very restricted in this country, on the basis of the knowledge that this is a single infestation centred on two adjacent properties, we are assured by the experts that there is a high probability of success in eradicating the termite colony.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para4">As it is considered essential to do all possible to curtail this infestation before it spreads further, the Government have undertaken to fund the full cost of the eradication and monitoring work.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a further commencement order in respect of the Housing Act 1996, enabling disputes over the reasonableness of service charges between landlords and long leaseholders on which court proceedings began before 1 September 1997 to be transferred to leasehold valuation tribunals.  [44137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80602w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Today my Department is publishing for consultation proposals which should be welcome to a number of those leaseholders who have not so far been able to take advantage of the improved arrangements for dealing with service charge disputes under the Housing Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para5">Section 83 of that Act allows a residential tenant or landlord to go to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (LVT) rather than to a civil court when seeking a decision on whether or not service charges are reasonable. It also gives the court discretion to transfer to the LVT any question relating to the reasonableness of service charges which falls within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. This provision came into effect on 1 September 1997 but it has not so far been applied to cases where court proceedings had begun before that date. Representations have been made that this exclusion is unfair.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para6">Under the further Commencement Order proposed today, the court's discretion would also apply to cases where proceedings had begun before 1 September 1997. This would allow the courts to consider whether the interests of justice would best be served by transferring a service charge dispute in such a case to the LVT.
<P>

<a name="80602w02.html_para7">Subject to consultation, the proposed further Commencement Order should bring these new measures into effect in August 1998. Tenants involved in

 I am today issuing a consultation paper, jointly with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales, setting out the Government's proposals to amend the Reservoirs Act 1975. These proposals involve the transfer of the Secretaries of States' responsibilities for making appointments to the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the transfer of local authorities' enforcement duties in England and Wales to the Environment Agency. I am satisfied that these measures will result in the procedures being made less burdensome both for candidates for appointment and for reservoir undertakers. The amendments would be made by an Order under section 1 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. I have today placed a copy of the consultation paper in the Library of the House.

 The House has risen before 7 pm on Thursdays on three occasions since January 1995 and on a further 15 occasions the business under consideration at that time was the half-hour adjournment. My hon.

The Committee also said that 7.00 pm on the other Thursdays should be the normal time for completion of main business. On the 26 Thursdays before non-sitting Fridays since January 1995, the House rose before 8 pm on 11 occasions and before 9 pm on eight other evenings. On the 83 Thursdays preceding sitting Fridays since then, the House rose between 10 and 10.30 pm on 44 occasions, later than that on eight occasions and adjourned before 9 pm on 26 evenings.

 The procedures for appointments to the consumer councils for which I am responsible have been drawn up since Lord Nolan published his report and are fully compliant with the Guidance of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. An advertisement for appointments to a number of consumer councils, including the Post Office Users National Council, appears in the press annually. At the time of advertising we also seek nominations from a number of sources including the Council Chairmen, the Public Appointments Unit and all consumer representative organisations and minority groups. Applications are considered by an interview panel, which includes an independent representative, and a short list of candidates is interviewed. Thereafter Ministers select appointees from among all those successful at interview on the basis of merit. This year I expect to be able to confirm the appointments to the Post Office Users National Council by October. I am seeking to ensure that this recruitment provides for better representation of gender and ethnic minorities.

<P>

 The Fireworks Bill is a Private Member's Bill which, if enacted, would provide the capability to deal with issues which cannot be addressed under the presently available powers. However, the fact of the Bill reaching the statute book would not of itself result in any new controls on fireworks being introduced. A key element in the Bill is a provision which would allow for the introduction of a training regime for the organisers of firework displays.

<a name="80602w03.html_para8">The Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997, which I made in September 1997, introduced a number of firework safety measures including banning bangers, flash bangers, fireworks with erratic flight, aerial shells, maroons and other large fireworks from sale to the public. The Regulations also place limits on the size of certain fireworks--such as Roman Candles--which can be sold to the public. These restrictions apply both to imported fireworks and to those manufactured in the United Kingdom.

 I have today placed in the Library of the House figures for the United Kingdom under the new format showing national holdings of civil plutonium as at 31 December 1997. These figures are published as part of the UK's renewed commitment to improve transparency and openness in its management of our national holding of civil plutonium. This follows the same format as that announced on 2 December 1997 for holdings as at 31 December 1996. In accordance with the requirements of the 'Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium', I have today sent a copy of the figures to the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who will be circulating it to Member States in due course.

The terms of the Broadcasting Act 1990 require that licences awarded by the ITC under that Act contain no positive requirements for specific programming categories or quality. The ITC will however continue to monitor conditions relating to local programming in cable licences issued by the Cable Authority under the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984, for which the Commission is now responsible.

 Provisions in the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>] place a statutory duty on the Court of Appeal to consider producing sentencing guidelines. The Bill also establishes a new sentencing advisory panel which will offer advice to the Court of Appeal.

 Of the &#163;159 million allocated to health authorities in England, over one fifth (some &#163;35 million) was transferred to social services departments for projects where the need was specifically for social care. Details of the precise spend on other projects which involved joint working with social services is not available centrally. However, we made it clear that all projects funded by the additional resources should be developed in consultation with local social services departments.

 I understand that this case is about a woman who has not been able to obtain in-vitro fertilisation treatment in Cumbria as she is not eligible under the North Cumbria Health Authority's criteria for infertility treatment. Like most National Health Service treatments, infertility treatment is funded through the general funding of health authorities, and decisions about the allocation of resources and about who should be eligible for treatment are the responsibility of individual authorities. We are determined to address concerns that the NHS should provide equality of access to services throughout the country and are currently considering what further advice the NHS should be given on infertility service provision.

 The Department is undertaking a number of relevant activities. Guidance on hospital discharge is under review.

The Department is working with health and social services authorities to develop assessment and care management, including written care plans for all patients on discharge from hospital, rehabilitation and recuperation services and joint investment plans.

 In the White Paper "The New NHS" we announced the end of the internal market in the National Health Service. The new National Institute for Clinical Excellence will set the standards of care that must be equally available to all. For the first time, the Government will require managers throughout the NHS to give as much attention to the effectiveness of treatments as to efficiency and cost. We will develop and publish National Service Frameworks which will make it clear what patients can expect from the NHS, and we will use the Service Frameworks to drive up quality through our management of NHS performance.

 The Calman/Hine report on cancer services recognises the importance of high quality research and recommends that this is carried out throughout the cancer care network--in cancer units, cancer centres; primary care and within the voluntary sector. This means that the necessary population is available for research; there is close liaison between the service and the research; and the results leading to improved care can be disseminated quickly.

 Coronary heart disease is one of the biggest killers in this country. It accounts for some 120,000 deaths a year including premature deaths. Its incidence shows marked social class inequality. For example, men of

<P><I>2 Jun 1998 : Column: 172</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80602w06.html_para0">The Government are undertaking a variety of initiatives to tackle the risk factors for coronary heart disease. These include the forthcoming White Paper on tobacco control, a major campaign, called "Active for Life" to publicise the significant health benefits of moderately intense physical activity, a review, last year, of effective interventions in the prevention and treatment of obesity, and a directory of weight management services available across the National Health Service in England. We also launched a rolling programme of National Service Frameworks including the development of a framework for the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease, which will set national standards; put in place strategies to support implementation; and establish performance measures against which progress in reducing preventable death, tackling inequalities, and ensuring consistency of treatment, will be measured. The emerging findings from this work are expected in the autumn, and will be published and disseminated.

All the projects are geared to answering the question: what actions on the part of health and other services can be effectively taken to reduce inequalities in health? In addition the Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health is reviewing existing research on this issue. Further research will be commissioned in the light of the Inquiry's report.

the ground. This &#163;22 million will be deliberately targeted to areas with higher numbers of non-fundholding general practitioners in recognition of the fact that they do not have the resources of the fundholder management allowances to draw on. It takes account of the fact that primary care management resources--including GP computing cash--has been unevenly distributed in the past. This is a first step to restoring equity across practices. It will be for local doctors and nurses to decide with their health authority how this money is best spent. This additional support will help family doctors and community nurses get their local Primary Care Group right so that patients get the maximum benefit from the new arrangements.

 It is the duty of health authorities to arrange the provision of specialist palliative care services (including hospice care) commensurate with the assessed health needs of their populations, in the same way as for other health services.

These data are not broken down between private and National Health Service sight tests, but we would expect optometrists to adopt common practices for both groups of patients.

 The majority of board members of non-departmental public bodies give their time and services voluntarily and receive no payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where members do receive remuneration, this can vary between an annual salary, an honorarium or an attendance fee (which itself can be a daily rate or a half-daily rate, or calculated on a per meeting or per case basis). Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable. Full details of all payments to board members of non-departmental bodies, by gender, are given in the Cabinet Office publication "Public Bodies". Copies of "Public Bodies 1997" are available in the Libraries of the House.

 All children are entitled to the financial and emotional support of both their parents wherever they live.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary questions about the Social Fund (SF) loans and grants available to the victims of the recent floods in Northampton.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Over the Easter weekend, the Benefits Agency (BA)'s Northampton office was open to personal callers and for telephone enquiries. The Business Manager appeared on BBC Radio Northampton to publicise the additional opening hours and to give advice to the public. Social Services and the Police were also advised of the additional opening. All applications for immediate help on Sunday 12 and Monday 13 April were awarded. On Tuesday 14 April a flood helpline was made available to the public, giving them direct access to staff able to answer their enquiries. This telephone number was advertised in the local press and on local radio. District staff also attended public meetings, held on 14, 15 and 16 April, to offer advice and assistance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In common with all client groups, pensioners who were affected by the floods in Northampton were eligible to apply to the SF for Community Care Grants (CCGs) if they were receiving Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA(IB)), Budgeting Loans (BLs) if they have been in receipt of IS or JSA (IB) for 26 weeks or more and Crisis Loans (CLs) which might be payable irrespective of whether the applicant was in receipt of benefit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BA measures the time taken to process applications to the SF by a series of targets which monitor the time from the date of receipt of the application to the date of the decision, not the date the applicant receives the funds. Information on the time taken to process CCGs, BLs and CLs is contained in the enclosed Table 1.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information relating to the range of time taken to process CCGs, BLs and CLs is not available and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Information relating to the number and average value of grants and loans received by flood victims in Northampton is not available in the format requested. The BA collates statistics by BA Districts. These Districts do not correspond to constituency boundaries or specific geographical areas.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BA does not routinely collate the reasons for SF applications. However, because of the nature of this emergency, the Northamptonshire District has maintained certain details of applications received from flood victims. Such information as is available is contained in Table 2 attached.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope that this is helpful.</FONT></UL>

(5) We aim to clear applications that are specifically for CLs on the day the application is received. All applications to the SF are considered for CCGs and BLs initially. At the point when the SF Officer knows that such an award is inappropriate a CL is considered. Whilst the majority of CL applications are made in person, a proportion of postal applications are received. Therefore, for the purpose of measuring performance, the target is considered to have been met if 95% of CL applications are considered on the day on which they were received<P>

 Although the Benefits Agency does not formally employ "benefits advisers", I can confirm that staff in every office of the Agency are able to provide advice about benefit entitlements and related matters, or to obtain such advice. Similarly, in 1979, every local benefits office in the Department of Health and Social Security employed staff who were able to provide or obtain such advice.

2. Sickness Benefit and Invalidity Benefit were replaced by a single Incapacity Benefit in April 1995. Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance introduced in 1992<P>

3. The figures do not include all expenditure to people of working age--for example, War Pensions paid to disabled people. Table 4 of the Departmental Report attributes expenditure for a particular benefit to the group where the majority of expenditure arises--in the case of War Pensions this applies to people over working age. The figures also include some expenditure for people not of working age. The figures for Disability Living Allowance include payments made in respect of children under age 16 and to people over age 60<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he proposes to allow prisoners to have televisions in their cells; and if he will make a statement.  [44219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80602w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 Except in a very limited number of cases for educational purposes, prisoners in Scotland have not been allowed to have televisions in their cells.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para0">However, having taken into account the support for wider availability of in-cell television evinced by a number of studies--and most recently by the review by the Social Work Services and Prisons Inspectorates of community disposals and the use of custody for women offenders in Scotland--I have decided that in-cell television should be made available on a limited pilot basis as a suicide prevention measure at Cornton Vale women's prison.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para1">The first sets will become available this Autumn. Eligible prisoners will pay a charge of around &#163;1.00 per week to cover the cost of the sets, out of a weekly wage of around &#163;6.00 per week, from which prisoners have to buy all of the items they are allowed but which are not provided by the prison authorities, including 'phone cards, additional toiletries, tobacco and sweets. They will have access to terrestrial channels only, during "lock-up" hours.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para2">Our expectation is that in-cell television will assist greatly in the normalisation of the prison environment at Cornton Vale, and reduce instances of self-harm among the more damaged members of its population. We shall monitor its use in the pilot study to ensure that it has no detrimental effect on prisoners' participation in the regime of the establishment.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para3">Consideration is also being given as to when this provision might be extended as an opportunity for a relatively small number of more responsible prisoners at the top end of the prison regime in Scotland, who would earn the privilege of access to in-cell TV through responsible behaviour. Out of a prison population of more than 6,000, such an extension would result in some 500 prisoners qualifying over time.

<P>
<a name="80602w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The International Whaling Commission's 50th annual meeting was held in Oman from 16 to 20 May. The United Kingdom delegation was composed of officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, assisted by officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and by representatives of environmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para4">At this meeting our delegation emphasised that the UK remains strongly opposed to all whaling, other than some limited subsistence whaling by indigenous people. We 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1998 : Column: 200</I><P>
made it clear that we would like to see all other forms of whaling, including so-called 'scientific' whaling, brought to an end and a permanent, comprehensive international ban on whaling introduced.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para5">It is with these objectives in mind that we are participating in consideration of ideas put forward by Ireland at the IWC's last annual meeting in Monaco last October. These ideas are intended to provide the basis for a compromise solution acceptable both to those countries opposed to, and to those countries in favour of, whaling. There was only limited further discussion of the Irish proposals in Oman. The UK delegation made it clear once again that while we were prepared to discuss these proposals, and all other possible ways of improving the conservation of whales, we continued to have serious reservations about some aspects of them, in particular those concerning coastal whaling. We and a number of other countries also stressed that further progress on them was unlikely unless the two whaling countries, Norway and Japan, indicated a readiness to end pelagic, and in particular so-called 'scientific', whaling and to accept a ban on international trade in whalemeat: this they declined to do. Nevertheless, the Irish Commissioner, who is the current chairman of the IWC, said that the proposals would remain on the table and that he would continue to try to advance them.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para6">Throughout the meeting the UK delegation stressed our strong support for the current moratorium on commercial whaling. We opposed a request by Japan for a quota of 50 minke whales, which I am pleased to say was again defeated, and we supported resolutions criticising Norway and Japan's continued whaling activities; although these do not conflict with the letter of the IWC's rules we and many others believe that they are contrary to their spirit and undermine the credibility of the IWC and of the moratorium.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para7">In recent years the UK has been arguing that environmental pollution and climate change may pose significant long term threats to whales and other cetaceans, and urging the IWC to devote more effort towards assessing these threats. At this meeting two significant resolutions were adopted. The first confirms that environmental issues are central to the IWC and directs the IWC's scientific committee to continue its work on the development of long term research programmes on the effects of pollution and climate change on cetaceans. The second deals with the financing of these programmes: it records an agreement in principle to find the necessary funds, drawing if need be on the IWC's financial reserves, and to consider establishing a dedicated Environment Research Fund. I very much welcome the increased emphasis that the IWC is now placing on this important area.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para8">The UK delegation again expressed our concern about the cruelty involved in killing whales. It was agreed that a workshop comprising scientific and veterinary experts would meet next year, immediately before the next annual meeting, to consider ways of improving the humaneness of whale killing methods. The UK will be playing a full role in the workshop.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para9">Small cetaceans continue to be threatened by human activities in many parts of the world. We took the lead in putting forward a resolution which drew attention to the number of beluga whales killed in subsistence hunts in 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1998 : Column: 201</I><P>
West Greenland and to doubts among scientists that the current level of exploitation may not be sustainable. The IWC Scientific Committee will be examining this issue at its meeting next year. We also drew attention to the numbers of Dall's porpoise killed in directed takes in Japan.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para10">Other important issues were discussed at this meeting. We and a number of other delegations expressed concern at evidence presented to the IWC's Scientific Committee suggesting that illicit trade in whalemeat may be taking place, and a resolution was adopted reaffirming the need for close co-operation between the IWC and CITES on trade issues and calling on all IWC members to respect previous resolutions on illegal trade in whalemeat. There was a positive debate on whalewatching. The UK highlighted the continuing expansion of this popular tourist activity and underlined the importance of the IWC's role in preparing guidelines and overseeing development in this area. Finally, Japan's proposal to amend the IWC's rules of procedure to allow secret voting on policy issues was heavily defeated.
<P>

<a name="80602w13.html_para11">Overall, I believe that this was a successful meeting for the UK. We achieved the majority of our objectives: in particular the moratorium on commercial whaling has not been weakened and there was further recognition of the increasing importance to the IWC of environmental issues. I will now be working with the environmental organisations and Government departments represented on the Consultative Forum on Whaling to formulate our objectives for the IWC's next annual meeting, which will take place in Grenada in June 1999.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what quotas of minke whales were granted to Norway and Japan over the past five years.  [43431]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80602w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 None. Under the terms of the current International Whaling Commission moratorium, commercial catch limits have been set at zero. Norway's commercial whaling is carried out under objection to the moratorium and its quota is self-awarded. Japan issues special permits to take minke whales in both the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific as part of its scientific research programme.

 In 1995 MAFF commissioned a three year agronomic and environmental evaluation of set-aside in England from a consortium including the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the British Trust for Ornithology and 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1998 : Column: 202</I><P>
ADAS and this has now been completed. The evaluation concluded that for most farmers the agronomic costs of set-aside are small, with if anything a yield benefit to crops following set-aside and few increases in pest, weed or disease problems.
<P>

<a name="80602w14.html_para0">Many farmers have observed positive environmental effects from set-aside and studies indicated that set-aside has benefited some species of farmland birds whose numbers have been in decline in recent years. Field studies showed that set-aside was an important habitat for these birds providing breeding sites and valuable food resources. The Government will consider how voluntary set-aside and the agri-environment schemes can be used to help to retain these benefits if the rate of compulsory set-aside is reduced as a result of EU Commission CAP reform proposals.

<P>
<a name="80602w14.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I chaired a meeting of the European Union Agriculture Council in Brussels on 25 and 26 May. My noble Friend Lord Donoughue, the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the farming and food industry, represented the United Kingdom, and my noble Friend Lord Sewel, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, was also present.
<P>

<a name="80602w14.html_para2">The principal business of the Council was to assess progress in negotiations on the Commission's proposals for CAP reform made in the framework of Agenda 2000. Those negotiations were launched at a special meeting of the Council which I chaired on 31 March 1998, and have continued at an intensive pace at expert level since then. In the Council, EU Ministers recognised the excellent start which had been made to this work, and discussed draft conclusions which I circulated as Presidency summarising the work to date, identifying the principal issues central to the on-going negotiation, and committing the Council to continuing its intensive work on the Agenda 2000 proposals from now on.
<P>

<a name="80602w14.html_para3">I am pleased to say that the Council was able to give unanimous approval to those conclusions, which will now be submitted to Foreign Ministers for inclusion in the report to Heads of Government meeting in Cardiff on 15-16 June. The Agriculture Council will then continue its discussions of Agenda 2000 at its July meeting.
<P>

<a name="80602w14.html_para4">The Council also debated the Commission's proposal on reform of the EU olive oil regime, and noted the principal questions remaining to be resolved on that proposal. I undertook to continue work on the proposal in the hope of finding a basis of agreement at the Council in June.

 On admission to a higher education institution, a student is personally liable for the fees charged and liability will continue irrespective of the student's personal circumstances. Where the student holds a mandatory award from an LEA and is eligible for assistance with fees because he or she is from a lower-income family, the LEA will assess and make a contribution from public funds. We have asked higher education institutions to be sensitive in collecting the private contribution in the early months of the degree course having regard to individual circumstances as necessary.

 The Government wish, through the use of high quality and innovative provision, to build on the experience gained from the New Deal for 18-24 year olds in taking forward the pilots for unemployed adults aged 25 and over, which were announced by the Chancellor in the Budget, 17 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1097-112, and which are due to begin in November.

<a name="80602w15.html_para0">In the answer that I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) on 14 May 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>181-82,</i> I announced an invitation to existing private sector led New Deal partnerships to bid for the delivery of ten of the pilots. I am now inviting by means of a letter distributed this week through Employment Service Regional Directors, each of the remaining New Deal partnerships to bid for the delivery of one of the rest of the pilots. The bids will be assessed in terms of both quality and innovation and their provision of a robust basis for evaluation. For this reason we will not be inviting bids from areas which overlap with any of the prototype Employment Zones established in February. We will also need to consider carefully the case for pilots in areas where in-work benefits Earnings Top Up schemes are operating.
<P>

<a name="80602w15.html_para1">We aim to announce the successful bidders, which will number around 20, by September.
