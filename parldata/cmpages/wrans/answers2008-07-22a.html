 In June this year we published the Legacy Action Plan (LAP) which sets out the long term benefits we hope to stimulate through hosting the Olympic games and Paralympic games in 2012, and how we plan to achieve them. This is unprecedented as no other host city has ever been at this stage of planning, nor so committed to a broad and sustainable legacy this early in preparations.</p>

Sport England will seek to get one million more active through sport; they will do this through new engagement with national governing bodies and through county sport partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_616"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para5"><a name="0807233000044">Further to the announcement in June, Government have now set out further details of the &#163;140 million cross-Government free swimming scheme. The scheme is designed to encourage as many local authorities as possible to participate in making swimming free for over 60s and under 16s in their local communities, but also to stimulate ambitious authorities to maximise and sustain uptake through other initiatives such as free lessons for adults who cannot swim, the introduction of swimming coordinators and to provide incentives for the most ambitious to move further towards a universal free swimming offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para6"><a name="0807233000045">The LAP also includes initiatives to stimulate economic and social benefit by increasing tourism and improving access to skills and business opportunities. This includes, for example, the London 2012 Business Network giving business across the UK access to the 75,000 contracts in the London 2012 supply chains worth &#163;6 billion.</p>

 The UK Government have been working closely with the major international organisations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN agencies and International Food Policy Research Institute) in order to assess future price trends and cereal production. Increased cereal production and the removal of export bans have brought about a calming of markets, and prices have fallen back from the very high levels seen earlier this year. But the consensus remains that the underlying demand for food remains strong, and this is likely to keep prices high for some years yet, with the trend price for grains stabilising at around 10-25 per cent. higher than 2001 levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="80722w0003.htm_para8"><a name="08072322000192">Many countries have experienced serious social and economic consequences of the recent surge in food prices, aggravated by similar movement in fuel prices. The macroeconomic impact on developing countries varies according to the degree of dependency on food and fuel imports. Some countries (e.g. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Mozambique) are experiencing significant food price rises; some (e.g. Kenya and Zanzibar) are experiencing clear food shortages; countries in West Africa (e.g. Nigeria and Niger) are heavily affected due to their reliance on imports from international markets; some (Malawi and Zambia) are relatively insulated from global price movements, while others (e.g. Vietnam) are benefiting. The poorest are hardest hit, with some families spending up to 90 per cent. of their income on food. The UK Government are pressing for a global partnership to address both the short term impact of surging food prices, and the longer term challenges of promoting food security for the 850 million people who continue to face hunger.</p>

Those factors include the introduction of the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 and the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005, improvements in the accuracy of the vehicle register, various Government and local campaigns to tackle abandonment, and the continuing high value of scrap metal.

 In 2003 the Environment Agency commissioned a report on the Prioritisation of Flame Retardants for Environmental Risk Assessment. The aim of the study was to assess the use of and risks associated with flame retardants, in particular to identify substances that might require detailed consideration in terms of their possible impact on the environment. It also considered issues concerning substitution of flame retardants. The study noted that little was known about the effects of many of the substances, including those sometimes proposed for use as environmentally-friendly substitutes.</p>

REACH also has the aim of replacing substances of very high concern, as defined by criteria in the regulation, with suitable alternatives. Industry will have to justify their continued use. These provisions will drive substitution of harmful substances and also provide the assurance that the substitutes are less harmful than the substances they replace. On current evidence decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) does not meet the criteria of a substance of very high concern.</p>

We are working closely with relevant stakeholders, including through the Rural Climate Change Forum and the Farming Futures communications project, to help ensure that farmers have the information and advice they need to take practical action to reduce GHG emissions. As such, we are promoting anaerobic digestion to reduce methane emissions from manure, slurry and other organic material.</p>

The legislation has been drawn up so that implementation will take account of the interests of landowners and minimise any impact on businesses.

 DEFRA published farm incomes in England by farm type in January 2008. These were based on figures from the Farm Business Survey. Farm Business Income per farm on dairy farms was expected to have increased to &#163;50,700 in the year ended February 2008, from &#163;33,600 in the previous year&#151;an increase of about 50 per cent. This was largely due to a higher farm gate milk price in 2007-08, although higher input costs, particularly feed, dampened down the size of the expected increase. This compares with the average income across all types of farms, including dairy farms, which was expected to have increased by 20 per cent. from &#163;37,600 to &#163;45,000 in 2007-08.

Therefore, it is unknown whether the differences in the abundances obtained were indicative of an actual change in abundance or were related to the different methodology used. Additionally, these two surveys only covered the continental shelf area. This species is known to move widely between inshore and offshore areas.</p>

As with all plant protection products, users should always read and follow the label instructions; this is a statutory requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_711"><a name="80722w0009.htm_para0"><a name="08072322000892">Some cases of damage to susceptible crops which appear to involve the weed killer aminopyralid have arisen recently. In such cases, the label precautions on the use of manure may not have been followed when manure has been supplied to allotment holders and gardeners. The manufacturer has indicated that they are withdrawing products which contain aminopyralid from sale and PSD is formally suspending their authorisations while they investigate the options for preventing a recurrence of this problem. A key issue in their consideration will be whether the conditions of use regarding manure are sufficient, or sufficiently well known.</p>

 The River Mimram lies outside the area of contamination. Sampling has shown that groundwater between the plume and the Mimram contains no bromate. Given this data and the generally stable nature of the plume the Environment Agency is confident that the Mimram is not, and will not be, subject to contamination by bromate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_712"><a name="80722w0009.htm_para1"><a name="08072322000899">Contamination of the chalk aquifer in Hertfordshire extends 20 km from Sandridge to the Lee Valley between Ware and Turnford, which includes Hoddesdon and Broxbourne. One borehole has been taken out of use for public supply. The contamination has restricted the use that can be made of seven other public supply boreholes and three private boreholes. The three private boreholes are all close to Sandridge. Concentrations of bromate and the size of the plume show no change with time.</p>

 The regulation of fishing activity in offshore waters is the responsibility of the EU Fisheries Council and the European Commission. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee has advised that, in respect of the offshore sites which it is so far proposed to designate as Special Areas of Conservation, the use of heavy towed gear should be prohibited in order to protect the features for which designation is proposed. Such controls already apply to the Darwin Mounds site, but it will be for the Commission to propose and ultimately for the Council to decide what measures, if any, should be applied in respect of the other sites proposed for designation.</p>

 The coverage of marine conservation zones (MCZs) proposed for designation under the draft Marine Bill will depend on the outcome of stakeholder-based regional projects being established by the statutory conservation agencies.

 The Forestry Commission's statutory remit under the Plant Health Act 1967 charges them with the responsibility for the protection of forest trees and timber against attack by pests. This statutory remit does not specifically extend to monitor amenity and urban trees in relation to pests and disease. In practice the Forestry Commission occasionally does this, either by individually financed surveys aimed at detecting specific pest problems, or by monitoring the issues raised in calls for advice through the Tree Health Diagnostic and Information Service operated by Forest Research. I have asked the Forestry Commission to consider whether there is a need to extend their remit to include a more targeted approach to amenity and urban trees.</p>

 The Gallagher review focused on the potential impacts of likely global demand for biofuels in 2020, rather than on the dynamics of specific regional biofuel markets. As part of this, it took account of matters such as the different types of biofuel feedstocks likely by 2020 to be used in different regions (including the EU, USA and China), and the different land requirements and impacts of these feedstocks. Matters such as current and projected levels of subsidies for biofuels and the impact these might have on different markets were outside the scope of the review.

 Where the particulate emissions limit is sufficiently strict as to oblige manufacturers to use a diesel particulate filter, as the future Euro VI standard proposed by the European Commission may be, the associated fuel consumption penalty would be likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent. if no offsetting improvements to engine or vehicle technology were made.</p>

The imposition of a carbon dioxide emission limit for lorries, would be technically very difficult and deliver limited environmental benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_798"><a name="80722w0017.htm_para4"><a name="08072356000525">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has its own well defined criteria for assessing the condition of its properties. For the majority of SFA, this consists of a list of over 100 individual attributes that are assessed to arrive at an overall Standard for Condition (SfC) score for the property. SfC scores are banded into categories, S1fC the highest to S4fC the lowest. SfC assessment includes aspects such as the structure of the property, its energy efficiency, health and safety features, security arrangements and sanitary items as well as an assessment of the kitchen and bedrooms. On that basis, the majority of SFA is already at either S1fC or S2fC. This includes over 12,800 properties that have been upgraded to S1fC since 2001. By the end of this financial year, no Service family will have to live in S4fC accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_799"><a name="80722w0017.htm_para5"><a name="08072356000526">We are confident that the current SfC system used by the Department fully takes into account the four basic tenets of the Decent Homes Standard. Rather than simply conforming to a minimum acceptable level of accommodation, MOD aspires to provide accommodation to a higher standard; and this is reflected in the criteria that must be met to achieve S1fC. (All eight categories must score at Standard 1 for the overall Standard for Condition to be 1).</p>

 The theoretical phenomenon known as "popcorning" is a process whereby a series of accidental detonations of a number of warheads' conventional explosives could lead to some nuclear yield. This is extremely unlikely and could occur only if the warheads were located in close proximity to each other without mitigation. Warheads are designed such that there cannot be a nuclear detonation without authorisation.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="4"><i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Finished admission episodes (FAE)<br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
3. Secondary Diagnoses<br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care:<br>
F10 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>
K70 Alcoholic liver disease<br>
T51 Toxic effect of alcohol<br>
4. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
 Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 6. Uncrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

The remit of the programme was to place service users and carers at the heart of any new service model and build on the strengths of the third and private sector. The overall aim was to develop a new high quality system for delivering equipment which would give those supported by the state the sort of choice and control they have not previously enjoyed.

The Act requires, and the capability of the agency's board depends upon, the independence and a wide range of skills and experience of members, who together act in the public interest without regard for their own financial or other interests which could prejudice the exercise of their duties.

 The key elements of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 were as follows. The Act made provision for the creation of national health service foundation trusts (FTs), accountable to local communities rather than the Secretary of State; placed a duty on NHS bodies to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare that they provide; gave the Secretary of State power to publish standards in relation to healthcare; created a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (usually referred to as the Healthcare Commission (HCC)) and a Commission for Social Care Inspection; and made new provisions in relation to primary dental services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_880"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para9"><a name="08072356001663">There are now 103 NHS FTs in place. NHS FTs have demonstrated their ability to establish strong finances and deliver high quality services; the Healthcare Commission&#146;s Annual Healthcheck for 2006-07 showed that FTs are delivering better care and improved finances compared to non-FTs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_881"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para10"><a name="08072356001664">The Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, or HCC, reports directly to Parliament on the state of healthcare in England, and on the quality of NHS and independent healthcare, and its value for money. The assessment of individual providers of NHS healthcare takes into account the standards for healthcare published by Secretary of State. By bringing together the expertise of previous health inspection bodies, the HCC is helping to reduce the fragmentation of inspection, easing the burdens on front-line staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_882"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para11"><a name="08072356001665">Similarly, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is an independent body, which provides a comprehensive picture of the quality of social care services and the performance of local authorities in meeting social care needs in their areas. It gives a star rating to councils annually and, from 2008, a quality rating to care services. The CSCI regulates, inspects and reviews all adult social care services in the public, private and voluntary sectors in England. It does so on the basis of regulations and standards issued by the Secretary of State. It makes an annual report to Parliament on the state of social care that gives a comprehensive overview of the social care sector in England.</p>

 The guidelines on the quality of herbal medicinal products prepared by the European Medicines Agency largely reflect good practice identified by the herbal industry. In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. The MHRA would expect some rationalisation in the manufacturing of herbal medicines reflecting the fact that to carry out this activity to systematic standards within a regulated environment requires specialist expertise. However, there is no basis on which to make specific estimates and feedback to the MHRA from individual companies suggest that many are still developing their plans. So far 14 companies have submitted applications to register one or more product in the United Kingdom under the THR scheme and we therefore anticipate that there will be a competitive market.</p>

 My right hon. Friend The Secretary of State would grant closed directions under section 7(2) of the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1967 in respect of staff transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) to qualifying social enterprises. A qualifying social enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community. The following legal forms will be acceptable; a registered charity, a community interest company or an industrial and provident society. The terms of the direction would mean that staff would be able to remain members of the NHS Pension scheme. The direction would be specific to the staff named on the direction, the organisation applying for the direction and to them remaining working wholly on the contract in respect of which they were transferred or other national health service contracts. If staff are subsequently transferred to another social enterprise or organisation qualifying for a direction, then a further direction would be granted in respect of those transferring staff. Directions will not cover a member of staff recruited individually in the open market from the NHS or elsewhere.</p>

However, the Healthcare Commission has conducted audits of national health service trusts to look at whether trusts have published the required information. Each PCT is required under the equality legislation to equality impact assess their functions, policies, strategies and procedures.

5. Data Quality&#151;HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. Assessing growth through time&#151;HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be accounted for when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be accounted for when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
7. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
