<a name="80331w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Rapson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures he is taking to promote greater racial equality in the armed forces following the decision of the Commission for Racial Equality to abandon legal action against the Household Cavalry.  [37360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The decision by the Commission for Racial Equality on 25 March 1998 to abandon altogether the question of legal action against the Household Cavalry was most welcome. It reflects, quite rightly, the considerable efforts which have been made over the last two years, across all three Armed Services and including the Household Cavalry, following general criticisms of racial equality policies. To achieve this progress has required considerable determination which Sir Herman Ouseley, the CRE's Chairman has described as a 'model of leadership in action'. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I are delighted with the excellent progress which has now enabled the 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1998 : Column: 444</I><P>
Commission to recognise the Armed Forces' willingness to make real, permanent progress; I congratulate the Services for what has been achieved.
<P>

<a name="80331w01.html_para0">It is essential that the commitment to change is maintained. For this reason we have agreed a five year "Partnership Agreement" with the Commission and I am placing a copy in the Library. The Agreement is comprehensive and reflects the considerable challenges which lie ahead for the Armed Forces as they seek to put in place and develop, through the strong leadership now being demonstrated, robust racial equality policies. The Agreement, which includes meeting challenging ethnic minority recruitment targets and developing monitoring and evaluation of personnel policies, will require rigorous application. We will be looking to build upon the constructive cooperation we have had with the CRE. We know that the Services are determined to address the Partnership Agreement with vigour and we shall be fully supportive of their efforts.

<P>
<a name="80331w01.html_wqn2"><B> Sir Raymond Powell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 12 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>325</i>, what area of land at RNAD Trecwn, Pembroke, was disposed of; how much was received for it; in which publications its sale was advertised; how many bids were received for its purchase; and which bidder was successful.  [36768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The area of land sold at RNAD Trecwn, Pembrokeshire was 431 hectares. Advertisements were placed in the Estates Gazette, Leisure Week, the Irish Times, Cork Examiner, Western Mail, Property Week, and the Financial Times. Ten bids were received and a preferred purchaser was identified. When the purchaser subsequently withdrew in September 1997, the site was re-offered to the underbidders by formal tender. These bids were submitted and the successful bidder was Omega Pacific Limited. The sale was completed on 21 January 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the value of exports to <i>(a)</i> Bahrain, <i>(b)</i> Kuwait, <i>(c)</i> the United Arab Emirates, <i>(d)</i> Qatar and <i>(e)</i> Oman of (i) land systems and equipment; (ii) air systems and equipment, (iii) naval systems and equipment and (iv) services and consulting in each of the last five years.  [34758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The information requested relates to the procurement of defence equipment and services by foreign governments. Details have been provided to the Ministry of Defence either directly by those governments or voluntarily by British companies under commercial confidentiality constraints.
<P>

<a name="80331w01.html_para2">Officials are currently reviewing whether the information may be released under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. I will write to the hon. Member as soon as that review has been completed. A copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1998 : Column: 445</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80331w01.html_para3">In the interim, I can advise that the UK reports the annual export of major weapons systems to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms which was established in 1992. This information is provided voluntarily by industry on the understanding that, by virtue of its inclusion in the UN Arms Register, it will be made public. The table shows the UK's return for the countries specified according to UN Register category. Categories I, II and III are land systems, category IV and V and VII are air systems and category VI is a naval system. The UK's 1997 return to the Register will be available in May.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the pattern of military low flying activity in the United Kingdom during 1997.  [37361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Military low flying training continues to be a necessary contribution to our defence capabilities. The amount carried out in 1997 was about 5 per cent. lower than in 1996, measured in terms of hours booked, reflecting current requirements and commitments. The distribution across the country has not changed significantly. We try to spread the activity as widely as possible, but a variety of operational, geographic and climatic constraints inevitably mean that some areas continue to see a greater intensity than others.
<P>

<a name="80331w01.html_para6">I have today placed in the Library of the House a paper giving a detailed account of the pattern of activity. Further copies can be obtained from the following address:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has for the re-deployment of the Royal Air Force aircraft at Gioia del Colle in Italy; and if he will make a statement.  [37510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The six RAF Jaguars currently based at Gioia del Colle in Italy and their supporting RAF Tristar tanker based at Ancona will be redeployed to the UK on 6 April. This results from our assessment that it is no longer necessary to have the Jaguars based in Italy on a full time basis given the improving situation in Bosnia. The Jaguars will, however, remain on short notice to resume participation in operations over Bosnia if required.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will set out the basis on which <i>(a)</i> the &#163;300 million for winter pressures in the NHS and <i>(b)</i> the &#163;500 million additional NHS funding announced in the Budget were allocated between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. [36149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 March 1998]:</i> &#163;190 million of the &#163;300 million allocated for winter pressures in the NHS was divided up according to the long standing Barnett formula. A further &#163;80 million was allocated directly to the Department of Health to meet specific pressures in England. The remainder was found by the Department of Health through administrative savings.
<P>

<a name="80331w02.html_para0">All of the &#163;500 million additional NHS funding announced in the Budget was divided up in accordance with the Barnett formula.
<P>

<a name="80331w02.html_para1">These amounts are in addition to the &#163;1.2 billion that the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget in July 1997 which were also allocated in accordance with the Barnett formula.

<a name="80331w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 1998]:</i> The latest estimates of revenue from road fuel duties are &#163;18.9 billion in 1997-98 and &#163;21.2 billion in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="80331w02.html_para2">If the duty rates had increased in July 1997 and March 1998 in line with the 12 month RPI for September 1997 and September 1998 respectively, the estimates would have been &#163;18.4 billion in 1997-98 and &#163;19.6 billion in 1998-99.

<a name="80331w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise estimate that the cumulative increase in the RPI as a result of increases in petrol and diesel duty rates since 1992 (including the 1992 increase) has been 1.36 per cent. Had the duty increases been limited to increases in RPI, the cumulative impact would have been 0.58 per cent. The additional amount is therefore 0.78 per cent.

 <i>[holding answers 20, 23, 24 and 26 March 1998]:</i> The data requested are given in the table. It shows that the Budget has taken an important step towards tackling the unemployment and poverty traps. In-work incomes have increased, and the level at which families with 2 children start to pay effective income tax has risen from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. of average earnings. The number of families facing very high marginal deduction rates has been reduced significantly. In those cases where families may face a higher MDR, they will still be better off.

 <i>[holding answer 17, 24 and 26 March 1998]:</i> From April 2000 the Working Families Tax Credit will generally be paid through the wage packet. Couples will be able to choose which partner should receive the credit. The details of the new scheme, including the rules for dealing with particular situations, such as disagreements between partners, will be developed by the Inland Revenue over the coming months. Although the resolution of particular disagreements would, of course, depend on the specific facts of the case, the present presumption is that, where the couple disagree about which of them is to receive the credit, it would normally be paid to the partner who mainly cared for the children.

<P>
<a name="80331w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 1998]:</i> Central Government support for sport is channelled through the UK and English Sports Councils. As independent bodies established by Royal Charter, it is for the sports councils to determine what funding they make available to sports governing bodies.
<P>

<a name="80331w03.html_para2">I have no power to intervene in the day-to-day affairs of properly constituted governing bodies of sport. I recognise that regional boundary areas can cause some problems, but it is for British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) to establish and implement rules and regulations which they consider to be in the best interests, both for individual players and for the game as a whole.

 It is important that students, careers advisers and parents are aware of the range of career opportunities there are in tourism.

It is not possible, without disproportionate cost, to identify all measures which may have related, to a greater or lesser extent, to the work of secondary teachers.

<a name="80331w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The Government have decided to accept the recommendations contained in the Scottish Law Commission Report on Boundary Walls. The Commission have concluded that the existing law is clear and seems widely accepted since there has been no recent case law and little pressure for change. The law provides for the maintenance of a boundary wall as a whole while at the same time allowing each owner to make full use of this own section of the wall. The Commission have therefore recommended that there is no need for legislation to either re-state or amend the present law.

<a name="80331w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 For the purposes of the deprivation payments scheme in Scotland, the Jarman Index is applied to enumeration districts. Scotland uses 7 variables of the index: unemployment; numbers of elderly people living alone; household overcrowding; under 5s; single parent households; residents in ethnic minority households; and numbers who have moved house. The application of the index results in a score being given for each enumeration district which are then classified as areas of high, medium or low deprivation. A score of 50 or more indicates an area of high deprivation, 40 or more an area of medium deprivation and 30 or more an area of low deprivation. Each Health Board when calculating deprivation payments looks at each patient on a GP's medical list and pays the GP the relevant amount for the enumeration district in which the patient lives.

 Most prisoners serving sentences of between three months and four years will be eligible for consideration for release on home detention curfew. To be released, they must first pass a risk assessment and have a suitable release address.
<P>

<a name="80331w06.html_para5">The detail of the risk assessment is still being worked out and will need to balance properly any potential risk posed by the prisoner's release on home detention curfew against the risks involved in retaining prisoners in custody until their automatic release date when the curfew is not available.
<P>

<a name="80331w06.html_para6">Prisoners will be assessed on the basis of their potential threat to the public and the probability of their reoffending or failing to comply with their conditions of curfew. Prisoners who have demonstrated a successful record of temporary release would normally be expected to be suitable for release on home detention curfew. The risk assessment will also make clear, however, that prisoners convicted of offences to which Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies will not be released upon home detention curfew, save where there are exceptional circumstances, as this group of prisoners present a particular type of risk. We will, of course, keep this policy under review.

 With the implementation, on 1 April 1998, of the remaining provisions of Part IV of the Police Act 1997, the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO), hitherto part of the Home Office, will become an executive Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB). As an NDPB, PITO will henceforth be independent of the Home Office although, as the responsible Minister, my right hon.

Members are invited to write direct to the Organisation's Chairman, Sir Trefor Morris, if they have any questions or concerns about the information technology or procurement activities undertaken by PITO on behalf of the police service or other customers, or about its administration. Sir Trefor's address is: Police Information Technology Organisation, Room 504, Horseferry House, Dean Ryle Street, London SW1P 2AW.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paul Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to publish proposals for modernising the Police and Fire Service pension schemes.  [37339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Consultation documents on the two pension schemes have been published today. I have placed copies in the Library. Copies are also being sent to police forces and fire services, police and fire authorities, the police staff associations and the fire service unions in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They have been invited to comment by 31 July 1998.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1998 : Column: 467</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para4">The current police and fire service pension schemes were established to reflect the special nature of police and firefighting work. Of course, we continue to take this fully into account. But these schemes are very expensive, both for police officers, firefighters and the relevant authorities and are not necessarily in tune with current circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para5">Authorities, in particular, are faced with large annual increases to pension costs, consuming an increasingly large proportion of their total budget and thus eating into the resources available to run the services themselves.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para6">The consultation documents have two main objectives: to stimulate debate for modernised pension schemes for future police officers and firefighters, which bring pensions more in line with other public service pensions and make them more affordable; to reform aspects of the current arrangements for retirement on medical grounds.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para7">In considering options for a new pension scheme, the unique nature of police and firefighting work will be recognised. There is no intention of reducing the pension benefits which serving or retired police officers or firefighters are entitled to as members of their pension schemes. Any changes to such benefits would apply only to new entrants to the police or fire service.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para8">The level of early retirements on medical grounds in the police and fire service is unacceptably high and in many cases cannot be justified. Wide variations across the country between forces and brigades support this argument. Good management of ill-health retirement is crucial. The consultation documents suggest options for change which depend on better practice and, in the case of the police, on amending current legislation. I have separately announced changes in regulations and practice to deal with those situations where officers seek to retire early before the disciplinary process is complete.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para9">The Government firmly believe that modernisation of the two schemes is essential, particularly as any changes to the pension benefits of new entrants will take many years to come into effect.

<a name="80331w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Responsibility for funding Boards of Visitors and the Secretariat will be transferred from the Home Office to the Prison Service with effect from 1 April. There are in practice no tangible business links between the work of Boards and the core Home Office and the transfer will enable Boards to be funded appropriately. This change will in no way affect the independence of Boards. Prior to reaching a decision the Government consulted the National Advisory Council for Boards of Visitors.

<P>
<a name="80331w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), which is currently part of the Home Office, will be placed on an independent statutory footing on 1 April in accordance with Part I of the Police Act 1997. NCIS will continue to have a United Kingdom-wide remit. The National Crime Squad will be created on 1 April in accordance with Part II of the Police Act 1997 and will replace the six existing Regional Crime Squads in England and Wales. The accountability arrangements for both services are similar to those for police forces. Each will be maintained by a Service Authority performing the same role as a police authority for a police force.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para10">NCIS and the National Crime Squad will both be under the direction and control of a Director General holding the rank of chief constable. In recognition of their operational independence, hon. Members should write to the Directors General if they have any questions or concerns about the operations or day to day management of NCIS or the National Crime Squad. The Director General of NCIS is Mr. John Abbott QPM NCIS, PO Box 8000, London SE11 5EN. The Director General of the National Crime Squad is Mr. Roy Penrose OBE QPM, National Crime Squad, PO Box 2500, London, SW1V 2WF.

<a name="80331w07.html_para11">The Service Authorities will be responsible for securing that NCIS and the National Crime Squad are efficient and effective. They will provide strategic direction and oversight, leaving the day to day management of NCIS and the National Crime Squad to the Directors General. Any questions about the role of the Service Authorities should be addressed to their Chairman, the right hon. Sir John Wheeler JP DL, PO Box 2600, London SW1V 2WG.
<P>

<a name="80331w07.html_para12">My right hon.

We will, of course, deal ourselves with any questions about the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers or responsibilities in relation to the two services or wider policy issues. If such questions relate solely to the activities of NCIS in Scotland or Northern Ireland, it may be appropriate for the relevant Secretary of State to respond. Where other general information is sought, we shall provide it if available. We shall usually reply that

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the road traffic offences for which the police, or other agents, are entitled to levy spot fines; and what plans he has to extend this to other such offences.  [37111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There is no system of "spot" fines for road traffic offences in the United Kingdom, but the police (and, in some instances, their traffic wardens) may issue fixed penalty notices in respect of some offences. The recipient of a fixed penalty notice must pay the penalty (normally &#163;20 or &#163;40) within 28 days or request a court hearing if issue of the notice is disputed.
<P>

<a name="80331w08.html_para0">Section 51 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 enables the Secretary of State to provide by order for existing offences to become fixed penalty offences for the purposes of the Act. Schedule 3 to the Act, as amended by two Fixed Penalty Offences Orders (Statutory Instrument 1990/335 and Statutory Instrument 1992/345), lists these offences. A copy of the Act and amending legislation is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80331w08.html_para3">In addition, regulations made last year under the Environment Act 1995, which apply within seven local authority areas, provide that local authority officers or other persons authorised by the authority, may issue fixed penalty notices to drivers whose vehicles fail to comply with vehicle exhaust emissions standards when checks are carried out at the roadside.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what regulation applies to the private security industry.  [37053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No statutory regulation currently applies to the private security industry. We intend to introduce statutory regulation of the private security industry as soon as possible but we will not be able to bring forward early legislation, as we warned before the election. We have recently completed a consultation exercise with the industry and others on the best way to provide a comprehensive, effective and streamlined system for the whole of the private security industry. It is clear from the responses that there is general support for our approach from the industry itself as well as from other respondents and we hope to put forward firm proposals later this year. In the absence of statutory regulation, the industry has taken steps to regulate itself. Several independent Inspectorates exist, inspecting companies to relevant British Standards and the international quality standard BS EN ISO 9000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Labour Charter for Football published in 1995 proposed that the threshold for the offence of indecent or racist chanting under section 3 of the Football (Offences) Act 1991 should be lowered to catch chanting by an individual as well as chanting in concert with one or more others. The Football Task Force Report entitled "Eliminating Racism From Football" has endorsed that proposal. We are awaiting a suitable legislative opportunity to introduce this amendment but would look for the practical recommendations contained in the Task Force Report as a way forward until such time as a suitable opportunity arises.
<P>

<a name="80331w08.html_para9">We are presently conducting a review of all football-related legislation to see whether any further changes should be made.

<P>

 Enhancing and developing the role of schools is essentially a matter for local education authorities and school governing bodies. The White Paper--'Building Excellent Schools Together' sets out the Government's commitment to raise standards in every school in Wales and a programme of action to support local education authorities and governing bodies in achieving this.
<P>

<a name="80331w09.html_para4">The National Grid for Learning offers significant potential for improving support for schools in rural areas by providing 'on line' access to materials and services. The Welsh Office is currently working on the development of the Grid with LEAs and others.
<P>

<a name="80331w09.html_para5">Ensuring effective provision of school places while securing a more cost effective education service poses difficult decisions for local authorities given the particular role schools often occupy in rural communities. I have asked LEAs to consider innovative approaches such as federations, amalgamations or groupings as alternatives to school closure. Authorities in west Wales are already exploring this.

<a name="80331w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Maclennan: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if a decision has been reached regarding the future management of the Dounreay Shaft and Wet Silo; and if she will make a statement.  [37449]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's recommendation to me that the radioactive waste in the Dounreay Intermediate Level Waste Shaft and in the Wet Silo should be retrieved for treatment and storage has been accepted by the Government.
<P>

<a name="80331w10.html_para2">It is now clear that the Shaft does not provide standards of waste disposal that are acceptable today and that retrieval is the best practicable environmental option. It has the support of the relevant regulators, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and of the Government's advisory bodies, the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee and the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment. Special interest groups have also shown support of the retrieval option.
<P>

<a name="80331w10.html_para3">This decision has been taken following detailed engineering studies completed recently by the UKAEA, who operate the Dounreay site, which have shown that it is now technically feasible to recover waste from the Shaft in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.
<P>

<a name="80331w10.html_para4">I have also accepted the UKAEA's recommendation that it is now time to plan for the removal and treatment of wastes stored in the Wet Silo.
<P>

<a name="80331w10.html_para5">Retrieval and treatment will provide a long term solution to the problem of what to do with the waste placed in the Shaft and Wet Silo over the last four decades which has caused such concern to the public.
<P>

<a name="80331w10.html_para6">The Government believe that nothing is more important than safety in the management of nuclear decommissioning and radioactive waste. We are fully committed to caring for the environment and to taking action to deal with the difficult legacies from the past.
<P>

<a name="80331w10.html_para7">I expect that the difficult task of retrieving this waste will be tackled effectively over the coming years and will demonstrate that the UK is taking a world lead when dealing with nuclear decommissioning and radioactive waste management challenges.

<a name="80331w10.html_para8">Naturally, in the early stages of such a large and complex project, there are significant uncertainties about the costs. The most recent estimates presented to me by the UKAEA suggest that total indicative costs may lie in the range &#163;215-&#163;355 million. These costs, which are already budgeted for, will be incurred over approximately the next 25 years and will be met from public funds. This includes the first stage of the work which will be for the UKAEA to develop its plans by completing hydrogeological and engineering studies aimed at minimising technical risk and refining predicted costs. They expect expenditure on this work will amount to about &#163;4.5 million over the next five years. At each stage of the project the UKAEA's detailed plans will require approval from the NII and SEPA.

<a name="80331w11.html_para0">The Outward Mission Scheme is primarily aimed at providing practical and financial support to small to medium sized UK companies relatively new to the markets concerned to travel overseas as part of a group to promote UK exports of goods and services. Ministerial delegations and delegations led by senior officials are sometimes organised outside the scheme by the Department and other Government Departments where the nature of the event and status/experience of the companies would make financial support inappropriate. Details of ministerial missions organised by the Department since May 1997 were provided on 23 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>106-07</i>, in response to a question tabled by the hon.

<P>
<a name="80331w12.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when changes in the Budget relating to employee share schemes will be reflected in National Insurance contribution rules.  [37362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are proposing two changes to National Insurance contribution rules which will bring them closer to the income tax rules in relation to shares and share options. This will make for greater clarity for employers and help reduce the administrative burden the system places on them.
<P>

<a name="80331w12.html_para0">First, we intend to bring forward at Report stage in the House of Lords a new clause for inclusion in the Social Security Bill. That clause will change the National Insurance treatment of shares that are subject to the risk of forfeiture or that are convertible. The change will align the treatment of these shares under National Insurance legislation with the tax legislation announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget.
<P>

<a name="80331w12.html_para1">Alignment of National Insurance with the income tax rules will bring forward some important changes to make the National Insurance on shares and options easier for business to administer while guarding against their use in avoidance schemes.
<P>

<a name="80331w12.html_para2">The new clause will be tabled as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="80331w12.html_para3">It will mirror the proposed income tax treatment of remuneration in shares subject to forfeiture or conversion. To keep to a minimum the period over which the tax and National Insurance positions differ, the clause will apply to shares awarded from the date on which it is tabled. We expect that to be before the end of the current Committee stage in the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="80331w12.html_para4">The second change we propose is to match my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's extension of the "seven year rule" for share options when we align the National Insurance treatment of share options with the income tax position. Under the current income tax arrangements the award of an option over shares is taxed at the time of grant rather than exercise only where the options can be exercised more than seven years later. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has announced his intention to extend that limit to ten years. We intend to mirror this in future National Insurance legislation. When the relevant regulations made under clause 50 of the Social Security Bill come into force they will replace the National Insurance liability on grant of options with a liability on exercise, except in the case of options which can be exercised more than ten years later. This would take the great majority of options outside liability for National

<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The backdating proposals in Clause 72 of the Social Security Bill will not affect arrears of benefit following a successful appeal on a claim for that benefit. The change affects only the period before a claim is made or treated as made. A claim for benefit will have been made before decisions on that claim can be appealed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what would be the effect on <i>(a)</i> gross expenditure on retirement pensions, <i>(b)</i> income tax revenues and <i>(c)</i> expenditure on means-tested benefits of raising the basic state pension to the level of income support, with the pension rising with age to reflect the current structure of age-related premiums, but not to reflect premiums for disabilities or other additional needs.  [34127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is estimated that the gross cost of raising the basic pension to the level of the income support age-related premiums would be &#163;3.4 billion in 1998-99. Income tax revenue would be increased by an estimated &#163;0.2 billion. Information on income related benefit offsets is not available.

 The fact that a decision is changed on appeal does not, necessarily, mean that the earlier decision was incorrect. A person's condition may have deteriorated since they made their appeal or they may produce fresh evidence to the tribunal. The date from which benefit is awarded will also be determined by the tribunal. For example, where an award is made because of a subsequent change in the person's circumstances, benefit will be paid from the date of the change rather than the date of the decision appealed against.

[36434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Since 1990, the student loan has been an integral part of student support. Students are not obliged to take up a loan if they feel no need to do so. However as loans are made available from public funds they cannot be ignored in calculating entitlement to further help from public funds.

 The formula for the calculation of assumed or notional income from capital does not represent any assumed rate of interest. It does, however, avoid the many practical difficulties that would arise if actual income were taken into account when assessing entitlement to Housing Benefit. It also strikes a balance between encouraging people to save and an expectation that people with more substantial savings can make some contribution towards their living expenses.

<UL>(2) how many single pensioners awarded a &#163;10 Winter Fuel Payment have subsequently appealed and been granted a further &#163;10, in <i>(a)</i> Glasgow, Pollok, <i>(b)</i> Glasgow, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> in the United Kingdom; [35296]

(3) what steps are being taken to ensure that winter fuel payments for 1997-98 at &#163;20 are reaching those single pensioners in tenement homes, where a single house number covers several separate households; and what monitoring her Department will undertake to ensure payments reach such pensioners.  [35298]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Winter Fuel Payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help the vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for this winter and next, to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners receiving a retirement pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80331w13.html_para2">The making of this winter's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around fifteen million computer records, involving fifteen qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million payments will have been made to over seven million pensioner households by the end of March.
<P>

<a name="80331w13.html_para3">The administration of winter fuel payments is a matter for Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. He will write to my hon. Friend.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of almost ten million winter fuel payments to over seven million pensioner households before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to match around fifteen million computer records, involving fifteen qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. We expect that every eligible pensioner will have received a payment before the end of March 1998. This has been achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Planning for next winter's payments has already begun. Operational experience from the delivery of this winter's payments will be taken into account and changes will be made where considered necessary.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, received their payment during January. In order to determine whether each of the other eligible pensioners were entitled to a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10 it was necessary to undertake an exercise of data correlation of all addresses held in Departmental records. Where only one eligible person was identified as living at an address a payment of &#163;20 was made. Where more than one eligible person was identified as living at an address a payment of &#163;10 was made.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where official records showed that an address contained a number of separate households, for example numbered flats or bedsits, each separately identifiable unit was treated as a separate address for the purposes of determining the number of eligible pensioners in a household. Therefore, where only one common address was recorded for more than one eligible person, it was not possible to determine which, if any, lived in a household where there was no other eligible person. As a result, some eligible pensioners who live alone, but share a common address with other eligible persons, will have been sent a payment for &#163;10 when they should have received &#163;20.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The letter which accompanies the payment clearly explains the entitlement conditions and informs anyone who received a &#163;10 payment, but satisfies the conditions for a &#163;20 payment, to contact the Benefits Agency Office which deals with their pension, or telephone the Winter Fuel Helpline, to request the balance. Requests for a review of the original decision to pay &#163;10 are being dealt with as a matter of priority, particularly in the case of tenement residents.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Adopting this approach aimed to ensure that all payments were made as quickly as possible and disproportionate administration costs were not incurred.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information requested for Glasgow Pollok, Glasgow, Scotland and the United Kingdom is not currently available. This is due to the fact that those payments are still in the process of being issued. It is anticipated that this information will be available some time after the end of April. I will provide the information requested once it is available.</FONT></UL>

 Of the 31 species of Amazonian parrot, 13 are listed on Appendix I of CITES and Annex A of the European Regulation governing trade in Member States. This means that international trade in wild specimens of these species is effectively banned.

 I am concerned about current funding arrangements for statutory Joint Waste Disposal Authorities (JWDAs). At the moment, the constituent authorities share the costs according to their shares of the Council Tax base. This system does not reflect the service each authority draws from the JWDA and provides little encouragement for waste minimisation or other sustainable methods of waste management. The JWDAs have also expressed similar concerns to me.
<P>

<a name="80331w17.html_para0">Under a tonnage-based system, authorities' contributions would be apportioned on the basis of the amount of waste they had delivered for disposal in a preceding period. The more successful they are in minimising waste and diverting it to other forms of sustainable waste management such as recycling and composting, the less they would deliver for disposal and the less they would pay. This will form one more element in our policy to encourage waste management options higher up the waste hierarchy.
<P>

<a name="80331w17.html_para1">I have therefore requested officials in my department to work out methods for a tonnage-based system and to discuss them with the local authority associations.

<a name="80331w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Where imports of cereal feed contain a mixture of organic and genetically modified produce, separation is not possible. Equally, the rules of the World Trade Organisation constrain our ability to require segregation at source. However, a number of companies are seeking to import identity preserved cereals to overcome these difficulties. The Department has recently published a list of suppliers of non-genetically modified soya to help those who wish to purchase such material.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the US Government's public health policy regarding the daily usage of vitamin B6.  [36457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80331w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The basis of the US Government's estimate of the vitamin B6 requirement of healthy adults is 16 micrograms per gram of protein per day. This is virtually identical to the 15 micrograms per gram of protein per day that is the basis of the estimate for healthy adults in the UK. We are not aware of any US Government public health policy on the desirability of intakes above this level.
<P>

<a name="80331w19.html_para1">There are no specific statutory limits in the US on the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements sold under food law. However, US legislation appears to allow less scope for the introduction of such limits on a precautionary basis. In this respect, it would seem to afford less protection to consumers than UK legislation.

 The Department received 189 replies to the consultation document on increasing regulatory fees for residential care homes and nursing homes issued on 19 January. 106 respondents agree that fees should be increased, although many of these felt that the proposed increases were insufficient. Of the other respondents 80 felt the proposed increases were excessive and the remaining 3 did not express an opinion about the level of increases.
