To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he will take to improve competition in the market for bulk-buying of index linked annuities; and if he will make a statement.  [145727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The operation of the market in bulk annuities is a commercial matter for the companies and pension schemes concerned.

<a name="40107w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>BCCI</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_wqn1"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what matters relating to BCCI and <i>(a)</i> the Bank of England and <i>(b)</i> his Department are outstanding; whether any of these matters could carry a liability to the public purse; and if he will make a statement.  [146359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Bank of England's position on the impending legal proceedings relating to BCCI, including an indication of costs already incurred, is set out on pages 35&#150;37 and 91 of its 2003 annual report. A further update will be given in this year's annual report.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para0">The Treasury are not a party to these proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para1">The Treasury are considering a request unrelated to the legal proceedings against the Bank of England for the release of a BCCI-related document. This has no implications for the public purse.

<a name="40107w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Child Trust Funds</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what information will be provided to <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> parents to show them how different investment scenarios will affect the return on their child trust funds, with particular regard to how (i) equities, (ii) cash and (iii) bonds are likely to perform.  [145697]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government want parents to engage actively with the child trust fund (CTF) and recognise that, for many parents, this may be their first investment product. We will provide resources to ensure parents are helped to make choices about their child's CTF, including an information pack, which will be issued alongside the CTF voucher and a dedicated CTF website.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para2">Information will include illustrations of investment returns, which will also be of interest to children as they grow older. Annual statements issued by providers to all children, and teaching and learning resources for use in the classroom, will also help children engage with their accounts and develop an understanding of how different investments could affect returns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the implications for those on non-family benefits should they wish to make contributions to child trust funds.  [145700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Money held in children's child trust fund (CTF) accounts will not affect family benefits claimed by a child's household.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para3">The Government will keep under review the treatment of capital in income-related benefits so that a sensible balance is struck between providing state support and not unfairly penalising those who have acted responsibly by saving. As a first step, the Government announced on 15 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1344 that, from April 2006, the &#163;3,000 threshold above which savings reduce eligibility to income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit will be increased to &#163;6,000 in line with pension credit.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para4">The pension credit rules include protection against capital deprivation to deal with cases where the real reason behind disposing of savings is to access pension credit or increase the amount of pension credit payable.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para5">Whether payment into a CTF is treated as a deprivation of capital will depend on all the circumstances of the case. However, in most cases it is unlikely that modest contributions to a CTF would be treated as deprivation of capital.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what research his Department has undertaken to assess the benefits consumers perceive if financial products, with particular reference to equity release policies, are regulated by the Government.  [145717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 A regulatory impact assessment was published on 5 June 2003 that set out the costs and benefits of giving the Financial Services Authority (FSA) responsibility for regulating mortgages, including mortgage-based equity release schemes. This is available from the Treasury website: www.hm-treasury.gov.uk
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para8">The purpose of the consultation paper, "Regulating Home Reversion Plans", is to arrive at a more in-depth analysis of the costs and benefits of the regulation of home reversion equity release plans. A draft regulatory impact assessment was included as Annex B to that document and we look forward to receiving views on that, as well as other aspects of the consultation.

<a name="40107w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>European Investment Services Directive</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what discussions he has had with business organisations about the impact the European Investment Services Directive will have on their companies, with specific reference to the impact that the end of execution-only sales will have;  [145706]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of how the European Investment Services Directive and the end of execution-only sales will affect <i>(a)</i> banks, <i>(b)</i> internet companies, <i>(c)</i> consumers and <i>(d)</i> the City of London.  [145709]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government were disappointed with the position adopted by the European Council of Ministers on the proposed new Investment Services Directive. We believe that in several areas the Council text misses opportunities to create a competitive, integrated European financial market and instead will harm competition.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para9">An area of particular concern for the Government during negotiations was the treatment of "execution-only" business in the Directive. We believe that it is important to ensure that execution-only business is not compromised by unnecessary regulation. Such business can provide low-cost access to share trading, for example, for a wider range of investors.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para10">During negotiations, the Government successfully ensured that execution-only business will be exempt from full "suitability testing" obligations.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para11">The Government will work hard with the Financial Services Authority to ensure that the provision relating to execution-only business is not implemented in the UK in a way which restricts normal marketing activity or direct offer promotions.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para12">The Investment Services Directive is one of the topics discussed when Treasury Ministers meet members of the financial services industry.




<P>
<P><I>7 Jan 2004 : Column 350W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para13">At official level, the Treasury has frequent contact with representatives of financial services businesses, trade associations and consumer groups. Recent contacts have involved discussions of the potential impact of the Directive on activities including on execution-only sales of financial instruments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what tax incentives are available to companies providing free financial education for <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> adults; and how these fit into the Government's policy to reduce financial illiteracy.  [145710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 There are no specific tax incentives in place aimed at encouraging companies to provide free financial education to children or adults.
<P>

<a name="40107w01.html_para14">Improving basic financial literacy is a key element of the Government's strategy to reduce social and financial exclusion, while tackling over-indebtedness, and promoting saving. We are doing this across government to help people identify and meet their financial needs. Key initiatives include:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Saving Gateway, a transparent savings account with tailored financial advice and education;

a framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) that provides for personal finance education to be taught throughout Key Stages 1 to 4 of the school curriculum; and

<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what regulation there is to protect Muslims from mis-selling of housing finance that complies with Sharia law.  [145720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 I understand that some Islamic home finance arrangements may already fall within the definition of a regulated mortgage contract under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI/2001 No. 544) and would therefore be covered by the regime that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) will be implementing from 31 October 2004.
<P>

<a name="40107w02.html_para0">However, as explained in paragraph 36 of the consultation document 'Regulating home reversion plans', we are seeking information on arrangements that are not reversion plans but which might nevertheless be caught by any legislative definition of a reversion plan if we decide to regulate home reversion plans. These might include alternative property financing arrangements that may be used by banks to provide housing finance which complies with Sharia law.

 HM Treasury has never had an information technology contract above &#163;20 million.
<P>

<a name="40107w02.html_para3">HM Customs and Excise has let two IT Contracts in excess of &#163;20 million in the past 10 years. An outsourcing contract was signed on 25 August 1999 with Fujitsu C&E Services Ltd., for the provision of IT and telephony infrastructure services. Because this was a services contract, there was no debugging. The Transfer of Undertaking was achieved to target without any overrun. A second contract was awarded to BT/Syntegra in 1989 for the provision of the CHIEF (Customs Handling of Import and Export freight) service. The contract was extended to January 2007 to recognise new strategic business requirements and allow sufficient time for the CIPR (Customs Information Processing Requirement) procurement process.

<a name="40107w02.html_para6">In 1998 the Inland Revenue inherited a contract from the Department of Social Security for the provision of the NIRS2 Services run by Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting). The system went live in July 1998 and has been stable since April 2000. The NIRS2 service was provided under a PFI contract which has since been adjusted to allow for the unprecedented level of change required of the system by new legislation. There were some well documented delays in introducing the NIRS system, involving extra development costs, paid for by Andersen Consulting. The Inland Revenue has also incurred business recovery costs, enabling the introduction of more modern and automated business processes.

 Under the new prudential capital finance system, which comes into force on 1 April 2004, a small amount of local authority airport investment will attract revenue support grant. In allocating this investment approval, the Department will give priority to health, safety, security and environmental projects required by the regulatory authorities. Local authorities will be free to make their own decisions on additional borrowing for airport development purposes, providing they can afford it. A further option would be to seek a private sector partner.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Comprehensive information is not held centrally on the number of offences or level of fines. Based on information collected by local authorities, the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Traffic Management Bill showed that the number of prosecutions under the 1991 Act has been small, less than 200 over the 10 years since the Act came into force, and that the average fine has been less than half the maximum permitted, the latter being &#163;1,000 for all the categories listed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Research has shown that using a mobile phone while driving is distracting and drivers are four times more likely to have an accident if they do so. While many other activities may also be distracting, we are not aware of a similar risk from the effects of smoking while driving.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Highways Agency is placing significant importance on appointing the right people to traffic officer posts. Persons applying for a position as a traffic officer will be required to have two years of relevant experience or one year of relevant experience with a minimum of 5 O Levels/GCSEs at grade C or above.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Once implemented, the provisions within the Traffic Management Bill will free up police time from some traffic management duties. While the police will still patrol the network, they will be able to spend more time and resources dealing with vehicle, road and other crime including detection and enforcement against bad driving, vehicle theft and licensing offences.

<a name="40107w03.html_para1">The plans for Highways Agency Traffic Officers will free up the equivalent of more than 500 police officers, as they are phased in over a period of three years. The information is not broken down by police authority. The effect of civil enforcement of further traffic offences by local authorities will depend on the take up of the new powers and the level of current enforcement activity in respect of those offences by the police.

up the equivalent of about 540 full-time equivalent police officers. Based on figures from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary of 6,540 designated roads police in 2001&#150;02, the report estimated that a transfer of non-core police activities to the Highways Agency enabled approximately 8&#189; per cent. of police time to work on other key tasks. Resources will be freed up over a period of about three years as Highways Agency Traffic Officers are phased in across all motorways and some key trunk roads.

 While the Traffic Management Bill proposes that each local traffic authority will be required to appoint a traffic manager, it is for each authority to decide who should carry out the role and precisely what duties they should have. The traffic manager could be an existing member of staff and/or could have other duties as well, so there could be no increase in costs. Taking the Bill measures as a whole, the Government consider that, on average, there should be no net cost to authorities.

 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> The UK ranks 91st internationally in the 2002 Environmental Sustainability Index compiled by the Global Leaders of Tomorrow Task Force of the World Economic Forum in association with the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University. The rankings of other EU member states are shown in the following table. However, the UK and other countries believe this index is profoundly flawed and therefore potentially misleading, for the following reasons. It is an aggregated indicator which aims to weight together many components into a single overall measure of 'environmental Sustainability', an approach which as yet is not scientifically robust. The choice of components, and the way in which they are weighted together, is largely subjective. A different choice of components or weights would give different results, amply illustrated by the fact that the previous edition of this index, based on a different selection of components, placed the UK 16th.
<P>

<a name="40107w04.html_para0">Furthermore, there are still many areas where data are not sufficiently comparable between countries, or are simply not available. The values of many of the variables used to compile this index are imputed. It should also be noted that the variables used in this index tend to measure circumstances at a single point in time rather than trends or changes, therefore to the extent the index measures anything at all, it measures the environmental situation which a country faces rather than its progress or performance in improving environmental sustainability.

<a name="40107w04.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications of the introduction of compulsory identity cards for her Department.  [143355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w04.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The introduction of compulsory identity cards is a long-term undertaking on which inter-departmental discussions are led by the Home Office. This Department has an interest in tackling illegal working at an acceptable compliance cost to business (for example, in the agriculture and fresh produce sectors) and in providing a means to encourage legal routes of migration to the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it was known by Ministers in her Department that Katherine Bryan had applied for the post of Chief Executive of Water Services at the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development at the time when she was appointed to chair the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM); on what date she tendered her resignation as CoRWM chair; what considerations was given to the other shortlisted candidates for the Chair of CoRWM in the appointment of her replacement; and who has been chosen as a replacement for Katherine Bryan on the Committee.  [143513]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2003]:</i> No. Ministers knew of Mrs. Bryan's intention to resign on 26 November 2003. With the agreement of the Environment Ministers for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and after consultation with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, an announcement was made on 5 December that Gordon MacKerron, an existing member of CoRWM, was to be appointed as the new Chair. Among those candidates originally interviewed for the post of Chair, he was considered the most suitable replacement for Mrs. Bryan. No other appointment to CoRWM has been made.

[145984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w04.html_spnew9"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The consultation document included four possible buffer zone sizes. These were 6 metres (reflecting a quarter section of a typical spray boom), 1.0 metres (the minimum set-aside width); 100 metres; and 300 metres.

<P><I>7 Jan 2004 : Column 362W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40107w04.html_para2">For the purpose of the consultation comparisons of the economic effects of introducing these various sizes of buffer zones were made. Information was sought from the Rural Development Service's Geographic Information Unit. The Unit estimated the area of both arable and improved grassland adjacent to built-up areas in five selected areas. This was done utilising the Land Cover Map 2000 which is derived from the analysis of Earth observational satellite imagery. The resulting data was then extrapolated to provide a total figure for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40107w04.html_para3">It was always acknowledged that these figures were illustrative, and one of the purposes of going to consultation was to see if these estimates could be refined further.

 The meeting on 13 October was held with rural residents' interest groups to discuss the issues raised by the informal consultation exercise on public access to information on pesticide use and to identify how practical measures might be introduced.
<P>

<a name="40107w04.html_para5">Those who attended were invited because it was felt they would be in a position to address the practical issues raised, rather than solely on the basis of having submitted a written response to the informal consultation.
<P>

<a name="40107w04.html_para6">Of the 33 representative organisations and individuals who were invited, five attended, 10 submitted written responses to the informal consultation by the official deadline; the remaining 23 did not submit a response. The official deadline was extended from 31 August to 30 September to take account of the summer holiday period.

 We have no plans to show A levels and vocational course qualifications separately in performance tables. The school and college performance tables will show combined results for General (GCE) and/or Vocational (VCE) A levels, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) qualifications and key skills at level 3. This practice recognises the qualifications as equal in worth and does not undermine the achievements in any particular qualification in any way. We are, though, currently consulting on future measures of success which will take account of the diverse curriculum offer in post 16 learning. "Measuring success in the Learning and Skills Sector" can be found at www.successforall.gov.uk. Following that consultation we will consider whether any changes in presentation should be introduced in future years' tables.

<P>
<a name="40107w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 January2003]:</i> Following the Machinery of Government changed in June 2003 the DfES assumed lead responsibility in Whitehall for policy on children and the family. As a result of the changes, around 120 staff from the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Department for Constitutional Affairs, who were engaged in a range of work on children and family issues, transferred to DfES. To support its enhanced role, the Department created a new Directorate: Children, Young People and Families, drawing together all those who were employed in these areas to improve the coordination of policy development and service delivery. Around 600 staff in Schools Directorate working on Sure Start and children's issues were moved to the new Directorate, accounting for the significant change in staff numbers in Schools Directorate during the latter part of 2003.
<P>

<a name="40107w05.html_para2">The increase in staff numbers in Lifelong Learning Directorate during the second half of 2003 resulted from the transfer of 200 staff from the former Youth Directorate. The majority of the remaining staff in Youth Directorate transferred to the Children, Young People and Families Directorate, while a small number moved to Strategy and Communications Directorate.

<P>
<a name="40107w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We did not provide the reply in the same format as the answers relating to Leadership Incentive Grant, Education Action Zones and Excellence Clusters because the funds that are allocated to Excellence in Cities (EiC) authorities are intended for all the schools in the authority. Funds provided for the other named programmes are targeted resources for individual schools as identified by my Department and local education authorities. However, we have now provided a table in the required format, listing the total schools in each authority. It is not possible to provide a meaningful breakdown of primary and secondary schools, as we do not know exactly where individual authorities will target their EiC funds.

 The White Paper: The Future of Higher Education was published in January 2003. In this, the Government set out plans to increase participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by 2010.Although there are no numerical targets for expansion of student numbers in further education, funding will increase by &#163;1.2 billion between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06, a 19 per cent. real terms increase.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w07.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 2003]:</i> Mature students will be treated in the same way as younger students both as far as the proposed changes to tuition fees and to income contingent loans are concerned: where they are studying full time, up front fees would be abolished and they will be subject to variable fees of between &#163;0 and &#163;3,000 per year from 2006; re-payable following graduation and for any loans they take out with the Student Loans Company, they will benefit from the raising of the income threshold above which repayments are made from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 from 2005. Part time students are already subject to variable fees: where they have taken out loans with the Student Loans Company, they too will benefit from the raising of the income threshold from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 from 2005. We are introducing a new package of support for part time students in 2004/05, including a grant for fees of up to &#163;575 and a course grant, neither of which are repayable. Mature students are also particularly likely to benefit from the new HE Grant of &#163;1,000, being introduced from 2004/05. We expect around a third of all those getting the full grant of &#163;1,000 to be independent, despite such students making up only around 15 per cent of the total student population.

 We are committed to promoting opportunities for young people not only to volunteer in their local communities through such programmes as Millennium Volunteers and the Young Volunteer Challenge but also in Europe through the European Voluntary Service. During the Irish Presidency of the European Union (EU) we will seek to influence the continuing discussions on youth volunteering, building on the European Commission's White Paper on Youth Policy and the Conclusions from the Commission and EU Presidency presented to the Rome Conference in November. Within the spirit of the Compact with the voluntary and community sector and the EU Open Method of Consultation on Youth we will continue to work closely with organisations with experience of volunteering to develop and deliver our policies and influence European-level activity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what his policy is on how to bridge the funding shortfall for schools in the City of York.  [145134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 On 29 October my right hon. Friend announced proposals to restore stability to school funding. Amongst the package of measures, we are ensuring that for 2004&#150;05 all schools will see a guaranteed minimum increase in their per pupil budget amounting to 4 per cent. per pupil where pupil numbers remain the same. In addition, we have ensured that schools will receive an increase in the amounts of Standards Fund, School Standards Grant and funding from the LSC for sixth forms in line with the minimum guarantee.
<P>

<a name="40107w07.html_para2">We are increasing the School Formula Spending Share by a minimum of 5 per cent. per pupil&#151;the City of York's increase is 6.8 per cent. This will give the Authority the headroom and flexibility to deliver the guarantee and provide support to help schools facing additional pressures.
<P>

<a name="40107w07.html_para3">On 10 December, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that a further &#163;317 million will be going to local authorities in their Revenue Support Grant for 2004&#150;05 for authorities with education and social services functions. This is on top of the increases already announced in the provisional settlement. For almost all authorities the additional grant will reduce the pressure on services and council tax, and will make it easier for authorities to meet education passporting targets. In the case of the City of York the additional grant amounts to &#163;1.2 million.
<P>

<a name="40107w07.html_para4">However, if the City of York or any other LEA is able to put forward a compelling case that additional, transitional funds are needed in the short term&#151;above and beyond those already available to the LEA &#151;my right hon. Friend will be prepared to consider bringing forward grant payments from my Department, so that the LEA will have funds available in 2004&#150;05 for this purpose, with the expectation of a consequential reduction to what they will receive in future years. The maximum amount that the City of York might be able to bring forward in this way would be &#163;300,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much has been spent by each of the Regional Development Agencies, in each of the last four years, on corporate plans.  [146080]<P>

<P>
<a name="40107w07.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 As set out in Quangos: Opening the Doors (1998) www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/central/198/pb/open/od main.htm, the Government believe that non-departmental public bodies should disclose as much information as possible including information on their role and achievements. England's Regional Development Agencies are required to prepare and publish Corporate Plans with a three year planning horizon, which are revised every two years, to synchronise planning and funding horizons with the Spending Review process. The current Corporate Plans cover the period 2003&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="40107w07.html_para5">The amount spent by RDAs in each of the last four years on printing and distribution of such plans is set out in the following table. The figures do not include the cost of staff resources in developing the detail of the plans where they are produced in-house, consulting stakeholders on the policies and activities reflected in the plans, nor the cost of departmental resources in approving them, which could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Expenditure also varies for many reasons such as the number of copies produced, whether consultants were used or whether the plans were only made available on the internet.

 Under Section 5(2)<i>(a)</i> of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 the Agencies may not give financial assistance without the consent of the Secretary of State. However, the consent of the Secretary of State has been given to each Agency to give such assistance subject to a specific financial limit and other conditions set out in its Financial Memorandum. Any proposed expenditure or guarantee that is in any way novel or contentious, regardless of its cost, also requires the specific approval of the Treasury.

<i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry published a consultation document on 15 December 2003 seeking views on draft guidance which she proposes to issue on the consideration of media public interest cases under the Enterprise Act 2002 (as amended by the Communications Act 2003). The new regime is substantially deregulatory compared to the old, with a small number of narrowly defined public interest considerations approved by Parliament.




<P>
<P><I>7 Jan 2004 : Column 378W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para0">In relation to the newspaper public interest considerations (accurate presentation of news, free expression of opinion and plurality of views), new legislation recognises that, for newspapers, there have historically been a small number of cases that have raised public interest issues beyond those that would have been considered as part of a competition assessment. It therefore allows the Secretary of State to intervene in certain newspaper mergers on these public interest grounds. The draft guidance sets out some indications of the general approach she expects to adopt in deciding whether or not to intervene in a particular newspaper case. However each case will be decided on its own facts.
<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para1">In relation to the scope of the broadcasting and cross-media public interest considerations, whilst in principle the Secretary of State .may intervene on these public interest grounds in any media merger case where these considerations are relevant, the draft guidance notes that as a matter of policy she expects thatintervention on these public interest grounds will normally only be considered in those areas where media ownership rules have been removed by the Communications Act.
<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para2">The assessment of newspaper and other media mergers on competition grounds will be the responsibility of the competition authorities.

<a name="40107w09.html_para4">The programme relates only to post office branches that are defined by Post Office Ltd. as 'urban'. I understand that the company classifies as urban any post office within a community of more than 10,000 inhabitants. The Post Office has carried out detailed planning to establish which of its branches should be classified as either rural or urban and has developed a geographical mapping computer model, which measures population in terms of contiguous or very close agglomeration. Thus where a number of villages or small communities adjoin each other or adjoin a larger town, and the aggregate population of the area exceeds 10,000, the model reflects that fact and classifies it as urban.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the effect that the Government stance on the Posted Workers Directive is having on <i>(a)</i> the job prospects for British workers in the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> the wage levels of migrant workers in the United Kingdom; and if she will make a statement.  [145486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The UK fully implemented the Posting of Workers Directive in 1999, providing all workers temporarily posted to the UK from another state with certain minimum conditions of employment as laid down by law. We have no reason to believe that its implementation has adversely affected the job prospects of British workers in the UK. Unemployment in the UK fell from 5.9 per cent. in the three months ending October 1999 to 5.0 per cent. in the three months ending October 2003 (ILO Unemployment Figure, Labour Force Survey, ONS).
<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para5">UK employment rights are applicable to all workers, regardless of country of origin, so migrant workers are protected in the same way as other workers by the National Minimum Wage.

<P>
<a name="40107w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government regards shareholder voting at company meetings as an integral part of shareholder engagement with the companies in which they invest.
<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para6">We fully support the continuing work of the Shareholder Voting Working Group, which has recently embarked upon a new project to identify, and propose practical solutions to, the impediments to casting proxy votes successfully at company meetings. The objective is for there to be a noticeable improvement in time for the 2004 AGM voting season.
<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para7">The Government has already enabled shareholders, through the Companies Act 1985 (Electronic Communications) Order 2000 implemented in December 2000, to use electronic communications to appoint a proxy. This enables shareholders to issue voting instructions electronically. As stated in our White Paper in July 2002, we also propose to introduce legislative measures to improve the rights of proxies. This will enable investors and others holding shares through intermediaries to ensure more easily that the voting rights in a company are exercised.

<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para8">The Government does not collect data on shareholder voting levels centrally. Such information is available from a variety of sources, and shows that shareholder voting has increased gradually over the past five years, and now stands at around 53 per cent.

A combined budget of &#163;10 million is supporting the installation and monitoring of PV systems in around 500 houses (30 projects) and 12&#150;15 large-scale public buildings. The Field Trials aim to raise awareness of PV technology, create confidence in its applications, and provide opportunities for the UK photovoltaics industry.

<a name="40107w09.html_para12">The Government is committed to a major initiative with industry and others to achieve a UK solar PV demonstration programme in line with our main competitors. The current programme, which started in April 2002 and is worth &#163;20 million over three years, is the first stage of this process. At the halfway stage, over half the funding has been allocated.
<P>

<a name="40107w09.html_para13">The DTI is also putting effort into removing a number of barriers to the deployment of very small generators, such as PV. These include reduction of VAT to 5 per cent. for professionally installed systems, a new PV Annex to Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG22), simplified connection agreements to the local network (G77 and G83/1) and Installer Training and Accreditation Schemes. In addition, the Government plans to amend the Renewables Obligation to enable very small generators like PV to accumulate their production over a year, rather than a month, so as to qualify for ROCs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w10.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Preliminary evidence, including hits on the DTI working parents website and requests for guidance, indicate that interest in the right to request flexible working by mothers, and fathers, is high. We recently published the top 10 questions asked by employees when calling the Acas helpline, and continue to gather evidence from a wide number of sources to build up a clear picture of the demand for, and uptake of, the new law.
<P>

<a name="40107w10.html_para0">The Department undertook an employee Work-Life Balance survey in 2003 as a baseline for comparison with a repeat survey due in 2005. The results will contribute to the review of the law that the Government are committed to initiate in 2006. Preliminary employee findings are available on the internet, www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar/, and we are expecting to publish the full report soon.

<a name="40107w10.html_para1">We are working with key intermediaries, such as Working Families and Maternity Alliance, who are collating data through member/supporter surveys. These organisations are due to report their findings to coincide with the first anniversary of the new law to request flexible working in April this year. We are also working with Prima Baby magazine which is carrying out a reader survey, and aims to publish the results in the March edition.
<P>

<a name="40107w10.html_para2">The Department has also commissioned questions on flexible working which currently appear in the Office of National Statistics monthly Omnibus survey. The results of these can be made gender specific and will be available in spring 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w10.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government are taking forward a significant legislative agenda on equality matters, and they have committed themselves to introduce a duty on public bodies to promote equality of opportunity for women and men generally when parliamentary time allows. In taking this forward, the Government will be considering the experience gained with the duty to promote race equality introduced in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act (2000).

<a name="40107w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women what steps are being taken to tackle pregnancy discrimination in the workplace.  [146255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w10.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Discrimination on the ground of pregnancy or maternity is a form of direct discrimination on the ground of sex. The courts have interpreted the Sex Discrimination Act as meaning that discrimination on the ground that a woman is, or might become, pregnant is unlawful. This is reinforced by the amended Equal Treatment Directive published on 5 October 2002 which says that less favourable treatment on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity within the meaning of the Pregnant Workers Directive constitutes sex discrimination.
<P>

<a name="40107w10.html_para3">In 1999, the Government introduced specific protections to prevent women from suffering detriment and from being unfairly dismissed or selected for redundancy for reasons connected with their pregnancy, childbirth or maternity leave. We have also ensured a woman has a clear right to return to her job after maternity leave, on the same terms and conditions as if she had not been away.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The table does not contain schemes that started winding up in the time period given and have since completed wind up. The Pensions Schemes Registry only records the present status of a scheme so only those winding up at the moment are captured. This is unlikely to bias the figures extensively as the winding up process can take many years to complete, particularly for large firms.<P>

2. The "All scheme type" column contains Defined-Contribution, Hybrid and Unknown Type schemes as well as Defined-Benefit schemes.<P>





3. A winding up scheme is one which has notified OPRA that it has commenced winding up procedures.<P>

4. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify OPRA of any status change, so the data for the current year is provisional.<P>

5. Data is not available for periods after the quarter beginning 1 April 2003.<P>

1. The prescription information was obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Total prescriptions include not only prescriptions originating from general medical practitioners in England but also from hospital doctors, nurses, and dentists, provided they were dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.<P>

2. Drugs for dementia are those defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) section 4.11.<P>

3. The Net Ingredient Cost refers to the cost (which the dispenser is reimbursed) of the drug before discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees. It does not include any adjustment for income obtained where a prescription charge is paid at the time the prescription is dispensed, or where the patient has purchased a pre-payment certificate.<P>

<a name="40107w11.html_para1">In August 1999 the Department issued Health Service Circular 1999/176 which asks national health service bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is not available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence. Funding for treatments, such as Ebixa, should not be withheld simply because of an absence of guidance from NICE.

 Details of the number of children diagnosed with autism are not available. The Medical Research Council (MRC) published a comprehensive review of autism research in December 2001 which provides an authoritative overview of the current state of knowledge on the prevalence, incidence and causes of autism. The report was commissioned by the Department of Health. It is available on the MRC website at: http://www.mrc.ac.uk/pdf-autism-report.pdf

<P>

<a name="40107w11.html_para2">The report says that according to recent reviews, there appears fairly good agreement that autism spectrum disorders affect approximately 60, and more narrowly defined autism 10&#150;30 per 10,000 children under eight.
<P>

<a name="40107w11.html_para3">In February 2002, we allocated a further &#163;2.5 million to the MRC to help them to take forward their programme of work on autism. Between December 2002 and July 2003, the MRC held a series of four seminars to encourage the development of good quality applications for autism research funding. Topics covered in the seminars were gut and the developing child; brain and mind (neuropsychology and neuroimaging); autism in populations and outcome measures for interventions in children and adults. On 11 July 2003, the MRC held the first of their annual fora for autism research "Breaking barriers, building bridges", in conjunction with the National Autistic Society, to bring together ideas stimulated by the previous four seminars.

 On 17 December 2002, following thorough options analysis work and detailed market research, the Department purchased the largest remaining independent United States plasma collector Life Resources Incorporated. The objective was to secure long-term supplies of non-United Kingdom blood plasma to ensure that the global plasma shortage would not reduce the availability to National Health Service patients of life-saving plasma products such as immunoglobulins and clotting factors. Large volumes of plasma are required for medicinal product manufacture, especially immunoglobulm.
<P>

<a name="40107w11.html_para6">The NHS has been using US-sourced plasma since 1998 because of the unknown and unquantifiable risk of transmission of vCJD through blood. At the time Life Resources Inc. was purchased, the US had no reported cases of BSE or CJD and was the only country able to supply the quality and quantity of plasma required. The US also has a well-established pool of donors, a well-regulated environment and a developed collection industry. The Government are aware of the one case of BSE reported in the US and considers this to be a negligible risk to the safety of the blood supply. This case is not in itself a reason to alter current arrangements but we will continue to monitor the situation closely.
<P>

<a name="40107w11.html_para7">It is standard in both the UK and the US that, in addition to screening donors for the major blood borne viruses of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, all blood products are heat treated or chemically treated to remove any viral contamination that may have escaped the screening process.
<P>

<a name="40107w11.html_para8">In the UK, expert advice is that if vCJD is transmissible through blood, the infection is most likely to be contained in the white cells and plasma. As a precautionary measure, we instituted universal leucodepletion (removal of the white cells) of all blood for transfusion from 31 October 1999.

 The National Blood Authority (NBA) undertakes a rigorous selection of blood donors as the first step in ensuring the safety of the blood supply. The questionnaire and accompanying interview of potential blood donors have been developed to elicit appropriate information relevant to donation. There are two important aims, which are to ensure as far as possible that the donated blood is safe for transfusion to patients and that blood donation is not detrimental to the donor's health.

With the clinical information given by hospital providers it is not possible to determine how many amputations due to diabetes could have been prevented. The national service framework for diabetes standards document noted that all people with diabetes should receive high-quality care throughout their lifetime, including support to optimise the control of blood glucose, blood pressure and other risk factors for developing the complications of diabetes. The standards document also noted that the impact of microvascular complications could be reduced if they are detected and treated at an early stage and states that all young people and adults with diabetes should receive regular surveillance for the long-term complications of diabetes.

 Ritalin is indicated as a part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children over six years of age where remedial measures alone prove insufficient. In October 2000 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published an appraisal of the use of the drug methylphenidate (main brand name Ritalin) in the treatment of childhood ADHD and issued clinical guidelines for its use, including the need for regular monitoring of children receiving this therapy. NICE recommended long-term follow-up of adverse effects and the potential for misuse of the drug in assessing long-term benefits and health gain into adulthood.

<a name="40107w13.html_para4">As with all medicines, the safety of methylphenidate is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the independent advisory body the Committee on the Safety of Medicines.

 An elected assembly for Yorkshire and the Humber will enhance regional prosperity, pride and democracy. It will control or influence key elements impacting on the regional economy, including the work of Yorkshire Forward and policies affecting planning, housing, transport and skills. Similarly it will improve people's safety and quality of life through work on the environment, fire prevention, culture and sport and the promotion of public health.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the estimated annual Government grant is to the proposed regional assemblies in <i>(a)</i> the North West, <i>(b)</i> the North East and <i>(c)</i> Yorkshire and the Humber.  [146039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Based on figures for 2002&#150;03, and on existing programmes, elected regional assemblies would receive grants of around &#163;780 million in the North West, &#163;350 million in the North East and &#163;570 million in Yorkshire and the Humber. Assemblies would also have influence&#151;through consultation with, and making appointments to specified bodies&#151;over budgets totalling &#163;1,600 million in the North West, &#163;600 million in the North East and &#163;1,100 million in Yorkshire and the Humber.
<P>

<a name="40107w14.html_para8">In addition, the White Paper "Our Fire and Rescue Service" published in June 2003 said "we envisage that, eventually, where there are elected regional assemblies, fire and rescue authorities will be regional bodies". In 2001&#150;02, the existing local fire and rescue authorities spent around &#163;238 million in the North West, &#163;103 million in the North East and &#163;159 million in Yorkshire and Humberside. These are the latest figures available. Broadly speaking, three quarters of the Fire and Rescue Service's overall budget spending is met by revenue support grant and national non- domestic rates and the balance from council tax.

<P>
<a name="40107w14.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 English Partnerships is the National Regeneration Agency. It leads on the development of Urban Regeneration Companies. It works closely with the Housing Market Renewal Pathfinders to regenerate areas of low demand and abandoned housing. Through the &#163;400 million coalfields programme it is actively regenerating former coalfield areas and their communities. We are also proposing that EP take a leading role in overseeing development in the wider Milton Keynes area through close co-operation with the local council and other key stakeholders.

 The key partnership in any area is the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP). A survey in summer 2002, as part of the Government's research into LSPs, showed that the vast majority of areas, at county and

<P>

<a name="40107w15.html_para0">LSPs must include representatives from and reflect an appropriate balance between the public sector including local authorities and other public services, and private, voluntary and community sectors. LSPs will operate by consensus, in order to reflect and retain the buy-in of partners.
<P>

<a name="40107w15.html_para1">The Government guidance, published in March 2001, states that it will be for local partners to decide the full range of work of their LSP. However, it does set out four core tasks.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he plans to implement the requirements of Directive 2002/91 on the energy performance of buildings under the European Communities Act 1972.  [145750]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_spnew5"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 The Government are still considering how implementation may be best achieved. Present thoughts are that the way forward could be a combination of amendments to the Building Regulations made under the Building Act 1984, and new regulations, made under the European Communities Act 1972, where this is more appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Each Government Department assesses ways and means of delivering its objectives, and appraises the relevant options in line with the guidance in "The Green Book&#151;Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government"&#151;including the costs of implementation. If, for example, a Department wishes to secure sustainability objectives, and in order to do so, has to dispose of assets, the disposal should be done in such a way that meets the requirements of Government Accounting chapter 24. This should ensure that overall value for money is achieved and that the disposal is effectively and properly done. Overall value for money goes beyond maximising proceeds by including the impact of effective public service delivery. Disposal of land by local authorities is governed by section 123 of the Local Government Act 1972. Local authorities may dispose of land in any manner they wish: my right hon. Friend The Deputy Prime Minister's only involvement is to grant or withhold consent where authorities wish to dispose of land at less than the best consideration reasonably obtainable and the proposed disposal falls outside the scope of the General Consent in The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Circular 06/2003. The rules on disposal do not, therefore, directly address issues of sustainability. These would be considered as part of the project appraisal or reasons for disposing of the land.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps she is taking to enlist the help of vocational divers in South Devon in investigating historic wrecks off the South Devon Coast.  [145774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no specific plans for vocational divers in South Devon. The Department has enabled the development and implementation of English Heritage's initial policy for maritime archaeology, Taking to the Water, which clearly states the desirability of engaging with the sport diving and wider communities. Any proposals for initiatives can be made directly to English Heritage where they will be considered according to national priorities and subject to available resources. English Heritage are already encouraging sport diving initiatives in the Solent, the North East and the Isles of Scilly together with providing support for an England-wide training programme and shipwreck projects through the Nautical Archaeology Society.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what considerations resulted in her Department stopping vocational divers investigating <i>(a)</i> the wreck of a suspected Barbary pirate ship off Gara rock in South Devon and <i>(b)</i> the Salcombe Canon site shipwreck.  [145775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The sites referred to as <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> are the same site designated under the Statutory Instrument 1997/2536, known as the Salcombe Cannon Site. The reference to the suspected Barbary pirate ship has arisen after research has shown that Barbary pirates were active around the period of the ship wreck in the area of Salcombe. Since designation the Secretary of State has issued licences to survey, surface recover and excavate the site. At the time of writing there are no current licences on this site, as there has been no application made to the Secretary of State. The issuing of licences since 1997 has enabled continued investigation of this site by vocationally based teams backed up by professional archaeological advice. Over the last 18 months this system has been supported by English Heritage. The Government's contractor for archaeological services in support of the 1973 Act has also visited this site and

<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 English Heritage's role is to carry out administrative functions exercisable by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State under the 1973 Act. English Heritage considers the merits of each case, consults the Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites, the archaeological diving contractor and other interested parties as appropriate, before submitting a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the additional cost to public funds is of involving English Heritage in the process of licensing historic wreck sites; and what the advantages are.  [145820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40107w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The transfer of responsibility for licensing designated wreck sites and acting as secretariat to the Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites to English Heritage has resulted in no additional cost to public funds. The administrative budget hitherto spent by this Department on these activities was transferred to English Heritage in 2003.
<P>

<a name="40107w15.html_para5">Benefits from the transfer include greater specialist expertise in the decision-making process and the management of protected wreck sites. Underwater archaeology projects are also now able to compete on equal terms with land archaeological projects for English Heritage grants.

Figures for annual spending since 1998&#150;99 and plans up to 2005&#150;06 are shown as follows. As shown, and in line with our overall strategy on assistance to middle income countries, we are planning a reduction in planned expenditure for the year beginning April 2005. We are discussing with the South African government how to manage this. We will continue to maintain a substantial programme there in recognition of the poverty problems inherited from the apartheid period, the growing spread of HIV/AIDS, and the critical importance of successful transition in South Africa for the prospects of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.

 In the last five years the SA80 has been subject to a major modification programme to improve its reliability by either replacing or reengineering components.

The basic design and concept of the modified SA80&#151;the SA80 A2&#151;remains the same, but there are significant engineering improvements to the internal gas systems, firing pin, bolt, hammer and barrel. The cocking lever has been redesigned to deflect spent cases and reduce the chance of stoppages, and the new magazine is more reliable and robust. Work has also been undertaken on the safety catch/plunger, and following successful trials of a revised safety plunger during Op TELIC, a contract will be let shortly to procure a sufficient quantity to modify all weapons.

 Anyone who has lodged a formal application for asylum in the United Kingdom is entitled to access health services. Health assessments are offered in induction centres to allow early identification of health care needs and in the event that an asylum seeker is dispersed, they will take with them a patient handheld record which health professionals can access. Asylum seekers housed in emergency accommodation pending dispersal also have access to health services. If an individual case is referred to and accepted by the Medical Foundation then they will normally be able to remain in London to access the specialist care that only the Foundation can provide.

In the case of a pregnant woman she will be given appropriate ante-natal care by the local Primary Care Trust. She will also be entitled to access those services which are generally available to women who have been raped. NASS's policy of dispersal according to language seeks to ensure that individuals are not isolated without any support from their community. We also encourage the active participation of asylum seekers in community life through, for example, our Purposeful Activities Scheme and through volunteer and mentoring schemes.

<P>
<a name="40107w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 This Government are determined to tackle domestic violence. As part of our overall strategy we have introduced the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill which will ensure an effective police response when victims report domestic violence, and make sure that the civil and criminal law offer the maximum protection to all victims to stop the violence recurring.
<P>

<a name="40107w18.html_para6">The main measures relating to domestic violence in the Bill are: making breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence; making common assault an arrestable offence; enabling courts to impose restraining orders when sentencing for any offence, and on acquittal for any offence if the courts consider it necessary to protect the victim; extending access to non-molestation and occupation orders to same-sex couples and couples who have never cohabited or been married; and issuing guidance to agencies on holding multi-agency reviews following domestic violence homicides.
<P>

<a name="40107w18.html_para7">We recognise that legislation alone cannot deliver improvements to services that victims need. The Inter-Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence will, over the next two years and beyond, oversee a programme of work which focuses on prevention, protection and justice, and support. Among other things, we will be looking at education and tackling risk factors, improving the police and CPS handling of domestic violence cases, delivering new refuge places and providing help and advice to those victims who wish to stay in their own homes.

 At the present time there are no plans for the Prison Service to put in place a separate national strategy for older prisoners. The current policy is to assess all prisoners' individual needs through sentence planning. This includes taking account of any requirements related to a prisoner's age.

 The allocation of Young Adult Offenders (YAOs) aged 18&#150;20, into Gloucester prison forms part of the ongoing programme to adjust the population mix of adult and young prisoners at a number of establishments. This is in response to the requirements of the Youth Justice Board for juvenile places and to increasing demand for spaces for adult male prisoners. This will be achieved through careful monitoring of population changes and the allocation of prisoners to establishments appropriate to their needs. It will also ensure maximum use of all available spaces in the prison estate, while minimising the distance of remand prisoners from the courts. This will enable the Prison Service to maintain its service to the courts despite the population pressures.
<P>

<a name="40107w18.html_para9">Ashfield prison is not being closed, but will instead only hold young prisoners, aged 15&#150;17.
