<a name="51028w02.html_para9">
The Government should (1) designate or create a single lead organisation to undertake the role of co-ordinating and ensuring consistency of application of non-native species policies across Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_14">In March this year the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), announced the setting up of a co-ordinating mechanism to ensure that policy and action on non-natives is joined up across Government and its agencies. The programme board held its first meeting on 12 September and plans further meetings on a quarterly basis. Minutes of the meetings will be published on the Defra website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_15">(2) Develop comprehensive, accepted risk assessment procedures to assess risks posed by non-native species and identify and prioritise prevention action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_16">A research contract to develop a comprehensive risk assessment methodology was completed in February of this year. The scheme is based upon the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) pest risk assessment scheme used for plant quarantine purposes, adapted to be applicable to all taxonomic groups. It has been designed to generate an assessment of risk based on a three point scale of high, medium and low risk. A joint programme of peer review and further testing is being agreed between DEFRA and the Scottish Executive and will begin shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_17">(3) Develop codes of conduct to help prevent introductions for all relevant sectors in a participative fashion involving all relevant stakeholders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_18">The first code of practice, for the horticultural sector, was launched by the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) in March 2003. It is published in full on the Defra website, and has been summarised in a leaflet. This code should form a template for other codes&#151;one for each vector of introduction. The programme board has suggested that a code for the pet trade should be the next to be developed in close association with the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_19">The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, currently before Parliament, includes a provision to give the Secretary of State the power to issue or approve codes of practice in connection with non-native species. These codes will not be statutory, but may be used as evidence in any court proceedings and may be taken into account by the court when sentencing. A similar power has already been introduced within Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_20">(4) Develop a targeted education and awareness strategy involving all relevant sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_21">The programme board will establish working groups to take forward the review recommendations, and to fulfil our international obligations. It has suggested that an education and public awareness group should be established immediately. Membership of working groups will be drawn from Government and its agencies, the academic and professional sectors and non-governmental organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_22">(5) Revise and update existing legislation to improve handling of invasive non-native species issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_23">A consultation on part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the principal piece of legislation which protects our native wildlife, was carried out in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2005 : Column 560W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
England and Wales last winter. This raised a number of issues associated with the legislative controls on non-native species, and we are taking forward two of these in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill. In addition to the power to issue or approve codes of practice, mentioned above, the Bill contains a power for the Secretary of State to ban the sale of certain non-native species, to be listed by order. There are no species proposed at this stage; any proposals will be the subject of full consultation in due course. We will develop a coherent package of further proposals for future consideration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para20">
<a name="stpa_24">(6) Establish adequate monitoring and surveillance arrangements for non-native species in Great Britain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para21">
<a name="stpa_25">A national audit of non-native species has been carried out within Scotland and England, and this will form the basis of a research project to be let shortly to carry out an audit of current monitoring activity in Great Britain in relation to non-native species. This will identify where the most significant gaps lie in existing capacity, and what improvements can be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para22">
<a name="stpa_26">(7) Establish policies with respect to management and control of invasive non-native species currently present or newly arrived in the wild, and develop operational capacity to implement these policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para23">
<a name="stpa_27">It is not possible to take action against all of the non-native species currently present in the wild. A sound risk assessment process will provide the scientific basis for decisions about priorities for management and control of individual species.

<a name="stpa_28">(8) Stakeholders should be fully consulted and engaged in development of invasive non-native species policies and actions through a mechanism such as a consultative forum.

<p>
<a name="51028w02.html_para25">
<a name="stpa_29">The holding of a regular forum, to which all relevant stakeholders are invited, is a valuable way to ensure a wider understanding and ownership of the issues. Two annual events have been held to date, and a further forum is scheduled to take place next spring.

Therefore, the Department has taken a pragmatic approach by inviting the optimal group of men and women who will benefit most from a screening programme. Also, we are determined that the new screening programme should not have a detrimental effect on services for patients with bowel cancer symptoms. When we have rolled out the programme to the whole country, we will make an assessment on whether to expand the programme to other age groups.

<i>[holding answer 21 October 2005]:</i> The Government believe that any woman considering an abortion must have all the facts to make an informed decision. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists&#039; (RCOG) evidence-based clinical guideline, The care of women requesting induced abortion (2004)&quot;, states that professionals involved in abortion care should be equipped to provide women with information on the long-term effects of abortion which are rare or unproven, including breast cancer. The guideline also concluded, following an extensive review of the literature, that the evidence shows that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer.

 Platinum-based medicinal products are effective in the treatment of certain cancers, including childhood cancers. They are, however, associated with a number of serious adverse effects. These are documented in the product information, together with warnings and advice, where possible, on how to reduce or avoid these adverse effects. When treating a patient with cancer, the doctor has to weigh up the risks of the treatment against the potential benefits and prescribe accordingly.

The SmPC notes that cisplatin should not be given to patients with existing hearing impairment as this may be associated with increased toxicity. It also warns that the damage to hearing caused by cisplatin is cumulative and that audiometric testing should be performed before starting treatment and before each subsequent course of treatment with cisplatin. In addition, the SmPC warns that the simultaneous use of other medicines that cause hearing damage, such as certain antibiotics, may make such damage worse. The SmPC describes in some detail 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2005 : Column 573W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

Of these, only one was in a child (one-year-old) who experienced deafness following therapy with carboplatin and gentamycin. During the same time period, a total of 19 reports (of 26 suspected reactions) of ear and labyrinth disorders associated with cisplatin have been received.

 It is our policy that decisions on fluoridation schemes should be taken locally by strategic health authorities (SHAs), following consultations with the populations they serve. The previous legislation governing fluoridation left water companies responsible for final decisions on fluoridation. The main initiative the Government have taken on fluoridation has been to introduce amending legislation to make SHAs responsible for decisions and to define in greater detail how they should conduct consultations. The Department has also made grants totalling &#163;428,000 over the period 2001&#150;02 to 2005&#150;06 to the British Fluoridation Society to promote the benefits of fluoridation.

 The United Kingdom influenza pandemic contingency plan takes into consideration that a flu pandemic may emerge in Europe rather than China or the Far East. A pandemic virus is likely to affect the UK irrespective of where it emerges, and our plan provides a framework to deal with the health impact of a pandemic, and the disruption it may cause to essential services and people&#039;s daily lives.

 The Department has made no assessment of the effectiveness of the see me&quot; campaign in Scotland. I understand from the director of the national programme for improving mental health and wellbeing at the Scottish Executive that an evaluation will be commissioned within the 2005&#150;06 financial year to track the development of the campaign in terms of inputs and actions, programme reach, results and short term outcomes, at national and local levels. It is expected that the evaluation will be completed before March 2007. The Department will carefully consider the report of this evaluation to inform the further development of shift, the five-year initiative (2004&#150;09) in England to tackle stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health issues.

<a name="stpa_92">The COT secretariat has reviewed the data submitted by ION in May 2005 and found that there was no new evidence to that already reviewed by COT in 2004, when it reached its conclusions on the safety of tryptophan that would support a higher level of tryptophan being used in food supplements. The FSA therefore adopted the level and purity criteria proposed by COT, and this has therefore been adopted into UK legislation to reintroduce the sale of tryptophan supplements in the UK, in the interests of consumer choice and safety. We have asked COT to review its recommendation and any new information on tryptophan since June 2004, and this will be considered at the COT meeting in December. Depending on COTs advice the legislation may be amended.

<a name="stpa_93">The expert group on vitamins and minerals (EVM) proposed safe upper levels (SULs) for vitamins and minerals using the well-established paradigm for setting acceptable and tolerable intake levels for chemicals in food. Where the data were not adequate to set a SUL, the EVM gave guidance on levels that would not be expected to result in adverse effects. The COT uses the same paradigm in its consideration of the safety of tryptophan as a supplement. However, the scientific data did not support derivation of a SUL, and the COT conclusion is expressed in the same terms that EVM used for its guidance levels.

<a name="51028w10.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_94">The use of advisory statements was not considered appropriate due to the severity of the symptoms of Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome in people taking dietary supplements containing tryptophan pre-1990, and the uncertainty relating to gaps in the scientific evidence. COT decided to recommend a daily dose level of 220mg that would not present an appreciable risk to health.

<a name="stpa_95">Decisions regarding the dates of the biometric road shows were dependent on the availability of the venues selected; the dates were agreed and venues booked on 16 August 2005. A wide range of local media organisations were contacted, including newspapers, television and radio stations, according to locality and size of readership/audience. In each case local BBC and commercial television and radio stations were invited to attend, along with the main regional/local newspaper(s). Notice of the road shows was provided to local media the working day before each event.

219 September 1999 to 31 December 1999<br>

Notes:<br>

1.At Medway, Rainsbrook and Oakhill, other staff&quot; excludes teachers and healthcare staff, none of whom are directly employed by the STC contractors.<br>

2.Hassockfield&#039;s other staff&quot; includes teachers and healthcare staff, as they are directly employed by the STC contractors.<br>

3.The high number of joiners at Rainsbrook and Medway in 2002 and 2003 reflect the expansion of both centres from 44 to 76 beds. (Hassockfield has 42 beds, Oakhill has 80.)<br>

4.Joiner/leaver numbers at all centres include staff who were provisionally appointed but did not actually start work with children because they did not pass the initial training course or did not receive Criminal Records Bureau clearance. These staff did not have contact with children.<br>

5.Rainsbrook introduced a fully automated personnel/payroll system in 2002. Data prior to this period is limited and accuracy cannot be guaranteed, so has not been included.<br>

6.Staff figures for Hassockfield in 1999 are for appointments after 19 September, when the centre opened. Some staff were appointed prior to opening, but figures for these are not available.<br>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) leads on engaging with British companies overseas. It has developed guidance explaining the effect of part 12 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security (ATCS) Act 2001. This Act gives UK courts jurisdiction over certain offences of bribery and corruption committed overseas by UK companies or nationals and gives UK companies a strong defence against attempts to extort bribes from them. DFID works closely with other UK Government departments, (including the FCO, the Home Office, HM Treasury, the Department for Trade and Industry and the Attorney General&#039;s Office) on anti-corruption activities, including raising awareness of the provisions of the ATCS act.

DFID has been urging other donors to focus more of their aid on poor countries and poor people, while recognising that security and conflict prevention have a key role to play. In this regard, DFIDis leading initiatives in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)&#039;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to promote information sharing on different donors approaches to allocation and to create a DAC watch brief on aid flows to a list of fragile states.

If standards of governance are very poor, we may decide not to deliver aid through partner governments but to use alternative channels, such as non-government organisations (NGOs).

 Sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, are some of the most cost-effective and beneficial health service interventions available. However, the unmet need for condoms, and other methods of family planning, is very high. Globally, some 120 million women and men who say they would like to use family planning have no access to modern contraceptives. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) also estimates that the global condom needs for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is around 9 billion annually.

An estimated &#163;46.5 million of this amount has been used by the UNFPA for the purchase of reproductive health commodities. DFID is also one of the leading bilateral providers of reproductive health commodities through its country programmes, where reproductive health supplies are an integral part of broader programmes to promote sexual and reproductive health and to prevent HIV. In 2004&#150;05, this included commitments of &#163;40 million for condoms in Nigeria, &#163;6.37 million for condoms in Vietnam and &#163;220,000 for female condoms in South Africa.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the total UK Government expenditure on TB control in developing countries was between 2001 and 2004; what the proposed expenditure is for <i>(a)</i> 2005 and <i>(b)</i> 2006; how much of the total was (i) multilateral and (ii) bilateral aid; and how the bilateral aid was divided between (A)project support, (B) health sector support and (C)direct budget support.  [21982]</p>








<p><a name="st_183"><a name="51028w21.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID funds TB control through some specific bilateral projects, but increasingly also funds the broader health sector plans of developing country governments by direct financing through their budgets, or through multilateral organisations such as the World Bank. Such sector programmes will build capacity in health services to diagnose and treat all major causes of illness. It is therefore difficult to attribute accurately all of DFID&#039;s expenditure on TB control. The following are estimated figures for funding to TB control through bilateral and multilateral channels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_205">DFID&#039;s bilateral expenditure directly targeting TB control was &#163;13 million in 2003&#150;04, and &#163;15 million in 2004&#150;05. These figures may underestimate DFID&#039;s TB bilateral expenditure since they only include the parts of projects which were specifically focused on TB control. They do not count the full costs of these projects which often provide funding to services which support TB control, but are not TB-specific. To count the full cost of these projects may be misleading as other diseases and sectoral areas are targeted within them. Expenditure estimates are not available prior to 2003 as information was not collected in a suitable format.

These figures are based on the share of spend which these organisations said they directed towards TB control (GFATM&#151;13 per cent., the WHO&#151;4 per cent.).

<a name="stpa_208">DFID provides a significant part of its funding directly to government budgets in support of their overall strategies for poverty reduction (&#039;Poverty Reduction Budget Support&#039;).

DFID has pledged &#163;5 million to the global Stop TB Partnership for 2005 to 2007, to co-ordinate technical support and supplies of quality drugs to TB programmes in developing countries, and &#163;200 million to the &#039;Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria&#039; for the two year period 2006 to 2007.

1.General Practitioner vacancies are not included in the table as the concept of a General Practitioner vacancy no longer exists under the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract. In the case of a single-handed practice, if the General Practitioner retires, resigns or is not available to practice the Primary Care Organisation (PCO) has an obligation to ensure that services are provided through contract with a new or existing provider.<br>





2.A current vacancy is an unoccupied post, which at 31 March 2005 was vacant and which the organisation was trying to fill. A long-term vacancy is an unoccupied post which at 31 March 2005 had been vacant for three months or more, and which the organisation was actively trying to fill.<br>

<p><a name="qn_261"><a name="51028w30.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will place in the Library details of the methodology used by the Department of Education Northern Ireland to determine the number of surplus places in schools.  [21503]</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51028w30.html_spnew2"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The calculation of surplus places in post-primary schools, is based on the enrolment which can be accommodated by the total physical capacity of teaching spaces less the actual number of pupils attending.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51028w30.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_261">For primary schools, the methodology is based on the schedules of accommodation in the Department of Education Building Handbook for Primary Schools, which uses enrolment bands to determine the number of classrooms that a school should have eg the enrolment band for a seven classroom school is in the range 176&#150;205 pupils. Many primary schools have a number of classrooms which are not used for teaching purposes and therefore to make some allowance for these non-teaching classrooms, the methodology for calculating surplus places has deemed the capacity of each primary school to be the lower end of the enrolment band. The actual enrolment is subtracted from this to produce an estimate of the surplus places.

<p><a name="st_261"><a name="51028w30.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Department has established a comprehensive programme to deliver its sustainable development strategy. Key to that programme has been the establishment of a network of &#039;Green Champions&#039; across the Department. This is a group of committed and enthusiastic individuals who collectively are driving forward the message of reduce, reuse and recycle in relation to the operation and management of the Department&#039;s estate.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on progress with completion of capital works at Tor Bank Special school in Dundonald; how the amount of finance 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2005 : Column 664W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
allocated by the Department of Education for this project was calculated; when this finance was allocated; and how much remains unspent.  [21371]</p>








<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51028w30.html_spnew4"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 It is expected that the invitation to negotiate for this public private partnership project (PPP) will issue to bidders before Christmas and that construction will start in the latter part of 2006. The estimated capital value of this project was calculated on the basis of construction, fees and furniture and equipment. As with all PPP projects, no financial allocation will be made until after a preferred bidder is appointed and the Department has approved the full business case. This is because thecunitary payment, which will be paid for the duration of the contract, does not commence until thecschool becomes operational.

 Tor Bank special school was announced in 2002 as part of a public-private partnership cluster along with Lagan college. It is anticipated that the invitation to negotiate will issue to bidders for this project before the end of the year and that construction would start in the latter part of 2006.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the performance of each council in Northern Ireland in waste management and <i>(b)</i> whether they are on course to meet their recycling targets.  [21360]</p>








<p><a name="st_264"><a name="51028w31.html_spnew0"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The Department reviews the annual performance reports submitted by the three district council waste management groups. The annual performance reports for 2004&#150;05 will be reviewed and reported on in December 2005. This review will include an assessment of whether the district councils are on course to meet their targets. It is anticipated that not all district councils will meet the 25 per cent. recycling target for household waste in 2005&#150;06. However, it is expected that most district councils will achieve a rate of at least 20 per cent. recycling of household waste.
