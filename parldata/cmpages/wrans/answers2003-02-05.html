They involve the political parties in Northern Ireland and both governments, including the Prime Minister and Taoiseach, who will visit Northern Ireland on 12 February. It is essential we restore the institutions on a stable basis, founded on the use of exclusively peaceful means.

<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_wqn7"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps is the Government taking to improve drug education among young people in Northern Ireland.  [93669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Under the Drug and Alcohol Campaign, various resources have been specifically allocated to educating young people against the dangers of drug use. Information and awareness raising is provided through many forums such as counselling services, treatment services, public information campaigns, projects providing life skills training and by other Departments and agencies, including the Health Promotion Agency. The Department of Education also include drug education as part of the present school curriculum, in line with the aims of the Drug Strategy, which is compulsory for all pupils aged 4&#150;16. The Education and Library Boards have each employed two full-time Field Officers, from the start of the 2000&#150;01 school year, to address the development of drug education programmes within schools and youth clubs and provide training for teachers, youth leaders, parents and governors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_wqn8"><B> David Burnside: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what he estimates the change in costs to Northern Ireland electricity customers would be if renewable generation were used.  [95000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Much would depend on the volume, nature and location of the renewable generation used; 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2003 : Column 259W</I><P>
and on whether or not it was grid connected. Generally speaking the grid connection, operational and other costs associated with assimilating renewables on to the system increases the cost to consumers. However, regulation initiatives can mitigate some of these costs to some consumers.

<a name="30205w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Employers' Liability Insurance</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. McGrady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the recent increases in employers' liability insurance in Northern Ireland; what action is being taken to address this situation; and if he will make a statement.  [95095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The current difficulties in the insurance market have a particularly adverse impact on a predominantly small and medium enterprise-based economy such as that in Northern Ireland. Three initiatives are under way to address various aspects of current difficulties: Government are conducting an urgent review of employers' liability to assess the scale and nature of the current difficulties; the Office of Fair Trading have launched a fact finding study to examine the reasons for premium increases and the Financial Services Authority are consulting on proposals for regulating the sale of general insurance.
<P>

<a name="30205w01.html_para2">In Northern Ireland the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has conducted a business survey on insurance costs. It indicates significant rises particularly (but not exclusively) in employers' liability and property insurance. The results of this survey will be fed into Government's current review in which my officials are participating. The outcome of the review will be reported to Ministers by the end of March 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many Government grants have been received by European Components in Dundonald in the last 15 years; and how much has been allocated to the company through these grants.  [94963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The information requested, covering the last 15 years, is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, over the past five years, the former Industrial Development Board offered TK-ECC (formerly European Components Corporation) a package of selective financial assistance totalling &#163;2 million.

 Additional funding in excess of &#163;80 million was allocated to the Department for Regional Development in the December 2002 Budget announcement for the development of public transport. Of this, &#163;40 million will be used to improve safety and reliability on the core railway network in accordance with the A. D. Little Safety Review and the "consolidation option" as outlined in the Railways Task Force Report. &#163;40 million will be used to purchase new coaches and buses to replace vehicles, whose "economic life" has expired, and help improve the reliability and accessibility of the Ulsterbus and Citybus fleets, including assistance with the promotion of Quality Bus Corridors. A significant proportion of this funding has been made available under the Strategic Investment Programme, hence it will be subject to final approval processes in advance of expenditure being incurred.

 The performance of the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise Service continues to give cause for concern, representing as it does a serious disruption to passenger services. Northern Ireland Railways is working closely with larnrod Eireann, their partners on the Enterprise Service, to identify the technical causes of the increasing regularity of mechanical failure on the locomotives servicing this line. Engineers have closely examined the performance of the locomotives over a 2l/2 year period. On the basis of this assessment Northern Ireland Railways and larnrod Eireann have agreed to jointly approach the suppliers of the locomotives with a view to addressing this unacceptable performance.

<a name="30205w03.html_para3">The Regional Development Strategy (RDS) acknowledges the vital role that retailing plays in the development of Northern Ireland. In particular it emphasises the need to create a thriving Metropolitan Area centred on a revitalised Belfast, through the enhancement of the role of the city, by supporting and strengthening the city centre as the leading regional shopping centre and maintaining the city centre as the primary retail and office location in the region. The RDS also advocates the development of the complementary role of the suburban districts of Castlereagh and Newtownabbey, and the development of the city of Lisburn, and the towns of Bangor and Carrickfergus and strengthening the multi-functional role of their town centres.
<P>

<a name="30205w03.html_para4">In recognition of this, the Department for Regional Development is currently preparing a new planning policy statement on Retailing and Town Centres (PPS5) to replace the current retail planning policy statement, which was first published by the Department of the Environment in June 1996. The purpose of this new policy is to assist the implementation of the Regional Development Strategy. In addition, it will provide strategic planning guidance to assist the Department of the Environment in the preparation of development plans and the determination of planning applications. Roger Tym and Partners were commissioned by the Department for Regional Development to carry out evidence-based retail research to guide the Department in the preparation of the new retail planning policy statement. The final draft report of the retail consultancy is due to be issued within the next few days. The new draft planning policy statement is scheduled to be issued for full public consultation during the next few months.

<i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> Proposed mergers in the food retail industry are considered, like other proposed mergers, under the provisions of the relevant legislation, currently the Fair Trading Act 1973. As a first step, the Office of Fair Trading investigates and then advises the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether a merger raises competition concerns meriting further in-depth investigation by the Competition Commission. The Secretary of State follows the advice of the Office of Fair Trading on whether to refer a merger to the Competition Commission, save in exceptional circumstances.

This conclusion still holds.
<P>

<a name="30205w04.html_para3">When nuclear material is subject to commercial bulk process like reprocessing, material from different origins becomes mixed in the plant and hence loses its separate identity. For each plutonium isotope, the atoms involved are also indistinguishable and thus regarded as interchangeable. This means that it is not possible to make a definitive statement about the reactors in which the plutonium concerned was produced.

 A station's operating hours are the responsibility of the operator not the British Transport Police (BTP). The decision to close Newcastle Central Station at 11.30pm, after the last passenger service has departed, was taken in 1990&#150;91 by the British Railways Board and was continued by Great North Eastern Railway. The station does partially re-open during the night to cater for passengers arriving and departing on overnight services. The BTP advised in 1993&#150;94 that the taxi rank on the station concourse should move to council property after 11.30pm because the station was no longer open and the rank was attracting large crowds that had no connection with the station.

 The licences granted by Defra under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 for the prevention of serious damage to property in Saltdean were not related to bovine TB control measures. No action on disease control grounds is currently being taken on badgers except within the Krebs trial areas. None of these is near Saltdean.

<a name="30205w06.html_para3">However given that badgers are susceptible to bovine TB it is important that any proposals to relocate badgers takes into account the risk of the spread of disease. Some five badgers positive to bovine TB were identified between 1984 and 1998 within a five kilometre radius of this sett at Saltdean. Some 55 have been found within a twenty kilometre radius.

<a name="30205w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> The UK is a member, through the EU, of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO), a United Nations body established to, among other things, "achieve a reasonable balance between world supply and demand on a basis which will assure adequate supplies of coffee at fair prices to consumers and markets for coffee at remunerative prices to producers to facilitate the expansion and transparency of international trade in coffee". The ICO, therefore monitors the world coffee market on an on-going basis and provides its members with market statistics and reports.
<P>

<a name="30205w06.html_para7">The UK contributes to the ICO's examination of its world coffee statistics and reports and to the development of its policies. A major plank of the Organisation's current activity is the Coffee Quality Improvement Programme, which was introduced on 1 October 2002. It requires exports of unprocessed coffee from member countries to comply with minimum standards which should have a positive effect upon supply and demand and, in turn, producer prices. Discussions are also under way within the organisation about how exports of processed coffee should be dealt with.

Along the stretch of river between Reading and Teddington (the effective tidal limit) the Environment Agency report that there are no riverside flood defence structures that are in worse than good condition. The weirs that primarily control water levels for navigation also have an important function in flood level control, however the condition of the weirs did not contribute to the flooding in the Thames Valley in the New Year period. The Agency advise that eight of these weirs are in worse than good condition and their reconstruction is either in progress or planned in the medium term. These weirs, with provisional reconstruction dates, are listed in the table.

However, as my answer on 23 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 911&#150;12W, to the hon.

 It remains Government policy that the fabrication and assembly of new warship hulls for the Royal Navy should be undertaken in United Kingdom shipyards, and this, of course, applies to the construction of the future aircraft carriers.

<P>

British industry is well-placed to compete for the equipment and sub-systems that will be required for the future aircraft carrier.

 The Harrier GR7 fleet will undergo two upgrade programmes over the next few years. First, 30 aircraft will be upgraded to GR7A standard by the integration of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus Mkl07 engine.

 The Ministry of Defence recognises the importance of regular communication between deployed Service personnel and their families. Consequently, although no decision has been taken to commit HM forces to military action in the Gulf, it is our intention to implement the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) for those personnel deployed to the Gulf region, where the infrastructure and environment allow.
<P>

<a name="30205w09.html_para3">The OWP includes a comprehensive communications element to enable deployed Service personnel to remain in contact with their families. This will entitle personnel to 20 minutes of publicly-funded telephone calls per week, and they will also be able to purchase additional telephone minutes. The cost of additional minutes will vary between locations, reflecting the varying types of communications system that will be installed. However, in most cases, the rate will be lower than that charged by commercial mobile telephone companies.

Merlin and Sea Kings with their early warning systems are also available. In addition, in the Gulf, force protection is provided jointly across coalition forces. Royal Navy ships have the necessary equipment to ensure that they are able to achieve a high degree of integration with coalition assets. Force protection is an issue that is well practised and understood. The threat to any United Kingdom asset is kept under review.

 Security in the Ministry of Defence is a function of command in the case of the military, and of mainstream line management, in the case of civilian staff. It is the business of Commanders and civilian managers at every level. Commanding officers/head of establishments are responsible for keeping protective security in their area of responsibility under constant review, taking into account the changing threat environment and the risks to their operational or business outputs. There is, in addition, a requirement for all establishments to be subject to formal external inspection by security staff; the minimum frequency of such inspections is determined by a system of categorisation which takes into account the threat from terrorism and espionage, and the sensitivity of the establishment concerned.
<P>

However, it is designed and built with significant space and weight margins to enable incremental acquisition should an emerging requirement necessitate a different equipment fit. Under such circumstances, the design could be modified to incorporate improved land attack capabilities including a larger calibre gun or a land attack missile system.

 The 'Sewel Convention' is a commitment made by the Government during the passage of the Scotland Bill that "the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature. The Devolved Administrations will be responsible for seeking such agreement as may be required for this purpose on an approach from the UK Government". Proposals for the inclusion of provisions relating to devolved matters in a UK Bill, and therefore the need to invoke the Sewel Convention, arise at the initiative of either the UK Government or the Executive, but in every case, require a process of discussion and agreement between the two Administrations. That process normally involves an exchange of correspondence between the UK Minister who is in charge of the Bill and the First Minister, or the relevant portfolio Minister.

 While there has been some deterioration in the food security situation in southern Africa, global acute malnutrition levels have not been found to be alarming.

However, mortality among those already sick, particularly people suffering from AIDS, have increased as a result of poor nutrition.

 The increase in the cost of rice in Madagascar is due to a combination of drought in the south and flooding in the north. In the north the harvest season for rice will begin shortly; if the flooding prevents this taking place, then prices will continue to rise and the food security situation will deteriorate further.

 I met with the President and chief executive of the Health Professions Council (HPC) on 4 December 2002; at which meeting all aspects of the HPC's proposals were discussed. However, it is for the HPC to propose and the Privy Council to determine the protected titles that will be associated with the parts and sub sections of the health professions register.
<P>

<a name="30205w15.html_para9">The aim of registration is to assure the public of the competence of registered healthcare professionals. The HPC consulted about which titles should be protected by law and restricted to use by those registered. These titles indicate that those registered have met HPC's standards of competence.

be protected by law and has undertaken extensive market research to understand the public's perception of titles currently in use by health professionals. The introduction of a sub register would not serve the aims of registration and would be likely to lead to confusion and would not assist the public when trying to make informed choices about whom to consult about their health.

 Our proposals to combine responsibility for functions of various bodies into a unified Health Protection Agency (HPA) offer a coherent, co-ordinated approach to providing specialist support for health protection and health emergency planning. It is intended that the HPA will take responsibility for providing or commissioning the specialist support that the various bodies currently provide. The unified HPA will be equipped to deal with a range of emergencies and to provide a national response.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Primary care trusts (PCTs) have a duty to reduce inequalities in their local areas and if there is a significant homeless/hostel population in their area they will be expected to have developed, or be developing plans to provide appropriate and timely access to healthcare for these people.
<P>

<a name="30205w16.html_para2">In addition, the new requirement of local authorities to carry out a review of homelessness in their area and develop a homelessness strategy with local partners such as PCTs will help to identify gaps in services and ensure that there is appropriate mainstream and specialist health care for homeless people.
<P>

<a name="30205w16.html_para3">One way of targeting this group is through personal medical services pilots, where primary care is specifically targeted to meet a particular local need. Many general practitioners and nurses in London also work closely with hostels and day centres to provide health care services to homeless people and often provide health sessions in the hostel or centre.
<P>

<a name="30205w16.html_para4">In addition, we are generally trying to improve access for all through a variety of different access routes, for example, through walk-in-centres, diagnosis treatment centres and one-stop-shop facilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The New Deal has gradually reduced the hours worked by junior doctors since its inception in 1991. However the New Deal targets have changed and become tougher, making direct comparison across the years misleading.
<P>

<a name="30205w16.html_para5">In 1991, to comply with the New Deal a junior doctor had to work less than 82 hours a week; in 1993, 72 hours a week and in 1995, 56 hours a week. The introduction of stricter rest requirements in 1998 and of the new junior doctors' pay system in December 2000 led to temporary increases in non-compliance. The overall trend, however, has been a substantial reduction in the hours worked by junior doctors from 73 per cent. complying with the 82 hour limit in 1991, to 70.6 per cent. complying with the 56 hour limit in 2002. This has been accompanied by a steady increase in the number of junior doctors working for the national health service: 23,875 in September 1991; 31,777 in September 2002.
<P>

<a name="30205w16.html_para6">Implementation of the New Deal has been supported by New Deal task forces and their successor bodies, the regional action teams, who have worked with trusts to tackle long hours.

<P>

<a name="30205w16.html_para7">By the summer of 2003 approximately &#163;31 million will have been made available to the NHS over three years, to support initiatives to help reduce junior doctors' hours and improve their living and working conditions. In addition, &#163;150 million was made available over the same three-year period to support the introduction of the new junior doctors' contract, which was designed to incentivise trusts to comply with New Deal hours and rest requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what <i>(a)</i> private and <i>(b)</i> public consultation took place between the National Asylum Seekers Support Service and constituents of Sittingbourne and Sheppey with respect to the decision to open a refugee and asylum reception centre at the Coniston Hotel in Sittingbourne; and if he will make a statement.  [91357]<P>

<P>
<a name="30205w19.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Prior to the meeting on 24 January there has been no public consultation between the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) and constituents in Sittingbourne and Sheppey. On 12 September 2002 NASS wrote to the Chief Executive of Swale Borough Council to advise that NASS was considering a tender for use of bedspaces at the Coniston Hotel. The letter from NASS made it clear that the information was at that time "Commercial in Confidence" since the tender to which it related was still being evaluated. It was suggested in the letter that Swale Borough Council liaise with other agencies to consider matters which fell outside their responsibility, such as 'Police/Crime and Disorder concerns'. The Chief Executive was asked to provide specific information and also invited to provide any additional information he felt would be appropriate or relevant to local or regional circumstances. Two written replies were received from Swale Borough Council.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) does not currently accommodate any asylum seekers in hotels or guesthouses in the Gatwick area. NASS does not have a central record of hotels used by local authorities providing housing for asylum seekers. Some people who were transferred from Sangatte are being temporarily housed in the Gatwick area.

<a name="30205w19.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hoban: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what checks are made on the accuracy of addresses provided by asylum seekers as their place of residence in the UK <i>(a)</i> at the time when they make new application for asylum and <i>(b)</i> at subsequent stages of their application.  [94921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w19.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Immigration officers at ports of entry would normally seek to verify any address which is provided by an asylum seeker as his or her place of residence in the United Kingdom. If the asylum seeker will be staying with friends or relatives, every effort is made to contact the person concerned. In addition the friend or relative's personal details and address may be checked against Home Office records, including the Warnings Index. Similar checks are run on applicants who claim in-country.
<P>

<a name="30205w19.html_para6">The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) also requires its accommodation providers to confirm in writing that an asylum seeker has arrived at accommodation which is being provided as part of a support package.
<P>

<a name="30205w19.html_para7">All claimants' addresses are entered on the Case Information Database (CID) which includes a postcode check mechanism to double-check the address.
<P>

<a name="30205w19.html_para8">The onus is on all claimants to notify any changes of address which will be entered on CID.
<P>

<a name="30205w19.html_para9">The ability to maintain contact with all asylum seekers is a primary objective of measures in the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and through the establishment of induction, accommodation and reporting centres. Asylum seekers will be informed of their obligations to provide up-to-date address details, and to report as required, during the induction process. The Immigration Service will actively manage the contact process: through the eight designated reporting centres, by using police stations and by visiting asylum seekers at their accommodation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w19.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hoban: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many crimes were committed by asylum seekers, broken down by type of offence, in the most recent year for which information is available.  [94924]<P>

<P>
<a name="30205w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I regret that the information requested is not available from existing data collection systems.
<P>

<a name="30205w19.html_para10">Information on the number of asylum applications is published quarterly on the Home Office website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html. The next publication will be available from 28 February and will cover the final quarter of 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 All police forces in England and Wales operate within the Health and Safety (Police) Act 1997 and must, therefore, conduct (and maintain) risk assessments into the roles of their officers. Where a risk is identified, body armour is one of the measures that should be considered. There are a variety of levels of protection which can be offered according to the perceived threat and a risk assessment will normally establish the level of protection required. The use of protective equipment is ultimately a matter for chief officers of police.
<P>

<a name="30205w19.html_para11">All forces in England and Wales have access to dual-purpose body armour (knives and ballistic) either as a general or pool issue. All firearms units in England and Wales have access to overt heavy-duty body armour. In May 2002, the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch set up a database to record instances when body armour has saved an officer from death or serious injury.

 On 20 January I announced that there will be an independent inquiry into the operation of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) which will include its general procurement processes. However, consultation on individual sites identified as potential accommodation for asylum seekers, whether on a short or longer term basis, will be carried out by NASS.

<P>
<a name="30205w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30205w20.html_para0">Before seeking committal warrants, local authorities must have tried other enforcement measures and before sentencing a council tax debtor to a term of imprisonment, the Court must first determine that there has been wilful non-payment. Magistrates also have the power to remit all or part of a debt if they consider this is justified.
<P>

<a name="30205w20.html_para1">The Government believes that pensioners should be treated in the same way as any other person who has failed to pay their council tax. This includes the need for the Court to determine whether the debtor has the means to pay.
<P>

<a name="30205w20.html_para2">Committal to prison for the wilful non-payment of council tax provides an incentive to encourage payment. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to abolish it.

London Underground has a number of its stations accredited under the scheme. Central funds amounting to &#163;1.36 million have also been provided to the BTP to support their participation in the Street Crime initiative. This will help BTP step up operations on and around transport, targeting stations and their car parks, station approaches and concourses as well as on tubes and trains.

 Information is not held centrally on the total numbers of police vehicle pursuits.
<P>

<a name="30205w21.html_para0">The tables, by police force area and for the years 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02, the numbers of police vehicle collisions and of police and civilian fatalities and injuries that occurred during the course of a pursuit or an immediate/emergency response have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30205w21.html_para1">The Government welcomes the recognition by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) that they must work to reduce the number of collisions involving police vehicles.
<P>

<a name="30205w21.html_para2">Measures already in place include a new police driver training course, launched in December 2000, which introduced a universal standard for driving in England and Wales. An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations, such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect. Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off. In addition, all forces have adopted some or most of the recommendations from the 1998 Lind Report on Police Pursuit Driver Training.
<P>

<a name="30205w21.html_para3">ACPO are working closely with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to identify why there appears to be an upward trend in police vehicle collisions and how this might be reversed. Useful information can be expected from the increasing use by forces of Automatic Data Recorders (ADR) and Vehicle Accident Data Recorders (VADR). These operate in a similar way to aircraft black boxes, providing data on such issues as speed, gear changes, braking, and the use of blue lights.

 I am informed by Hampshire Constabulary that the police investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr. Nick Woodward is incomplete at present. An inquest review is due to be held on 18 March 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the principal objectives are of the National Intelligence Model; and if he will make a statement on progress on implementation of the model.  [95035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Intelligence Model (NIM) is designed to ensure that operational policing is focused on policing priorities. It is informed by an evidence-based assessment of the crime or disorder occurring and the options for dealing with it. In this way policing effort can have a disproportionate impact on crime and disorder. It is an entire process for policing, developed by the service itself and is fully supported by the Home Office, which has to date invested &#163;11.1 million.
<P>

<a name="30205w21.html_para5">NIM is a key part of the Police Reform programme, and implementation is being strongly led by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), to ensure NIM is fully implemented across all 43 forces by April 2004. The ACPO-led implementation team is on track to achieve this milestone.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will define <i>(a)</i> Level 1, <i>(b)</i> Level 2 and <i>(c)</i> Level 3 crimes under the National Intelligence Model; and what purpose this framework serves.  [95036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 In order to ensure consistency and a common standard, within National Intelligence Model (NIM) level 1 is defined as usually crime, criminals and other problems affecting a basic command unit or small force area. Level 2 is defined as usually the actions of a criminal or other specific problems affecting more than one basic command unit, a group of basic command units, neighbouring forces or a group of forces. Level 3 is defined as serious and organised crime, usually operating on a national and international scale.

 Under the Police Act 1996, a police authority is responsible for ensuring an effective and efficient police force for an area. It sets an annual policing plan and a three-year strategy setting out the priorities and targets for the policing of the local area. In doing so, it must consult local people and have regard to the National Policing Plan issued by the Secretary of State. The Chief officer of police is responsible for the direction and control of the force to enforce the law and to deliver the objectives of the local policing and three-year strategy plans. Local policing policy is a matter for both the police authority and the chief officer. Operational direction and control resides with the chief officer of police. The Secretary of State, consulting where appropriate, sets strategic priorities for policing in England and Wales in the National Policing Plan. He may issue regulations, codes of practice and non-statutory guidance where he believes this to be in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of the police.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary launched a three-year safer custody programme in April 2001 aimed at reducing deaths, self-harm and violence in prisons. The programme targets the highest risk prisoners in the highest risk locations, concentrating on six pilot sites. As part of this programme the Prison Service is considering how it can improve and strengthen investigation procedures into deaths in custody to determine not only what happened in an individual case but also how practice might be improved in future to try to prevent further deaths.
<P>

<a name="30205w23.html_para0">The Prison Service has conducted a wide-scale consultation exercise, considering a number of options (including asking Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons to conduct such inquiries) to make investigations into deaths in custody more independent. Ministers are also considering whether to give responsibility for investigating deaths in prison custody to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. In the interim, the Prison Service is working to strengthen and improve the current system of investigating deaths.
<P>

<a name="30205w23.html_para1">Section 5A(4) of the Prison Act 1952 permits the Home Secretary to refer specific matters connected with prisons and prisoners to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and direct her to report on them. Similarly, the Home Secretary can ask the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman to investigate and report on any prison matter.

 Information is not collected centrally on the number of court cases postponed due to late probation reports. However, I am aware that in the last eight months the Avon and Somerset probation area has had difficulty in meeting the demand of the magistrates courts for court reports
<P>

<a name="30205w23.html_para6">The National Director of the National Probation Service has recently issued revised guidance on the prioritisation of work and the Chief Officer and the Probation Board of the Avon and Somerset probation area are carefully monitoring the position. Action has been taken by the Chief Officer to manage and improve the situation, including prioritising certain categories of case, redeploying some staff from other service delivery areas and recruiting and training new staff subject to budget limitations. The Probation Board reviews the probation area's performance at regular intervals and received a report on the provision of reports to court at it's meeting in January and will receive a further report on progress being made in April.

 Information is not available centrally on average times for probation officers to submit reports to courts, but is collected to record performance against the National Standards target which requires that pre-sentence reports are to be prepared within 15 working days of the request by the court (National Standards for the Supervision of Offenders in the Community 2000 (revised 2002)). The National Probation Service currently has a target to produce 90 per cent. of Pre-Sentence Reports within 15 days. The latest figures, which relate to magistrates courts, show that for all probation areas in 2001&#150;02 79 per cent. of reports were provided within the 15 day target.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Home Office does not routinely publish national statistics on recorded crime on a monthly basis. Annual national statistics on recorded crime, including robbery, will be published in July 2003 for the period April 2002 to March 2003. This will provide a direct comparison with the previous year (April 2001 to March 2002), of the level of robbery offences for each police force area in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30205w23.html_para7">A quarterly update on recorded crime was published early in January and covered the 12 month period to September 2002. This showed that recorded robbery in England and Wales fell by an estimated 10 per cent. in July to September 2002, compared with the same period the previous year. However the quarterly update does not provide a force by force breakdown.

<a name="30205w23.html_para8">Snatch theft is not a standard Home Office offence category, although information on snatch thefts has been collected from April 2002 for the 10 forces currently taking part in the Government's Street Crime Initiative.

<P>
<a name="30205w24.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the Government's policy is on the application of planning rules to horticultural polytunnels.  [95056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The application of statutory planning regulations is a matter for local planning authorities in the first instance. In the case of polytunnels, where they are placed temporarily, without any permanent fixings, on agricultural land and used for horticulture, they may be deemed to be a use of land for agriculture and therefore exempt from planning controls under the provisions of section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para5">Where the erection of polytunnels is deemed to constitute 'development' under the provisions of the 1990 Act, 'permitted development rights' under part 6 of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 1995 may be available. In certain cases, these permitted development rights cannot be exercised unless an application has been made to the local planning authority for a determination as to whether their prior approval will be required for certain details relating to the siting, design and appearance of the development.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para6">In other cases where the erection of polytunnels is deemed to be 'development' and permitted development rights cannot be exercised, an application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority. The authority will determine the application in accordance with policies in the development plan, taking account of national planning policies.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para7">The Government's national planning policies on development related to agriculture, including horticulture, are set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 7 (PPG 7), "The Countryside".
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para8">Whether the erection of any particular polytunnel is deemed to constitute development will depend on the facts of each case. Ultimately, this is a matter for the courts who are likely to place weight on several factors that may indicate the degree of 'permanence' of the structure. These factors are reflected in the advice given in paragraph C11 of Annex C to PPG7.

<P>

 In England, during 2001&#150;02, completions of dwellings to rent by Registered Social Landlords and local authorities totalled 14,470. A further 7,400 dwellings were provided in through Registered Social Landlords shared ownership and other low cost schemes.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will issue a top-up grant of &#163;464,058 to the East Riding of Yorkshire Council for the provision of nursery school places to 381 applicants for this academic year following the migration of these children into the county subsequent to the allocation of the 2002&#150;03 nursery education grant.  [93846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w24.html_spnew7"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para9">On 11 December 2002, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced that all three-year-olds will be entitled to receive a free part-time early education place from April 2004. This is six months earlier than originally planned. Currently around 70 per cent. of three-year-olds are able to access a free place.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para10">Funding for the provision of free early education places is made available to local education authorities on the basis of financial, rather than academic, years. During the 2002&#150;03 financial year, we have made &#163;275 million of Nursery Education Grant funding available for the provision of free places for three-year-olds. Funding has been allocated to local education authorities primarily according to their position on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Index of Multiple Deprivation. East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been allocated &#163;1,353,198 to fund 1,111 places. Local education authorities are responsible for devising eligibility criteria for the distribution of free places in their area according to social need and without exceeding their allocation.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para11">At the end of the autumn term, the Department for Education and Skills reallocated Nursery Education Grant funding from authorities who were unable to use their full allocation to authorities who were able to use additional funding. East Riding of Yorkshire received anadditional &#163;283,794 as a result of this exercise.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para12">Also, the audit of Nursery Education Grant in the East Riding of Yorkshire for 2001&#150;02 showed that there was an underspend of &#163;198,670 which ought to be returned to Department for Education and Skills. In light of the circumstances currently faced by East Riding of Yorkshire Council, the Department for Education and Skills has exceptionally allowed them to carry over this amount to 2002&#150;03. Therefore, East Riding of Yorkshire Council has received a total of &#163;482,464 additional funding for the spring term 2003.
<P>

<a name="30205w24.html_para13">From the 2003&#150;04 financial year, funding for the provision of free places is being transferred into Education Formula Spending as part of an overall &#163;500 million transfer of DfES grant funding into general funding. A total of &#163;319 million Nursery Education Grant funding is being transferred into the under fives sub-block. The funding for authorities such as East Riding of Yorkshire who have not yet achieved universal provision is being calculated to ensure that they have sufficient funding to provide a free place for 85 per cent. of their three year old population. 85 per cent. is the DfES planning assumption for universal provision for three-year-olds.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many affordable housing units were <i>(a)</i> in use and <i>(b)</i> unused in (i) England and (ii) local authorities defined as rural, by region, in each year since 1978.  [90832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Numbers of residential dwellings and vacancy levels in stock owned by local authorities and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) are reported by local authorities annually on Housing Investment Programme returns, and since 1993 by RSLs on Housing Corporation RSR returns. Data for RSL vacant stock at LA level between 1979 (the earliest available data) and 1992 are not as complete as in later years, and consequently figures for rural authorities will be slightly underestimated.
<P>

<a name="30205w25.html_para0">Regional estimates, distinguishing the position in local authorities regarded as rural, as at 1 April for each of the past ten years, and for selected years back to 1979, are in a table that has been placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has to reform the system whereby council tenants contribute to the cost of housing benefit for other tenants.  [95741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Council tenants' rents are not used at present to meet housing benefit costs. What really happens is that assumed Housing Revenue Account surpluses are captured and put towards Housing Revenue Account subsidy for other authorities who are unable to meet reasonable expenditure on their housing stock from their assumed rental income. This is done by offsetting the assumed Housing Revenue Account surplus against the subsidy for rent rebates due to that authority.
<P>

<a name="30205w25.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that this system is not transparent or well understood and is addressing this in the Local Government Bill currently before Parliament, through which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes to remove rent rebates from the Housing Revenue Account and subsidise them separately in the General Fund.

 The Government have already announced the absolute increases in service control totals for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 as part of 2002 Spending Review. The next planned re-examination of service control totals will be part of the 2004 Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30205w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 There is no requirement for local authority members to inform us of retirements or resignations, for whatever reason.

<P>
<a name="30205w26.html_spnew6"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Since 1998 all local education authorities (LEAs) have been under a statutory duty to provide a free part-time nursery education place for all four year olds whose parents want one. Funding for three year olds provision was made available in 1999. A PSA target was set for increasing the number of nursery places for three year olds to 66 per cent. by March 2002, this target was met in advance of the agreed date. Significant progress has been made to achieving universal provision for three year olds, currently around 70 per cent. of three year olds are able to access a free place.
<P>

<a name="30205w26.html_para3">65 of the most deprived local education authorities already offer a free place to all three year olds whose parents want one, these are listed below. The remaining authorities are responsible for devising eligibility criteria for the distribution of free places in their area according to social need.
<P>

<a name="30205w26.html_para4">The Secretary of State recently announced that all three year olds will be entitled to receive a free place from April 2004. This is six months earlier than our manifesto commitment of September 2004.

<a name="30205w26.html_para5">From 2003&#150;04, Nursery Education Grant funding is being transferred into Education Formula Spending as part of an overall &#163;500 million transfer of DfES grant funding into general funding. A total of &#163;319 million Nursery Education Grant will be added to the Under fives sub-block. We have also updated the baseline we use to calculate the control totals for the schools sub-blocks which has resulted in a further substantial increase to the Under fives sub-block.

 Specialist schools are a central part of this Government's overall framework for raising standards in secondary education in England.
