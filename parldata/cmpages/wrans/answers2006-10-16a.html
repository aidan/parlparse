Thomas:</b> Research funded by the Government at the Hadley
Centre suggests that climate change could lead to a drier climate in
the Amazon Basin. A less disturbed forest will better adapt to these
conditions, a more fragmented one will be more vulnerable to fire and
therefore less resilient. Most climate models agree that complete
removal of the Amazonian forest would lead to a drying of the climate,
because local rainfall depends on recycling of water via the forest.
Removal of the Amazonian forest could also affect local climates in
neighbouring regions through changes in atmospheric circulation. The
effect on agriculture could be profound and research by Brazil's
national meteorological service suggests that the rainfall in the La
Plata Basin (where much of Brazil's hydroelectric power is generated)
depends on moisture transported via the atmosphere from Amazonia. In
addition to these potential impacts on agricultural production and
power generation, loss of forest as a result of climate change would
result in significant reduction in biodiversity and access to forest
products which contribute to local livelihoods. Conflicts related to
access to natural resources would be exacerbated.</p><br>

Thomas:</b> The cornerstone of preventing obstetric fistula is
prompt access to good quality health care when needed. DFID is
committed to helping countries expand access to health care, including
family planning, safe abortion services, antenatal and obstetric
services, all of which are vital for preventing fistula. Meeting the
existing demand for family planning services would reduce maternal
deaths and injuries by over 20 per cent. DFID is the only major
bilateral donor to have a strategy focused on reducing maternal
mortality. Copies of the first progress report on the strategy can be
found in the Library of the
House.</p><p><a name="06101619000098">The effects of
fistula can be devastating for the lives of girls and women, whose
babies often die. Rendered incontinent they are often rejected by their
husbands, thrown out of their homes and excluded from community life.
DFID is therefore committed to promoting the rights of girls and women,
particularly their sexual and reproductive rights, and to the
elimination of harmful practices such as early marriage and female
genital mutilation, which can significantly increase the risk of
fistula.</p><p><a name="06101619000099">DFID targets
some funding through NGOs to tackle obstetric fistula. For Example,
DFID has provided a grant of &#163;558,000 to the EngenderHealth and
Women&#146;s Dignity Project to combat obstetric fistula in Tanzania
and Uganda, and &#163;140,000 to the Obstetric Fistulae in Africa
Project. To compliment our country level support, DFID channels funds
through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). DFID provides
&#163;20 million a year core funding and in 2004 provided &#163;10
million specifically for reproductive health supplies. DFID also
provides an annual contribution of &#163;19 million to the United
Nations Children&#146;s Fund (UNICEF) and &#163;12.5 million to the
World Health Organisation (WHO), whose programmes support work on
women&#146;s empowerment, maternal and reproductive

likely future air quality in their areas. The first step of the review
and assessment process is an Updating and Screening Assessment (USA),
which is to be undertaken by all LAs, every three years, to identify
those matters that have changed since the last round was completed.
Where LAs consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air
quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be
met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality
management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is
expected. These LAs must then take action, along with other agencies

objectives.</p><p><a name="06101623000050">When the

AQMA.</p><p><a name="06101623000051">The second round

Bradshaw:</b> Last year the Government launched the Courtauld
Commitment, a voluntary agreement between 13 major retailers and the
Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), to reduce packaging waste.
There are three broad objectives to meet, which
are:</p><a name="61016w0002.htmbrev_66"><a name="06101623000360"><ul><p class="tabletext">i. to design out
packaging waste growth by
2008;</p></ul><a name="61016w0002.htmbrev_67"><a name="06101623000361"><ul><p class="tabletext">ii. to

and</p></ul><a name="61016w0002.htmbrev_68"><a name="06101623000362"><ul><p class="tabletext">iii. to identify
ways to tackle the problem of food
waste.</p></ul><p><a name="06101623000076">I will shortly
be meeting with the retailers and WRAP to assess progress against these
objectives, and to agree next steps. I am also meeting
retailers on the 12 October to discuss ways in which we can take action
to reduce the amount of plastic bags offered at the point of sale and
encourage their
reuse.</p><p><a name="06101623000077">There are also
two sets of Regulations in place which address the environmental impact
of packaging in the UK; both of which encourage producers (including
retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility
Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase
the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging
waste producers have to recover and recycle, and the cost of doing so,
is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle.
Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of
packaging they deal
with.</p><p><a name="06101623000078">The Packaging
(Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number
of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK,
including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that
the volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to
maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the
packed product and for the
consumer.</p><p><a name="06101623000079">Both
regulations have led to decreases in packaging used around products.
However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging
that is produced. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to
work with industry to find solutions to this problem and recommend ways
of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging
they
use.</p><p><a name="06101623000080"><b><a name="61016w0002.htm_spnew512"><a name="06101623000394">Mark

estimated 19-21 per cent. of the total plastics consumed in the UK in
2005-06 were recycled. The Government are taking action to support the
reduction of plastic packaging in the waste stream and the recycling of
plastics more
generally.</p><p><a name="06101623000084">There are
numerous different types of plastics in use, which would require
separate collection (or separation after collection) and treatment
facilities to recycle. It inevitably takes time for that capacity to
develop. Local authorities have understandably tended to focus their
attention on waste streams that make a greater contribution to their
targets and for which recycling infrastructure and markets are more
developed. However, with targets for household waste recycling and
composting becoming ever more demanding, all local authorities will
have to start tackling the more difficult waste streams like
plastics.</p><p><a name="06101623000085">The Waste
and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is working to further develop
efficient markets for recycled materials. WRAP'S targets for 2004-06
are to work with the plastics industry to increase the acceptance of
recycled plastic throughout the supply chain, to deliver an additional
20,000 tonnes of domestic plastic bottle recycling capacity, and to
ensure that an additional 11,000 tonnes of non-bottle plastics are
recycled.</p><p><a name="06101623000086">The
Packaging Regulations set targets for recovery and recycling of
packaging waste to be met by obligated businesses each year so that the
UK can meet the relevant EU directive targets by the specified
deadline. The directive requires the UK to recycle 22.5 per
cent. of the plastic packaging waste entering the UK waste stream by
2008. Currently around 20 per cent. of plastic packaging is recycled in
the UK.</p><p><a name="06101623000087">Defra is

package of measures set out by the Government provides the Mayor with
increased powers and responsibility to deliver his municipal waste
management strategy and spatial development strategy for London. The
Mayor sets out policies relating to new technologies and renewable
energy, which may include hydrogen production, in his municipal waste
management strategy. The enhancement of his powers to require waste
authorities to deliver services in general conformity with his
strategy, along with his existing power of direction, will help ensure
the strategic vision the Mayor sets out for London is delivered on the
ground.</p><p><a name="06101623000199">The Waste and
Recycling Forum announced as part of the package will be led by the
Mayor to co-ordinate activity across different sectors and address the
key strategic issues facing London. The Waste and Recycling Fund is
associated with this and should be used to link waste with other London
priorities such as transport and climate change. The Mayor leads on the
London Hydrogen Partnership, which has just released a report on
hydrogen as the bus fuel of the future, where he is working to
introduce 70 hydrogen vehicles. I will be interested to see how he
takes this forward and links it with

These reduce build-up of deposits within the fuel system, fuel

Tom Harris:</b> The DfT published a consultation document on
29 September 2006 which set out four options for implementation of the
Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy [RUS]. The principal
focus of the RUS is on delivery of increased capacity to relieve
crowding on peak London commuting services and improved operational
performance. However, all the options are also expected to deliver an
improvement in journey times between Sussex coast stations and London
termini due to the provision of separate services to and from the east
and west coastway routes in place of the present combined services.
Elimination of the time penalty when trains split or join at Haywards
Heath is expected to reduce the overall journey time of these trains by
between three and seven minutes, though this is subject to confirmation
as the details of the new timetable are

aid the transition, to support parental choice and to reflect provider
circumstances. These included: allowing that the 38 weeks provision
could be delivered by a single provider or by providers in cooperation;
indicating that where a parent decided explicitly that they wanted to
take their provision with a provider offering only 33 weeks they could
do so and the provider would be paid for that period; and recommending

all Key Stages we have made efforts to ensure that standards of

experience that children who achieve level 4 (the expected level for
their age) or above in English and mathematics at the end of Key Stage
2 tests are more likely to achieve grade C or above in their English
and mathematics GCSEs. The reforms we are pushing through at primary
level, particularly the renewed Primary Framework for Literacy and
Mathematics, will play an important part in helping children achieve
more at GCSE.</p><br>

GCSE and replaced it with a two-tier qualification, meaning that all
pupils will have the opportunity of achieving a grade C; and have
established a National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of
Mathematics. We are also making changes to the mathematics curriculum
to better meet the needs of diverse employers and individual pupils. As
part of our overhaul of literacy and numeracy qualifications,
mathematics and English GCSEs will be restructured to place functional
skills at their heart. In addition, the review of the Key Stage 3
national curriculum will provide greater flexibility for teachers to
meet pupils' needs and opportunities to concentrate on securing the
basics in English and
mathematics.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61016w0007.htm_wqn2"><a name="06101635000014">Geography</h3><p><a name="06101635000435"><b><a name="61016w0007.htm_spnew662"><a name="06101635002276">Mr.

Knight:</b> The phonics pilot scheme referred to (the Early
Reading Development Pilot) was designed to test whether phonic work
could be taught faster and more systematically to bring about better
literacy outcomes for children while still maintaining the benefits of
the broader foundation stage curriculum. The scheme, which began before
Jim Rose's report was published, was based on existing Primary National
Strategy teaching materials and therefore did not generate information
on the effectiveness of alternative interventions.</p><p><a name="06101635000492">In line with statutory guidance
for the age group involved (four and five-year-olds), children were
assessed against the relevant early learning goals within the
foundation stage profile. Teachers regularly assessed children's
progress in acquiring knowledge of the 44 phonemes (sounds) in the
English language and in their ability to use this knowledge to read and
spell unfamiliar words. Feedback from the programme suggests the
approaches used have led to improvements in the development of phonic
knowledge and skills, without compromise to children's wider
development. An independent consultant reviewed the work undertaken by
schools and early years settings as part of the pilot, looking at areas
such as data and the progress made by practitioners and children in
following the pilot approaches. This confirmed that there had been a
positive impact on children's progress and on practitioners' confidence
and expectations of children's attainment.</p><p><a name="06101635000493">We are implementing Jim Rose's

offers significant opportunities for cost-competitive carbon dioxide
reduction by 2030. Six different types of transport energy chain have
this potential and also offer increased energy security. None is
readily available today and each would require significant changes to
the energy system. However, they are sufficiently promising to be worth

accommodating wind generation wishing to connect to the grid network in
Wales lies with the distribution network operators, SP Manweb and
Western Power Distribution, and the National Grid Company. However, the
DTI, in conjunction with Ofgem, established the Transmission Working
Group (and its predecessor the Transmission Issues Working Group) to
monitor progress in identifying and delivering GB-wide grid
infrastructure upgrades necessary to accommodate the Government's
renewable targets. The DTI is also working closely with the National
Grid Company on studies to review the future performance of GB
Transmission system with a renewable generation capacity commensurate
with achievement of these targets. I hope that the outcome of these
studies will be available early in the new
year.</p><br>

1. The only new deal programme available to Pathways to Work customers
is the new deal for disabled people (NDDP), which is available through
the Choices package. 2. As requested this answer is based on
the number of participants who have entered Pathways and then
subsequently taken up NDDP. The total number of Pathways starts and
NDDP take-up is higher as an individual can have multiple spells on
Pathways. 3. It would not be appropriate to infer a precise
NDDP take-up rate from the data supplied in this response as it would
be an underestimate of the true underlying NDDP take-up rate due to the
fact that more recent cases will have had less time to take up
NDDP. 4. Stock customers can volunteer for the normal Pathways

Purnell:</b> The timetable as proposed is
designed to broadly keep pace with the projected rises in average life
expectancy and so maintain at a roughly constant level the same
proportion of adult life spent in receipt of the state pension
following the proposed increase in state pension age as set out in the
Pensions White Paper Security in Retirement: Towards a New Pensions
System.</p><p><a name="06101712000194">Our intention
is that each increase will be implemented gradually over a two-year
period. The first increase from 65 to 66 will be phased in between
April 2024 and April 2026; the increases from 66 to 67 and from 67 to
68 will be implemented in the same way, starting from April 2034 and
April 2044 respectively.</p><p><a name="06101712000195">Increasing state pension age
with no transitional period would mean that two people born a day apart
could have a year between their respective state pension ages, while a
more extended transition period would increase complexity. We consider
that our proposal, which follows a similar model as will apply to the
increases in state pension age for women between 2010 and 2020 under
the Pensions Act 1995, strikes a reasonable balance between fairness
and simplicity.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61016w0014.htm_wqn0"><a name="06101712000019">Post

from motor vehicles, is addressed in the Milton Keynes Community Safety
Partnership's (CSP) overall strategy for crime reduction, which is
supported by a detailed Police Basic Command Unit (BCU) Crime Reduction
Plan. The CSP continues to target vehicle crime through enforcement,
prevention, intelligence and
communication.</p><p><a name="06101720000240">Police
operations have been targeted both at known offenders and at those
areas where offences have been committed. These have been supported by
regular dedicated automatic number plate recognition operations and the
daily use of this technology by the Thames Valley Police Roads Policing
Department in the Milton Keynes area. The CSP has also made effective
use of CCTV, and has both a fixed and a mobile capability to target
known &#145;hotspot&#146;
locations.</p><p><a name="06101720000241">There are

Offenders scheme, receiving intensive supervision by both the police
and probation service. Of these, 23 have offending histories of, or

crime.</p><p><a name="06101720000242">The CSP and
police have undertaken a number of actions to
raise</p><p><a name="06101720000243">awareness of vehicle crime
and advise the public on how to protect their property. For instance,
as more than 20 per cent. of vehicle crime in Milton Keynes since

specific communications activity has taken place to raise public
awareness and reduce offending

in the senior responsible owner, a Home Office director who is also
chief executive (designate) of the National Policing Improvement
Agency. The SRO is accountable to the Secretary of State through the
responsible director general and the permanent secretary. He is advised
by a steering group on which the main stakeholder interests are

Board chaired by a representative of the Association of Chief Police
Officers.</p><p><a name="06101720000334">The
IMPACT programme has produced a number of business cases covering the
development of the IMPACT nominal index, which has subsequently been
delivered to forces and is proving to be a valuable tool in child
protection work; the Cross-Regional Information Sharing Project
(CRISP), which is currently in the early stages of a competitive
procurement exercise; and the Police National Database (PND), which is
due to be delivered in 2010. The Home Office has yet to give approval
to the programme to contract for the CRISP service and to initiate
procurement of the PND pending further work which is due to be
concluded in March
2007.</p><p><a name="06101720000335">The
cost of producing the business cases cannot be disaggregated from other
programme costs without disproportionate cost. The total cost of the

million (budget) in the current financial

Darent Valley Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC). They advised those
present that the SARC model provides the highest level of support for
victims of sexual violence. It was on this basis that a start-up grant
of &#163;30,000 was provided by the Home Office to Kent police in
2003-04. The ongoing running costs of a SARC are the responsibility of
local police forces and primary care trusts, and national service

Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 162 for lung
cancer and 174 for female breast cancer for the years 1985 to 2000, and
Tenth Revision (1CD-10) codes C33-C34 for lung cancer and C50 for
breast cancer for 2001 onwards.  Between 1984 and 1992 a
different interpretation of ICD-9 selection Rule 3 was used to code
underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used
internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period
and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The
impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported
in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994. *The introduction of
ICD-l0 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are
not completely comparable with data for years before this date.
Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore
also be interpreted with caution. An article specifically examining the
effect of the change in classification for cancer trends was published
in Health Statistics Quarterly 23. ** More information about these
change can be found on the National Statistics website at

the years 1975 to 1978, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 140-208 for the
years 1979 to 2000, and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes C00-C97 for 2001
onwards. Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation of ICD-9
selection Rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England
and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that
comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be
interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality
statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications
in 1984 and 1994. * The introduction of ICD-l0 for coding cause of
death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable
with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data
before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with
caution. An article specifically examining the effect of the change in
classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics
Quarterly 23. ** More information about these changes can be found on
the National Statistics website at
www.statistics.gov.uk/icdl0mortality.  <sup>(3)</sup> Figures
are for registrations of death in each calendar year from 1975 to 1992
