<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when the Government intends to respond to the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#039;s Report entitled Aircraft in Flight; and if he will make a statement.  [221400]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew2"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#039;s (RCEP) report &quot;The Environmental Effects of Civil Aircraft in Flight&quot; was their response to the Government&#039;s 2002 consultation on the future development of air transport in the UK. The Secretary of State for Transport met the chairman of the RCEP, Sir Tom Blundell, in March 2003 to discuss the report. The report was one of over 500,000 responses to the consultation, which informed decisions on &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper published in December 2003.

<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when an evaluation was last carried out of the need for traffic light controls at Junction 14 on the M5; who was consulted on the results; and whether the results were published.  [220902]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The last evaluation of the need for traffic light controls at Junction 14 on the M5 was undertaken by the Highways Agency in October 2004. The agency consulted South Gloucestershire council, who are the highway authority for the B4509 at Junction 14.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w01.html_para0">
The traffic light controls will prevent traffic queuing back onto the motorway and improve safety for right turning traffic from the B4509 onto the M5, which has been the cause of a number of collisions. In accordance with normal practice, the results of the evaluation were not published.

<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the operation of the newly installed traffic lights at Junction 14 on the M5.  [220903]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The lights at this junction have been installed to help improve safety for all road users by reducing the number of personal injury accidents and decreasing congestion. The Highways Agency and its contractor are currently working to rectify a component problem and the lights should be operational by the end of March.

<a name="50314w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Motor Cycling Strategy</h3>


<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the effects of the Government&#039;s motor cycling strategy, with particular reference to the proposal to amend the Government&#039;s guidance on bus lanes, on levels of use of powered two wheelers; and what assessment he has made of the consequent effects of any changes in levels on <i>(a)</i> the Government&#039;s objectives to encourage increased walking, cycling and public transport use, <i>(b)</i> the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, <i>(c)</i> overall road safety, <i>(d)</i> pollutant emissions and <i>(e)</i> noise emissions.  [220851]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The National Motorcycling Strategy is a framework for developing policy and action to ensure that motorcycling is fully recognised as a mode of transport. The Department has published research by consultants Halcrow and Rand Europe and WSP into factors affecting the level of use of motorcycles, which included preliminary assessments of environmental effects of greater use, although not specifically in the context of allowing motorcycles to use bus lanes. The Government is aware of a number of concerns relating to motorcycling in bus lanes which is why we are working with local authorities to evaluate the safety and other effects of this before revising our guidance. We will consult widely on any resulting changes to the guidance.

<a name="50314w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Penalty Payments</h3>


<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn6"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport where responsibility will lie for the collection of penalty payments from train operating companies once the Railways Bill comes into force.  [221005]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Penalty payment provisions are contained in some, though not all, passenger rail franchise agreements. Under the Railways Bill, responsibility for passenger rail franchises would pass to the Secretaries of State for Transport and Scotland as appropriate.
</p>




<a name="50314w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Pollution (Ships)</h3>


<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Robathan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations he has received regarding the timescale for UK compliance with <i>(a)</i> MARPOL, <i>(b)</i> the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, <i>(c)</i> the Protocol of 1978 and <i>(d)</i> associated regulations.  [221132]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The United Kingdom has ratified the MARPOL Convention and the protocols to the Convention. The United Kingdom has already implemented Annexes I, II, III and V to MARPOL in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2005 : Column 3W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
national law, and is in the process of implementing Annexes IV and VI. I have received no representations regarding the timescale for UK compliance with MARPOL.

<a name="50314w01.html_sbhd6"><h3 align=center>Rail Services</h3>


<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Lyons: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will include the introduction of new rolling stock as part of the negotiations for the new East Coast Mainline contract.  [220348]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Bidders for the franchise have been allowed to propose their own rolling stock solutions for the provision of the service within the specifications laid out in the Invitation to Tender. This does not exclude new rolling stock as a potential option.
</p>





<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn9"><b> Brian Cotter: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on increases in rail fares for 2005&#150;06; and what action he plans to take to invest in the rail network and improve services.  [220355]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Following the Strategic Rail Authority Fares Review in 2003 we announced that regulated fares would in future rise by RPI plus 1 per cent. from January 2004. This would help redress the balance of funding between the taxpayer and the fare payer. Increases in unregulated fares are a commercial matter for the train operating companies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w01.html_para1">
Government funding and investment in the rail network continues to run at unprecedented levels. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, made a detailed statement on this matter on 10 February 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 93WS.

<a name="50314w01.html_sbhd7"><h3 align=center>Regional Offices</h3>


<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn10"><b> Mrs. Spelman: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport which <i>(a)</i> non-departmental public bodies and <i>(b)</i> Executive agencies within the remit of his Department have regional offices based on the Government offices for the regions&#039; regional structure; and when the regional offices were established in each case.  [219885]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew10"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 None of the non-departmental public bodies and Executive agencies within the remit of this Department have regional offices based on the Government offices for the regions&#039; regional structure.

<a name="50314w01.html_sbhd8"><h3 align=center>SS Richard Montgomery</h3>


<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn11"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of whether there were <i>(a)</i> chemicals and <i>(b)</i> biological weapons or component parts on board the SS Richard Montgomery when it sank in the Thames Estuary.  [220435]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The cargo manifest for the SS Richard Montgomery does not list any chemical or biological weapons, or component parts. However, I have recently commissioned work to examine the current risks posed by the ordnance that remains on board. The results of this study will inform consideration of possible future management options for the wreck.

<p><a name="50314w01.html_wqn12"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the reliability of Thameslink services from Mill Hill and Hendon.  [220522]</p>




<p><a name="50314w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Reliability problems with the train fleet used by Thameslink during the CTRL blockade affected the performance of its services in the run up to Christmas. Action has been taken to address these problems and performance has since improved.

<p><a name="50314w02.html_wqn0"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much was paid, and on which dates, through the Strategic Rail Authority to train operating companies in respect of compensation for loss of revenue during industrial disputes in each of the last three years.  [221003]</p>




<p><a name="50314w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The arrangements under which the Strategic Rail Authority is able, at its discretion, to compensate train operators for loss of revenue in these circumstances have existed only since March 2003. Since then, payments have been made in March 2003 (&#163;12.65 million); June 2003 (&#163;3 million); January 2004 (&#163;6.8 million); July 2004 (&#163;143,000); and November 2004 (&#163;701,000).
</p>





<p><a name="50314w02.html_wqn1"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what funds he has set aside to compensate train operating companies in the event of industrial disputes on the railways in the 2004&#150;05 financial year.  [221004]</p>




<p><a name="50314w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 None. Payments of this sort are made entirely at the discretion of the Strategic Rail Authority and there may well be years in which none is made. No specific provision is therefore made and any payment would have to be funded from within the SRA&#039;s existing budgets.

<p><a name="50314w02.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of whether the 29 March deadline for the introduction of the Working Time Directive regulations applicable to road haulage operators will be met.  [218634]</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what guidance she plans to issue to the police on criteria to be used in deciding whether non-lethal methods of control under General Licence WLF18 are ineffective or unpracticable.  [221095]</p>




<p><a name="50314w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 March 2005]:</i> There is no requirement for the police to decide whether non-lethal methods of control are either ineffective or

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the average rental price of farmland in each <i>(a)</i> Welsh and <i>(b)</i> English county was in each of the last five years.  [221327]</p>


 


<p><a name="50314w02.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Farmland rental prices are collected through the Tenanted Land Survey (TLS), previously called the Annual Survey of Tenanted Land (ASTL). We do not produce results on a regional basis for two reasons.

<p>
<a name="50314w02.html_para0">
Firstly, analysis has shown that most of the variation in rental prices is between farm types, with rental consistent across regions within this&#151;i.e. rental prices for a cereal holding are similar no matter where the holding is located.

<a name="50314w02.html_para1">
Secondly, the relatively small sample size means that data would not be sufficiently robust to make valid and precise conclusions on a county level basis.

 The Soil Guideline Values Task Force is an initiative of the Cabinet Office Business Regulation team and the Government Departments and Agencies most involved in the publication of the Defra/Environment Agency soil guideline values and related materials. This technical guidance helps in assessing risk to human health in connection with land contamination, for example when considering regulatory action or proposals for development of land. Two subgroups have 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2005 : Column 9W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
recently been set up to explore training and possible additional guidance. The Local Authority Standing Conference on Land Contamination is represented on the Task Force, and all local authorities in England were notified about the initiative earlier this year. No other guidance has been given to local authorities in respect of the Task Force. We currently expect proposals from the Task Force later in the year, and that these will be made publicly available.

Notes:<br>

1. The government allocates funds to LEAs via Education Formula Spending and grants. These funds are then distributed by the LEA to schools within their area according to their own local formulae. Education Formula Spending is part of the wider local government finance system and is supported by council tax as well as central government grant.<br>

2. Total funding includes funding via Education Formula Spending and revenue grants. These figures include the pensions transfer to EFS and the Learning and Skills Council, and are in cash terms.<br>

3. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education EFS settlements and include the pensions transfer to EFS and LSC.<br>

4. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15 and exclude EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>

5. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the EFS settlement calculations.<br>

6. Figures are reported in cash terms and rounded to the nearest 10 as reported by the LEA.<br>

However, we have brought up funding levels for Further Education as we said we would, without penalising schools. The Learning and Skills Council&#039;s funding rates per course in FE have been rising faster than school sixth forms and the gap has narrowed.

Specific programmes, such as the Strategies&#039; English as an Additional Language (EAL) pilot and Aiming High &quot;Raising the Achievement of Minority Ethnic Pupils&quot;, also address the needs of particular groups of under-achieving pupils which include African-Caribbean pupils, Gypsy and Traveller pupils, pupils from mainly Muslim backgrounds and isolated minority ethnic pupils. In addition, schools now have access to better data on individual pupils and comparative performance than ever before which enables them to identify underperformance and set appropriately challenging pupil targets.

 The events mentioned occurred so long ago that it is unlikely that any intellectual property rights exist in any information within the Department originating from Germany prior to its unconditional surrender in 1945. However, as is well known, some technologies now used widely in defence have their origins prior to the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) consists of the three former organisations&#151;the Prison Service, Probation Service and Correctional Services.

The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction.

Since 2001, a total of &#163;1.93 million has been allocated to Coventry CDRP under these initiatives.

Tackling drug misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2005 : Column 41W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
</ul>

Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &#163;1,244 million in 2003&#150;04, rising to &#163;1,344 million in 2004&#150;05. Coventry has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the through care and aftercare elements of the Drug Interventions Programme. In 2003&#150;04 the allocation for Coventry drug action team amounted to &#163;2.08 million, rising to &#163;2.83 million in 2004&#150;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Coventry, South constituency can be obtained from the Coventry drugs action team, for contact details see http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams.

The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &#163;125 million is being invested across the country through the future builders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website http://www.active-citizen.org.uk.

This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people&#039;s lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at www.yearofthevolunteer.org.

 The use of the methylamphetamine or crystal meth in the UK is negligible. We continue to monitor the incidence of methylamphetamine through liaison with police and customs officials.

 Arrests for cannabis possession have fallen by a third in the first year since reclassification in January 2004, which amounts to an estimated saving of 199,000 police hours. It is an operational decision for each police force to determine the level of resources employed in tackling Class A offences. Operation Crackdown, launched in January and involving 33 forces, demonstrates how forces are working to combat drug misuse and dealing.

<p><a name="50314w13.html_wqn3"><b> Pete Wishart: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what policies in the areas of <i>(a)</i> crime reduction, <i>(b)</i> antisocial behaviour, <i>(c)</i> policing and <i>(d)</i> active communities have been put in place since 1997 by his Department (i) for all parts of the UK and (ii) in Scotland.  [220337]</p>




<p><a name="50314w13.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 March 2005]:</i> The Government has put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for all parts of the UK. For Scotland these are devolved matters for the Scottish Executive and for Northern Ireland are matters for the Northern Ireland Office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para1">
In England and Wales between March 1997 and September 2004, the number of police officers increased by 12,977 from 127,158 to 140,135. The Government&#039;s introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 4,599 CSOs on the streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&#150;04, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2005 : Column 48W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
there has been a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 23 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 20 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para2">
Expenditure on policing supported by Government grant or spent centrally on services for the police in England and Wales has increased by over 53 per cent. (26 per cent. in real terms) between 1997&#150;98 and 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para3">
As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area in England and Wales has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para4">
The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &#163;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para5">
Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &#163;301.3 million has been allocated under these initiatives. A further &#163;20 million has been provided over the two years 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 to Home Office Regional Directors for CDRP capacity building.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para6">
The Government&#039;s Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para7">
New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. There are currently 50 TOGETHER antisocial behaviour action areas in England and Wales. Between April 1999 and September 2004 a total of 3,826 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued. Further information on tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp

Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and its policy is set out in the 10 year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the House Library.) Under this, the Government has invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
</ul>

Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &#163;1,244 million in 2003&#150;04, rising to &#163;1,344 million in 2004&#150;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs can be obtained from http://www.drugs. gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams

The Government is working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. The Home Office has allocated &#163;15 million in grants under the Connecting Communities race equality grant scheme over the three years (2003&#150;06). Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &#163;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website http://www.active-citizen.org.uk

This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people&#039;s lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at www.yearofthevolunteer.org

<p><a name="50314w13.html_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The prison elements of the National Offender Management Service Drug Strategy provides a comprehensive framework to reduce the amount of illegal drugs in prisons. Passive drug dogs are used to detect traces of drugs on visitors, and other dogs are used actively to search for drugs within prisons, as part of a general drug search strategy. Closed circuit television systems are installed in all visits areas to monitor behaviour, and fixed and low-level furniture is used in visits areas to make it difficult to pass drugs undetected. Sanctions are taken against visitors suspected of smuggling drugs, including visit bans and closed visits. Where there is adequate evidence they are prosecuted. Prisons and police share intelligence about drug routes into prisons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w13.html_para21">
Each month a random sample of the prisoners in each prison (5 per cent. or 10 per cent. depending on the size of the prison) is required to submit to a drug test, and a positive test result will lead to disciplinary proceedings. All establishments use and contribute to a drug supply reduction good practice guide and a monthly security bulletin, both of which share information on ways of protecting against drugs.

<a name="50314w13.html_para22">
Prisons work with the Police Scientific Development Branch to strengthen physical and technical barriers, particularly in prisons, such as those in city centres, where public spaces are close to perimeter walls. Prisons have a Professional Standards Unit to help identify staff who may be involved in or at risk of corruption. It will provide relevant information to facilitate investigations.

 The overall aim of the Youth Inclusion Programme is to reduce crime in the 72 neighbourhoods in England and Wales in which the programme runs. Each scheme targets the 50 young people, aged 13 to 16, who are most at risk of criminality in the local area. Programme objectives include reducing arrest rates amongst the target group and helping them to engage in suitable full-time education, training or employment.

However, UKAEA undertakes an extensive beach monitoring programme using sophisticated vehicular radiation detection systems. Since 1999, these systems have regularly monitored five local beaches: Sandside, Crosskirk, Brims, Scrabster and Thurso. These are situated between 3 km west (Sandside) and 13 km east (Thurso) of Dounreay. Reassurance surveys of Melvich beach, some 10 km west of Dounreay, have been carried out on two occasions and an extensive survey of Dunnet beach, approximately 23 km east of Dounreay, has now commenced. The foreshore at Dounreay is also monitored by the vehicular system.

</ul>

However I am informed that in recent years, a number of independent expert organisations including the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE), the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee and the National Radiological Protection Board have investigated and advised the Government, UKAEA and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on the potential health risks from particles of radioactive material found on Sandside Beach. This advice has considered both the likelihood of exposure to such a particle by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact and the resultant health risks should such an exposure occur. COMARE tells the DTI that the probability of a member of the public encountering a particle remains extremely small and the estimated radiation dose to an individual consequent upon ingestion of a typical particle from Sandside Bay is roughly equivalent to the average UK-annual background radiation dose (2 milliSieverts). SEPA has commissioned additional research to further refine this latter estimate.

An orientation debate was held on the proposed Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive. Member states expressed a strong preference for indicative not mandatory energy saving targets though views were mixed on whether a uniform target at EU level would be helpful; many delegations preferred individually set targets. There was general recognition that the public sector could play a leading role in promoting energy efficiency but the majority of member states opposed specific targets for the sector. On the question of the placing of obligations on suppliers there was a clear preference for a broader more flexible approach rather than a focus on one energy efficiency approach-energy services. There was broad agreement that a harmonised approach to measuring energy savings was needed, but there was a split on whether a top down or bottom up approach was best.

<sup>(25)</sup> For the years 1997&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes selected to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2003 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were selected:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

<i>Letter from Len Cook to Mr. John Taylor, dated 14 March 2005:</i>

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what action was taken by Ministers to establish that the Registrar General had statutory authority to state that personal information from the 1981 and 1991 decennial population censuses for England and Wales would be retained for 100 years before being released. (221179)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A Registrar General is empowered to conduct a census under the provisions of the Census Act 1920 as amended by the Census (Confidentiality) Act 1991. The protection of personal information is covered by Section 8(2), which makes provisions with respect to unlawful disclosure of information. Censuses from 1921 onwards have been taken under this Act and, as records which are retained in my custody, remain covered by these provisions. The necessary permission to retain these census records once they are over 30 years old has been granted by the Lord Chancellor under the provisions of Section 3(4) of the Public Records Act 1958, and has continued to be granted at periodic intervals.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Particularly at the time of a census there is great public concern about confidentiality and the use to which personal census information is put, and it has been the practice to give strong declarations of strict confidentiality including on the front of the census form, to allay these concerns. At the time of the 1981 and the 1991 Censuses, there was legislation in force that closed Census records for a period of 100 years. This legislation was Instrument 12 dated 1966 made under the provision of Section 5(1) of the Public Records Act 1958. The declarations however, did not specifically make reference to this legislation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In an attempt to simplify the confidentiality message on the front of the 1981 and the 1991 Census forms, the assurances, as worded, stated that the Registrar General had authority himself to retain the records for 100 years. This pledge asserts authority that the Registrar General does not have. As explained above the authority for the Registrar General to retain Census records rests with the Lord Chancellor. Notwithstanding this, the legal basis of access to, and confidentiality of, Census records was not affected. Assurances given on the 2001 Census form, however, more accurately referred to the relevant statutory authority as existed at the time.</p>

Projections are based on the number and value of residential and commercial transactions, derived from the Survey of Property Transactions in England and Wales, projected to the required year, in line with the pre-Budget 2004 forecast for price and volume trends. By comparing UK stamp duty receipts with England and Wales survey estimates in historic years it is possible to derive projections for the UK.

The main focus of business was preparation towards the Spring European Council. This took the form of a policy debate, based on a Presidency questionnaire and a Key Issues paper from the Employment and Social Protection Committees (EMCO and SPC), to finalise the ESPHCA Council&#039;s contribution to the Spring Council.

<p>
<a name="50314w27.html_para2">
For the UK, I stressed that there was no conflict between the economic and social agendas. On the contrary, a focus on employment should be seen as an affirmation of Europe&#039;s commitment to its social goals, as without growth social policies might not be sustainable.

The Council agreed a partial general approach on a decision establishing the PROGRESS social spending programme, which would replace five existing social programmes from 2007. For the UK I maintained a parliamentary scrutiny reserve. A Council declaration explained that the partial agreement covered all articles except Article 17, on the budget and internal allocations between different strands of activity. The agreement could be re-opened in the light of the EP&#039;s opinion or agreement of the Financial Perspectives.

<a name="50314w27.html_para12">
Around 90 per cent. of all local authority districts in Great Britain have an employment rate above the EU average, and a key element of the Government&#039;s labour market policies is improving the performance of the relatively small number of areas within each region where this is not the case.

Since 1997 claimant unemployment has halved, long-term unemployment has fallen by more than three quarters and the number of lone parents on benefit has fallen by a fifth. In addition, the number of people on incapacity benefits has peaked after two decades of substantial growth. The improvements have been greatest in the areas where, in 1997, benefit receipt was highest.
</p>


<p>

While this has moved us closer to the aim of full employment in every region, the Department&#039;s five year strategy set out the Government&#039;s long-term aspiration to achieve an employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population. This will mean continuing to focus on those who can get back into work, including people on incapacity benefits, lone parents, older people and the long-term unemployed.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the target time for holding a Work Focused Interview (WFI) following an initial claim to Income Support, Incapacity Benefit or Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance, and the average time between the initial call and the interview being conducted at the Jobcentres in Blandford, Bridport, Christchurch, Poole, and Wareham. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Under Jobcentre Plus operations, a claim to Income Support, Incapacity Benefit or Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance usually starts with a telephone call to the Contact Centre. After obtaining initial details, Contact Centre staff call the customer back to obtain the necessary information to complete a claim to benefit. They also arrange an appointment for the customer to attend their local office to see both a Financial Assessor and a Personal Adviser.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">At present Jobcentre Plus has separate targets for processing Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support and Incapacity Benefit. These are known as Actual Average Clearance Targets (AACT). The target for Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance is 12 days from the first contact with the Contact Centre and the processing of the claim. For Income Support the target is again 12 days however this commences from when a customer has provided all the necessary information to process the claim because Income Support claims are subject to the Evidence Requirement. Incapacity Benefit claims have a target of 22 days from the date of claim to the date of processing. The WFI stage is a component part of the process.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There is no current target for the holding of a WFI following the initial claim to benefit although it is our aim to conduct the interview within 5 days of initial contact. Unfortunately as there is no target the information you require on the performances of particular offices is not available.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As part of Jobcentre Plus&#039; future performance measures, we are looking into the possibility of introducing an internal key performance indicator to measure the time between the customer&#039;s initial call and the WFI being conducted. This would be included in a suite of measures to manage the end to end process from when a customer makes contact with us to when they find work or are awarded benefit. A decision will be made on this later in the year.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under what circumstances individuals 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2005 : Column 113W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
would be entitled to retire on health grounds following the implementation of proposed Government pension scheme changes in Northern Ireland.  [220692]</p>




<p><a name="50314w30.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 It is assumed that this question is referring to the proposed changes to the pension schemes for civil servants, staff employed in the NHS and for teachers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w30.html_para4">
Consultation on proposed changes to pensions, including those for ill health retirement, of the main civil service pension scheme in Great Britain and the NHS and teachers schemes for England and Wales are currently under way. As the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme for Northern Ireland, the Health and Personal Social Services Superannuation Scheme, and the Teachers Superannuation Scheme in Northern Ireland operate on a principle of parity with these schemes, the normal approach would be to introduce similar changes for Northern Ireland staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w30.html_para5">
The proposals relating to ill-health retirement in the consultation document &quot;Building a Sustainable Future&#151;Proposals for Changes to Civil Service Pension Arrangements&quot; are broadly similar to those presently available to members of the premium arrangement of the current civil service pension provisions with the recognition that higher benefits should be paid to those who are most incapacitated. The proposals relating to ill-health retirement for the teachers pension schemes are similar to those proposed under the civil service scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w30.html_para6">
The proposals are as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Where the scheme&#039;s medical adviser agrees that a member&#039;s ill-health is such that they are no longer able to do their job and that this is likely to continue to pension age, the member should receive their pension immediately without any reduction for early payment.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">If the scheme&#039;s medical adviser considers that the member is virtually unable to do any job, not just their present job, they should receive an increase to their pension, under a formula yet to be determined.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w30.html_para7">
Civil service members who are covered by the current classic arrangements are subject to a slightly modified approach, compatible with an employee contributions rate of 1.5 per cent. rather than the premium contribution rate of 3.5 per cent. Regardless of the degree of incapacity a single level of ill-health pension will be payable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w30.html_para8">
The review partners of the NHS pension scheme consider that the pension scheme cannot deal with ill health in isolation and that it is important that any changes to the pension scheme are part of an integrated approach to managing ill-health absence. They have proposed that a separate partnership review of sickness 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2005 : Column 114W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and ill-health arrangements should be carried out, which will help the pension review determine this aspect of pension scheme design. The consultation document is seeking views on this approach to reviewing sickness and ill-health retirement arrangements.

[221340]</p>




<p><a name="50314w30.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The draft Integrated Impact Assessment published on 29 November set out Government&#039;s assessment of the impacts of its policy proposals and options. The draft equality impact assessment element of the IIA noted that the proposal to base domestic water and sewerage charges on property value would have a marginal negative differential impact on the elderly and on those who care for them. A number of measures to mitigate the negative equality impacts were identified, including the provision of discounts for certain low income households. The proposal also envisages that the impact of the low income protection measures should be kept under review to determine how effectively they are mitigating differential equality impacts.

 In common with the other Whitehall Departments, the Northern Ireland Office reports progress against the targets and objectives in the public service agreement (PSA) in its Departmental Report and Autumn Performance Report. In the 2004 Spending Review PSA, the NIO agreed seven main objectives and, within these, four key target areas which commit it to a specified level of performance or achievement. Since the SR2004 PSA commences in April 2005 no material is available to monitor progress against these targets. However the Department has provided extensive public information on progress against the PSA targets agreed as part of the SR2002 settlement. Because the targets are clearly measurable they are reported on in detail in the Departmental Report and Autumn Performance Report. Progress against objectives is reported on in more general terms.
</p>

<a name="50314w31.html_para0">
The NIO&#039;s 2005 Departmental Report is in draft and will be published soon on a date to be set by HM Treasury. It will provide detail on the targets and give information on performance to the end of the SR2002 PSA period. It and the Autumn Performance Report are

 In developing water and sewerage charging options for Northern Ireland, careful consideration was given to the existing regimes in Great Britain. As in the rest of the United Kingdom, the proposed self-financing arrangements will mean that customers&#039; bills will, in general terms, reflect the costs which that customer imposes on the water and sewerage systems for a supply of clean water and the disposal of dirty water. Details of the approach taken to developing the proposed water and sewerage charging regime are set out in the Integrated Impact Assessment Policy Proposals Paper published on 29 November 2004 http://www.waterreformni.gov.uk/consult2004.asp

<p>
<a name="50314w31.html_para2">
In England and Wales, unmeasured domestic charges, in general, consist of a standing charge and a charge based on the property&#039;s rateable value. It is proposed in Northern Ireland that charges will consist of a standing charge and a charge based on the property&#039;s capital value&#151;which will be the basis for calculating domestic rates in NI from 1 April 2007. In Scotland unmeasured charges are based on the council tax band which, in turn, is based on the property&#039;s capital value.

Some adults who have been in contact with mental health services will be subject to the multi-agency public protection panel arrangements. The arrangements for the tracking of individuals considered a risk to the public are detailed in paragraphs 76 and 77 of Probation Circular 54/2004, &quot;The MAPPA Guidance&quot;. This places the responsibility firmly on the responsible authorities (the relevant police and probation services) initiating the transfer to ensure that the receiving authorities have both the information and the time to put suitable arrangements into place. The arrangements for moves between Wales and England are the same as those between English regions. Health bodies have a duty to cooperate with police and probation services in making these arrangements function effectively.

Notes:<br>

1. The mental illness expenditure reported is the expenditure of the PCTs on the commissioning of secondary mental illness services from national health service bodies. This does not include all the relevant expenditure which cannot be separately identified centrally.<br>

2. The figures do not include commissioning of mental illness services from independent providers. This expenditure is included within the commissioning of social care and cannot be separately analysed between mental illness, learning disability and similar services. Over the two years, there has been a &#163;28.5 million increase in independent sector commissioning.<br>

3. The figures are not comparable between PCTs and between years. There are a number of factors which may distort the figures, including PCTs commissioning on behalf of others, the devolution of mental illness budgets by health authorities and the increase in provision by the independent sector.<br>

<p><a name="50314w36.html_spnew8"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 &quot;Getting Ahead of the Curve&quot;, the infectious disease strategy published by the Chief Medical Officer in January 2002, made clear the intention of reviewing infectious disease law. No specific timetable for the review has been set as yet: we have always intended that it should be carried out at the point when it can make the most effective contribution to improving the control and prevention of infectious disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w36.html_para2">
Our top priority, in terms of improving health protection, has been the legislation to establish the Health Protection Agency (HPA). It has existed since April 2003 as a special health authority in England and Wales and will be established from 1 April 2005 as a United Kingdom-wide public body under the Health Protection Agency Act 2004. As a result of the creation of the HPA, consultants in communicable disease control (who generally discharge the &quot;local authority proper officer&quot; function under the 1984 Act) are in England all now employed by the HPA. This is an improvement on the previous position; when such consultants were in effect single-handed practitioners, each based in a local national health service body, which could offer them relatively little specialist support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w36.html_para3">
In preparation for the planned review of the law, we asked the HPA last year to consider first how public health practitioners might make more effective use of the powers currently provided by the 1984 Act; and second, what difficulties practitioners find with the current powers and what changes might be desirable. We expect to receive the results of this work from the HPA in the first half of this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50314w36.html_para4">
We are contributing to the development of new International Health Regulations (IHR) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO aims to adopt the new IHR at the World Health Assembly in May 2005. Many of the requirements of the current IHR are reflected in regulations made under infectious disease law in the UK, which will need to be revised once the new IHR are in place. In the meantime, the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 has provided new emergency powers which complement those provided through public health legislation.

 The national service framework for renal services makes clear we are determined that kidney patients should have timely and appropriate surgery for permanent vascular access. Latest data for 2003&#150;04 show the average time waited for vascular access surgery was 41 days. However, where, exceptionally, patients wait longer than six months on the waiting list, primary care trusts are responsible for offering choice of an alternative provider in line with the Department&#039;s &quot;Choice of Hospital&quot; guidance.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through English Partnerships has set up the Register of surplus public sector land. The Register lists landholdings held by central Government and its agencies that are surplus to requirements. Any Department wishing to dispose of surplus land is required to place that land on the Register for a period of 40 working days before the land is marketed. The Register currently consists of over 800 parcels of land totalling almost 4000 hectares. The majority of the sites are brownfield and include previously developed land and buildings that are vacant or derelict and have the potential for redevelopment. The Register is currently being developed to allow on-line access by early April 2005 to central Government users. Brownfield and greenfield land will be easily identifiable.

There is no change to green belt policy which is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2 &quot;Green Belts&quot;.

In such cases applicants would have to demonstrate that there were very special circumstances that clearly outweighed the harm that the development would cause to the Green Belt. Draft PPS10 expects regional planning bodies and planning authorities to prepare and deliver planning strategies that protect green belts but recognise the particular locational needs of some types of waste management and that the wider environmental and economic benefits of sustainable waste management are material considerations that should be given significant weight in determining whether proposals should be given planning permission.
