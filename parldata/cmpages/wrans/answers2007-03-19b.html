 The roof terrace was closed, along with other roof areas in the parliamentary estate, on 28 September 2006 when a detailed health and safety audit indicated that there were significant risks when assessed under modern regulations. Since then priority has been given to providing safe access to those areas of the roofs where access is required to maintain the structure of the buildings. Work on the roof terrace has been limited to providing temporary fencing to prevent access to areas where people can and have put themselves at risk.</p>

 Responsibility for London Underground passed to Transport for London and the Mayor of London on 15 July 2003. Performance since then has been an operational matter for London Underground who are best placed to answer direct. London Underground does not record investment broken down by lines. However the total figures to 2002-03 are shown in the following table. In April 2000, London Underground adopted new accounting treatment for its investment expenditure which removed the category &#145;investment renewals': the majority of this expenditure was reclassified as capital, although some (&#163;90 million) became resource expenditure. Therefore the figures before and after April 2000 are not directly comparable and are presented in two separate tables with the years 1990-91 to 1999-2000 on one consistent basis and those for a restated 1999-2000 to 2005-06 are on another. It is normal accounting practice when a change in accounting treatment occurs to restate the previous year's figures on the same basis in the accounts, so that a true comparison can be made.</p>

 In 2005, the latest year for which comprehensive data are currently available, a total of around 209,000 hectares was estimated to be used in England for crops purpose-grown for use as industrial materials and bio-energy. Of this total, oilseed rape for biofuel use accounted for nearly 93,000 hectares. This figure relates only to plantings under the Energy Aid Scheme as the end-use for crops not receiving this aid is not known. Energy crops for use in the generation of heat and electricity accounted for around 600 hectares. Plantings of energy crops have increased significantly since 2005, with over 4,500 hectares now in the ground. Biomass also comes from non purpose-grown sources such as straw and woodfuel from forestry operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="70319w0004.htm_para6"><a name="07031936000516">To meet the 5 per cent. transport biofuel target entirely from UK sources would require between 1 to 1.5 million hectares of crops. However, we anticipate that biofuels in the UK will come from a mixture of home-grown and imported crops, recycled vegetable oils and tallow. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for bioethanol production, so reducing pressure on land.</p>

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment carried out before the introduction of the Detergents Regulations 2005 estimated that the total one-off compliance costs would be between &#163;8.4 million and &#163;14 million based on compliance testing of 2,800 surfactants. Given the long lead in for these regulations, the costs of additional labelling requirements fell within normal business running costs which were assisted by a six month transition period after the regulations came into force.</p>

 Fisheries agreements with third countries, including those on imports, are negotiated by the European Commission on behalf of all member sates. Neither the Council of Ministers nor the Commission exercises Community competence over whaling issues and there is no common EU line on whaling matters. Not all EU member states are even members of the International Whaling Commission. As such, negotiations with third countries on fisheries and trade matters are unaffected by those countries&#146; stance on whaling. While the European Commission joined the recent demarche against Iceland over its resumption of commercial whaling, it did so on its own behalf, rather than on behalf of member states.</p>

Examples include our &#163;18 million support for the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP) and our &#163;20 million contribution over three years to the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). NRAP has built essential infrastructure such as roads, bridges and irrigation schemes, and has generated over 15 million days of labour for Afghans. MISFA has so far provided small loans to over 230,000 Afghan families. This has enabled poor people who would otherwise not have access to credit to successfully invest in income-generating activities.</p>

Of this, &#163;1 million has been channelled through a World Bank-managed Trust Fund which provides risk guarantees to attract foreign investors. In the past year, this Trust Fund has supported three projects which are expected to trigger over $26 million of investment, stimulate the cotton and pharmaceutical sector, and expand access to credit.

 In 1996, the then Secretary of State consulted on whether any specific conditions should be attached to offers to purchase export deferred items made by private buyers. As a result of that consultation, it was decided that an owner's refusal to accept such an offer from a private buyer should lead to an export licence being refused only if the private buyer is able to guarantee reasonable public access and satisfactory conservation conditions for the art work. This remains the position. If an individual refuses an offer where such assurances have been provided, the licence application will normally be refused.</p>

What we do is different in different countries, depending on our assessment of what the priorities are.

Rwanda has the highest female representation in the world. Our most recent support to the FFRP funded a conference on  22 and 23 February that celebrated the progress made towards gender equality in Rwanda. It also produced the "Kigali Declaration", that will add vitality to the efforts of other African countries to get more women into Parliament&#151;following Rwanda's example.</p>

 At a global level the World Bank Institute estimates that US$1 trillion plus or minus  40 per cent. is paid in bribes every year, representing  3 per cent. of the world&#146;s gross domestic product. No firm estimates exist on how this issue affects UK business specifically. The obstacles to measuring corruption scientifically have led to the measurement of perceptions.</p>

The highest ranked country is the one whose companies are seen as least likely to pay bribes. The UK is ranked 6<sup>(th)</sup> out of 30 countries, the 2<sup>(nd)</sup> G7 country and 3<sup>(rd )</sup>EU country in the table. But the UK is not complacent because, as the UK White Paper on Eliminating World Poverty recognises, &#145;Corruption undermines the accountability of political leaders and officials to their citizens. When politicians are &#145;bought&#146; by powerful people or businesses through bribery, or when leaders themselves use personal or public funds to buy support, they become representatives of the few and not the many. In short, corruption is both a cause and a symptom of bad governance.&#146; Any such impact will undermine work to promote good governance and reduce poverty in developing countries.</p>

this by providing developing country Governments with technical assistance which they can use to tap the full potential of public private partnerships in infrastructure. PPIAF also identifies, communicates and promotes best practice on matters relating to public private partnerships in infrastructure. It is also recognised as a leading resource for training and best practice in the role of public private partnerships in infrastructure service delivery.</p>

For example Kenya PPIAF provided technical assistance and training to enable micro-credit banks to lend to small water providers to provide clean water to rural and semi-urban communities. This has led to 21 micro-credit investments and an output based grant which will result in 60,000 people gaining access to clean water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="70319w0011.htm_para2"><a name="07031943000112">Also in Ghana, PPIAF supported the Ghana Community Water and Sanitation Agency with regulatory and legal reform to improve small town water services. This has allowed local water operators to provide clean water to communities for the first time. Communities themselves were involved in the selection of the water providers. This has been successfully implemented in three towns and will be extended to 300 small towns across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="70319w0011.htm_para3"><a name="07031943000113">After the war in 2002, the Government of Afghanistan recognised that they needed to expand telecommunications access and improve service delivery. They encouraged private mobile phone operators into their market, and asked the PPIAF to help them develop the initial regulatory framework and build the Government&#146;s own capacity and understanding of technical, commercial and regulatory issues. Today, where once there were only two telephones for every 1,000 people, there are now more than 1 million mobile phone subscribers with national and global access, and prices have declined by 70 per  <br>

Specifically, it has helped developing country Governments&#146; capacity to improve their policies, laws, regulations and procedures that have resulted in better infrastructure and better services for their people. The PPIAF has also been recognised as a centre of excellence for advice to developing countries on public private partnerships, and there is high demand for PPIAF&#146;s services.</p>

 The renewables obligation (RO) was introduced in 2002 to replace the previous support scheme, the Non Fossil Fuels Obligation (NFFO), which was a form of a feed in tariff. It was introduced as a means of encouraging greater deployment of renewables, providing investor confidence, and increasing value for money for the consumer. A review of the RO, carried out in 2005-06, confirmed that the RO was a more successful mechanism. Since its introduction eligible renewable electricity generated under the scheme has increased to 4.0 per cent of total electricity sales to UK consumers in 2005 up from 1.8 per cent. in 2002, compared with an increase under the NFFO from  0.2 per cent. of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent. in 2002.</p>

 Since 2003 FRANK, the Government funded drug awareness campaign, has reached out to young people, their parents and carers, with a range of innovative national and local communications providing credible drug advice and information. We have also launched &#145;Understanding Drugs&#146; as a new resource to all secondary schools to support drugs education programmes. In addition we continue to work across Government to ensure that drug education in schools is effective at building awareness of the harm caused by drugs as well as engaging and supporting those groups of young people most vulnerable to developing drug problems.</p>

 To tackle drug-use in custody, NOMS has in place a comprehensive drug strategy. The strategy's three key aims are to: reduce the amount of illicit drugs getting in&#151;by using a co-ordinated range of supply reduction measures; reduce the demand for drugs&#151;through delivery of effective drug treatment; and strengthen through-care links with the community, helping ensure timely continuity of care for drug-users on release. While NOMS remains committed to doing more, the drug strategy is already making significant progress, with drug-use&#151;as measured by random mandatory drug testing&#151;down from 24.4 per cent. in 1996-97 to 10.3 per cent. in 2004-05; a reduction of  58 per cent.</p>

 The Home Office-commissioned estimates of the number of problem opiate and crack users do not contain any information about individuals and their parental status. However, the Advisory Council of Misuse of Drugs in their report &#145;Hidden Harm&#146; estimated that in the UK there were between 250,000 and 350,000 children of problem drug users in 2003. Since the publication of that report changes have been made to several monitoring systems to improve the information available, which will allow us to produce an updated estimate in the future. In particular the core dataset for the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System for England was updated from April 2006 and all treatment service providers are now required to record information on whether users in treatment have dependent children and whether the child(ren) are living with the person in treatment or with others.</p>

 Uploading videos of a criminal offence is not necessarily itself a criminal offence It will be a criminal offence if it amounts to inciting the offence involved, or if it involves the publication of obscene material.

 The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is the only authorised organisation in the UK operating an internet 'hotline' for the public to report their exposure to potentially illegal content online. Its aim is to minimise the availability of potentially illegal internet content, specifically child abuse images hosted anywhere in the world; criminally obscene content hosted in the UK; and incitement to racial hatred content hosted in the UK. While we work closely with the IWF on these issues, we have not had any discussions with it about video clips on websites which show violence, physical assaults or criminal damage as these issues are outside of its remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70319w0021.htm_para4"><a name="0703203000978">In terms of industry regulation, the vast majority of the UK internet industry takes a responsible approach to what content it hosts, both of its own volition and in co-operation with law enforcement and Government agencies. Where the industry is advised that content it hosts contravenes UK legislation, it will remove it. In addition, internet service providers (ISPs) also have contracts with their customers concerning what may be hosted on their servers called acceptable use policies (AUPs), which allow them to remove offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal. Anyone concerned about the contents of a website should approach the relevant ISP hosting the site and ask it to consider whether it breaches its AUP.</p>

 Under the provisions for police injury benefits, which are not dependent on pension scheme membership, a special or augmented pension of up to half the officer's pensionable pay is payable to a surviving spouse or civil partner where the officer dies as a result of an injury received without their own default in the execution of their duty as a constable. Under the Police Pension Scheme 1987 (old scheme) an ordinary pension of up to one third the officer's pensionable pay is payable to a surviving spouse or civil partner where the officer dies in service, whether or not they were on duty at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70319w0022.htm_para2"><a name="0703203001024">Police pensions and police injury benefits are administrated locally by the police authority for the force concerned and details of the number of surviving spouses and civil partners of officers who died while on duty and of the cost of their pensions are not held centrally. However, it is estimated that in the region of 400 surviving spouses are in receipt of a special or augmented pension in the UK. About half of this number are in respect of police officers who died in Northern Ireland. No separate estimate has been made of the number of surviving civil partners in receipt of such a pension but the estimate given for spouses can still be taken to include civil partners in view of the relatively short time since the start of civil partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70319w0022.htm_para3"><a name="0703203001025">The Government Actuary's Department has estimated that the capitalised extra cost of making these pensions life-long to be between &#163;10 million and &#163;20 million. This estimate is indicative only since it is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. The capital cost would manifest itself in additional cash expenditure over a period of decades peaking in 10 to 20 years' time. This cost only relates to survivor pensions currently in payment. There would also be additional costs relating to pensions to spouses and civil partners of police officers who die in the future as result of an injury received in the execution of their duty. The cost does not include the reinstatement of any pension that has already ceased on remarriage, formation of a civil partnership or cohabitation, or the backdating of any such restored pension.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 March 2007]:</i> These data are not held in the form specified. The data collected measure those who complete all elements required of the particular framework undertaken. However, since 2001 separately assessed underpinning knowledge has been a compulsory part of apprenticeship frameworks. Up to 2005 this had to take the form of a technical certificate, even where there was duplication of content between qualifications. Therefore all apprentices completing in this period would have passed a technical certificate in order to complete the full framework. Since 2005 and following consultation, sector bodies have had the flexibility to deliver underpinning knowledge through an NVQ where it can be demonstrated to the Apprenticeship Approvals Group that this will remove duplication. So far the two major frameworks to integrate underpinning knowledge into the NVQ are in accountancy and hairdressing. Most of their learners will not yet have completed under the new arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="70319w0024.htm_para10"><a name="0703209000195">Furthermore the Secretary of State and the Learning and Skills Council have both been involved in drawing the attention of the FE sector to the age legislation through correspondence with FE governing bodies and by issuing guidance to learning providers. Higher education institutions have been supported in this area by the Equality Challenge Unit, which is the sector body responsible for providing advice and guidance on equality issues to these bodies.</p>

We believe that this is good value for money as we were able to reach a large section of our target audience. As the 14 to 19 programme will require schools and colleges to collaborate in the future, and teaching of the diplomas will start from September 2008 we increasingly need to inform our target audiences about the reforms and the impact that they will have on them.

2. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 11 to 15 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>
 3. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the EFS settlement calculations.<br>
 4. Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>

A child achieving a good level of development can be deemed to be &#145;working securely&#146; within the Early Learning Goals.</p>

Assessment against the Foundation Stage Profile is not yet universally well established and ongoing improvements in assessment and moderation have contributed to a general downward shift in the scores, including the percentage of children working securely within the Early Learning Goals. The downward shift is apparent across most authorities but to varying degrees. While the downward shift in the figures between 2005 and 2006 reflects these improvements to moderation and assessment, the precise extent of the impact is uncertain. While many local authorities may now have settled in respect of assessment, it is possible that there will be further impact in some authorities for some time although the effects on the results are likely to reduce over time as the survey becomes more embedded.</p>

Non re-payable bursaries, typically worth &#163;1,000, are available from universities and colleges to those from low income backgrounds. Additional help is available to students facing financial hardship from the Access to Learning Fund administered by individual higher education institutions.</p>

These loans are repayable only after a student has left their course and only then when their annual income reaches &#163;15,000. The rates of interest are well below that of commercial credit and students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrow.</p>

 Questionnaires have been distributed to all general practices with a request that they be distributed to all patients referred by their general practitioners (GPs) between 16 January and 30 March 2007 for a first out-patient appointment where the choice policy applies. In some cases, the need for rapid access to diagnosis and treatment may be judged by the GP to override choice-at-referral policy, for example in cases of chest pain or suspected cancer. In other cases, such as maternity or mental health, other kinds of choice may be more likely to improve the patient experience.</p>

 No improvement notices have been issued yet. The Health Act 2006 gave the Healthcare Commission the power to issue improvement notices if it considers that a national health service organisation is not observing the provisions of the Code of Practice in any material respect. The Act, however, includes various other matters that the commission needs to take into account before this power is exercised. The commission is currently reviewing the arrangements in all 41 trusts whose annual health check and rating published in October 2006 gave rise to concern with respect to health care associated infection. This programme will be completed by the end of March. The commission has assured me that if this work reveals evidence of any material failures to observe the provision of the code the issue of formal improvement notices will be likely to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="70319w0037.htm_para0"><a name="0703209002090">In addition, trusts are being required to make a specific declaration by 1 May regarding their observance of the code as part of the next annual health check cycle. The Healthcare Commission will follow up these declarations as part of a programme to review the application of the code in trusts where there may be risks of inadequate performance. The issuing of improvement notices is an important power to help secure the safety of patients and the commission will use this new power when it is appropriate.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 March 2007]: </i>The national health service provides a contribution to the cost of continuing education and training for professions whose income derives in part from providing NHS services. Under deregulatory changes approved by Parliament in 1986, the NHS provides optical vouchers to certain eligible groups to assist in buying glasses or contact lenses, but the dispensing of glasses is carried out on a private basis. The Department considers that these arrangements work well in promoting choice and access to services and that it would be anomalous to use public funds to make continuing education and training payments to health care professionals who do not provide services under contract to the NHS.</p>
