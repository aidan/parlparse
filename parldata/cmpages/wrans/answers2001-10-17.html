<a name="11017w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Defence Vetting Agency carries out security vetting checks on people employed by the Ministry of Defence, by certain other Government Departments, and by defence contractors. Since 1997, the agency has been involved in an ambitious modernisation programme to create a responsive, efficient organisation that will exploit the capabilities of modern information technology to the benefit of its customers. This is the second year of major change for the agency. During this financial year a collocation programme, which involved the closure of its London and regional offices and the setting up of an integrated organisation in York, will be completed and a number of other initiatives to improve efficiency and responsiveness will also be progressed. It is expected that performance will be depressed while those changes take place. The chief executive has been set the following key targets:

 I am pleased to say that the review team have completed the first phase of its studies. As indicated in my written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker) of 15 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 275W, the team has covered medical arrangements for personnel in Germany and Northern Ireland; and the interrelationships between primary and secondary care as well as the functions and organisation of the Ministry of Defence's four medical agencies&#151;the Defence Secondary Care Agency, the Defence Dental Agency, the Defence Medical Training Organisation and the Medical Supplies Agency.
<P>

<a name="11017w01.html_para1">I have endorsed the broad lines of the review team's report on the first phase of its studies and have agreed a package of further work to underpin and confirm its provisional conclusions. A paper summarising the main features of the team's initial report and the phase 2 work, which will take place between now and the end of the year, is being placed in the Library of the House. As the paper indicates, this further work will result in a detailed report which will form the basis of full consultation.

 On 14 August, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport launched a consultation on the details of two pilot schemes to be launched in the London borough of Camden and in Middlesbrough. As part of the pilots, the two councils will be able to levy a daily charge (or "lane rental" as it is often called) on utilities carrying out works on the highway. The pilots are expected to begin in January 2002, and we will be monitoring closely the effect they have on the disruption caused to road users by utilities' works in the two areas.

 GLA transport grant is determined annually after consultation with the Mayor of London under section 101 of the GLA Act 1999. The Secretary of State has today redetermined the level of grant for 2001&#150;02 at &#163;714,388,000. This reflects additional monies paid to the Mayor in respect of his share of the costs relating to preparation for an east-west rail link across London, and other minor adjustments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We have not made an assessment of those costs. There will be no change to funding for local education authority administrative costs. The Department funds the Learning and Skills Council for its administrative costs. We expect the LSC to deliver its new sixth form funding responsibilities within the overall administrative budget allocated to it. There is no separate element within that overall budget identified for work on school sixth forms.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools bidding for specialist status under the specialist schools programme were supported by donations from the Technology Colleges Trust as part of the qualifying sponsorship criteria in the years <i>(a)</i> 1999&#150;2000 and <i>(b)</i> 2000&#150;01.  [7689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Technology Colleges Trust does not itself make donations to applicant schools but raises funds from other donors. Detailed information on the sponsorship included in school applications for specialist status in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 is not readily available and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, we do have an analysis of applications for Arts, Technology and Language College status in June and October 1999 and in March 2000, which shows that 37 per cent. of applicants included sponsorship arranged through the Technology Colleges Trust.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much the planned expansion of the specialist school programme depends on the ability of the Technology Colleges Trust to support financially schools that are unable to find some or all of the required sponsorship.  [7690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Technology Colleges Trust seeks at national level to raise sponsorship that can be allocated to schools intending to apply for specialist schools designation. Many specialist school applications include elements of sponsorship raised in this way. This is one source of sponsorship and has been part of the initiative since it began in 1994 and we expect it to remain so. Funds raised at national level help to ensure that schools are not excluded from the programme because of particular local difficulties in raising sponsorship.

<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools have failed to achieve specialist school status through their inability to raise the level of sponsorship that is required.  [7691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our network of 685 specialist schools shows that applicant schools across the country, including those from rural and inner city areas, have raised the 



<P>
<P><I>17 Oct 2001 : Column: 1232W</I><P>
sponsorship required, but we are aware that some schools find this more difficult than others. It would not be practicable to make an estimate of the number of schools that have been unable to raise funds but we have taken steps to ensure all schools have a reasonable opportunity to do so. In 1999, the sponsorship requirement was halved to &#163;50,000 and my Department grant aids the Technology Colleges and Youth Sport Trusts to provide advice to schools about raising sponsorship and raise funds themselves to support applicant schools. We will keep the sponsorship criteria under review.

 There are no current plans to relax or remove the sponsorship requirement except that we are considering the position in relation to very small secondary schools. We will keep the situation under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will change the arrangements for overseas domestic workers who accompany their employers to the United Kingdom.  [8743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w03.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There is a longstanding concession, outside the Immigration Rules, enabling overseas employers coming to the United Kingdom to bring their domestic workers with them, if they need to do so.
<P>

<a name="11017w03.html_para2">Changes to the conditions under which overseas domestic workers could be admitted to the United Kingdom were laid before the House on 23 July 1998. The primary objective of those changes was to deal with concerns about reports of abuse suffered by such workers. Responding to those concerns, while minimising scope for immigration abuse, presented a difficult balance. We therefore undertook at the time to review the changes in the light of operational experience.
<P>

<a name="11017w03.html_para3">Following this review, a number of changes are being made with effect from today, which we shall include in the Immigration Rules at a suitable opportunity.
<P>

<a name="11017w03.html_para4">In response to concerns raised by the employers of domestic workers, the level of duties needing to be performed by the worker will no longer have to exceed those set down in the International Labour Organisation's International Standard Classification of Occupations.
<P>

<a name="11017w03.html_para5">We remain concerned at reports of abuse of domestic workers accompanying their employers to the United Kingdom and have discussed with Kalayaan, the organisation that represents overseas domestic workers, how this can be prevented. We have decided to continue allowing domestic workers to change employer but will be asking any that do so to inform the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in writing, outlining their reasons for doing so, at the earliest opportunity. This will enable officials to monitor any possible abuse of the concession by either individuals or employers and, if detected, liaise with other departments to ascertain whether any action could be taken.
<P>

<a name="11017w03.html_para6">We are also clarifying what is meant in the concession by the meaning of 'household'. Some United Kingdom- based employers have long argued that, although they reside here, they maintain a household abroad and therefore domestic workers currently working in their overseas residence should qualify under this concession. We will make clear that a domestic worker wishing to come to the United Kingdom is expected to have been carrying out domestic duties under the same roof as their employer for 12 months before applying for entry clearance, or in a household that the employer uses for himself on a regular basis and where there is clear 



<P>
<P><I>17 Oct 2001 : Column: 1234W</I><P>
evidence of a connection between employer and employee. The domestic worker will also be expected to travel to the United Kingdom with their employer, their employer's spouse or minor child.
<P>

<a name="11017w03.html_para7">This definition should make it clear that the concession is not intended to allow employers who are resident here to recruit domestic workers from overseas. It will also benefit those employers who regularly divide their time between two houses.

 The New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme provides estimates of repeat offending drug misusing offenders for the purpose of tracking the drugs strategy. Repeat offending drug misusing offenders are defined as the proportion of arrestees that are using heroin and/or cocaine/crack at least once a week and who have offended at least twice a month in the last 12 months. As yet estimates are available only for the financial year 1999&#150;2000.

 I am aware of the allegations relating to the training of United Kingdom nationals overseas. Under Section 54 (1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000, it is an offence to provide instruction or training or to receive instruction or training in the making or use of firearms, explosives, or chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. In addition, under subsection (3) (b) a person commits an offence if he invites another to receive instruction or training and the receipt would constitute an offence under subsection (2) but for the fact that it is to take place outside the United Kingdom. Any concrete and verifiable evidence of such activities will be dealt with immediately, and the police and intelligence services are fully aware of this.

 It is not possible to provide information on how many refugees have sought to enter the United Kingdom in any given period, because some refugees arrive clandestinely and subsequently claim asylum in- country rather than claiming on arrival at United Kingdom ports, and because not all attempts to enter the United Kingdom are successful. Information on the numbers of applications for asylum to the United Kingdom in 2001 from nationals of Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan is provided in the table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the inspector appointed by the Government to oversee the consultation exercise during the drawing up of the recent Essex waste plan forbade Essex county council from specifically excluding incinerators from the plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11017w06.html_para4">The inspector did not forbid Essex county council from specifically excluding incinerators from the plan. The deposit draft plan itself, which was before the inspector at the inquiry, did not exclude incinerators. It set out a policy, W7K, which provided criteria for considering planning applications for incinerators, and at policy W8A it identified sites for major waste management facilities, which explicitly might include incinerators. In response to objections, the inspector recommended retention of these policies subject to modifications.
<P>

<a name="11017w06.html_para5">In a schedule of proposed changes put to the inquiry by the county council, it was proposed to delete policy W7K. But this did not amount to excluding incinerators from the plan, as the relevant criteria were proposed to be transferred, with amendments, to policy W8A. The inspector recommended against such a change for reasons set out in his report, principally that it confused the criteria to be applied to proposed incinerators with those to be applied to major waste management sites, which might not necessarily be developed for incinerators.
<P>

<a name="11017w06.html_para6">It would not in any case have been possible for the Inspector to have forbidden the county council for excluding incinerators. His role was to make recommendations to the county as to how they should respond to the objections made. It remained for the county council to decide whether or not to accept those recommendations.
<P>

<a name="11017w06.html_para7">The reasons why the Inspector did not recommend the council to exclude incinerators from the plan as some objectors would have wished are set out in his report, especially paras 27.11&#150;27.14 and 27.36&#150;27.39. To get the full picture these paragraphs should be read in the context of other parts of the report, especially the remainder of part 27 and parts 5 and 34. In summary the main reasons are:
<P>

<a name="11017w06.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whatever the plan says, it cannot prevent planning applications for incinerators in Essex from being submitted. It is appropriate therefore that the plan should set out how the county council would respond to such applications. The deposit draft plan proposed to deal with this by stating criteria against which planning applications would be considered, as well as identifying sites for waste management facilities in general. The inspector supported this basic approach.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11017w06.html_para9"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It would in theory have been possible for the plan to state a presumption against any incinerators being permitted. But this would have to be justified by land use planning considerations and take account of advice about the relationship between planning and pollution control (report para 5.12). National policy in "Waste Strategy 2000" provides for a continuing role for energy from waste, including incinerators, as part of the waste hierarchy. There was no such presumption in the deposit draft plan and the Inspector supported the county council on this.

<a name="11017w06.html_para10">Attention is drawn to the modified versions of policies W7K and W8A which were recommended by the Inspector (report paras 27.49, last bullet, and 34.49, last bullet). The criteria recommended they address objectors' concerns about incineration and for these to be taken into account if planning applications for incinerators are submitted.
<P>

<a name="11017w06.html_para11">The paragraphs of the Inspector's report are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Extracts from Essex local plan report</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5.12 For example, at the inquiry there was more than once quoted to me the parliamentary answer given to Mr. Bob Russell, MP, that "A Way With Waste" creates no obligation to include incineration within waste development plans (doc 2588/PE/1, appendix 5) (and no doubt a similar point could be made with regard to "Waste Strategy 2000"). However I think that is not the point. Nobody can prevent planning applications being submitted for incinerators, and if the plan said nothing about them then it would not provide useful guidance. It would perhaps be entitled to state a presumption against incinerators being permitted, but if it did so this would have to be justified by land use planning considerations, and take account of advice about the relationship between planning and pollution control. I say more about that in part 27. The point here is that the plan should not, in my view, dictate to the WDAs and WCAs what their strategy should be, although it can constrain that strategy within land use planning principles.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Should there be a policy on incineration?</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.11 The first issue arises because in schedule 8 the WPAs propose to delete policy W7K and incorporate policy guidance on incineration into policy W8A. The consortium's objection is withdrawn subject to this. This change might be thought to delight many others who do not want to see any policy on incineration in the plan and who quoted in support of their case the parliamentary reply to Bob Russell MP that there is no obligation to include incineration in the plan (see para 5.12). But it seems to me that having no policy on the matter will not necessarily meet objectors' cases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.12 There is no doubt that waste incineration is an issue in Essex and Southend. Private companies are interested in building incinerators, as evidenced by the three successful bids in the latest round of NFFO contracts (doc 2588/PE/1, appendix 3). They may decide to submit planning applications, and if the waste local plan provided no guidance as to how such applications would be dealt with, the resulting uncertainty would not be in anyone's interest. As regards household waste, the WDAs, having agreed interim contract strategies up to 2007, are in the process of deciding their strategy for post-2007. Through "Working Together", they have agreed with the WCAs a minimum recycling/composting target of 60 per cent. by 2007, but as I understand it they have not reached any decision to eliminate energy from waste incineration from their strategy. Paragraph 29 of PPG10 advises that waste local plans should ensure an adequate planning framework for the provision of facilities by the waste management industry, and should carefully consider the environmental implications of all waste management proposals. For these reasons it would not be a reasonable option for the plan to ignore incineration.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.13 I accept that the proposed changes to policy W8A would still refer to incineration. But I do not consider that it would provide proper guidance. Firstly, this policy applies to the waste management sites identified in schedule 1. Planning applications for incinerators might be submitted on other sites, and there would be no policy basis in the plan for determining such applications. Secondly, the additions to policy W8A on incineration have no justification in the supporting text in chapter 8, and indeed, as objectors to this proposed change point out, include new matter on incineration being a last resort which is not justified anywhere in the plan. Thirdly, the supporting text to policy W7K is not proposed for deletion or amendment, yet if the policy were deleted this text would be left hanging in the air. Fourthly, all the other significant waste management processes, including landfill, have explicit policies applying to them. Simply to remove the 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Oct 2001 : Column: 1245W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>incineration policy and include amended parts of it in policy W8A is not therefore in my view an appropriate response to the objections.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.14 For these reasons I shall not recommend the deletion of policy W7K. In line with the scheme of chapter 7 of the plan for other waste processes, there should be a policy which provides clear guidance for responding to planning applications for incinerators. It is next necessary to consider the content of the policy. To address this, I shall examine in turn the matters included under the second issue listed above.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Should the policy state a presumption against incinerators? If not, what constraints should be applied?</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.36 It will be evident from my conclusions on the above issues that I do not consider that the plan should rule out incineration as a matter of principle. I also see no justification for introducing the phrase "as a last resort" proposed in schedule 8. It is not clear what this means: the question of practicable alternatives further up the waste hierarchy would be taken into account anyway under policy W3A. However clear guidance should be provided in policy W7K as to the matters that would be taken into account by the WPAs in dealing with any planning application.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.37 The definition of these matters follows from the foregoing discussion. Where requirements are common to other forms of waste management, they should be stated in policies W8A and W8B. They would then apply to incineration also, as would be made clear by inserting a cross-reference to those policies in policy W7K. The purpose of policy W7K is to introduce additional requirements specific to incineration, namely consideration of emissions to air or water (see para 27.22) and disposal of residues (see para 27.34). A further matter that I think is best expressed as a requirement is that incineration without energy recovery will not be permitted; but in response to objection from GOER this should be worded to enable an exception to be made in specialised cases. That would conform to para 7.37 of the supporting text, incorporating the modification recommended, which explains the meaning of that term.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.38 Policy W8B contains criteria for major waste development outside the locations identified in schedule 1. Provided an incinerator proposal met those requirements, I see no justification for precluding it solely on the grounds that it was not on an identified site. It might for example be a smaller scale project, or the location might be a suitable one even though it has not been foreseen in drafting the plan. This is the more so because later in this report I have recommended the deletion of some of the identified sites, and shown that there would be difficulties in accommodating a conventional incinerator at some of the others. It would impose an unfair burden on the remaining sites if the plan did not allow flexibility for alternative locations to come forward. My recommended wording therefore includes a reference to other locations subject to policy W8B, and I consider in part 35 how that policy should be worded. This would meet Mid Essex Gravel's objection. It is perhaps unlikely that an incinerator below 50,000 tpa capacity, to which policy W4B would apply, would be proposed, but to allow for future developments this possibility could be mentioned in supporting text.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27.39 Lastly I pick up some of the other matters raised by objectors. The limited energy efficiency of a conventional incinerator, unless it includes a combined heat and power plant, is a factor that would be taken into account in assessing whether a proposed incinerator was the BPEO, under policy W3A. This factor might be improved by technical innovations. The life of an incinerator would be taken into account at planning application stage, and also, no doubt, by the WDAs when considering waste contracts. The University of Essex and others refer to new quasi-incineration techniques such as pyrolysis or gasification: there is nothing in the plan to preclude these, and insofar as they overcame the problems of conventional incinerators they would to that extent be favoured under the policy. The problems raised by Harlow council are all matters that would be addressed at the application stage under various policies of the plan; the issue of

<a name="11017w06.html_para12">The role of a Local Plan Inspector is prescribed in the Town and Country Planning (Development Plan) (England) Regulations 1999 and set out more informally in the Green Book, "Local Plans and Unitary Development Plans: A Guide to Procedures". Essentially it is to hold the inquiry and report to the council with recommendations as to the action they should take with respect to each of the objections. The council must decide whether or not to accept the Inspector's recommendations. They may decide not to do so but must give their reasons for this. The council will normally propose modifications to the Plan in accordance with their decisions on the Inspector's recommendations, prior to adopting the Plan.

<a name="11017w07.html_wqn1"><B> David Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how long foot and mouth disease can remain active in the digestive tract and faeces of <i>(a)</i> carrion crows and <i>(b)</i> foxes.  [5255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 These species are not susceptible to infection by the foot and mouth disease virus. If they ingest the virus there is no true infection or colonisation of the digestive tract. If the virus is ingested, any remaining virus particles, which have survived the activities of digestion, will only persist in the gut for a day or two and will be excreted naturally. However, crows and foxes are not capable of excreting sufficient virus to infect one of the farm species.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has received representations from an extremely wide range of interested parties on all aspects of the foot and mouth outbreak. Since the start of the outbreak, we have regularly consulted a wide range of stakeholders and worked closely with them in the development of our disease control policies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has engaged consultants to prepare detailed restoration and aftercare proposals for the site. The final form of the proposal is nearing completion and in the very near future a copy of the formal proposals will be submitted for approval by the Cumbria county council. Part of this process will involve the county council consulting a number of statutory agencies, the local council and the local parish council for their views.

<a name="11017w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the reasons were for the decision to scrap the EpiMan data management and prediction system for controlling a major foot and mouth epidemic.  [7727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EpiMan data management and prediction system was not scrapped. The modelling component (Interspread) for evaluating control measures and predicting the future course of the epidemic has been used extensively and almost on a daily basis. One scientific paper has been published describing its use during the early stages of the epidemic. The data management component was not used in full as it was designed to administer all tracings associated with Infected Premises and other control activities from a central disease control centre. The widespread geographical distribution of infection did not lend itself to such a central administration. Staff in DEFRA built on their experiences from dealing with the outbreak of classical swine fever and produced a generic disease control database, which has proved to be of great benefit.

<a name="11017w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the estimated cost to the economy is of the foot and mouth disease outbreak to date.  [7731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am very much aware that the outbreak is having a considerable impact on farming and a range of industries throughout the UK. However, it is not possible, at this stage, to make a reliable estimate of the longer-term economic consequences. Work is in hand to complete a national assessment, the details of which will be made publicly available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The total amount paid in statutory compensation in Great Britain as at 10 October is &#163;1,047,102,708. This comprises &#163;1,020,769,169 for animal compensation payments and &#163;26,333,152 for items seized and destroyed such as hay, feed, fodder and semen straws.

[8043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The inquiries which the Government have announced into the current foot and mouth disease epidemic are independent. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for DEFRA to decide how to encourage any person, company or organisation to submit evidence. It is for the chairmen of the independent inquiries to encourage interested parties to submit their views.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what contribution her Department is making to the research being undertaken to develop a vaccine against foot and mouth disease, which does not result in a carrier state.  [6486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As yet no vaccine is available that can provide a guarantee of preventing the carrier state. The Department is funding a programme of research on foot and mouth disease, concentrating on (i) vaccine development (ii) molecular structure of the virus (iii) improved diagnosis and (iv) epidemiology. During the current financial year, we are committed to spend just over &#163;900,000 on this programme, of which &#163;268,000 will be devoted to three projects on vaccine development. In addition, one project from the 'improved diagnosis'

programme is specifically examining the carrier state in cattle. The Department has also received six proposals for future research and development into vaccine development and use.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects that Somerset will be adjudged not to have high risk status in respect of foot and mouth disease.  [7889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 2001]:</i> The county of Somerset was classified as foot and mouth disease free from 9 October, while the single unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset was declared foot and mouth disease free on 11 September. The unitary authority of North Somerset was classified as foot and mouth disease free on 16 October 2001.

 No information is available on whether any CHP capacity has been decommissioned since the introduction of NETA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11017w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Veterinary and scientific advice is that there is an inherent risk of spreading the disease by mixing animals together and then dispersing them. Any livestock keeper with poor standards of biosecurity might attend markets from anywhere in the country and put at risk others attending the market. Even in designated free counties, it would take only one such lapse in biosecurity precautions to spread disease. It is right to be cautious at this stage but the situation will be kept under review.

 We have received from carers' organisations a number of representations on this and other aspects of financial support for carers. Some of these were in response to the Government's recent consultation on our proposed changes to provide entitlement to Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) to those aged over 65, to make the benefit payable for 8 weeks after the death of the person being cared for, and to change its name to the more appropriate "Carer's Allowance". These enhancements to ICA, which are part of a &#163;500 million per annum package of benefit improvements announced last Autumn, will be introduced shortly by means of a Regulatory Reform Order.

In addition, &#163;308 million had been spent on the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme, and the Government have put in place several measures to help the countryside recover from foot and mouth disease, including: deferral of tax, VAT and National Insurance contributions which has helped over 18,000 businesses; establishment of a &#163;50 million Business Recovery Fund; establishment of rate relief scheme covering affected areas; establishment of a matched funding scheme for charitable donations; and the Government making additional lending available through the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme.

 Sections 342 and 343 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 provide HM Treasury with powers to make regulations specifying the circumstances in which appointed actuaries of insurance companies must make a report to the Financial Services Authority. The Treasury intends to make such regulations, but before doing so it wants to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on its proposals. These proposals are set out in a consultation document which will be published by HM Treasury in the near future.
