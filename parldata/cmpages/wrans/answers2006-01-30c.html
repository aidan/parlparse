 DEFRA officials have considered numerous reports on whether cephalopods experience pain and suffering, but the current scientific evidence is not clear-cut.

 The Department is continuing to hold constructive discussions about the project in Gloucestershire which, to the Department&#039;s knowledge, is keeping the beavers in captivity and is therefore not a re-introduction project.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what environmental impact assessment has been carried out into the process that converts vegetable oils into biodiesel of diesel quality.  [43911]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60130w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The most common process for converting vegetable oil into biodiesel is trans-esterification. This process is well known from years of use in the oleochemical sector. However, the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership will be looking at the specific environmental impacts of biodiesel processing as part of their work on developing draft environmental standards for biofuels. The impacts in terms of pollution to air, land and water are controlled by the Environment Agency. A pollution prevention control permit is required where biodiesel is being produced for own-use by six or more people or for commercial operations producing more than 5,000 litres a year. The processing of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and tallow is also subject to waste management controls. Various studies have assessed the greenhouse gas impact across the whole production process from raw material to finished biodiesel. UK-produced biodiesel typically gives greenhouse gas savings of around 55 per cent. compared to fossil diesel.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60130w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The current skin test for bovine tuberculosis is an effective test. It is the accepted standard laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of the disease in a cattle herd. Under EU law, the gamma-interferon diagnostic blood test may be used to supplement the skin test. It is considered marginally more sensitive than the skin test, but less specific. This means that it results in a higher probability of false positives. EU legislation allows for the gamma-interferon test to be used to pick up cases missed by the skin test, but not to overrule it.

 The UK Film Council provides financial assistance to film projects to help deliver a consistent flow of high quality and culturally significant films. All film projects are selected according to an assessment of their cultural and creative merits. Funding will generally be given only to projects that are wholly or substantially capable of certification as a &#039;British&#039; film. However, the UK Film Council is able to exercise discretion and may still elect to finance a film if there are other strong cultural reasons for doing so.

<a name="stpa_129">The Royal Armouries currently runs a programme called &#039;Memories&#039;, which records through DVD the reminiscences of veterans from the Second World War about the Department for weapons they either used or encountered during conflict. A DVD is currently on display in the main entrance to the Royal Armouries in Leeds, and 10 more Second World War veterans will be interviewed by the end of February. The project is in its early days and it is estimated that it will cost &#163;7,000 in 2005&#150;06, with plans for further development.

 The LSC is currently undergoing a radical restructuring exercise which will enable it to work even more effectively with local partners and stakeholders in identifying and responding to London&#039;s learning and skill needs. The existing local office structure will be replaced by a number of specialist local Partnership and Economic Development teams made up of experienced education and training professionals. They will work closely with local partners and stakeholders to ensure that properly funded education and training is available that meets the needs of learners and employers in the London area. These changes are in keeping with the Government&#039;s wider public sector reform agenda, which seeks to move responsibility for local delivery closer to the frontline.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60130w24.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The level of funding per pupil received through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) reflects the characteristics of children in each authority: authorities receive more funding if they have higher numbers of children living in deprived circumstances. That is because pupils from more deprived backgrounds are likely to have additional educational needs, and to require additional help if they are to have an equal chance to succeed. North Somerset&#039;s average level of funding per pupil mainly reflects the authority&#039;s lower than average level of deprivation. The Government will review the operation of a number of aspects of the new school funding arrangements, including the DSG distribution, but in doing so it will continue to aim to give all pupils an equal opportunity in life.

 A research review commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2003 found some indication that there is a relationship between overcrowding and children&#039;s educational attainment, and between overcrowding and children&#039;s social and emotional development. However, the research evidence on the effects of overcrowding on attainment is limited. It is also hard to separate any direct effect of overcrowding from the effect of other associated factors, such as poverty and degree of parental involvement in education. Current evidence suggests that any direct effect of overcrowding on attainment is likely to be small.

<i>[holding answer 24 January 2006]:</i> Total education spending by Newcastle-Upon-Tyne local authority in 2004&#150;05 was &#163;185 million, including spending on provision outside schools. The Department is currently working on figures for spending on school provision for 2004&#150;05 that are comparable with the Dedicated Schools Grant, on both a cash and per pupil basis, and will place them in the Library as soon as they are available.

The total DSG allocation will not be finalised until May 2006 when the January 2006 pupil figures are finalised. In addition, while authorities must apply the whole of their allocation of DSG to their Schools Budget, they are free to add to it from their own resources. Final figures for total budgeted expenditure per pupil for 2006&#150;07 may therefore be higher than the authority&#039;s allocation of DSG per pupil for that year.

 The Department for Education and Skills pays dedicated schools grant (DSG) to local authorities, to provide for those items that are included in each local authority&#039;s schools budget, which consists of the delegated budgets allocated to individual schools, and a budget for other provision for pupils which local authorities fund centrally. Each local authority then decides, in consultation with its Schools Forum, on the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Jan 2006 : Column 96W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
distribution of funding between its schools. The national formula for distribution of DSG does not take account of the level of deficit at an authority&#039;s schools and, normally, local authority formulae for distributing funding do not do so either. However, it is open to an authority to distribute additional funding to a school which is in financial difficulties. Where a school is in deficit, it should agree a plan with its local authority to eliminate the deficit over a three-year period.

This was a larger than usual increase. We might therefore expect a slight fall in application numbers for the 2006 entry and then a return to a long-term upward trend, as experienced in 1997 and 1998 when the last major change to student support arrangements was introduced.

However, we judge that there is most unlikely to be agreement in the UN Security Council to refer Zimbabwe to the ICC at present and that failure to secure agreement would constitute a reverse.

 EU sanctions against leading figures in the Zimbabwe Government continue to place real and significant pressure on the regime. They have the support of the Zimbabwean political opposition and non-governmental organisations, and they send a firm message that the EU is concerned at human rights abuses, but as we have made clear on many previous occasions, the measures we have in place are targeted specifically against the regime. We do not believe it is right to pursue sanctions which would hurt innocent Zimbabweans already suffering from the misrule by the Mugabe regime.

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID.

However, the Department also provides a wide variety of other arrangements which allow staff to work flexibly, and thereby help to promote diversity and the achievement of a better work-life balance, while still ensuring its business is conducted effectively. These include initiatives such as a flexitime scheme, part-time working, job sharing, part-year appointments, which are particularly suitable for people wishing to work only during school term time, compressed hours, fitting the working week into less that five full days, and special leave arrangements to cope with a variety of circumstances.

 As part of the Department&#039;s commitment to reducing administrative burdens on the national health service, statistical information relating to medicines management in hospitals is not collected routinely. However, in 2003 NHS trusts were invited to self-assess their medicines management performance against developmental good practice standards contained in the Department&#039;s medicines management framework. Responses were considered by strategic

health authorities (SHAs) and, where appropriate, action plans to address areas of weakness would be developed and implemented by the individual trusts. The information collected by SHAs suggested that by the end of 2004 some 67 per cent. of respondents expected to have systems in place to utilise patients&#039; own drugs and enable self-administration, where appropriate.

However, the Office for National Statistics&#039; (ONS&#039;s) report &quot;Psychiatric Morbidity among Adults Living in Private Households, 2000&quot; shows the associations between the presence of mental disorders and key socio-demographic and economic characteristics for those with different types of mental disorder.

 The Queen Elizabeth Hospital National Health Service Trust has a reference cost index score of 103 for the year 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60130w52.html_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 This is a local matter. The South East London Strategic Health Authority (SHA) has advised that following the HM Treasury&#039;s discount rate for the provisions for 3.5 per cent. and 2.2 per cent., the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Trust has applied this directive to the deferred asset created to transfer ownership of the private finance initiative hospital back to the national health service over the term of the contract. The SHA further advises that this interpretation of the guidance has recently been clarified by the Department. However, the trust is finding it difficult to contain the impact of the financial pressure resulting from this clarification which was published on 3 January with an effective date of 1 April 2005.

 This is a local matter. The South East London Strategic Health Authority has advised that the Queen Elizabeth Hospital scheme has not been refinanced. It was financed with an index-linked bond. The nature of bond deals make them very hard to refinance without incurring considerable additional costs. It is therefore unlikely that a refinancing will take place as the costs will normally outweigh the benefits.

 As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with advice from independent experts. The United Kingdom&#039;s Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on vaccine safety have thoroughly reviewed the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines, including alleged links with neurodevelopmental disorders, and kept this under close review.

<p>
<a name="60130w52.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_213">In 2001, the CSM, now the Commission for Human Medicines, conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data on a number of occasions as it has emerged. Following concerns in the United States of America (USA) about the possible toxicity of thiomersal-containing vaccines, the Department funded a study using the UK&#039;s general practice research database to investigate whether there is a relationship between the amount of thiomersal that an infant receives through vaccination at a young age and subsequent neurological disorders. Data from a study involving over a 100,000 UK children were considered by CSM in 2003. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children and a study from the USA have also specifically investigated 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Jan 2006 : Column 190W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence of a causal association with subsequent neurodevelopment disorders, including autism.

<p>
<a name="60130w52.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_214">The advice of CSM stands that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible allergic reactions, typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the USA&#039;s Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 13 July 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1094W, on overseas prisoners, whether the UK has a bilateral prisoner transfer agreement with the United States; whether not keeping records of transit applications are a standard of such agreements&#039; whether transit applications are recorded electronically at any stage in the process; and by what means records of transit applications are disposed of once the transit has been completed.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60130w58.html_spnew4"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The United Kingdom and the United States are both parties to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The Convention provides for the transfer of sentenced persons to continue serving their sentences in their country of nationality or one with which the sentenced person has close links. Transfer under the Convention requires the consent of both states involved and the prisoner concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60130w58.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_31">Article 16 of the Convention enables contracting parties to transit through UK airports to another contracting party, or to a third party, where transfer of the prisoner has been agreed in accordance with the relevant international agreement. The Convention does not require that records of transit requests be kept. For the purposes of the transfer of sentence prisoners transit only takes place in the United Kingdom through Gatwick and Heathrow and it is the normal practice of states wishing to transit through Heathrow or Gatwick airports to fax a request to the National Offender Management Service. The request would normally 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Jan 2006 : Column 211W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
contain details of the individual concerned, including sentence and offence details, the agreement under which transfer has been agreed, and flight details. The National Offender Management Service then makes the relevant arrangements for transit. Once transit has been completed the request is destroyed either by shredding or disposal in confidential waste. Secure disposal is used because requests contain personal information about the prisoner. Transit requests are not electronically recorded.

 During the Protective Services Review of summer 2005, the extent to which police forces had a dedicated Major Incident Team (MIT) was assessed. The vast majority of police forces do have some dedicated staff to major crime investigation; however, generally this takes the form of a small, core office team, with the additional investigative staff being drawn from basic command unit&#039;s (BCUs), ordinarily the CID.

The latter data will however become increasingly available through Learning and Skills Council management information arrangements as they take responsibility for planning and funding offender learning and skills during 2006.

 The Government published on 15 December 2005 a Green Paper called &#039;Reducing Re-Offending through Skills and Employment&#039; (Cm 6702). The Green Paper outlined the Government&#039;s assessment of the importance of skills and employment as part of a broad package of interventions to reduce re-offending.

<p>
<a name="60130w59.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_42">Evidence suggests that employment and a reduction in re-offending are linked and that those with higher skills, for example level two in the National Qualifications Framework, are more likely to be in employment than those without. The Home Office&#039;s longitudinal study&#151;Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction&#151;will assess the impact of a range of interventions, including education.

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60130w59.html_spnew8"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Prisons running intensive drug rehabilitation programmes are shown in the following list.. There are currently no plans to expand the delivery of drug treatment programmes. Research evidence shows that it is possible to achieve up to a 10 per cent. decrease in the level of expected re-offending but this can only realistically be achieved where effective through-care arrangements exist and timely community after-care has been made available.

Notes:<br>

1. A patrol dog is a German Shepherd dog used mainly in high security prisons to provide perimeter protection against escape attempts or concerted prisoner indiscipline.<br>

2. A proactive dog is generally one of the gundog breed and is trained to search cells, vehicles and other areas for hidden controlled drugs or drug-contaminated items.<br>

3. An arms and explosive search (AES) dog is generally one of the gundog breeds. It is trained to search cells, areas, vehicles and other areas for hidden firearms, explosives and associated components.<br>

4. A passive drug dog is generally one of the gundog breeds and is trained to search individual or groups of people usually entering a prison for hidden controlled drugs on their person.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps his Department is taking to reduce reoffending.  [45210]</p>




<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60130w61.html_spnew6"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Building on the National Action Plan launched in 2004, in November 2005 we launched the National Reducing Reoffending Delivery Plan, the cornerstones of which are: partnership working at national, regional and local levels; end-to end-offender management under the National Offender Management Service (NOMS); and public protection. The Delivery Plan sets out the key actions the Government intends to take over the next 18 months towards the delivery of our target of reducing re-offending by 10 per cent. by the end of the decade. It also charts the real progress NOMS and its partners have made over the last 18 months in delivering services to offenders that address the reasons for their re-offending. For example, 87 per cent. of prisoners on whom information is recorded now have accommodation to go to on release, the number of educational awards offenders have achieved has risen by 40 per cent. and the number completing a drug treatment course in prison or a drug testing order in the community is up by a third. (Copies of the Delivery Plan were placed in the Library at the time of publication.)
</p>


<p>
<a name="60130w61.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_51">Alongside the Delivery Plan, we announced three important new reducing re-offending alliances. The first of these will build on links with employers at national, regional and local levels to explore how businesses can work with NOMS to improve the employability and training of offenders. The second, the civic society alliance, will involve working with local authorities and other local partners to support the resettlement and reintegration of offenders. The final alliance is with faith groups and the voluntary sector and will address the needs of offenders through the innovative work by faith and voluntary sector groups already under way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60130w61.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_52">Complementing the alliances, NOMS has published an Action Plan to improve effective engagement and partnership with the voluntary and community sector. Also, as part of the cross-Government &quot;Together We Can&quot; Action Plan, NOMS and the Youth Justice Board have developed a joint approach to working with communities and civil renewal. This has the twin aims of reducing re-offending and increasing public confidence, with a focus on four priorities: public protection; unpaid and reparative work; victims and restorative justice; and community integration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60130w61.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_53">In December we published, jointly with colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions, a Green Paper, &#039;Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment&#039;. We have been developing proposals for embedding skills and employment for offenders as key tenets of the broader national delivery plan for reducing re-offending. We hope that this will start a constructive dialogue with our partners about how we can most effectively equip offenders for employment and with the basic skills needed for law-abiding adult life, including engaging employers in the design and delivery of programmes for offenders and drive improvement in the quality of the programmes offered to offenders.

 The Respect Action Plan aims to tackle antisocial behaviour and promote respect by empowering individuals and community groups, such as residents&#039; associations, to play an important role in taking a stand and tackling and not tolerating antisocial behaviour.

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and expressed in thousands.<br>

2. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3. Numbers are based on a 5 per cent. sample, and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation. These figures should be used as a guide to the current situation only.<br>

4. Figures for the latest quarter do not include any late notifications and are subject to major changes in future quarters. For illustration purposes, total commencements for May 2004 increased by 18 per cent. in the year following their initial release.<br>

5. Income support figures will include a small number of minimum income guarantee and pension credit claimants.<br>

6. Incapacity benefit figures exclude severe disability allowance, since there are no new severe disability allowance commencements.<br>

1. The data refers to benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple<br>

2. Caseloads are expressed in thousands and rounded to the nearest thousand. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3. Average amounts are rounded to the nearest penny and refer to the amount of housing benefit or council tax benefit only.<br>

4. Housing benefit figures exclude any Extended Payment cases<br>

5. Council tax benefit figures exclude any Second Adult Rebate cases<br>

6. There will be overlaps in the housing benefit and council tax benefit figures as it is possible to be in receipt of both benefits.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are rounded to the nearest thousand, and are a &#039;snapshot&#039; at end of February each year.<br>

2. The analysis presented includes those cases with a full maintenance assessment only, as it is not possible to provide disaggregated volumes for pre-assessed cases or those with an interim maintenance assessment.<br>

3. Northamptonshire is based on the following local authority areas: Corby, Daventry, East Northamptonshire, Kettering, Northampton, South Northamptonshire, Wellingborough.<br>

4. Wellingborough analysis is based on Wellingborough parliamentary constituency.<br>

5. Robust information covering the period from March 2003 to present is not currently available.<br>

<sup>(99)</sup> While the agency did receive stage 1 telephone complaints prior to 2002&#150;03, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(100)</sup> Although 671 stage 1 telephone complaints were recorded between December 2002 and March 2003, their volumes were not recorded throughout the whole year, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(101)</sup> While the agency did receive complaints directly to the chief executive, treat official complaints, and MP complaints to business units prior to 2000&#150;01, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(102)</sup> During 2003&#150;04 complaints sent directly to the chief executive were not recorded separately from those complaints which were escalated to him as part of the three stage process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received during 2003&#150;04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly (as opposed to those escalated via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with data for earlier years.<br>

<sup>(103)</sup> In April and May of 2004, the chief executive received a total of 1,435 complaints but it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly, as opposed to those escalated to stage 3 of the complaints process. From June 2004 to March 2005, after which time such complaints were recorded separately, the chief executive received 4,352 direct complaints and 2,549 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2. Again, these recording issues prevent meaningful comparison of this category with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(104)</sup> Treat official letters are those received by a Minister from a member of the public, and referred for initial consideration to an official of the agency.<br>

Note:<br>

The agency has a three-tier complaints process which comprises of: stage 1 complaints from clients which are dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team located within each of the agency&#039;s six business units; stage 2 complaints which are an escalation to the relevant area director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1; and stage 3 which is an escalation to the chief executive if the client remains dissatisfied.<br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_243">It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular whilst the volume of stage 1 written complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003&#150;04.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_244">It should also be noted that the volume of complaints has stabilised.

<sup>(105)</sup> While the agency did receive stage 1 telephone complaints prior to 2002&#150;03, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(106)</sup> Although 671 stage 1 telephone complaints were recorded between December 2002 and March 2003, their volumes were not recorded throughout the whole year, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(107)</sup> While the agency did receive complaints directly to the Chief Executive, treat official complaints, and MP complaints to Business Units prior to 2000&#150;01, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(108)</sup> During 2003&#150;04 complaints sent directly to the Chief Executive were not recorded separately from those complaints which were escalated to him as part of the 3 stage process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received during 2003&#150;04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the Chief Executive directly (as opposed to those escalated via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with data for earlier years.<br>





<sup>(109)</sup> In April and May of 2004, the Chief Executive received a total of 1,435 complaints but is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the Chief Executive directly, as opposed to those escalated to stage 3 of the complaints process). From June 2004-March 2005, after which time such complaints were recorded separately, the Chief Executive received 4,352 direct complaints and 2,549 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2. Again, these recording issues prevent meaningful comparison of this category with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(110)</sup> Treat official letters are those received by a Minister from a member of the public, and referred for initial consideration to an official of the agency.<br>

 The new Office for Disability Issues (ODI) will report annually to the Prime Minister on cross-government progress in implementing the Strategy Unit report, Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People. The first report is due to be published by summer 2006. It will contain an assessment of the activity undertaken both by the ODI and by relevant Government Departments to fulfil the responsibilities and recommendations set out in Strategy Unit&#039;s report.

<a name="60130w66.html_para3">
The Department for Work and Pensions has responded positively to the recommendations of the Strategy Unit report and, working closely with colleagues from other Departments, established the cross-government ministerial steering group that is taking forward the Government&#039;s strategy to deliver substantive equality for disabled people by 2025. The Department co-ordinated cross-government efforts in setting up the Office for Disability Issues, which was launched on 1 December this year, and partnered with the Department of Health and ODPM in the development of the pilots for individual budgets, announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health on 21 November 2005. The Department is also leading an exercise to appoint people onto an advisory group that will work with disability organisations, disabled people, and Government officials to develop proposals for a national forum for organisations of disabled people.

<p>
<a name="60130w66.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">The Department for Work and Pensions is also committed to taking forward the recommendations in the Life Chances report on employment, working with other Government Departments to achieve these. Progress against these recommendations will be published in the ODI annual report. The Life Chances report, and the recommendations within it are key in helping the Department for Work and Pensions in reviewing the employment services offered to disabled people, and in considering how best to reform incapacity benefit to ensure that disabled people are empowered and supported within the labour market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60130w66.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">Work is underway on a project to research information and advice required by disabled people and review existing cross-government provision. We will work with other Departments to develop proposals to improve the provision of information and advice about services to disabled people. The Directgov website for disabled people, www.directgov.uk/disability is now the central point for all information from Government. It has been warmly received by disabled people and organisations and continues to grow in popularity and interest. All Departments contribute to the information and services and it is now written and co-ordinated within the Office for Disability Issues.

<a name="stpa_130"><i>Letter from Terry Moran, dated January 2006:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_260">In reply to four of your recent Parliamentary Questions about the reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit, the Minister for Disabled People, Anne McGuire MP, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, promised you a substantive reply from the Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_261">You asked what assessment he had made of the Disability and Carers Service&#039;s reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit to operate on a regional basis.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_262">The Disability Benefit Unit (DBU) is the largest of the Disability and Carers Service&#039;s (DCS) operational sites and has responsibility for the ongoing management of approx 4.5 million cases where Attendance Allowance or Disability Living Allowance is in payment. It also deals with new claims for these benefits from people living in the south of England.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_263">The decision to reorganise on a regional basis was made in order to improve service delivery to customers and their representatives, by reducing the number of people and teams that have to be involved in handling claims and changes of circumstances. Under the current organisation, a claim or change of circumstances could be dealt with by one of a number of functional teams dealing with customers from any part of Britain. The new model joins holistic benefit teams in the DBU with their counterparts dealing with new claims in our regional centres, the Disability Benefit Centres (DBC). Customers will continue to contact DCS through the national Customer Care Helpline (CCH) and the underlying structural changes should not be obvious to them, except that their business will be dealt with more efficiently and effectively.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_264">You also asked if he would list the private sector firms that have been contracted for the reorganisation of the Disability and Carers Service; and what the value was of each such contract.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_265">The total cost of accommodation, infrastructure and IT changes has been budgeted at &#163;444,000. The changes are being made through the DWP&#039;s normal partners, Land Security Trillium, EDS and BT.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_266">You also asked how many staff hours he expected to be taken up by the <i>(a)</i> reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit and <i>(b)</i> subsequent training of staff; and what this represents in terms of financial cost.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_267">In answer to part <i>(a)</i> of your question, the notional staff cost associated with the move is 79,617, based on an assumption that each member of staff will be non-productive for half a day during implementation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_268">In answer to part <i>(b)</i> of your question, most staff will continue to carry out the same work as they are currently but, over the coming months, a programme of learning and development will be used to refresh or broaden the skills of those who require it. A skills audit of all staff is being carried out currently and that will be used to assess the training needs and costs. Whilst the full cost has not yet been assessed, it is worth mentioning that some training of this nature would have been undertaken as part of the normal life of the unit; the key difference is that the skills audit will facilitate precise targeting of the training.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_269">Finally, you asked what advice he had received from the Disability and Carers Service on the likely impact on assessment of claims during the reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_270">The expectation is that, in the immediate term, there will be minimal disruption to services. Pre-implementation activities have included the deployment of a dedicated team that has ensured there are no bottlenecks of work in the DBU and contingency plans exist should, unexpectedly, there be difficulties in the immediate period after the changes. The CCH will be open for its
