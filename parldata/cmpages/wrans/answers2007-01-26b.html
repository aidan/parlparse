<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70126w0001.htm_para6"><a name="07012690000252">Section 8 of the Childcare Act 2006 provides that a local authority may not deliver new child care provision itself unless it is satisfied that no other provider is willing to do so or, if another provider is willing to do so, that in the circumstances it is appropriate for the local authority to provide the child care. We intend section 8 to come into force in October 2007. It will not affect the provision of child care by the governing body of a maintained school, and it will not apply to day care for children in need provided under section 18 of the Children Act 1989.</p>

That guidance will make clear that the restriction in section 8 relates only to new or expanding local authority child care. There is no requirement for local authorities to close their existing provision, or change it when section 8 comes into force. If, however, a local authority wishes to expand existing child care in terms of the number of places or the hours offered, or if it wishes to open new provision, the requirements of section 8 will need to be met.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 January]:</i> Mainstream school funding is provided through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which sets local authorities allocations for 2006-07 and 2007-08: the allocations for 2007-08 will depend on pupil numbers in schools in January 2007 and the guaranteed unit of funding per pupil set in December 2005, which took account of the number of children for whom English is an additional language and those pupils from ethnic minorities who are underachieving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70126w0002.htm_para0"><a name="07012690000261">The increase in Peterborough's DSG guaranteed unit of funding was 7 per cent. in 2006-07 and will be 6.8 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

They can also deliver wider benefits including improvements in pupil behaviour, increased confidence and independent mobility for pupils with special educational needs, improved punctuality and school attendance, engaging schools and pupils from deprived areas, building positive relationships with local authorities and local communities and improved safety.</p>

However, according to the Office for National Statistics&#146; Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, median hourly pay excluding overtime in the north-west of England (including Merseyside) rose 34 per cent. since the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) (from &#163;6.95 in 1998 to &#163;9.32 in 2006). Though the NMW would have made some contribution to this increase, no quantitative assessment of its impact has been made.</p>

The UK Resource Centre for Women in SET has been set up and is working with over 70 employers to increase numbers of women in SET, and 38 schools are currently participating in an initiative run by SETNET to increase the participation of ethnic minority school children in science.</p>

 In accordance with the Anglo-French Joint Maritime Contingency Plan (Mancheplan), the Secretary of State's representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP) and the French maritime authorities made an on-scene assessment of the condition of the MSC Napoli, and the French authorities assessed a number of possible locations for a place of refuge in French waters. The conclusion arising out of these assessments was that the least environmentally risky option was to tow the vessel to a place of refuge in UK waters. The south coast of England provided better options for a place of refuge than the French coast, where there were no suitable places of refuge within reasonable distance.</p>

 The UK&#146;s 2006 White Paper on International Development commits us to tackling barriers to access to markets and financial services, and supporting microfinance initiatives in partnership with banks and regulators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="70126w0007.htm_para2"><a name="07012690000741">For DFID, microfinance is part of a broader strategy to promote stronger and more inclusive financial sectors. In addition to programmes that have microfinance as the central activity, DFID supports programmes to improve access to finance for poor people where microfinance is just one component. These programmes aim to encourage the entry of financial institutions into the microfinance sector and assist Governments to improve the regulatory environment for financial institutions to serve the poor.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate his Department has made of the impact of changing the definition for determining the local housing allowance from the mid point of local rents to the median on the <i> (a)</i> percentage of claimants subject to the single room rate/shared room rent restriction who face a shortfall between their eligible and contractual rent and <i> (b)</i> average size of that shortfall.

 Any shortfall between the local housing allowance and contractual rent at the time of national roll-out of the local housing allowance will depend on the trends in local rent levels and the accommodation choices made by tenants. The trends in local rent levels up to the point of national roll-out are currently hard to predict and local housing allowance rates will vary across local private rent sector markets. This is true for all claimants, including those single under 25-year-olds without dependants who are subject to the local housing allowance shared room rate.</p>

 Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally, but less than 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide. Emissions of carbon dioxide attributed to agriculture arise from direct energy use such as the use of diesel in tractors, gas in heating greenhouses, and electricity used in livestock buildings. The bigger challenge is on two other gases, methane and nitrous oxide, of which some 36 per cent. and 67 per cent. respectively comes from agriculture, livestock, manures, and artificial fertiliser. About 86 per cent. of this methane comes from enteric fermentation in the digestive system of animals (sheep, pigs and bovines), and about 14 per cent. from animal waste. Methane emissions from agriculture have declined by 12 per cent. since 1990.</p>

This research project will build on our knowledge-base and take an integrated approach to the development of ruminant nutrition regimes to deliver reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions (particularly methane) per animal and per unit of meat and milk output. Approaches for consideration include the modification of forage-based diets, alterations to concentrate feed formulation and ingredients, and feed supplements. All options and solutions will be looked at.</p>

The resulting increases in individual cow milk yields can reduce methane emissions per unit of milk produced. The Defra research has included, for example, developing grass varieties that are high in sugar and lead indirectly to a reduction in methane emissions.</p>

 I assume my hon. Friend&#146;s question refers to the recent decision to approve trials of a genetically modified (GM) blight-resistant potato.

With regards cross-contamination, statutory conditions have been attached to the trials to ensure that no GM material enters the food, or animal feed, chain.</p>

The trial sites will not be released from statutory control until there have been two consecutive years in which no groundkeepers or volunteers are observed.

Most existing incentive schemes reward those householders that produce less residual waste after recycling. By minimising waste and recycling or home composting as much as possible, householders can help to keep down waste costs and, therefore, help reduce pressures on council tax bills. Pensioners tend to produce less waste than the average household, so would be likely to gain from any incentive scheme. Any new initiatives on waste would of course need to take into account the impact on different groups, including the vulnerable and those on low incomes, as part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p>

 Since the 1985-86 whaling seasons, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has maintained a moratorium on the hunting and killing of all great whales. Norway and Iceland, who objected to the introduction of the moratorium, are thus not bound by it and therefore conduct whaling operations legally.</p>

We will continue our efforts, along with other countries, to urge these countries to reconsider their position and reverse this unjustified and unnecessary practice. Indeed, in November, the UK led a diplomatic demarche of 25 countries together with the European Commission in condemning the Icelandic Government's decision to resume commercial whaling.</p>

This ensures that these countries are in no doubt of the importance that the UK places on whale conservation.</p>

 European food law places primary responsibility on food operators to ensure that the food and animal feed that they sell complies with food safety legislation. The European Commission has powers to introduce emergency measures to control the import of potentially contaminated food and feed and has done so in cases where this is necessary, such as following the discovery of unauthorised genetically modified (GM) material in long grain rice from the United States. The Commission also represents the European Union (EU) in discussions with trading partners on issues where there is an agreed EU position, including GM food and feed. The Commission, through its Joint Research Centre (JRC), is also able to provide practical support for laboratories involved in analysing food and feed for unauthorized GM material. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is encouraging the Commission and the JRC to expand this work. At national level, the FSA is responsible for overseeing the food law enforcement activities of local authorities.

2. Prior to the financial year 2000-01, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust existed as two separate trusts&#151;Chorley and South Ribble NHS Trust and Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. In 2000-01 these trusts merged (with part of Chorley being allocated to another trust), keeping the name Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. In the financial year 2002-03, this became Lancashire Teaching Hospitals. The &#145;combined&#146; figures given prior to 2000-01 are based on a sum of the two merged trusts. Due to the division of Chorley as part of the trust merger, the medians prior to 2000-01 should be regarded as estimates as they are based on data that does not fully represent the area currently covered by Lancashire Teaching Hospitals.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how the assumption of 2.5 per cent. for pay settlement and drift used to inform the pay, price and reform uplift to the tariff in 2007-08 was taken into account in determining the 1.7 per cent. increase in the tariff for pay; what definitions of pay settlement and drift she is using; and if she will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="07012690002311"><a name="70126w0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="07012690003074"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 The tariff uplift is based on the estimated increase in the cost of services within the hospital and community health service (HCHS) sector. The 2.5 per cent. increase in pay settlement and drift translates into a 1.7 per cent. increase in HCHS costs because pay represents around two-thirds of total HCHS costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70126w0018.htm_para5"><a name="07012690002312">Pay settlement is the level of pay increase awarded following the recommendation by pay review bodies. Pay drift is the increase in paybill beyond increases due to workforce growth, pay settlement and staff on-costs. For example, a decrease in workforce growth or improved staff retention may lead to pay drift due to a change in the distribution of staff between different incremental points on the pay scale.</p>
