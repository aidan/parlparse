 The Government are committed to making use of more diverse methods of involving the public and to engaging a broader range of people. The &quot;Code of Practice on Written Consultation" provides guidance to Departments on written consultations with the public. To help policy-makers improve policy design through undertaking public involvement initiatives, the Cabinet Office has also published &quot;Viewfinder: A Policy Maker's Guide to Public Involvement". Viewfinder is available on the Policy Hub Website www.policyhub.gov.uk. Viewfinder includes examples of good practice, features a wide range of involvement techniques (including e-consultation) and describes how effectively to plan public involvement activities, 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2003 : Column 853W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30129w01.html_para8">The Office of Public Services Reform in the Cabinet Office has developed five principles of good customer feedback to guide Departments in consulting on public services.

<i>[holding answer 28 January 2003]:</i> I assume that the hon. Member is referring to the Wattisham air traffic contract. A risk assessment was included during the bid evaluation process for the first competition of the Wattisham air traffic contract, and that process identified areas of concern in all bids. The resulting contract with VT Aerospace (contract CS 4D/2017) was, however, terminated by mutual consent and the competition was re-run between the other bidders, leading to a contract with Serco (contract CS 4D/2027).

 As at 21 January 2003, 1,816 reservists had been sent call-out notices in support of Operation TELIC. Single Service Adjudication Officers have been in contact with reservists' employers to consider applications for revocation, exemption or deferral of employees' call-out and applications for financial assistance to cover the additional costs resulting from call-out as defined by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96).

 The Ministry of Defence has been conducting a long-standing campaign designed to win and maintain the support of Britain's employers for the volunteer reserve forces, which was re-launched in September 2002 as SaBRE (Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers). Its purpose is to explain to employers not only the benefits of employing reservists, but also the attendant rights and obligations that employers have, including the requirement to reemploy reservists who have been called-out in accordance with the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985. In addition, when a reservist is called-out, a letter is sent to their employer reminding them of their obligations under the Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985, an employer must take into his or her employment, under the same conditions of service as they were previously serving, those former employees who have been called-out as reservists who make a written application at the end of a period of called-out service. If this is not reasonable and practical, the reservist must be reinstated on the most favourable terms of service available.
<P>

<a name="30129w02.html_para6">Under the Act, where an employer fails to reinstate a reservist, the reservist may apply to a reinstatement committee. These committees, appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, have the power to compel an employer to reinstate an employee and/or order the employer to pay appropriate compensation. Failure to comply with an order of a reinstatement committee is a criminal offence and an employer may be fined on conviction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act provides for reinstatement and/or compensation for reservists dismissed from their jobs whilst called out. Reservists who feel they have been unfairly dismissed by their employer may apply to a reinstatement committee to hear their case.
<P>

<a name="30129w02.html_para8">Any decision to seek legal advice is a matter for the individual, and the Ministry of Defence is not in a position to offer legal advice in individual cases. However, The Forces Law Network, an association of solicitors with experience of the needs of service personnel, can provide independent legal advice. Advice on how to apply for reinstatement, and what to do if any employer fails to honour his/her legal obligations, is available to reservists at both unit and regional level. In addition, the SaBRE (Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers) campaign can answer general queries about the provisions of the Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w03.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 1997 (Statutory Instrument 1997 No 309) allows Reservists to continue payments into their civilian employers' pension scheme while they are called out. Under the regulations, the Ministry of Defence has powers to pay the employer's pension contribution, provided that the reservist continues to pay any employee's share required by the scheme. Pension scheme administrators must accept the MOD's payments for this purpose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Breathing Apparatus Rescue Teams (BARTs) and Rescue Equipment Support Teams (RESTs) have been assembled by withdrawing individuals from almost every unit of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Recognising the important contribution the teams have played during the national firefighters dispute, every effort is made to preserve the capability of BARTs and RESTs. Recently, six RAF and 124 Royal Navy personnel have been withdrawn from Operation FRESCO as a direct consequence of deployments to the Gulf. During the course of the industrial action, the Ministry of Defence has maintained a programme of replacing personnel who needed to be withdrawn for various reasons, including the Gulf deployment, in order to ensure that the overall fire and rescue capability remains broadly constant. As this is a rolling programme, there is no direct correlation between those personnel stood down from Operation FRESCO due to their deployment to the Gulf and those personnel (or their parent units) from across the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy being trained as replacements.

 While the Ministry of Defence is examining the benefits of using Open Source Software in some areas, it is not envisaged that its use will be mandated to Project teams.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w03.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Software used in the Ministry of Defence is selected on its ability to meet business and operational needs, taking full account of value for money, long-term viability, security and interoperability. The Ministry of Defence currently has no explicit policy on the use of Open Source Software, but does follow the Government Open Source Software policy published and announced in Parliament on 22 July 2002. This policy is available on the e-Envoy website (www.e-envoy.gov.uk) or the Office of Government Commerce website (www.ogc.gov.uk).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w03.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is recognised that, increasingly, systems which include commercial off-the-shelf software will be offered to the Ministry of Defence by potential contractors for defence applications. This can be beneficial in reducing development times and costs, but can give concern as off-the-shelf software may be of uncertain origin and not stringently tested prior to release. Projects are therefore treated on a case by case basis. The security requirements of each system will be specified in the design documents. When a commercial

<a name="30129w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Railtrack have, at various stages, made 47 separate applications in regard to the Thameslink 2000 project, many of which replaced or varied earlier ones. They first applied in November 1997 for an Order under the Transport and Works Act (TWA) and for planning permission, together with applications for listed building consent (LBC) and conservation area consent (CAC). These proposals were modified by further applications in 1998 and 1999 for LBC and CAC and, in September 1999, for an amending TWA Order and related planning permission. In October 2000, while the public inquiry was underway, Railtrack submitted a further tranche of amending planning and LBC applications. The position concerning the applications is therefore a complex one which has involved many changes.
<P>

<a name="30129w04.html_para3">The inspector who held the public inquiry provided a report in January 2002, followed by supplementary reports in May and June 2002. These were published in July 2002. In summary, he concluded that whilst the scheme would bring very substantial transportation, regeneration and economic benefits, there were three key deficiencies in the scheme&#151;at London Bridge and Blackfriars stations and in the Borough High Street area&#151;which required resolution before a decision could
<P>

<a name="30129w04.html_para4">appropriately be made on the scheme as a whole. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has since been giving careful consideration to the inspector's conclusions and to the many representations which have been received since the inquiry closed. These include a letter of 31 October 2002 from the Strategic Rail Authority who proposed that the scheme be split into two phases and asked for approval to be granted subject to conditions to deal with the outstanding issues identified by the inspector.

<a name="30129w04.html_para5">We are today informing Railtrack that a decision on the scheme is to be deferred pending the submission and consideration of fresh applications aimed at addressing the deficiencies identified by the inspector, an amended Environmental Statement and a proper examination of the SRA's proposal to split the project into two phases. This will require a re-opening of the earlier inquiry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the findings of the Audit Commission report, &quot;PFI in Schools".  [92769]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Audit Commission's report found that whilst teaching staff and pupils were generally pleased with their new schools, there had been some difficulties in the procurement process and some design aspects were less than ideal. However, the report focused only on a small number of very early PFI pathfinder schools. Since those early days, as the report itself made clear, we have continuously refined and improved the schools PFI process in the light of experience. Over 500 schools are now covered by PFI deals, representing over &pound;1.3 billion of private sector investment. Another 400 PFI schools are in procurement or provisionally approved. This is a major programme by any standards and many schools are now receiving substantial investments to help provide high quality accommodation, raise educational standards and transform working conditions for pupils and staff.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w04.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the merits of funding the building of schools through the Private Finance Initiative.  [92771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) has significant merits. For example, it allows for risk sharing with the private sector. The public sector does not pay anything until construction work on the school building is complete and the school is receiving the contracted service. New schools are generally completed on time and are then maintained to a high standard over the whole life of the contract. This prevents the deterioration of the schools estate which has been so common in the past. Also, teaching professionals can focus on teaching without the distractions of facilities management and poor accommodation.
<P>

<a name="30129w04.html_para6">Using the PFI to fund the building of schools has so far meant that an extra &pound;1.3 billion has been invested to provide better conditions for pupils and teachers in over 500 schools. Transforming school accommodation is helping us to raise educational standards.
<P>

<a name="30129w04.html_para7">As far as individual PFI projects are concerned, each one is assessed at the outset to ensure it will provide best value over the whole life of the contract. Further checks are made at various points during the procurement process to ensure that value for money for the public sector is delivered. Once the project is operational and transactions appear in the local authority's accounts,

 A local authority, governing body or foundation body must obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of any playing field that has been used for the purposes of a maintained school within the preceding 10 years. This applies to both continuing and closed schools.
<P>

<a name="30129w05.html_para6">Applications to dispose of school playing fields are assessed against three main criteria. These are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, will be met;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) community needs: that community use of school playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) finance: that any sale proceeds are re-invested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, or are used otherwise to help raise standards by providing better educational facilities.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="30129w05.html_para7">The criteria are set out in the Department's Guidance 0580/2001: The Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for City Academies. The criteria enable the Secretary of State to take into account the team game playing field provision at other local schools. This is to ensure that where there are surplus fields at one school, other local schools are given the opportunity to use those surplus fields. The School Playing Fields Advisory Panel provides advice on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria. The Secretary of State has no influence over what happens to a school playing field once consent has been given to its disposal. Any future development is a matter for the local planning authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no routine year-on-year monitoring of birds on Countryside Stewardship special projects. However, there are some data available regarding those special projects that are specifically targeted at particular bird species. For example a report published by RSPB in 2001 showed cirl buntings had increased by 83 per cent. on land under Countryside Stewardship scheme agreements, compared with an increase of only 2 per cent. on non-agreement land.
<P>

<a name="30129w06.html_para2">At present, only provisional results for regional bird data are available. Indicators have been developed based on on-going research by RSPB/BTO on behalf of DEFRA. These provisional estimates show that between 1970 and 1999 the Woodland species population index increased in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the number, East Midlands and the West Midlands. The woodland species population index declined in the East, South East and South West regions. For the five regions where estimates are available, the Farmland species population indices decreased over the period.

 There are no statutory standards for compost, although by virtue of Best Value Indicator BV82b, compost counts towards local authority statutory targets for recycling and composting. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), in close co-operation with the Composting Association, has developed a BSI Publicly Available Specification (PAS) for compost. The delivery of this PAS for compost should help to create markets for organic waste derived products by creating confidence in the product. Achieving the PAS will depend on, for example, the suitability of the feedstock and the composting process used. We expect the EU Commission to issue a proposal for a Bio-waste Directive later this year; this should contain harmonized EU standards for composting.

 There would be no impact to the cost of salaries to core Defra employees by increasing the national minimum wage by the amounts quoted, either nationally or across the Department in total. The minimum salary for a Defra employee is already above the rates quoted. This is a national salary payable to Defra employees across the United Kingdom.

The Council fully supports the efforts of the UN to ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq with all relevant resolutions of the Security Council, in particular with UNSCR 1441 of 8 November 2002. The resolution gives an unambiguous message that the Iraqi government has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully.
<P>
<BR>
 The Council therefore urges the Iraqi authorities to engage in full and active co-operation with UNMOVIC and IAEA. The Iraqi authorities must, as an imperative, provide the inspectors, without delay, with all additional and complete information on questions raised by the international community. The Council expresses its appreciation for the work accomplished by the inspectors so far and reiterates its confidence and full support for Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei to complete their mission in accordance with UNSCR 1441. It welcomes their intention to continue and intensify their operations.
<P>
<BR>
 The Council recalls that it stands ready to engage all necessary efforts to answer the needs of UNMOVIC and IAEA in personnel and practical means.
<P>
<BR>
 The Council underlines the fundamental importance of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in accordance with the relevant international instruments. The Security Council has a key role to play in these endeavours.
<P>

 The Council reaffirms the role of the UNSC in the implementation of UNSCR 1441. The responsibility of the UNSC in maintaining international peace and security must be respected."

 The most recently published guidance is Health Service Circular 1999/018. This explains that refugees or persons applying for asylum in the United Kingdom are regarded as ordinarily resident. They are therefore eligible to register with a general practitioner or personal medical services pilot provider for national health service primary care services.
<P>

<a name="30129w09.html_para7">Primary care trusts are responsible for securing all health services for their populations. In doing this they will continually assess whether or not the current configuration of primary care services matches the need of the current population.

 Emergency service personnel will play a central role in dealing with any possible contamination, in the event of a potential attack using biological agents. To this end all the 'blue light' emergency services have been provided with suitable personal protective equipment to protect them against the effects of contamination in the event of a bio-terrorism attack. Protocols for washing down and decontamination of emergency service and national service personnel, the public and premises have been developed with the fire service. The NHS already has in place sound working procedures to deal with biological agents, the spread of infectious diseases and to deal with contaminated equipment and premises. The advice of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens will be sought on how to tackle any new risks from dangerous pathogens should they emerge.

European Union legislation on tobacco advertising, having strong domestic legislation in place. He made clear the Government's determination to ensure the legal victories secured by the tobacco companies over previous European legislation would not be repeated with this Directive. He therefore voted against the Directive because he did not think that the drafting of some provisions was good enough or that it went as far as it could in some areas (for example by not covering cigarette papers).

Others supported the Commission. Most felt that Member States should appoint at least one member to the management board. Many were willing to consider also accepting representatives of patient groups or the European Parliament. A majority of Member States and the Commission were able to accept the Presidency compromise of a single renewal of an authorisation after five years.

 There are no plans to vaccinate the whole population as a contingency measure against the threat of a bio-terrorist incident involving smallpox. Mass vaccination of the population could be justifiable if there was a smallpox attack or outbreak but it would not be acceptable to expose people to the risk of vaccination in the absence of any possible exposure to the smallpox virus. This is consistent with the approach recommended by the World Health Organisation.

It is estimated that around 77 per cent. of refusals of applications made in 2001 resulted in an appeal, and that around a fifth of those appeals were allowed. The appeals allowed figures given in the following table do not necessarily relate to the refusals in the same year. These could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.

The purpose of the new policy is to ensure that those wishing to seek asylum do so at the earliest opportunity. If this purpose is fulfilled, there is no reason to suppose that there will be an increase in the number of homeless people. Since 8 January 2003, when the new policy was introduced, there has been no indication of increased homelessness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w15.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research was undertaken by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> Capita to determine the <i>(i)</i> likely level of demand for Criminal Records Bureau checks and (ii) Criminal Records Bureau customers' preferred means of submitting applications for checks. [89984]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w15.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Original research into the likely level of demand for Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks was undertaken by the Home Office and CRB. Two comprehensive market research studies were carried out by Coopers Lybrand (1996) and Accent Market Research (March 2000) to determine who would use the service and what likely levels of take up were anticipated. These studies were validated by the Labour Force Survey carried out between September and November 1999. A telephone survey with existing checkers was carried out to validate the baseline information created from the above research. In December 2001, Capita Account Managers conducted their own research to determine which Registered Bodies were likely to be major users of the service and there is ongoing joint Capita and CRB forecasting work based on latest actual demand and outputs from a forecasting model.
<P>

<a name="30129w15.html_para0">An analysis of legislation and its likely impact on CRB demand was also undertaken. The analysis looked at whether or not legislation would increase the number of sectors eligible for CRB checks or whether or not the impact would be neutral. It was determined that the outcome was likely to be neutral.
<P>

<a name="30129w15.html_para1">The original concept for the CRB was based on a call-centre, telephone-based and online application route, with capacity to deal with individual paper applications. That arrangement was expected to be convenient for applicants and would reduce errors. It was also in line with the Government's e-government objectives. Market research was undertaken by Rosslyn Research in 2000 to establish employer's requirements in terms of service standards.
<P>

<a name="30129w15.html_para2">However, during extensive consultation with registered bodies and employers from January to June 2001, there was strong pressure from them to introduce a full-scale paper-based application. Consequently, in May 2001, the CRB agreed to introduce more extensive capacity to deal with paper-based applications.

<a name="30129w16.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Children Act 1989 requires that the court's paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child. Judges are guided by a list of factors set out in section 1(3) of the Act, known as the 'welfare checklist'. The court has the discretion to take into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the individual case when deciding any question concerning the child, including issues of contact and residence.
<P>

<a name="30129w16.html_para5">Any person (including grandparents) may, provided that the permission of the court is obtained, apply to the court for an order for residence or contact with a child. This requirement is designed as an early filter for those applications the court feels would not to be in the best interests of the child. Experience suggests that grandparents (or other interested relatives) do not

usually experience difficulty in obtaining permission where their application is motivated by a genuine concern for the child.

<a name="30129w16.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what proposals she has to ensure that grandparents have increased legal rights of access to their grandchildren; and what other rights grandparents have in the event of family breakdown. [93550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w16.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The current requirement is for grandparents to obtain the leave of the court to issue an application for contact with grandchildren. Experience has shown that grandparents, or wider family members, do not usually experience difficulty in obtaining leave when the application is motivated by genuine concern for the child. Consequently, there are no plans to amend the Children Act 1989. In the event of a family dispute, any person, including grandparents, with a contact order can apply to the court to determine the implementation or variation of the existing order.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w19.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The UK can expect to gain from commitments taken by other WTO Members, as this will provide a more stable and competitive environment for UK companies seeking to expand into new markets. Similarly, for developing countries, GATS commitments should help to attract foreign participation in their markets and bring new investment and technology, while commitments by developed countries should confirm market access for service sectors and modes of supply (notably movement of people) of interest to them.
<P>

<a name="30129w19.html_para7">Liberalisation is always a domestic policy choice. Governments will always weigh the risks and benefits in their assessment of what is in their overall interest. GATS negotiations cannot and will not force countries to make commitments where they choose not to do so.

This may include some measures to promote indigenous industrial development. But the evidence of the benefits of specific tariff protection is mixed so the Government do not see it as a particularly useful tool to foster economic growth and therefore poverty reduction.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency is working to achieve the Government's commitment to deliver the target of resurfacing 60% of the trunk road and motorway network with low noise surfacing by 2011. This includes resurfacing all concrete roads. Within Hull and the East Riding there are two sections of concrete roads, both on the M62 Motorway, between Gilberdyke and Newport, and Balkholme and Gilberdyke. Some preliminary design work has been undertaken on schemes for these sections of road. There is also a section of concrete carriageway on the Ml8 Motorway between Junctions 6 and 7, which falls partly within the East Riding. The timing of resurfacing work will depend on when road maintenance is required.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, the Agency regularly reviews the trunk road and motorway network to identify the need for maintenance. At present, we envisage undertaking the following maintenance schemes within the next four years and will be considering the use of quieter surfaces:</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what reasons underlie the reduction in expenditure by the Office of Government Commerce between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03; and if he will make a statement.  [93441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The level of resource consumption estimated for 2001 -02 for the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) in the latest H.M. Treasury Departmental Report (Cm5425) was &pound;88 million, reducing to a planned -&pound;5million in 2002&#150;03. The actual level of resource consumption in 2001&#150;02 was &pound;6million. The change between the estimated and actual outturns for 2001&#150;02 is largely accounted for by a revaluation to and change in timing of the run down of some of the provisions the OGC holds in respect of its obligation to dispose of the Government's remaining surplus Residual Civil Estate. The change in the timing will also affect the outturn for 2002&#150;03 where it is now anticipated that the likely outturn will be some &pound;50 million. Such fluctuations in the valuations of and timing for the sale of the remaining surplus Estate, which reflect market conditions and opportunities, can be expected to continue in the future, although on a smaller scale as the size of the remaining Residual Estate continues to reduce. The actual change in resource consumption between years also reflects a reduction in the level of income the OGC generates .

 The Sandler review of the market for medium and long-term retail savings, which was published last July, recommended two changes to the regime for taxing life insurance products. These changes are the abolition of qualifying policies and the replacement of the so-called 5 per cent. tax-deferral rule which applies to withdrawals.

In the 2001&#150;02 session, 4,618 of the 5,888 written questions to the Treasury (78.4 per cent.) received substantive replies on or before the due date for answering. 111 (1.9 per cent. of the total) had not been answered within two weeks, 57 (1.0 per cent.) within one month and 43 (0.7 per cent.) within three months. In the 2002[en rule]03 session to date, 76.7 per cent. of all written questions have been answered on time.

 In December 2002 the Department issued a revised disciplinary policy to all staff which outlined the guidelines to be issued in all cases of serious and minor misconduct, including internal fraud. The policy is supported by separate guidance produced for individuals and managers and includes categories of disciplinary offences and the range and duration of penalties.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> The objective of our policies is to help jobless people, particularly the most disadvantaged, move into and remain in employment. Initiatives such as the New Deals and Work Based Learning for Adults are helping to achieve this. Some of those helped into work by government programmes may change their jobs or occupations at a later date. However, the skills and confidence they have gained through participation in our programmes will stand them in good stead in the current dynamic labour market. Success, therefore, should be measured by the improvement in the level of employment. This has increased by 1.3 million since 1997 and now stands at 27.8 million.
<P>

<a name="30129w23.html_para2">There has been no specific research into the length of time individuals stay in a particular occupation after receiving Government subsidised training. However, we have commissioned a study into Work Based Learning for Adults that will examine the impact of a subsidised training programme on client outcomes.

 We have committed to a target of paying pension credit to at least three million pensioner households by 2006. We have already shortened the minimum income guarantee claim form from 40 to 10 pages. We are designing the pension credit application process to be even simpler, including use of the telephone for most applications. The number of questions that a pensioner is required to answer in order to assess their eligibility to pension credit will depend on their individual circumstances.

<a name="30129w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We uprate State Pensions for British citizens living overseas where there is a legal requirement or a reciprocal social security agreement to do so.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para3">The UK has a reciprocal agreement with Barbados that provides for British pensioners living in that country to be paid the same rate of State Pension as would be paid if they lived in the UK. However, although there is a social security arrangement with the Canadian Government, it does not allow for the payment of UK benefits to persons in Canada and contains no similar provision on the uprating of State Pensions.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para4">The uprating of State Pensions abroad is the subject of a Court of Appeal hearing set for 24&#150;25 March 2003. This is an appeal against the High Court's finding that the UK Government are not in breach of the European

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what discussions he has had with interested groups on plans to make the retirement age for men and women equal.  [87364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The UK has a fixed age for eligibility to State Pension (currently 60 for women and 65 for men, although to be equalised at 65 for both sexes as from 2020). We do not have a national mandatory retirement age. Sex discrimination legislation prohibits employers from setting different retirement ages for men and women.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para5">A variety of representations have been received from a range of organisations and individuals about the equalisation of State Pension Age, the bulk of which would have been dealt with at the time of the previous administration. A discussion document &quot;Options for Equality in State Pension Age" was published in December 1991. A White Paper &quot;Equality in State Pension Age" followed in December 1993.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para6">Plans to equalise the State Pension age progressively over the period 2010 to 2020, were enacted by the 1995 Pensions Act.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para7">We are also committed to implementing the age strand of the European Employment Directive by 2006, when domestic legislation will come into force outlawing age discrimination in employment and training. Under the Directive, employers' compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful unless they are objectively justified.

[91403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 In March 1997, Transco was registered with Corgi and all its emergency service operatives were deemed to hold valid certification under the Health and Safety Commission's Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) scheme, the sole means of demonstrating safety competence then in force. As this certification was valid for five years, no action could have been taken against Transco up to March 2002.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para8">If Transco were to breach legal requirements in this area, there is a range of enforcement action available to HSE under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1994, ranging from the provision of advice to the serving of an enforcement notice and, ultimately, prosecution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30129w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Since 1998, competency standards have been incorporated in the Nationally Accredited Certification Scheme for Individual Gas Fitting Operatives (ACS). However, a new National Vocational Qualification, developed by the Gas and Water Industries National Training Organisation (GWINTO), was launched in 2002, and includes competence assessments that, with regard to gas safety matters, are aligned with those of the ACS.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para9">Transco has a duty to meet the requirements of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 with regard to gas work downstream of the emergency control valve immediately before the meter. It has to ensure that its operatives who undertake this work are competent to do it safely. The accepted means for determining competence is for operatives to be assessed against recognised national standards on a five-yearly cycle. Standards were originally set under a Health and Safety Commission Approved Code of Practice (ACOP). All Transco engineers engaged in safety work in domestic premises hold valid certificates of competence under one or other of these schemes, and accordingly, meet the registration conditions laid down by the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI).

 The percentage of work performed by non-Transco employees may vary and is not prescribed in Transco's safety case. However, the safety case contains details of Transco's health and safety management system, which includes arrangements for the management of contractors.
<P>

<a name="30129w24.html_para10">Both Transco and their contractors have a statutory responsibility for ensuring work carried out is such that it will not, so far as is reasonably practicable, expose either its own employees or others to risks to their health and safety.
