To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to consult on the new set of initiatives in health, education and the environment to be funded by the National Lottery through the New Opportunities Fund.  [61785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Today I have published and laid before Parliament a consultation document, 'New Links for the Lottery'. Copies are widely available from my Department and through The Stationery Office.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para0">I believe that the Lottery's long-term success depends on retaining and reinforcing public confidence in its power to address the issues that most concern people across the UK. The initiatives we are proposing--cancer prevention, detection, treatment and care; green spaces and sustainable communities; and community access to lifelong learning--demonstrate our commitment to see the benefits of Lottery money more widely spread. The document also contains proposals to increase the number of summer school places for school children, to increase the benefits to people with disabilities and to build on the contribution the Lottery can make to volunteering and community involvement. I believe that our proposals will receive widespread support, and I look forward to receiving views on how best to take them forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Viggers: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General for what reasons he decided that it was not in the public interest to prosecute following an investigation into the circumstances of the disposal of clinical waste at Royal Hospital, Haslar.  [61031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The investigation by the Ministry of Defence police to which the hon. Member refers commenced with the arrest and initial interviews of 



<P>
<P><I>27 Nov 1998 : Column: 18</I><P>
2 suspects on 15 April 1997. Following further inquiries, they were charged on 1 December 1997 with offences of corruption and bailed to appear at Fareham Magistrates Court on 2 February 1998. However, the case had not been fully prepared for committal by the time of a hearing on 18 June 1998 and the court discharged the 2 defendants.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para1">On 10 September 1998 my office received from the Crown Prosecution Service a request for consent to proceed against the two defendants for offences under Section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906; a case may not proceed beyond committal until such consent has been given.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para2">In considering the application, I was mindful of the history of the case. I weighed the seriousness of the alleged offences (including the loss alleged to have been suffered by the Ministry of Defence and the alleged benefits to the defendants) against the fact that the defendants had already faced court proceedings stretching over some 7 months. Almost 3 months further had elapsed. I formed a provisional view that the circumstances were not such as to justify the institution of a further prosecution. I caused inquiries to be made to ascertain what, if any, disciplinary action had been taken against the Ministry of Defence employee involved. I learned that he had been dismissed. I therefore declined to consent.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the revenue forgone as a result of 



<P>
<P><I>27 Nov 1998 : Column: 20</I><P>
HM Customs and Excise's decision not to recover VAT wrongly charged to 1 January 1999 on sweetened dried fruit.  [60876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 On 11 September 1998, HM Customs and Excise announced the outcome of a review which clarifies the VAT liability of sweetened dried fruit. It allows suppliers who received an earlier zero-rated ruling and whose products are now properly standard-rated to apply the liability change from 1 January 1999. The revenue is estimated to be negligible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the revenue which would be raised if naturally sweetened dried fruit with no sweetening matter were subject to VAT at the standard rate.  [60879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Using information on sales of dried fruit, HM Customs and Excise estimate the annual revenue which would be raised to be about &#163;15 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the council meeting of the Economic and Finance Ministers of the European Union held on 23 November.  [61908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I attended the Economic and Finance Council--ECOFIN--of the European Union in Brussels on 23 November. The Economic Secretary accompanied me.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para5">In the context of Agenda 2000, ECOFIN discussed the EC's future financial framework and in particular the stabilisation of EC spending by 2006 at its present real-terms level of around 85 billion euro. There was increasing support for this idea, which the UK supports, not least because it will help prepare the EU for enlargement. We asked that this issue be put on the table for the Vienna European Council. I made it clear that stabilisation was compatible with CAP reform.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para6">The Council discussed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and Own Resources issues. I made clear the UK's willingness to find a package of measures to address other states' large net contributions, whilst making it clear that, in moderating their problems, it would be unjust to make ours worse. Stabilisation of spending should form part of this package. The Presidency undertook to prepare a report of all the Agenda 2000 discussions so far, to be submitted to the European Council at Vienna.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para7">Commissioner Van Miert presented a paper on banks providing services of general economic interest. There was a discussion during which the German delegation said it would pursue the matter bilaterally with the Commission. Commissioner Monti proposed a framework for action in financial services. I make it clear that the UK did not support all aspects of the Commission's paper but welcomed action to improve the single market in financial services. The Council decided that a Financial Services Policy Group should be established, with the personal representatives of Finance Ministers, to identify priorities in improving the Single Market in Financial Services. The Economic Secretary will represent the UK.

<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para8">The Commission introduced the 1999 Employment Guidelines, and the Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee gave his Committee's opinion on the Guidelines. The Council welcomed the Guidelines and the EPC's opinion on them.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para9">The Council discussed the 1999 EC Budget. The Presidency concluded that a number of delegations had stressed the need for budget discipline, and several countries had also expressed concern about adequate funding for structural policies.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para10">The Council discussed measures to take forward the Sound and Efficient Management 2000 initiative. The proposed conclusions were adopted. Commissioner Gradin made a presentation describing the progress made in the Fight against Fraud in recent years. The adoption by Council of the joint guideline on inspections of Community Own Resources was blocked by Spain and is to be remitted to Coreper.
<P>

<a name="81127w01.html_para11">The Council discussed combating the counterfeiting of the euro. The Presidency concluded that the Monetary Committee's recommendations would be adopted as Council conclusions. The Council discussed the issue of collector coins in the euro area. The Presidency adopted the Monetary Committee's recommendations.
<P>

The ONS last published broad splits of "Debt of the public sector: nominal amounts outstanding" in table S1 of <i>Financial Statistics</i> in April 1998.

The largest component is in the form of British Government Securities (total liability about &#163;280 billion) of which about a half are held by UK life assurance and pension funds, and about &#163;55 billion are held abroad. National savings are held by UK households and account for more than &#163;60 billion.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and I have decided on twelve areas to pilot the Single Work Focused Gateway.
<P>

<a name="81127w03.html_para3">From June 1999, Essex South East, Warwickshire, Clyde Coast & Renfrew and Lea Roding (East London) will be the first pilot areas. From November 1999 Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Gwent Borders and Calderdale & Kirklees will test the benefits call centre technology can bring to the Gateway process. At the same time, private or voluntary sector providers will be invited to lead pilots in Suffolk, North Nottinghamshire, Leeds and North Cheshire to test out whether they can bring extra value through innovative approaches to the Gateway.
<P>

<a name="81127w03.html_para4">These twelve pilot areas will play a vital part in the development of a new welfare state based on rights and responsibilities--work for those who can and support for those who cannot. They will also be at the forefront of providing the excellent service to clients that we are determined to provide.
<P>

<a name="81127w03.html_para5">The Single Gateway marks a step change in our welfare system. Currently, our system puts clients in boxes, depending on whether they are unemployed, lone parents, carers or face illness or disability. Under the Gateway, after an initial 'registration and orientation' phase, all clients will be allocated a personal adviser. The adviser will be responsible for working with individual clients to establish their individual needs and provide them with the help they need to become independent and move towards work. Of course, for some clients--such as the recently bereaved--it may not be appropriate to have an initial focus on work. In these cases, the personal adviser will keep the case under review and contact the client at a more appropriate stage to discuss their needs. The

<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There are no current plans to invite claims to Income Support (IS) when an award of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) has been made. DLA provides a contribution towards the extra costs associated with disability. When a claim to DLA is received from a 



<P>
<P><I>27 Nov 1998 : Column: 27</I><P>
customer there is insufficient data to indicate whether the customer would be entitled to IS. However, the leaflet issued with DLA award notices contains information about other benefits, including Income Support.

 We have concluded and made clear in the Green Paper "New Ambitions for our Country: A New Contract For Welfare" (Cm 3805) that Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance will remain universal, national benefits and as such they will not be subject to a means test.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has for benefits for those who are severely disabled and are older than 20 years of age.  [60915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The proposals for the reform of Severe Disablement Allowance (SDA) as set out in the Consultation Paper--"Support for Disabled People", would apply to new claims only. Existing SDA recipients aged 20 or over at the point of change would be protected and continue to receive benefit as now. Under the new arrangements, people who become severely disabled after the age of 20 would no longer be able to claim SDA.
<P>

<a name="81127w03.html_para7">However, around 70 per cent. of those currently receiving SDA also receive Income Support (IS) and it is likely that the same proportion would continue to qualify for IS following the introduction of the proposals. This group would, therefore, see no change to their overall level of income. Disability Living Allowance is also available to help with the additional costs of disability.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w03.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Fyfe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what plans he has for the relative levels of <i>(a)</i> disability living allowance and <i>(b)</i> incapacity benefit; and what decisions he has made about the minimum level of each;  [60914]

<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Disability Living Allowance and Incapacity Benefit are awarded where specific entitlement conditions are met. There is no relationship between the relative levels of the benefits. There are no plans to change the amounts of the benefits, but they will continue to be reviewed as part of the normal uprating process.

1. Incapacity Benefit replaced Sickness Benefit and Invalidity Benefit in April 1995. All existing recipients at that date became Incapacity Benefit recipients.<P>

2. Figures include 11,000 Severe Disablement Allowance recipients.<P>

3. Other pensions includes Widows, Trade Union and Friendly Society pensions and Annuities regulated by the Pensions Act 1995 but not purchased with tax relieved pension savings.<P>

4. Some Incapacity Benefit recipients will receive both occupational and personal/other pensions. Aggregating occupational and other pension income causes some cases to be shifted into a different band, consequently the total in the third column is not the sum of the first two.<P>

5. Figures include a number of former Invalidity Benefit recipients above State pension age who were able to elect to remain on benefit for up to 5 years. From April 1995 Incapacity Benefit is not payable above State pension age.<P>

6. No existing recipient of Incapacity Benefit at the point of change will have their entitlement affected by the proposal to take some account of occupational and personal pension income above &#163;50 a week in assessing future Incapacity Benefit claims.<P>

<a name="81127w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Incapacity Benefit is a contributory benefit to help replace the income of people unable to work because of an illness or disability. It is paid to people who have the necessary National Insurance contributions and who pass the appropriate test of incapacity.
<P>

<a name="81127w03.html_para8">Disability Living Allowance is a non-means-tested, non-contributory benefit which can be claimed by people aged under 65 for extra care or mobility needs arising from their disability.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="81127w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Carers currently have to pay a minimum amount of National Insurance contributions at some point prior to the claim, in order to qualify for Incapacity Benefit. This will continue to be the case in the future. However, as we made clear in our consultation paper "A New Contract for Welfare: Support for Disabled People" we are planning to modify the proposed new contribution test so that carers who received Invalid Care Allowance 



<P>
<P><I>27 Nov 1998 : Column: 29</I><P>
are not disadvantaged because they were unable to pay contributions due to their caring responsibilities in one of the two tax years before the claim.

<a name="81127w05.html_para2">The Council agreed to tighten the rules on government aid to industry. A new Regulation will codify the existing Commission procedures for the control of state aid and it will also strengthen the ability of the Commission both to recover aid paid illegally and to undertake on-site monitoring of companies receiving state aid. The Commission agreed to publish final state aid decisions in all the languages of the <i>Official Journal</i> and to take a formal decision before compelling a company to co-operate where it refused to allow on-site monitoring. With these two amendments, all outstanding reserves were lifted. The Presidency concluded that a political agreement had been reached on the text of the Regulation while the Council awaited the opinion of the European Parliament.

The Commission also proposed a closer working-level dialogue in eight key sectors, including coal, steel and automotive industries, which could provide analysis of the CEEs' progress. The Presidency concluded that this should be followed up and that there was a general consensus for increasing bilateral contacts and advice to the applicants.

 When I announced the Urban White Paper on 20 October 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1064, I said I would be making an announcement shortly about our policies for rural areas.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para5">We have introduced a range of new policies to implement our commitment to sustainable development and to foster a modern, inclusive society with fairness and opportunity for all. Rural communities are an integral part of our vision with the whole country and are already benefiting from our new approach. Our manifesto pledges on education, health, crime and the economy apply just as much to rural areas as to urban. Rural areas have many distinctive features and needs. In our Manifesto, we pledged to recognise these special needs and to stop the decline in rural public and transport services, give greater protection to wildlife, and give greater freedom for people to explore our open countryside.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para6">Already we have taken action to support these pledges. We have given an extra &#163;50 million a year to rural transport; given greater protection to the countryside by 



<P>
<P><I>27 Nov 1998 : Column: 39</I><P>
increasing the target for housing development on brownfield sites; and announced our decision to bring together the Rural Development Commission and Countryside Commission to create the new Countryside Agency to champion rural England and the English countryside. As a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, expenditure on DETR countryside programmes will increase very significantly--from &#163;128 million this year to &#163;174 million in 2001-02. We are committed to restoring confidence in the farming industry and have just announced an additional aid package for the UK livestock sector that will be worth some &#163;120 million. We have also secured the lifting of the ban on beef exports. At a regional level, the new Regional Development Agencies will bring a more strategic approach to regional development taking full account of their rural areas.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para7">As our range of new policies bear fruit, we are determined to ensure that they come together in a holistic way to fit rural circumstances. Our vision is of a living, working, accessible and sustainable countryside, with thriving rural communities where public services are properly supported, which is contributing fully to the life and economy of the nation, and where the natural and cultural heritage is conserved and enhanced for everyone to enjoy.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para8">We now propose to set out more details of our vision, and what we are doing to achieve it in a White Paper on rural England. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have therefore agreed that preparation of this new White Paper will be led jointly by our two Departments. We will also be working closely with colleagues in many other Departments to ensure that Government activity across the board is tailored and integrated to reflect rural circumstances and the distinctive contribution that rural areas make to all our lives. We will be involving the Countryside Agency and the Regional Development Agencies in drawing up the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para9">The White Paper will explore how our policies on matters such as the economy, health, transport, education, housing, crime, agriculture, energy efficiency and planning will support sustainable rural communities and how rural areas can contribute to the fulfilment of the government's objectives in these matters, and give rural people the opportunity to participate fully in our society. It will examine the way we are conserving and enhancing the countryside as a resource and amenity for all to appreciate and enjoy. Most importantly, it will consider how our overall environmental, social and economic objectives will be integrated in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para10">The White Paper will assess what more needs to be done by government, other organisation and individuals. We are determined to ensure that the links between towns, cities and rural areas are properly considered. Work on the Rural White Paper will complement that on the Urban White Paper.
<P>

<a name="81127w06.html_para11">There has already been much debate about the countryside. We will continue to listen to views and engage in discussions as we prepare the White Paper. I am sure many organisations and people will wish to contribute.

 I understand that specific times are not yet available, but that London Underground are currently working on the timetable. Details will be made available to the public in advance of the line opening. First and last train times will be similar to those already in operation on the Jubilee Line and elsewhere on the Underground network (i.e. between approximately 0500hrs and 0045hrs, with slightly later opening times on Sundays).

 Underground station opening times are a matter for London Underground Limited.

On that basis, stations will open between approximately 0500hrs and 0045hrs. Opening times are slightly later on Sundays.

 This information is not available in the form requested. As I said in my answer to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) of 17 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>744-45</i>, the delivery of new trains was delayed by more than a year. This was due to design changes specified by London Underground and production problems at ALSTOM's train-building plant.
<P>

<a name="81127w08.html_para1">There have been a number of other problems including the computer software on trains, a delay in delivering the train simulator (and subsequent delays to driver training) and delays in proving that all train systems, such as the CCTV link to train drivers, are operationally satisfactory and reliable. In testing and commissioning new trains, snagging problems arise on each train and are addressed on an on-going basis.
<P>

<a name="81127w08.html_para2">ALSTOM and London Underground are working together to introduce the trains at as fast a rate as possible, and London Underground expects that a full Northern Line service will be provided with new trains by early autumn 1999.

 Such figures could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. They would depend critically on the assumptions made, especially about trip length. (For example, average trip length varies by line: if all customers were to travel just one stop more could be carried than if they all travelled several stops.)
