 There is currently no standardised approach to information collection and needs assessment for the receipt of housing-related support through the supporting people programme. Nor are there currently standardised arrangements which cover supporting people and care assessments together. Arrangements are instead set by, and vary between, local authorities and between providers. There may be some duplication between the information collected for supporting people services and that collected through the Single Assessment Process, but in some cases this is already being handled in an integrated way.

 Supporting people is a grant programme for the provision of housing-related support services (or, in excellent authorities, welfare services). It does not fund health or care services. The power of the Secretary of State to issue guidance relates to the administration and application of supporting people grants and, as such, guidance on the use of supporting people funding does not directly discuss meeting health or care related needs.

Notes:<br>

1. More up-to-date figures on the cost of the contracted-out rebate are available but the most recent for the GDP are those published in the Quinquennial Review of the National Insurance Fund. For comparison purposes it has been necessary, therefore, to use the same source for the cost of the rebate.<br>

2. Costs are for GB receipts and are in 2003&#150;04 prices terms&#151;the basis for projections in the Quinquennial Review of the National Insurance Fund.<br>

3. The Quinquennial Review does not extend to the Northern Ireland Insurance Fund so the figures provided are for GB rather than the UK.<br>

This flexible framework will give trustees greater leverage in framing the scheme&#039;s funding strategy and determining the contributions paid by the employer. In addition, from 6 April 2006 current HM Revenue and Customs requirements for pension schemes to reduce an actuarial surplus will be abolished. This will remove a factor which may have played a part in some decisions to allow pension fund contribution holidays in the past. We do not believe, however, that it would be appropriate to prevent a contribution holiday where the scheme is sufficiently well-funded, and the trustees and the sponsoring employer consider that it is appropriate in the circumstances.

Prior to the introduction of stakeholder pensions in April 2001, the Government advised that it would undertake a review of a number of provisions contained in the Stakeholder Pension Regulations 2000 after they had been in operation for three years. This review was concluded in October 2004, and after careful consideration, it was decided that no changes were necessary at that time. It was, however, recognised that developments in train in the wider pensions field might have a bearing on those provisions and that it might be necessary to look at them again at some point over the coming years.

<p>
<a name="51214w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_59">Following the Sandier report in July 2002, which looked at medium and long-term retail savings in the UK, we reviewed the stakeholder pensions charge cap. This resulted in the annual management charge being revised from 1 per cent. of the value of the fund a year to 1.5 per cent. for the first 10 years of membership, reducing to 1 per cent. thereafter for stakeholder pension policies bought on or after 6 April 2005. We also introduced the requirement for providers to offer lifestyling, the process where at least five years before retirement the members pension savings are gradually moved into less volatile arrangements.

Responses to the recent public consultation on &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, DEFRA&#039;s developing new Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management, reinforced the need to continue this area of investigation alongside consideration of how other rural land management techniques might contribute to managing flood risk.

<a name="stpa_31">The Department has since 1989 issued precautionary guidance on the climate change impacts that should be taken into account when designing flood and coastal erosion risk management measures. This was last updated in 2003 to take account of the UKCIP 2002 scenarios and other specific research on river and coastal impacts. The guidance is kept under review in the light of emerging research results; for example, those presented by leading experts at DEFRA&#039;s conference on &#039;Dangerous Climate Change&#039;, held in Exeter in early 2005. In developing our new Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management&#151;Making Space for Water-we have made a specific commitment to review our guidance in 2007. To support this review DEFRA has just commissioned a major piece of research over a 30 month period to understand, better the potential impacts on river flow of a range of future climate scenarios.

 Farmers&#039; markets, which this Department has responsibility for, are an important outlet for local food producers, with the added advantage that the direct sales they can stimulate leave producers with a bigger share of the retail price. They have been shown to help bring life back into town centres and to stimulate trade in surrounding shops on days when they are held. They can also play a part in reinstating a more individual character to the local area, where high street uniformity has possibly crept in, and in restoring a more traditional &#039;market town&#039; atmosphere.

 CPS Essex performance data for the second quarter of 2005&#150;06 shows improvements across a range of key indicators (measuring delivery of services to the public).

This equates to an overall performance improvement from the first quarter of 2005&#150;06 and suggests improved delivery of Area business.

 We aim to develop a more improved approach to training and testing. This will be based on research. To this end my Department has recently let two contracts. One is about improving the delivery of road safety education. The other is a review of pre-driver education, which will study the attitudes and influences on driving style that are developed at a young age and before any formal training is undertaken.

If this proposal was consistent with the European Court of Justice&#039;s judgement of 13 September and if it was adopted by the Council (or the Council and Parliament in the case of co-decision), then member States would be obliged to implement the directive. Directives that are intended to confer rights on individuals can in some circumstances be relied upon in national courts by those individuals against the state where the state has failed to implement the directive by the prescribed implementation date, i.e. may give rise to direct effect. These conditions, however, would not be satisfied by the provisions of a directive which were concerned with the establishment of criminal offences rather than the creation of rights for individuals.

Companies who decide to carry out private venture work at their own risk do so as part of their normal business.

 The Ministry of Defence&#039;s approach to the assessment of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss in the War Pensions Scheme reflects that of the Government as a whole and is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts including an Industrial Injuries Advisory Council review. The Ministry of Defence also routinely scrutinises the published peer reviewed literature to ensure that compensation policy and approaches continue to take account of contemporary evidence.

<a name="stpa_74">The threshold for compensation for noise-induced hearing loss was introduced into the War Pensions Scheme in 1993. The Government consulted the Central Advisory Committee on War Pensions on this change which formed part of a wider package of changes that included the removal of rank differentials from war disablement pensions and increases in the rate of disablements pensions above the rate of inflation; the most severely disabled other ranks gained most from these increases. The Central Advisory Committee is a statutory body whose role is to consider matters put before it by the Minister. It includes members from the principle ex-service organisations including those representing disabled veterans.

The specific requirements for ISD and IOC will vary between projects depending on the nature of the role and the equipment in question, and are agreed at the point when the main investment decision is taken (referred to as Main Gate).

 It is too early to be precise about the impact on staffing levels. For planning purposes, we assume that collocation will lead to a reduction of at least 240 civilian and 100 military posts. However, the Army is still determining the possible size and structure of the new HQ organisation and we are unlikely to make an announcement until late 2006. Similarly, project costs and the budget for Project Hyperion continue to be refined and will be confirmed at Main Gate, which is unlikely to occur before November 2006.

The main projects involved funding &#163;180,000 towards the provision of 25,000 transparent ballot boxes with tamper-proof coded seals and &#163;22,000 for the publication of the Cameroonian National Election Observatory&#039;s report, to demonstrate that the organisation was able to carry out a critical analysis of the electoral process. In common with other diplomatic missions, the British high commission sent out a team of 12 to observe the elections in five of the ten provinces. We co-ordinated closely with our EU, G8 and Commonwealth partners. We intend to continue such observation in the future.

<p>
<a name="51214w27.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_132">The Cameroonian Government has recognised the need to reform the electoral law and we remain committed to assisting, principally through the Commonwealth. Our priorities are to see a revised electoral code and the introduction of an Independent Electoral Commission to organise future elections, which will support the development of a multi-party democracy in Cameroon.

 The value of catering contracts let by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) for the current financial year (2005&#150;06) in relation to the provision of catering and canteen facilities at its offices in London and Milton Keynes amounts to &#163;1,625,096.

 The Government support the decision of the European Council in December 2003 to review the EU Arms Embargo on China. This review is ongoing&#151;it was last discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 13 December. The Government do not wish to exclude any options for the review, nor to pre-empt the conclusion of the review. There is no consensus at present in the EU for lifting the embargo. Further consultations in the EU and with other international partners are necessary before any decision is taken. The European Council Conclusions in December 2004 stated that any decision on the arms embargo would not result in an increase of arms exports to China in either quantitative or qualitative terms.

 The Government have not made representations to the Chinese Government about China&#039;s right or need to implement family planning policies. We believe that China&#039;s family planning policies should be based on the principle of consent, and not coercion, as espoused by the International Conference on Population and Development. In this context, we are concerned about reports of enforced sterilisation and abortion. The EU, under the UK&#039;s presidency, raised the case of Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer who revealed information about forced abortions and sterilisations in Linyi City, Shandong Province, with the Chinese Government in October and November. We will continue to raise our concerns where appropriate.

<p><a name="st_146"><a name="51214w28.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 Through our embassy in Bogota, and also through the EU, we regularly impress on the Colombian Government the need to investigate thoroughly all human rights abuses and, where there is sufficient evidence, to prosecute those deemed responsible, regardless of their background, in accordance with the relevant Colombian laws. We reinforce this message in contact with visiting Colombian Ministers to London and the Colombian embassy, most recently in the meeting between my noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Triesman of Tottenham) and the Colombian Vice-President on 28 November. We have urged the Government to crack down even harder on impunity and instances of collusion between state forces and officials and illegal armed groups. There has been some improvement in this regard.

 The UK supports the position set out in the EU Ministerial Council Conclusions of 3 October, available at http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms&#95;Data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/86442.pdf. These conclusions highlight several defects in the Justice and Peace Law and note the concerns expressed by some observers that the law does not take into sufficient account the principles of truth, justice and reparation in accordance with internationally agreed standards. Nevertheless, the Council believes that if the law is effectively and transparently implemented, it will make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia.

 The British Government welcomed the decision to open the crossing point at Ledra Street and we are therefore disappointed that difficulties have arisen. In our view, these provide a worrying example of the lack of trust between the parties in Cyprus. The deeper causes of the Ledra Street controversy can only be addressed through a meaningful process of negotiation aimed at a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. In the meantime, we strongly support the conduct of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) over Ledra Street, and its efforts to convert the current controversy into a genuine confidence building measure.

improving the basic skill levels of 2.25 million adults between the launch of &#039;Skills for Life&#039; in 2001 and 2010, with a milestone of 1.5 million in 2007; and reducing by at least 40 percent. the number of adults in the workforce who lack NVQ 2 or equivalent qualifications by 2010.<br>
Working towards this, one million adults in the workforce to achieve level 2 between 2003 and 2006.</td><td class="tabletext">The first part of this target covers those aged 16 and above in England, who have left compulsory education excluding those in school sixth forms.<br>
The target refers to individuals significantly improving their basic skills. This could be through public or privately supported provision. Publicly supported provision is largely funded by the Learning and Skills Council, but also includes provision through, Jobcentre Plus, the Prison Service and other Government funded routes. The LSC are also proposing to have this target.<br>
Improvement refers to the individual passing an appropriate attainment threshold in:<br>
Literacy, Numeracy or ESOL at Entry Level 3, Level 1or Level 2 mapped to the National Standards developed by the Qualification and Curriculum Authority.<br>
Key Skills test in Application of Number or Communication at Levels 1 or 2<br>
GCSEs in Maths or English.<br>
There will be portfolio-based assessment for some, especially those at the lowest skill levels. The target refers to numbers of adults not qualifications.<br>
Progress will be monitored through collation of administrative statistics on recruitment, retention and achievement from the Learning and Skills Council and other relevant sources. This data will be received quarterly. Additional sources include quarterly data of learning within the Prison Service and Jobcentre Plus. To improve timeliness, quarterly administrative statistics on qualifications will also be collected directly from Awarding Bodies. This will also be used to verify LSC, Prison Service and Jobcentre Plus achievements, assess the coverage of these sources and allow adjustments for under-coverage.<br>
The time lag between qualifications and data collected by the LSC is about six months and for Awarding Body data is about three months.<br>
The target period began on 1 April 2001 and ends on 31 July 2010 at the end of the academic year 2009/10. Final data on achievement will be available in Autumn 2010. A milestone of 1.5 million achievements by 2007 will be reported against in Autumn 2007.<br>
The second part of the PSA target covers attainment of all economically active adults in England between the ages of 18&#150;64 (males) or 18&#150;59 (females). Economically active adults, who also constitute what is meant by &quot;the workforce&quot;, are either employees, self-employed or unemployed 



according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition and thus actively seeking work.<br>
Progress towards the target will  be measured in terms of the increase in the number of economically active adults with a level 2 or higher qualification between 2001 and 2010.<br>
The data used to monitor progress towards achieving the target come from the Autumn quarter of the LFS (available in January of the following year).<br>
All achievements recorded through the LFS, whether gained through public or private investment, will count towards the target This reflects the nature of the target as a shared ambition, whose achievement is dependent not just on Government interventions and funds but also on the voluntary actions of employers and individuals choosing to spend time and private resources on achieving qualifications.<br>
The baseline for 2010 is the Autumn 2001 LFS figure (when 16.0 million economically active adults had at least a level 2 qualification whilst 7.1 million were below level 2). After allowing for the estimated increase in the size of the workforce between 2001 and 2010, achievement of a 40 percent. reduction in the numbers without a level 2 requires an additional 3.6 million first level 2 or higher qualifications over that period. From spring 2007 the LFS is likely to change from being a seasonal quarterly survey to calendar quarters. The 4th quarter (sampling in October, November and December) will provide the closest comparison to the old Autumn quarter (sampling in September, October and November) used to set the target baseline. Therefore the final target outturn will be assessed using the 4th quarter of the 2010 LFS.<br>
The baseline for the 2006 milestone target is autumn 2002 to be assessed against the autumn 2006 quarter of the LFS.<br>
The Level 2 threshold is reached by obtaining any of the following: Five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C; an intermediate GNVQ; an NVQ level 2 or any other equivalent Level 2 qualification; one A-level (grade A to E); 2 AS levels (grades A to E) or any other full Level 3, Level 4 or Level 5 qualification.<br>
Figures related to this target have been previously published in an annual statistical first release (SFR) since 2001, most recently in &quot;The Level of Highest Qualification Held By Young People and Adults: England 2003&quot;. published on 5 February 2004. The SFR is within the National Statistics remit.

 The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), has in place a bovine tuberculosis (TB) control programme, which aims to bring about a substantial reduction in TB disease levels in Northern Ireland. The incidence of TB has been decreasing in Northern Ireland since early to mid-2003. This trend has continued during the first ten months of 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51214w36.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_191">The control measures are based on a programme of testing, the slaughter of infected animals, the restriction of movements of animals to and from infected herds and surrounding herds, and the tracing of contact animals.

<a name="stpa_192">Following the TB policy review undertaken in 2002, DARD has introduced a number of new measures to strengthen the control of TB in Northern Ireland. The most important of these measures are tighter restrictions on overdue tests and changes to the valuation system, including the establishment of an independent appeal panel to resolve valuation disputes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51214w36.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_193">Work is also underway on the feasibility of further measures that can be introduced to control TB.

 Gas transporters are obliged, on request, to connect a domestic property within 23 metres of an existing gas main. Under normal circumstances, the gas transporter will apply a standard charge, agreed with the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) for providing such a connection. This charge varies slightly between different parts of Great Britain. The transporter will ordinarily bear the cost of installing the first 10 metres of pipe in the public highway. Gas transporters are able to recover the reasonable costs of providing connections to properties more than 23 metres from a gas main. Connections may also be arranged through gas suppliers, which will oversee the process, but will charge the customer for this service.

These obligations include the maintenance of a Priority Service Register, and the provision of special services to meet the access, communication and safety needs of eligible customers. Relevant information about customers on the register is passed to gas and electricity distribution companies to enable them to comply with their obligations in the event of certain categories of supply failure.

<a name="stpa_238">Many microgenerators already benefit from the Renewables Obligation (RO). However, feedback from microgenerators, as part of the current Review of the RO, suggested that the some of the administrative requirements might act as a barrier to accessing the benefits of the RO. One potential barrier is that the RO order defines the obligation in terms of the supply of electricity to customers in Great Britain. As a result there is a requirement that even generators that consume their own electricity must first sell it to a supplier before buying it back for their own consumption.

<a name="stpa_239">The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill is currently before Parliament, and the Government intend to use this to introduce primary legislation that would allow the removal of this requirement for small generators. The Government would also like to use the same Bill to introduce primary legislation, which would allow agents to act on behalf of small generators through the process of accreditation and claiming ROCs and allowing ROCs to be issued to agents. It will also allow agents to amalgamate the output of small generators.
