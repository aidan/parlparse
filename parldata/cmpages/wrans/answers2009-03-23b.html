 From 2001 to 2007, HMG funded its conflict related programme activity through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) and Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP), owned and managed tri-departmentally by DFID, FCO and MOD. By bringing together the UK Government's development, diplomatic, and defence interests and expertise this ensured a coherent response to conflict prevention. In 2001, all three Departments contributed funds to form these pools (&#163;2.1 million disbursed by the FCO; &#163;14.4 million by DFID and &#163;3.2 million by MOD), but in subsequent years funds have been allocated directly from HMT. The Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP) was set up in April 2008 as a successor to the former Global and Africa Conflict Prevention Pools, focusing activity through regional programmes where the UK can have its biggest impact, and through thematic programmes to deal with cross-cutting conflict prevention issues. The CPP commands a total of &#163;112 million in 2008-09 of which the Africa Conflict Prevention Programme is forecast to spend &#163;68 million. From FY 2001-02 to 2007-08, HMG has spent approximately &#163;341 million through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool. This is broken down by year as follows:</p>

 The Government place the highest priority on the safety and security of our servicemen and women while on operations.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said many times that the UK would like to have a positive and constructive relationship with Iran&#151;a relationship which is based on mutual respect and is not a prisoner of history. We believe that we have important shared interests in Iran's neighbourhood, including stability, security and economic development in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, we and the rest of the international community have significant and legitimate concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, its activity in the region, and its repression of its own people. Iran must address these if our relationship is to move forward. The Iranian authorities are also responsible for unacceptable harassment of our staff in Tehran, both UK based and Iranian&#151;pressure which has forced the British Council to suspend its operation in Iran, and which obstructs the legitimate activities of our embassy. We have raised this with the Iranian authorities on numerous occasions, and we regret that they have done nothing to address this.</p>

 While there have been improvements in the human rights situation in Nepal since the end of the conflict in 2006, significant challenges remain to the promotion and protection of human rights caused by the absence of rule of law. Despite the government of Nepal making repeated commitments to promoting respect for human rights, they have made limited progress. It has taken steps towards the proportional inclusion of minorities in all organs and at all levels of the state. It has also increased the budget for the national human rights commission, and has discussed the introduction of a bill to establish a truth and reconciliation commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="90323w0007.htm_para0"><a name="09032312000575">The continuing impunity for past and current human rights abuses remains a key concern. It has encouraged a lack of respect for the law which encourages people to turn to violence to resolving disputes. Poor public security, particularly in the Terai (plains), where there is a proliferation of armed groups, is a major obstacle to improving human rights in Nepal. We are also concerned at the increase in intimidation and violence against journalists which is leading to self-censorship by journalists. Political interference in police investigations is commonplace and we continue to receive reports of torture in police custody.</p>

We will continue to engage with the government of Nepal both bilaterally and in conjunction with the EU, other international partners, and the Office of the High Commissioner on human rights to urge it to meet the commitments they have made to uphold and promote human rights. Our Embassy is also supporting the efforts of civil society to combat impunity, through advocacy, training and work on legislative reform.</p>

It will be subject to security checks.

 While we have yet to enter into formal discussions with the European Commission on the review of EC Regulation 1/2005 on the welfare of animals during transport, as it has yet to publish formal proposals, we have responded to early opportunities presented by the Commission to comment on a draft options paper. The UK provided a set of generic principles which was drawn up in close consultation with the Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer in Wales, the Scottish Government Rural Directorate and the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland. We fully support the Commission&#146;s initiative to review key elements of the Regulation and welcomed the opportunity in the early stages of the review process to express our opinion on the Commission&#146;s policy options.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 March 2009]:</i> The Government recognises that the nitrogen oxides emission levels proposed in the commission&#146;s draft implementing measures on boilers and water heaters are challenging for the industry to achieve. DEFRA officials are working together with industry representatives to understand the impact on UK oil-fired boiler manufacturers and to determine a level to propose to the commission that is achievable for the industry.</p>

 As Minister for Farming and the Environment I have met representatives of the pig industry and producers on a number of occasions to discuss what the Government can do to help the industry achieve profitability and long-term economic sustainability.</p>

 The DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) works to develop new markets for waste in the UK. WRAP has supported several companies, through a range of financial and technical assistance mechanisms, in developing new and existing plastic recycling businesses.</p>

WRAP'S focus has therefore moved on to mixed plastics (plastic packaging other than plastic bottles).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="90323w0010.htm_para7"><a name="09032318000503">WRAP has undertaken trials with a number of technologies, with the aim of understanding the best ways to handle mixed plastics from an environmental, economical and technological perspective. The programme has investigated three main areas: collection, reprocessing, and end markets. The trials showed clearly that it is economically viable to recycle the vast majority of the mixed plastics we currently send to landfill, and there are clear environmental gains in doing so. WRAP is now working with councils and industry partners to deliver mixed plastics reprocessing in the UK.</p>

 The Design for Manufacture Competition was announced by the then Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, on 26 September 2004. The Prior Information Notice was issued on 15 February 2005, and the Contract Notice (which formally opened the competition process) was issued on 29 March 2005. This allowed consortiums to register their interest in participating and to request the necessary initial documents.

 The system on which the details of enforcement operations conducted by the UK Border Agency are recorded categorises the nature of the facility visited into one of several broad groups. Therefore, it is not possible to differentiate between hospitals and care homes without examination of individual records at disproportionate cost, as these are recorded together under one category (along with nursing homes); restaurants and takeaway food outlets are similarly categorised.</p>

This report has since been superseded by their report &#147;Management of Asylum Applications by the UK Border Agency&#148; which was published on 23 January 2009. This does not give a single average figure for the cost of removal but instead (on page 36 of the report) breaks it down into upper- and lower-end estimates for a range of people in different circumstances (for example, a single undetained adult who is removed after exhausting his/her appeal rights, the cost range given is between &#163;7,900 and &#163;17,000 excluding accommodation and support costs, and between &#163;12,000 and &#163;25,600 including accommodation and support costs).

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>

 The Government have not made any such assessment. The decision on whether to accept certain payment methods, and whether or not to charge a fee for accepting certain payment methods, is a commercial one for banks and retailers. However, in doing so, they must take account of legal obligations which are relevant to the giving of information about prices. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 prohibit traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices which harm consumers&#146; economic interests. In broad terms, commercial practices are acts or omissions by a trader directly connected to the supply of products to consumers.

 When an apprentice is made redundant, the first option that training providers and the National Apprenticeship Service will explore is finding immediate alternative employment. We recognise that current economic climate can make it even more challenging to find a new employer place. We have agreed new flexibilities to allow apprentices who cannot find immediate alternative employment to move into full-time further education for up to six months while maintaining their existing apprenticeship framework and maintaining their status as an apprentice. The Learning and Skills Council have advised providers of this new flexibility which allows redundant apprentices to maintain their framework for an extended period while they and their provider seek a new employer.</p>

1. Bexley local authority numbers are rounded to the nearest 10, all other numbers are rounded to the nearest 100.<br>
2. Learner numbers are shown for provision funded through the FE budget.<br>
3. Number of starts include Work Based Learning and Train to Gain data.<br>
4. Train to Gain was launched in April 2006, so comparable data does not exist for 2003-04 and 2004-05.<br>
5. The field for delivery mode is not mandatory in the Individualised Learner Record collection for Work Based Learning and Train to Gain. Therefore we have provided starts information for contextual purposes.<br>
6. This table uses programme starts as a measure for comparative purposes. Full-year numbers are a count of the number of starts at any point during the year Learners starting more than one course will appear more than once.<br>
7. Area is based upon the home postcode of the learner. Where the postcode is outside of England, learners are included in the 'Other' category. Where postcode is not known this is also included in the 'Other' category.<br>

 Parliament decided in passing the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 that universities should be autonomous and that Ministers should have no role in deciding how individual subjects and courses are funded.

 The Government recognise that information communication and technology (ICT) training has a major role to play in helping to deliver our ambition to become a world leader in skills. With regard to ICT user skills, the recent publication &#147;Skills for Life: Changing Lives&#148; outlines how DIUS is considering with partners the development of a national strategy for ICT as a skill for life. More details will be provided shortly when the Informal Adult Learning White Paper is published. Plans for the development of digital skills more widely are being prepared with advice from sector skills councils following publication of &#147;Digital Britain: The Interim Report&#148; in January 2009 and will be presented in the final report to be published by the summer.</p>

There is a range of projects located in local communities across Kent Thameside aimed at raising the skills of local people. The Gateway Knowledge Alliance is part of a partnership delivering targeted IT provision with Learn IT to unemployed learners in deprived communities. It is also working as part of Employ North Kent on a SEEDA funded initiative. Starting from April 2009, the project will involve jobs-matching and the delivery of suitable courses that have been identified, which could include IT. In Dartford, a new state-of-the-art adult education centre was officially opened in February. The centre includes a new IT suite and aims to allow adults  <br>

<i> [holding answer 17 March 2009]:</i><i> </i>Data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) suggest that the employment rates for 18 to 24-year-olds not in full-time education have fallen slightly faster than for other age groups. However, it is too early to say that young people are or will be disproportionately affected by the current downturn, and the data may be affected by sample size fluctuations.</p>

The claimant count, which tends to be more reliable than the LFS for looking at short-term economic trends, shows that the rise in inflows to job seeker&#146;s allowance (JSA) has also been spread evenly by age.</p>

 Clinical priority is, and remains, the main determinant of when patients should be treated. We have repeatedly stated that those patients who are in greatest need should continue to be treated first. Good waiting list management is based on treating clinically urgent patients urgently and all other patients in turn chronologically. Working with their lead commissioner, primary care trusts need to ensure they have the necessary capacity in place to support this.</p>

 It is not possible to identify from central data the average annual salary of a neonatal nurse employed by the national health service in England.

 The report from Professor Baker is not yet in the public domain, and we have to balance the legitimate public interest in openness, against the rights of individuals named within the report, in respect of personal details relating to them.

 The precise skill mix is best determined locally by the primary care trust and the appointed local contractors and will depend on the range of services commissioned at the centre. Our guidance to the national health service suggested a general practitioner (GP)-led health centre might have nine practice nurses, and three GPs to reflect the extended hours and walk-in appointments which will predominantly be dealt with by nurses. However there should always be a GP available at all times able to see patients, where appropriate.</p>

A joint Overview and Scrutiny Committee of local authorities agreed to the proposals on 21 September 2007. The transfer of the unit did not require the approval of the Secretary of State for Health, as proposals for the reconfiguration of services are a matter for the national health service locally, working in conjunction with clinicians, patients and other stakeholders.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 March 2009]: </i>There were 17 NHS trusts designated financially challenged in 2006-07 (financially challenged trusts (FCTs)). Long-term financial recovery plans were drawn up for these NHS trusts with the aim of returning them to financial balance while maintaining and improving services to patients. 10 of these trusts have agreed a realistic profile for surpluses going forward and repayment of their historic debt within five years and were no longer therefore designated as FCTs at the beginning of the 2008-09 financial year.

 Many parts of the national health service have made excellent progress implementing this important legislation, which ensures that patients receive safe, high quality care from staff who have not been forced to work excessive hours. The United Kingdom Government notified the European Commission in January of their assessment of progress in achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive by doctors in training. A copy of the UK Notification of Derogation for Doctors in Training has been placed in the Library. The Department is working closely with the Medical Royal Colleges, the British Medical Association and the strategic health authorities to ensure trusts are prepared for full implementation.</p>

 Integrated Offender Management is a locally agreed, multi-agency approach to reducing crime through punishing and reforming persistent offenders. IOM is a relatively new concept and there was no central funding of West Yorkshire before 2008-09. In 2008-09, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice together allocated &#163;550,000 to support the development of Integrated Offender Management in West Yorkshire. This money was received by the Drugs and Offender Management Unit in West Yorkshire police on behalf of the multi-agency Integrated Offender Management partnership in West Yorkshire. We expect the allocation for 2009-10 to be &#163;395,000. The core funding of criminal justice agencies also supports this work.</p>

 Tackling prejudice and discrimination is one of the aims of offender management and it is standard practice for offenders to be advised about the implications of discriminatory behaviour during the induction process: The information requested is not available, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, in the four probation areas that make up the Yorkshire and Humberside region of the National Offender Management Service, 16,715 offenders started community or suspended sentence orders during 2006 and 18,079 during 2007. Each offender will have gone through an induction process. Section 2c.7 of the National Standards for the Management of Offenders requires probation areas to induct offenders into the sentence at the start of a community order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="90323w0039.htm_para6"><a name="0903241001236">It is not possible, on the basis of information held by the Yorkshire and Humberside region or by each probation area within that region, to disaggregate and isolate from general probation activity the amount of time spent on the delivery of each of those restrictive interventions to offenders. To require this information to be collected this information would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many inmates <i> (a)</i> escaped and <i> (b) </i>absconded from each open prison in each year since 1997. [264718]</p>

 Absconds have fallen to less than half the levels they were 10 years ago while there have been no prison escapes so far this financial year compared to 10 to 20 escapes per year a decade ago. Escapes occur when prisoners unlawfully absent themselves from custody by overcoming a physical barrier or restraint. Absconds occur from open prisons when prisoners absent themselves without needing to overcome a physical barrier or restraint. Prisoners can escape from an open prison if they are being held temporarily in secure conditions within the open prison such as in segregation.</p>
