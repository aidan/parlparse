 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2000]:</i> I will write to the right hon. Member shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn1"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seekers have been relocated to Morecambe in the last 12 months. [120014]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Local authorities have been responsible for accommodating destitute asylum seekers in the last 12 months. Therefore, we do not know the number of asylum seekers who may have been relocated to Morecambe in the last 12 months.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn2"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his policy regarding the relocation of asylum seekers to seaside resorts through <i>(a)</i> voluntary and <i>(b)</i> compulsory dispersal schemes; and if he will make a statement.  [120017]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Home Office has not dispersed any asylum seekers under the voluntary dispersal arrangements. This is an arrangement between local authorities.
<P>

<a name="00420w01.html_para0">Under the New Asylum Support Service arrangements, brought in on 3 April 2000, all areas of the United Kingdom will be expected to share the responsibilities of destitute asylum seekers. Those asylum seekers who are eligible for support are being dispersed on a fair and rational basis around the country. On this basis, destinations may include seaside resorts. However, it is our clear intention that no local authority should have a disproportionate share of the responsibility.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn3"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is his policy on consulting hon. Members on the relocation of asylum seekers to their constituencies;  [120016]
<P>
<UL>(2) what information is provided to hon. Members representing constituencies in the North West of England from the National Asylum Support Service and the North West Regional Consortium about proposals for relocating asylum seekers in their constituencies.  [120019]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 A letter will shortly be sent to Members of Parliament advising of the likely cluster areas for dispersal during the first three months of the new arrangements.

<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn4"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what plans the National Asylum Support Service has to use the Grosvenor Hotel in Morecambe to house asylum seekers;  [120015]
<P>
<UL>(2) what visits have been made by his Department's officials to Morecambe to look at potential properties to house asylum seekers.  [120018]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has no plans to use the Grosvenor Hotel to house asylum seekers. NASS officials have not visited Morecambe to look at potential properties.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department by what means it is possible for a person with a well-founded fear of persecution in another country legally to enter the United Kingdom <i>(a)</i> when holding valid travel documents from the regime which they are fleeing and <i>(b)</i> in the absence of such documents. [120052]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 All asylum applications, irrespective of the applicant's method of entry, are considered in accordance with the criteria set out in the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. To be recognised as a refugee, a person must be outside his or her country of nationality and have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
<P>

<a name="00420w01.html_para1">As a matter of law, any asylum applicant who gains entry by material deception having presented a valid travel document or who enters without any documents or using false documents is an illegal entrant.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Whittingdale: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will receive a reply to his letter of 24 January to the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), concerning the proposal to house asylum seekers in the Maldon district. [119963]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The information necessary to provide the answer has been subject to protracted inquiries. I apologise for the delay and a reply will be sent to the hon. Member shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the amount <i>(a)</i> spent, <i>(b)</i> claimed and <i>(c)</i> reimbursed to each local authority in the United Kingdom, and in total, in relation to expenditure on asylum support in each six month period since 1 April 1999; how many payments to local authorities are (i) outstanding and (ii) in dispute; and if he will make a statement.  [120055]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Tables showing the amount spent, claimed and reimbursed to each local authority in the United Kingdom have been placed in the Library. It is not shown in six month periods; for the first eight months from 1 April 1999 to 5 December 1999, these costs were covered by a special grant report, for the four months 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 2000 : Column: 593W</I><P>
from then until 31 March 2000, the costs were covered by grant paid under the Asylum Support (Interim Provisions) Regulations 1999. These are shown separately. In each case, the amount claimed is the amount that has been paid.
<P>

<a name="00420w01.html_para2">All claims received by the National Asylum Support Service so far have been paid, but all are still subject to audit.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn8"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria must be met by those wishing to provide accommodation to the National Asylum Support Service.  [120057]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The accommodation provider will have a contract with the National Asylum Support Service. They will ensure that the accommodation is "suitable" in that it will be of an adequate standard; the relevant standard. The relevant standards are the same as those applied by local authorities when re-housing any homeless residents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he intends to implement his proposals for regulation of the private security industry.  [119566]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 As we indicated in our White Paper last year, we intend to introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to bring forward proposals for better regulation of private investigators.  [119567]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Our White Paper of last year, "The Government's Proposals for Regulation of the Private Security Industry in England and Wales", proposed that a new authority should be established to set and improve standards in the industry and to license those who work in the private security field. The White Paper proposed that licensing should apply to private investigators in due course.

<a name="00420w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Custody (Vulnerable Adults)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what specialist training and standard 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 2000 : Column: 594W</I><P>
protocols are made available to custody officers for handling persons with learning difficulties and other vulnerable adults.  [119996]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Codes of Practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 require the presence of an appropriate adult whenever a mentally disordered person (including a person with learning difficulties) is being detained or questioned.
<P>

<a name="00420w01.html_para3">National Police Training (NPT) has developed a two-week training course for Custody Officers which is available for delivery by forces. The course, which includes the content of the provisions of the Codes of Practice, is regularly updated and revised. It is, however, essentially for Chief Officers to decide on the training to be undergone by their officers.
<P>

<a name="00420w01.html_para4">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) recognise the value and importance of the custody officer training package, and continue to work with NPT in promoting the use of this course by police forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will list the number and value of <i>(a)</i> bids and <i>(b)</i> grants made in each of the last three financial years for which figures are available, for each (i) area-based and (ii) other regeneration-related initiative for which his Department is responsible;  [119796]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list for each <i>(a)</i> area-based and <i>(b)</i> other regeneration-related initiative for which his Department is responsible (i) the amount budgeted and (ii) the total expended in each financial year for the planned lifetime of each initiative.  [119788]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Office is responsible for a number of initiatives which although not directly aimed at regeneration, contribute indirectly to the regeneration of deprived areas. The information requested on the sums already expended and planned budgets for the current and next financial years in respect of these initiatives is given in the table. Expenditure plans beyond March 2002 will be determined by the current spending review.

<a name="00420w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Welsh: </B>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's authority to possess prohibited weapons is only granted to those people who can show they have a genuine need to possess them, almost always to allow them to follow their trade or profession. Authorities are conditioned to limit holdings of prohibited firearms to the minimum number required and specify stringent security conditions under which the weapons are to be kept.
<P>

<a name="00420w02.html_para0">The vast majority of authorities are held by companies who either manufacture, sell or transport such weapons or who need them for research, development or testing purposes.
<P>

<a name="00420w02.html_para1">There are only five private individuals in England authorised by the Secretary of State to possess a total of 1,282 prohibited weapons. The vast majority of these are held by one person in one of the most comprehensive private collections of historic firearms in the world. The remaining firearms are held by a forensic firearms expert; a lecturer and technical consultant; the owner of a private museum; and a professional trapper of dangerous animals who is called in by the police to deal with such animals as escaped big cats.

<a name="00420w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I am pleased to report that, as I predicted in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) on 28 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 135-36W, thanks to the hard work carried out in Government Departments and Agencies, the Leap Year date change had a negligible impact on them. Very few incidents were reported, and none of them had any impact on the public. Completed questionnaires will be placed, as usual, in the Libraries of the House and published on the internet, as had been the Government's practice throughout. This degree of openness and transparency has been one of the distinguishing features of the Year 2000 programme.
<P>

<a name="00420w02.html_para2">These will be the last questionnaires. My assessment of the impact of the Bug is that is has been very slight, both for central Government and for all the essential services in the national infrastructure. As I have said before, and repeat now, this success was not a matter of chance. Many people worked long and hard to bring it about. Government and businesses will continue to be vigilant throughout the year; but there is no longer any need for systematic monitoring.

 There should not be any effect due to the loss of MIRAS. Benefit was recalculated from 6 April automatically, and customers received a notification from the Benefits Agency, informing them of the change to their benefit. An endowment mortgage does not affect the recalculation of benefit. The mortgage scheme only makes payments on the interest element of the mortgage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the annual cost of <i>(a)</i> removing the means test for benefits for pensioners and <i>(b)</i> keeping SERPS in (i) Scotland and (ii) the UK. [119869]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The cost of removing the means test for benefits for pensioners depends on what assumptions are made. The net cost of uprating the basic State Pension to the level of the Minimum Income Guarantee is around &#163;4.5 billion, excluding the effect on linked benefits. Retaining SERPS in preference to the State Second Pension would result in a cost saving because the State Second Pension will be more generous to some 18 million low and moderate earners, carers and long-term disabled people with broken work records. Estimates apply to Great Britain. Separate costs for Scotland are not available.

The Inland Revenue gives approval in respect of arrangements made by the trustees to secure the pension rights when a scheme ceases to be contracted-out of the State Earnings Related Pension Schemes (SERPS). There are about 24,000 schemes in the process of ceasing to contract out. Many of them will also be winding-up. No information is available about schemes winding up because the sponsoring employer is insolvent.

<a name="00420w06.html_para0">With real GDP growth of 1.5 per cent. per year pension expenditure is estimated to increase as a proportion of GDP between 2000-01 and 2030-31, from 4.3 per cent. to 4.7 per cent. After 2030-31 the proportion of GDP represented by pension expenditure falls, from 4.7 per cent. to 3.8 per cent. by 2050-51.
<P>

<a name="00420w06.html_para1">With real GDP growth at 2.0 per cent. per year pension expenditure as a proportion of GDP follows a more general pattern of decline, from 4.3 per cent. in 2000/01 to 3.0 per cent. in 2050-51. This more general pattern of decline is wholly attributable to the faster increase in GDP.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The figures have been calculated using the following assumptions:<P>

Total pension expenditure is the sum of expenditure on SERPS, State Second Pension, and the Basic State Pension.<P>

SERPS expenditure is based on the assumption that State Second Pension is introduced in 2002 and so any SERPS expenditure after that date is on earlier accruals.<P>

SERPS expenditure does not include the effects of the Inherited SERPS scheme and accompanying deferral announced on 15 March 2000.<P>

State Second Pension expenditure assumes the scheme becomes flat rate from 2006 onwards, when Stakeholder pensions are established.<P>

From 2006 everyone aged under 40, and earning over &#163;9,500 (in 1999 earnings terms) chooses to contract out of State Second Pensions. Contracting out is based on the proposals contained in the current Bill.<P>

Increases in contracted out rebates as a result of introducing State Second Pension and Stakeholder pensions are not included in expenditure figures.<P>

2. Expenditure figures are consistent with those in the Government Actuary Department's report on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill 1999.<P>

3. GDP for future years is estimated by taking the figure for 1999-2000 and uprating it. GDP figures are often subject to revision in later years, and because of the long time horizon over which projection is undertaken the effects of any error corrected in a subsequent revision will be magnified.<P>

 At the Transport Council meeting of 28 March 2000, the European Commission presented its recently adopted Communication on road safety. The United Kingdom strongly welcomed the Communication and other member states also responded positively. The Commission indicated that blood alcohol levels would be the subject of a Recommendation. However, the Commission pointed out that the proposal for a Directive which was first presented in 1988 remains on the table if the Council wishes to debate it. It was concluded that there should be a discussion of the Communication at the Council meeting in June.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The use by local authorities of on-street parking revenue surpluses is governed by section 55 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Briefly, this provides that local authorities may use surpluses for the provision and maintenance of off-street parking facilities but if it appears to the local authority that the provision of further off-street parking provision in their area is unnecessary or undesirable, surpluses may be used for the purpose of meeting the costs of public transport services and highway or road improvement projects. Local authorities may not therefore spend revenue from on-street car parking to pay for heritage projects and tourist facilities.

(b) trading in licences should be encouraged in such a way that it delivers environmental benefits together with economic gains, within the regulatory requirements of the abstraction licensing system as it will be following the changes which the Government announced on 31 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 756-57, and which it will bring forward in a forthcoming Water Bill;
<BR>
(c) the Environment Agency should actively encourage abstraction licence trading with a general presumption that trading may be possible in most areas, and in particular by:
<BR>

<BR>
ensuring that its licensing administrative processes operate speedily and efficiently, making full use of e-mail and other electronic means;
<BR>

<BR>
clearly identifying, within its Abstraction Management Strategies, the scope for trading and any unavoidable limitations to particular types of trades;
<BR>

<BR>

 Drug Action Teams (DATs) are a partnership of local agencies such as health and local authorities, police, probation and local eduction authorities. Funding for their activities is channelled for the most part through these agencies. However, they receive a grant from the Home Office Drug Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS) to fund the running costs for DATs, namely the post of the co-ordinator and administration costs. That grant is set to rise from some &#163;5 million to some &#163;6.7 million over this year to fund the creation of additional DATs, bringing the total up to some 150.
<P>

<a name="00420w08.html_para2">DATs are supported by DPAS in partnership with the UK Anti Drugs Co-ordinator and Cabinet Office UK Anti Drugs Co-ordination Unit (UKADCU). DPAS provides the link between central government and local delivery and has nine regional offices providing advice and support to the DATs in their area in driving forward the Co-ordinator's Strategy. The Co-ordinator and staff of UKADCU also visit DATs and, in partnership with DPAS, organise conferences for DATs to discuss current and future issues.

<BR>
<i>By March 2000</i>
<BR>

<BR>
Have established CARATs, (Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare) the basic treatment framework to improve the assessment, advice throughcare and support of prisoners; and put in place more and better quality treatment programmes.
<BR>

<BR>
Put in place more dogs trained to detect drugs; more CCTV in visits areas; obtain better information about supply routes and availability of drugs to prisoners; and discourage families from smuggling drugs.
<BR>
<i>By March 2002</i>
<BR>

<BR>
Ensure that the CARATs annual caseload reached 20,000; that there are 30 new prison-based rehabilitation programmes and that 5,000 prisoners per year go through treatment programmes.
<BR>

<BR>
Have developed and implemented a model to assess the levels and routes of supply of drugs within prisons.
<BR>




<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 2000 : Column: 618W</I><P>

<BR>
To reduce the rate of positive tests from prison random drug tests from 20 per cent. (in 1998-99) to 16 per cent.
<BR>
The targets for March 2000 have been met through the introduction of CARATs in all prisons and twenty-one new treatment programmes. A further eight treatment programmes and four new therapeutic communities will start this year. There are 60 new passive and twelve new active drug dogs, bringing the totals to 121 and 196 respectively. CCTV is available in visits areas in 118 prisons. Improving intelligence is an ongoing task. New sanctions for visitors caught smuggling drugs were introduced in April 1999. They include a ban on the visitors concerned and the imposition of closed visits for three months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w10.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Health action zones (HAZs) are the only area-based initiative for which the Department is responsible. Most of the additional resources available to health authorities in HAZs are allocated on the basis of a NHS weighted capitation formula rather than through a bidding process. Health Authorities that are HAZs received and spent an additional &#163;5.6 million in the first year of the initiative (1998-99) and &#163;89.4 million in 1999-2000 (&#163;3 million less than budgeted for). Resources for 2000-01 and beyond have yet to be finalised.
<P>

<a name="00420w10.html_para3">Other initiatives classified as regeneration-related initiatives are the Healthy Schools Initiative, Personal Medical Services (PMS) Pilots and the Primary Care and Primary School Partnership pilots.
<P>

<a name="00420w10.html_para4">The resources budgeted for and allocated to the Healthy Schools Initiative, which has now been rolled out across England, were &#163;1.2 million in 1998-99 and &#163;2.9 million in 1999-2000. &#163;5.7 million will be available in 2000-01. No decisions have been made about resources for future years. The cost of the initiative is shared equally between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Employment.
<P>

<a name="00420w10.html_para5">PMS pilots receive a "fair share" of the resources that would have been available from the general medical services non-cash limited pool. The only additional resources they receive are for preparation costs. The preparation costs for the first two waves of PMS pilots were &#163;2 million in 1997-98, &#163;2 million in 1998-99 and &#163;3 million in 1999-2000.

 Before the establishment of the Legal Services Commission on 1 April 2000, the Legal Aid Board was responsible for granting applications for legal aid.

This work would disrupt the implementation of the new computer system and divert staff from their tasks of processing legal aid applications. Accordingly the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 It is now normal procedure, when government departments and agencies make applications for the Lord Chancellor's permission to retain records over 30 years old, for officers of the Public Record Office to encourage them to allow public access. Such applications are further scrutinised by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on Public Records. The Advisory Council may request access for the public as a condition of an application proceeding to receive the Lord Chancellor's approval.

<a name="00420w12.html_para5">As a result, the public will be granted access to the great majority of the records retained under s.3(4) since March 1999. The commonest reason for access to be refused is that the retained records remain sensitive. In such cases access would undermine the reason for retention.

I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence about the procurement of two new Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. I assume that you are referring to the Alternative Landing Ships Logistic (ALSL) Programme. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Five UK shipyards have expressed an interest in the ALSL project and each is being invited to tender for their design and build. The five companies are:
<BR>

<BR>
Appledore Shipbuilders Ltd.
<BR>

<BR>
BAE SYSTEMS Marine Ltd.
<BR>

<BR>
Cammell Laird Shipyard
<BR>

<BR>
Harland and Wolff Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries Ltd.
<BR>

<BR>
Swan Hunter (Tyneside) Ltd.
<BR>
The contract will be awarded to the shipyard that offers the best whole life value for money.
<BR>
An invitation to tender (ITT) was issued on 14 April. Contract placement for the design and build of two new ALSLs is planned to occur in late 2000. The estimated cost for the construction of the two vessels is &#163;138M.

<a name="00420w14.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Quentin Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the effect of his decision to finance the Royal Navy's requirement for roll on/roll off ferries by means of a public private partnership, on the protection of the relevant contracts from the Public Procurement Directive available to military procurement contracts under the Treaty of European Union.  [118663]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00420w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's requirement for a strategic sealift capability is defined as non-warlike and ships providing the service will not be warships. Rather, they will be commercial standard ro/ros. The competition for the requirement has, therefore, to be conducted under European Community and World Trade Organisation public procurement rules. In such circumstances, a MOD requirement that stipulates that service providers or suppliers provide British built ships would be contrary to our EC obligations prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of nationality.
<P>

<a name="00420w14.html_para7">The requirement to compete in this way is not, therefore, influenced by whether the service is provided through PFI or more traditional procurement methods. We are, of course, doing all we can within the bounds of fair competition to give UK industry the best opportunity to participate in the programme.

 Our White Paper, "Conclusions of The Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee", Cm 4071, stated that it was not possible to quantify the impact of the new energy framework on emissions. This is because the aim of the policy is not to achieve any particular outcome in terms of fuel mix in generation but to create a level playing field so that all forms of generation can compete equally and as a temporary precautionary measure to ensure the artificial encouragement for new gas plant that has arisen from distortions to the electricity market does not artificially undermine security and diversity of supply.
<P>

<a name="00420w15.html_para6">I announced on Monday 17 April that I would be lifting the stricter consents policy in October 2000 as soon as the new electricity trading arrangements were in place. The Government are determined to meet the UK commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 12&#189; per cent. below 1990 levels in 2008-12. The stricter consents policy and the timetable for its lifting is entirely consistent with meeting that target, and with moving towards our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. on 1990 levels.
