 The Government continue to believe that targeted EU sanctions against the military regime in Burma are an important means of maintaining pressure for political reform and respect for human rights. Sanctions introduced in 1996 have been strengthened over time, notably after the Saffron Revolution in 2007, and in August 2009 in response to the guilty verdict in Aung San Suu Kyi's trial. They are now among the EU's toughest autonomous measures against any country. The UK will not support any easing of sanctions in the absence of tangible progress on the ground.</p>

 South Wales Police have an excellent record on dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour.

Where a force, such as South Wales, is performing well on dealing with crime but public confidence remains low, this could be due to a number of reasons. For example more work might need to be done to ensure the successful work taking place is being communicated effectively to the public. The commitments to information provision and holding public forums within the policing pledge should assist with this.</p>

 The terms "open PSN case" and "open P14 case" are not used by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="100210w0009.htm_para0"><a name="10021085000611">PAYE open cases arise when HMRC is unable to match the pay and tax details submitted by their employer on form P14 to an individual's tax record or a match is made but the pay and tax do not reconcile and further work is needed to establish the correct tax position. This is a normal part of the PAYE process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="100210w0009.htm_para1"><a name="10021085000612">The most recent internal audit review of PAYE open cases took place in March 2009, and reviewed the accuracy of clearance of 2007-08 PAYE open cases.

<i> [holding answer 26 January 2010]:</i> Projections about grid decarbonisation are already taken into account in the carbon emission factors that are used to determine carbon compliance. The factor is currently calculated by projecting five years into the future, based on an average value of carbon intensity. Officials from DECC and CLG are working closely with the zero carbon hub's working group that has been set up to consider issues such as compliance and its assessment, as we move to zero carbon homes in 2016. The carbon intensity of grid energy, electricity, gas and the other fuels, is likely to be a factor in their deliberations. The workgroup is expected to make its recommendations later this year.</p>

 The recommendation for a 23 kilo bag weight limit is from International Air Transport Association (IATA) and is supported by HSE as one aspect of industry risk reduction measures.

 From the matrix of assets that are fit for purpose and available, Her Majesty's Coastguard will task the most appropriate declared search and rescue resource to deal with the given circumstances of a maritime incident. It is the view of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) that the resources available for search and rescue in the southern part of the South West Peninsula are sufficient to address the known maritime risks for that location, without the need for an additional boat at Hope Cove, whether or not that they were privately run. However, this is the subject of a consultation exercise at this time and no decisions about the future of the general purpose boat at Hope Cove will be taken until the consultation period is complete.</p>

The White Paper also invited the current Total Place pilots to provide information on the costs of assessment and inspection to inform the Smarter Government workstreams. A report on the pilots will be published alongside Budget 2010.</p>

 Broadly speaking, rateable value represents the annual rental value of the property. For the 2010 business rates revaluation, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) collected and examined 1,300 rents on petrol filling stations. This evidence was then filtered down to those rents that best reflected the rateable value assumptions and were agreed closest to the valuation date of 1 April 2008. There are around 100 of these key rents for petrol filling stations of which around 60 per cent. are from independent operators.</p>

It is only fair to all ratepayers this is reflected in rate bills. The Government have put in place a £2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_576"><a name="100210w0016.htm_para0"><a name="10021088001041">The table includes mainly one-off cases where there are specific factual reasons for changes in rateable value well outside of the norm. In some cases the publication of draft valuations has brought forward new information and valuations-either 2005, 2010 or both-have been amended accordingly. Otherwise reasons for change relate to the unique circumstances of individual valuations; examples include removal of temporary reductions in rateable value or changes in domestic elements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_577"><a name="100210w0016.htm_para1"><a name="10021088001042">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring that the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of its property relative to others. The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government.</p>

The Government have put in place a £2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

 Research, which is helpfully summarised on the website of Cancer Research UK, shows that the main causes of oral cancer are tobacco usage and excess consumption of alcohol with their combined usage having a synergistic effect. These factors together account for about 75 per cent. of the 5,300 cases of oral cancer occurring annually in the United Kingdom. There is also evidence of an association with the human papillomavirus and low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. Tobacco usage and alcohol consumption are also associated with cancer of the oesophagus and larynx, together with diet and family history, but information is not available on which to base estimates of their relative significance.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) (%) Statistical Robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV&lt;5 Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
The above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.).<br>

 The Ministry of Justice welcomes the fact that the 10:10 campaign will increase awareness among the public and business about climate change and sustainability. It will help to develop a higher profile of this issue in those sectors that are yet to set themselves any targets for improvement. Some of these businesses will also be our suppliers and this campaign should therefore serve to secure improvements in our supply chain.</p>

Going forward a key part of the strategy are projects to establish better quality, more frequent data through the use of Automatic Meter Reading (AMR), enabling more timely action to be taken to reduce energy consumption. Other projects include plans to upgrade building services and to optimise energy use both through technological measures and better energy management practice. The MOJ will continue with its carbon reduction work streams already in place and we will continue to promote the long-term and structured work we have been doing to reduce carbon usage.

This represents 7.2 per cent. of all staff employed over this period. An absence of less than five days is defined as an absence where the return to work date is less than five calendar days after the first day of absence. No account is taken of rest days.</p>

This reduced to 9.5 days per person in the 12 months to September 2009 (10.5 days per person in NOMS and 7.5 days per person in the wider MOJ).</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> "Hit and run" usually refers to a collision in which someone was injured or killed. The offence of failure to stop is also committed if there has only been damage but such incidents cannot be distinguished from those involving injury or death.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> A person involved in a hit and run incident may be convicted of a more serious offence such as dangerous driving.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it Is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has recently made amendments to prison rule 39, which covers the confidential handling arrangements for the delivery of legally privileged material to prisoners. This was introduced by way of a negative statutory instrument which was laid before Parliament in November 2009 and came into effect on 1 January 2010 (SI 3082-2009). This clarified that the level of authorisation for the interception of such communications had been raised from governing governor of a prison to the chief operating officer of NOMS. It also made clear that there should be no distinction between legally privileged material which was delivered as correspondence or documentation (electronic or other) which was handed over during the course of a legal visits. Both should be afforded the same level of confidential handling arrangements.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
2. It is known that in some police force areas, information on remand decisions is not always readily available to those coding court proceedings returns. In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures.<br>

1. Data for 2009 now include Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). However, the ESA component of the data is provisional and is likely to be revised when data for the next quarter are released.<br>
2. There are a number of different definitions of worklessness, but the one used in this analysis of benefits data is the same as the one in DWP statistics that refers to "Income replacement" benefits-those that are paid as replacement for an earned income. These are: jobseeker's allowance, incapacity benefit, income support, severe disablement allowance, and carers allowance. Using the Statistical Group analysis this includes jobseekers, incapacity benefits, lone parents, carers and other income related.<br>
3. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
4. Figures are only available on comparable basis back to August 1999.<br>

However, as part of our consultation process we commissioned a final impact assessment from independent consultants, Europe Economics. This assessment estimated the impact on groups across the UK which would be affected.

We value the contribution musical performers make to the economic and cultural success of our country. We have got to make sure that they are rewarded for their efforts so they can continue creating. As part of this process it is essential that PPL work with the third sector to agree reasonable and appropriate tariffs. The Government want to ensure that discussions between PPL and the third sector are facilitated so that the outcome is satisfactory for all concerned. A mutually agreed solution is vital if the needs of both PPL members and the third sector are to be met. I remain confident that this will be possible.</p>

The results of these tests are contained in the impact assessment summary accompanying the Government response to the Music Licensing Review ('Government Response to the Consultation on Changes to Exemptions from Public Performance Rights in Sound Recordings and Performers' Rights').</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 January 2010]:</i><i> </i>The Government want a copyright system which achieves the correct balance between the interests of all parties. It is essential that third sector organisations are protected from excessive burdens and experience minimal disruption as they continue to provide their vital services. We must find a balance which is fair to both sides and is consistent with EU and international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_798"><a name="100210w0036.htm_para5"><a name="1002111002785">The Government consider the current exemptions do not draw the correct balance between the interests of right holders and charitable and not-for-profit organisations. It is for this reason the maintenance of the status quo was not consulted on as an option for reforming the current system of exemptions. At present, if charities wish to play recorded or broadcast music they will have to pay for a licence from the Performing Rights Society (PRS for Music), which provides remuneration to songwriters and music publishers. But third sector organisations are exempt under UK law from requiring a PPL licence, which provides remuneration to performers and record labels, if certain conditions are met. The proposed repeal means that charities will now pay performers and record companies for the public playing of their recorded or broadcast music, in the same way as they already pay songwriters and music publishers.</p>

 The RDAs produce corporate plans setting out corporate objectives and expenditure plans across all major activities including social enterprise. Progress against these plans is subsequently reviewed and reported in the RDA's annual report and accounts. RDAs are also required to undertake impact evaluations of their major projects. That work was recently collected together in a report "Impact of RDA Spending" carried out on the Department's behalf by PriceWaterhouseCoopers which provided an overall assessment of RDAs' effectiveness.
