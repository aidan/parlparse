 In 2009, the gap between full-time men's and women's median earnings was 12.2% rising to 22% when comparing median earnings for all men and women. The Government do not produce a forecast of the gender pay gap and has made no assessment as to when the gap will close. The Government are committed to tackling the gender pay gap and is taking a range of measures to improve women's position in the labour market including making pay secrecy clauses unenforceable, extending the right to request flexible working to all employees, consulting on a new system of parental leave, and promoting gender equality on company boards including asking Lord Davies to fully investigate the issue.</p>

 The Department does not forecast levels of future house building, and delivery will be determined by local housing plans. In the spending review we announced investment of over £6.5 billion in housing. This includes over £2 billion to make existing social homes decent and almost £4.5 billion investment in new affordable housing to deliver up to 150,000 affordable homes. We are giving housing associations much more flexibility on rents and use of assets, so our aspiration is to deliver as many homes as possible through our investment and reforms. On 22 November we published our consultation document 'Local decisions: a fairer future for social housing' which set out our plans for radical reform of the social housing system.

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="101129w0001.htm_para22"><a name="1011299000329">Because their record has not improved on delivery of the project, we informed EADS on 8 November that we consider them to be in material breach of their obligations under the contract and required them to remedy the position in 20 working days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="101129w0001.htm_para23"><a name="1011299000330">As with all major Government projects, FiReControl is being reviewed to ensure value-for-money for the taxpayer. We have been clear that EADS must deliver to time, cost and quality. The new Government are committed to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, improving resilience and stopping the forced regionalisation of the fire service.</p>

 As per my answer on 27 October 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, column 357W, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) is not able to collate statistics in respect of numbers of lost original documents without reference to individual cases. Thus, estimates as to frequency would be no more than speculative.</p>

The OPG scans all applications on receipt and therefore where an original copy is misplaced, an office copy of the instrument can be provided. Where the original is subsequently identified, measures are in place to ensure it is then forwarded to the applicant. Office copies are afforded the same weight in law as the original. Costs are therefore limited to the resource to produce and issue any replacement material.</p>

 No measures will be introduced to release existing prisoners early.

 The National Offender Management Service delivers a broad range of interventions to address the particular risks and needs of offenders. Information on all the activities undertaken by individual prisoners is not centrally collated and details on those who did not take part in offender programmes could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by analysing offender files and local data systems, validating the information and collating in a common format. Whether a prisoner needs to participate in a particular programme will depend on assessment locally.</p>

 As at 12 November 2010, there were 369,253 crime scene sample profiles on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) submitted by police forces in England and Wales, of which an estimated 221,401 had been matched to subject sample profiles and an estimated 147,852 had not. The offence types recorded against these crime scene sample profiles are shown in the following table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="101129w0002.htm_para21"><a name="10112930000085">Since April 2002, records have been captured on the NDNAD Match Reporting Management Information Database (MID) on matches between crime scene sample profiles and subject sample profiles. The figures provided are estimates, as it is possible that some crime scene profiles were matched before 2002 and therefore not captured on the MID. The number of unmatched crime scene profiles may therefore be lower than indicated. In cases where a crime scene sample profile on the NDNAD has not matched to a subject sample profile, the crime may nevertheless have been detected through other evidence.</p>

 The Government are committed to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes. A review is currently under way to consider how this can be done in a way which protects the welfare of children while ensuring the departure of families who have no right to be in the UK. We need to be sure that any new process works in practice so we are testing out a range of new approaches aimed at keeping families with children in the community. We have also been working closely with a range of interested parties in the voluntary and statutory sectors who have experience and expertise in this area.</p>

The number of families detained in immigration removal centres has reduced significantly during the course of the review, and it is no longer the case that families are detained for long periods of time.</p>

The NPIA will support forces to implement 'Next Steps' and will target forces with high levels of disproportionality.

 The formal grant agreement (not a contract) with New Schools Network (NSN), an independent charity, was signed on 8 November 2010. It contains appropriate clauses regarding conflicts of interest, performance indicators and the provision of information among others, as is usual practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="101129w0003.htm_para1"><a name="10112932000575">The Department considered carefully the options for securing the requisite services from an external organisation. Given the need for specialist skills and experience to be in place quickly, it was decided to award a time-limited grant to NSN. In doing so the Department took account of the UK Public Procurement Regulations 2006 and the Compact Commissioning Guidance. There have not been any discussions with the Cabinet Office relating to this award.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="101129w0003.htm_para2"><a name="10112932000576">NSN has championed the development of parent and teacher promoted schools and has been providing advice and support to those interested in establishing new schools since 2009. It has also been developing networks among interested groups and individuals. This experience makes it ideally placed to fulfil the role. The Department has given similar grants in the past, such as to the NSPCC, the Holocaust Education Trust, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust and the Youth Sport Trust.</p>

 Too many young children are not achieving the standards expected in early literacy and numeracy. In order to raise standards we will provide the resources to support the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics; introduce a new year 1 phonics screening check to confirm whether children have acquired the basics of phonic decoding and identify those needing additional support; and, as part of the review of the National Curriculum, make sure that children are able to grasp the core arithmetical functions by the time they leave primary school. We are also introducing a pupil premium to provide extra funding for those schools with the most challenging intakes.</p>

While the network of school sport partnerships has helped schools to increase participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools. Through the comprehensive spending review, the Secretary of State has ensured that front line budgets for schools have been protected. The removal of centrally driven, top down programmes will mean that schools will have more flexibility to use their funding in areas which they identify as their own priorities. This includes competitive sport.</p>

 The temporary closure and rationalisation rules of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) are intended to incentivise industry to maintain production at their most efficient installations. The provision to retain full allocation during periods where a company is rationalising production or temporally shutting down production provides flexibility for companies to move their allocation to the sites that are still at full production in order to meet their compliance needs. Companies can also sell their allowances in order to raise finance in response to the economic situation.</p>

we believe Israel has every right to defend itself, we believe that barriers are not the best way to achieve this in the 21st century. Where it is constructed outside of Green Line Israel, the Israeli separation barrier is illegal both according to international and Israeli law. It is worth noting that the barrier on some 40% of the intended route remains unbuilt. We judge that Prime Minister Fayyad's reform of the Palestinian security sector has played the most significant part in reducing the violence committed by Palestinian groups against targets in Israel. The best way of ensuring Israel's security is to come to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace agreement with its neighbours.</p>

 As outlined in the strategy document 'Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth', published on 16 November 2010, the current arrangements for learner support will start to change from the 2011/12 academic year. An enhanced discretionary learner support fund will be created within the next two years. We will work closely with the sector on these changes to ensure funds are targeted on helping those learners facing financial difficulties.

And this is enforced by the initial responses to Ofcom's recent consultation on the issue. In addition, under new provisions in the Electronic Communications Framework review operators must present information about their service, including the nature and extent of their traffic management policies and their impact on service quality in a clear, visible and easy to understand form for all their customers.</p>

 "Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth" (16 November 2010) sets out the funding strategy for post-19 further education (FE) and skills. This includes the introduction of new fee loans from the 2013/14 academic year, providing the opportunity for FE learners to access the funds they need to gain intermediate and higher-level skills. We recognise that this is a significant reform and that is why we will over the next few months engage with colleges, training organisations and others on the details of how fee loans will be implemented. The changes will be phased in over the spending review period to provide the sector with sufficient time to plan effectively.</p>

The Secretary of State has previously announced that UK bilateral aid programmes in China and Russia will close. Consequently not all countries will receive a cash increase in funding.

 Food prices are determined by supply and demand. A growing population will increase the demand for food in years to come. Our policy seeks to match this growing demand for food by working with others to increase the supply of food in developing countries at a price that poor people can afford, for example by funding agricultural research.</p>

 The Government monitor international food supplies and price movements carefully. Our current assessment is that despite poor weather in southern Russia and Ukraine earlier this year, other regions of the world did well, and contributed to 2010 having the third largest cereals harvest on record. Global supplies remain adequate to meet expected demand, and available data and past evidence suggest that there is unlikely to be a shortage of food over the coming year. However prices remain higher than they were at the start of the year, reflecting the tighter supply situation.</p>

G8 countries have also pledged to support the L'Aquila Food Security Initiative to increase food supplies in developing countries, and make markets work more effectively.

 While it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions, it is unlikely that financial speculation has a significant effect on food prices in developing countries. Food price movements such as those seen in 2008 can be better explained by other factors such as local supply shortages, low international stocks, uncertainty about the size of the global harvest, a weak dollar, very high energy prices and export restrictions imposed by some countries.</p>

 Threats to food security come from a variety of sources, and over different time periods. In the short-term, countries heavily dependent on imports to meet their food supply needs are most vulnerable to price volatility on the international commodity markets. In 2008 this was the case in many West African countries heavily dependent on rice imported from Asia. Countries which are more self-sufficient in food are vulnerable to local harvest failure, as happened in the Sahel earlier this year.</p>

 Financial assistance from the UK to the Palestinian Authority (PA) is delivered through a Trust Fund administered by the World Bank. This makes disbursements to the PA conditional on progress in reforms to improve the efficiency of spending and reduce their need for aid in the future.

There was general agreement about the value of the service that Access to Work provides but that the programme should be more flexible; more available to those who are in need of most help; and that larger employers could contribute more.

 We are unable to estimate the number of people caring for a person receiving the middle rate care component of disability living allowance who are not in receipt of carer's allowance.

One of the things the review team examined was the impact of the reforms on business. David Yeandle, of the Engineering Employers' Federation, was part of the review team to ensure that business interests were well represented in the review process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para67"><a name="10113011000877">The review team recognised that easing burdens on business was important. So a number of their recommendations are aimed specifically at making things more straightforward for employers and we have accepted these recommendations in full. This includes:</p>
<a name="101129w0006.htm_brev3"><a name="10113011001179"><ul><p class="tabletext">Increasing the threshold at which an individual is automatically enrolled (currently £5,035 at 2006-07 prices) to align it with the PAYE tax threshold (£7,475 in 2011-12) and aligning the threshold at which contributions become payable (currently £5,035) with the national insurance contributions threshold (currently £5,715).</p>
</ul><a name="101129w0006.htm_brev4"><a name="10113011001180"><ul><p class="tabletext">A simpler way for employers to check that their defined contribution schemes meet the required standards.</p>
</ul><a name="101129w0006.htm_brev5"><a name="10113011001181"><ul><p class="tabletext">An optional waiting period of up to three months before an employee needs to be automatically enrolled.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para68"><a name="10113011000878">Such recommendations will give employers greater flexibility in how they implement the new requirements and will mean that there is a much more proportionate impact on employers. The increased earnings threshold and waiting period are particularly beneficial for smaller employers, as they tend to have more lower earners and higher staff turnover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para69"><a name="10113011000879">The review team recommended a range of further measures specifically aimed at helping smaller businesses including:</p>
<a name="101129w0006.htm_brev6"><a name="10113011001182"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ensuring that micro employers are aware that the design of NEST specifically takes account of their needs.</p>
</ul><a name="101129w0006.htm_brev7"><a name="10113011001183"><ul><p class="tabletext">Providing the maximum possible comfort to small employers that they will not be held liable for their scheme choice, particularly if they opt for NEST or a stakeholder pension scheme.</p>

 The relative effectiveness of the consumer prices index (CPI) and retail prices index (RPI) in measuring the increases in living costs for pensioners has been considered with regards to the coverage or "basket of goods" and methodology of each.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para72"><a name="10113011000884">The CPI excludes mortgage interest payments, which are not relevant to the majority of pensioners: only 7% of pensioners have a mortgage<sup>(1)</sup>. The RPI includes mortgage interest payments, which are variable and consequently can have a marked effect on that index. This means that in some years the RPI faces significant downwards or upwards pressure from a cost of living irrelevant to 93% of pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para73"><a name="10113011000885">For example, in the 12 months to September 2009 the RPI fell by 1.4%, leading to many pensions being frozen, for example additional state pensions, public service pensions and some occupational pensions. Without downwards pressure from mortgage interest payments, the RPI would have grown by 1.3%<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para74"><a name="10113011000886">In addition in terms of population coverage the RPI excludes a significant group of pensioners (pensioner households who receive 75% or more of their income from the state). The CPI includes those pensioners<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="101129w0006.htm_para75"><a name="10113011000887">The methodology used to calculate the CPI takes into account the fact that many people tend to trade down to cheaper goods when prices rise. This contributes a significant portion of the gap between the CPI and the RPI and is known as the "formula" or "substitution" effect.</p>

It will not under any circumstances exceed £335,000 plus the costs of assessment; but it may in the event be substantially less than £335,000 depending upon the view that the court takes of the reasonableness of the amounts claimed.</p>
