 Farms in Lancashire are in a relatively strong economic position. The predominant farms in Lancashire are Dairy, Less Favoured Areas (LFA) grazing livestock and non LFA grazing livestock and incomes on these farms are expected to have increased in 2008-09. In each of years 2003-04 to 2007-08 inclusive, incomes at the all farm types level were slightly higher in Lancashire than for the North West Government Office region as a whole.

To help local authorities do this, DEFRA operates an Air Quality Grant scheme, a capital grant for which local authorities bid. All local authorities are invited each year to bid for a grant. Applications are considered and, where successful, awards made towards the cost of air quality projects.

 The following figures show the reported number of thefts/losses of laptops from 2005. The recent increases should be seen against the background of a significant increase in the numbers of laptops in use; for example, the numbers of IBM laptops issued across the DEFRA network under the enabling contract has increased more than six fold from some 1,200 in 2005 to over 7,500 in 2009, as we have gradually replaced desktops with encrypted laptops to reduce environmental impacts and make it easier for staff to work remotely.</p>

 Distance food has travelled, on its own, is not a good measure of sustainability (AEA Technology (2005) The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator for Sustainable Development), but Government do want to address the environmental costs associated with the transport (as well as the production and consumption) of food&#151;such as carbon emissions and congestion. Government have been working with the food industry to identify ways of reducing the sector's environmental impacts overall, and in doing so, improving efficiency across the supply chain. In response to recommendations made in the Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (DEFRA, May 2006), the British Retail Consortium developed a set of commitments to reduce their members' environmental impacts and the Food and Drink Federation developed their Five-Fold Ambition. Both these initiatives set targets to reduce the environmental impacts of food transport in the UK. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) is also spearheading a voluntary initiative on 'sustainable distribution' for the food and grocery industry.</p>

 Council Directive (2002/3/EC) sets target values for ozone for the protection of human health and ecosystems, to be attained by 2010. Ground level ozone is formed when sunlight acts on nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and other atmospheric substances close to the ground. The pollutants that cause ground level ozone come from a range of sources including industry and combustion sources such as road transport and power generation. Ozone formation can take place over several hours or days and may arise from emissions thousands of kilometres away.</p>

The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol does the same for a larger group of countries under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe. The UK is currently below its 2010 VOC ceiling and is committed to meeting its NOx ceiling as soon as possible.</p>

 The Government believe that differences in charges relating to the method of payment should reflect the costs of servicing that method, and should not discriminate unfairly against any group of customers.

 Our present estimate is that, in round terms, of the emissions reductions in 2006 below the increase that would otherwise have occurred since 1990, structural changes in the economy linked to changing patterns of imports and exports were responsible for about 30 per cent. Improvements in energy efficiency accounted for about 20 per cent., lower carbon fuels about 25 per cent. (made up of 15 per cent. from the so-called dash for gas and about 10 per cent. from renewables and other lower carbon fuels). Lower emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 were responsible for some 25 per cent. The direct effect of Government policies overlaps with the estimates given above and is likely to have accounted for about 15 per cent. The effect of emissions trading in 2006 is not included in these estimates but if included would in 2006 have increased the emissions reduction by about 10 per cent.</p>

While the precise timing of the devolution of policing and justice is a matter for the Assembly, an agreed process is underway that will lead to the transfer of policing and justice powers, including responsibility for the criminal law relating to abortion.</p>

Virtually any analogue TV can be converted to digital with the addition of a set-top box. We recognise that some consumers may use digital switchover as an opportunity to upgrade their TV and/or to dispose of analogue TV equipment (TVs and recorders). Research undertaken for DEFRA and DTI in 2006 indicated that switchover was not expected to cause any significant overall increase in TV or recorder disposals. For example, it predicted a 1 per cent. increase in recorder disposals. There is no current evidence to show of additional disposal of equipment that can be attributed to digital switchover.</p>

The information you have requested for compliant non-resident parents in these categories is shown in the attached table. Compliance is defined as those non-resident parents in each quarter who have paid maintenance. Non-compliant non-resident parents are those from whom maintenance has been requested but who have not paid maintenance in the previous quarter. Therefore I have also included information on non-compliant cases assessed at the basic, reduced, flat rate maintenance for current scheme cases only in the attached table.</p>

This is a more accurate measure of the impact the Commission is having on improving the proportion of parents paying maintenance. I have therefore also set out the number of cases with a positive maintenance outcome under the categories you have requested in the attached Table 2.</p>
</ul><a name="90713w0012.htm_brev5"><a name="09071334001051"><ul><p class="tabletext">In addition to the information on basic, reduced and flat rate current scheme cases set out in the attached table, in the quarter to March 2009 there were 106,300 current scheme cases with a nil maintenance assessment.</p>

This information will be provided by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and will be for the latest available tax year. Maintenance liability will also be reviewed annually with updated information received from HMRC, ensuring that in cases where neither parent has reported a change of circumstances any change in gross income will be notified to the Commission.</p>
</ul><a name="90713w0012.htm_brev8"><a name="09071334001054"><ul><p class="tabletext">As with the current scheme, either parent will be able to notify the Commission of a change of circumstances which affects gross income and therefore maintenance liability. Cases with a change of circumstances which would trigger a review of a nil maintenance calculation can be reassessed without waiting for confirmation of the gross income from HMRC. It is intended that this new statutory maintenance scheme will be introduced from 2011, with existing cases moving to the new scheme over a period of 3 years.</p>

4. Third Party Debt orders in England and Wales instruct a third party to pay any funds owed to, or held on behalf of, the non-resident parent to the Agency instead. In practice this is typically used for banks and building societies.<br>
5. Charging orders in England and Wales are where a County Court Order for the legally recognised debt is attached to the equity in the non-resident parent's property. They are then unable to re-mortgage or sell the property without satisfying the debt. If they satisfy the debt by other means the charge is removed.<br>

The table shows that in a small number of boroughs, staffing numbers reduced between March 2008 and March 2009. In Merton, where the biggest reduction took place, this was due to the closure of the Wimbledon office. In other cases, reductions were due to the retrenchment of clerical posts and staff and work will also have moved from one office to another, within the same Jobcentre Plus district but across borough boundaries.<br>

 Tax credits are a carefully targeted system of financial support that provides the greatest help to the least well off families. Support is assessed on the basis of household circumstances, taking into account factors such as the number of children in the household and any disabilities, and only in very exceptional cases will families with very high incomes receive any support. No families with an income over &#163;80,000 a year are currently receiving tax credits, and the majority of families in receipt have incomes below &#163;20,000 a year.</p>

The results of that examination and analysis will, however, be crucial in guiding the selection of witnesses and the detailed questions that will then need to be answered. I expect our report will publish all the relevant evidence except where national security considerations prevent that.</p>
</ul><a name="90713w0023.htm_brev27"><a name="09071337001076"><ul><p class="tabletext">A particular suggestion which has been made is that the Inquiry might make an interim report, possibly on the run-up to the war, or up to the moment when the coalition assumed responsibility for Iraq's internal affairs. While I do not rule out the possibility, it seems to me clear that the causes and effects of particular phases of these events cannot simply be divided up so as to separate clearly one period from another. To take one obvious example, the existence or otherwise of weapons of mass destruction could not be established with any reliability until well after the conflict phase, after the work of the Iraq Survey Group and others had gone as far as it could, while before the event the outstanding possibility had significant implications for the military deployment into the initial conflict phase.</p>
</ul><a name="90713w0023.htm_brev28"><a name="09071337001077"><ul><p class="tabletext">Because we will need to give careful attention to what comes out of the consultation processes I have outlined, I am, as I said, not yet in a position to state in more detail exactly how we will conduct the Inquiry. It is however already clear to me that as much as possible of the work of the Inquiry as is consistent with fulfilling our remit should be conducted, or explained, in public.</p>

 It is important that all communities, including Muslims, that have been displaced by the conflict over the years are able to return to their homes as soon as possible. We regularly discuss this with the Sri Lankan Government. Our immediate concern remains the humanitarian needs of the 280,000 civilians displaced by the recent fighting who are still held in camps. We support the continued engagement by Walter Kälin, the UN Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, in addressing the needs of all displaced persons in Sri Lanka.</p>

<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Cause code</i><br>
The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. The field within HES counts only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode. The codes used are: W53, W54,<br>
W55, W57, W58. and W59.<br>

 Patient safety will be paramount in taking forward the work on generic substitution. It has long been the Department&#146;s policy to encourage generic prescribing where possible, for reasons of good professional practice and because of the opportunities for more effective use of national health service resources. However, we have always recognised that there are circumstances in which it may be clinically appropriate to prescribe a particular brand of drug even where a generic is available if the prescriber considers it essential for the patient to receive that specific product. This position will need to be maintained under any new specific proposals made as part of the work on generic substitution.</p>

1. Patients may qualify for an NHS sight test on more than one criterion. However, they would only be recorded against one criterion on the form. Patients are more likely to be recorded according to their clinical need rather than their age. For example, a patient aged over 60, with glaucoma, is likely to be recorded in the glaucoma category only. The count by eligibility is therefore approximate.<br>
2. The figures relate to the number of NHS sight tests and are not a count of individuals.<br>

 The National Programme for Information Technology (IT) is a long-term programme which presents an unprecedented opportunity to use YY to reform the way the national health service in England uses information, and to improve health services and patient care. As reported by the National Audit Office in May 2008, elements of the programme are already fully deployed across the NHS, some ahead of schedule.

 The Impact Assessment accompanying the Consultation Paper published by the Department on 8 May 2009 (www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51197.pdf) set out the estimated costs and benefits of the directive. Figures are not available for the specific cost to local authorities, although costs were included for public sector hirers of agency workers. Under a 12-week qualifying period for equal treatment, as agreed under the TUC/CBI agreement of 20 May 2008, the cost to public sector hirers was estimated to be between &#163;227 and &#163;337 million a year.</p>
