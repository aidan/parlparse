<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list, by country, for each of the past 10 years, the amount of state aid permitted by the European Commission to each EU country by sector.  [158326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The latest available information on expenditure of compatible state aid by member state can be found in the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Surveys on State Aid in the European Union on the European Commission website at www.europa.eu.int. Copies of all these surveys will be placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions he has had with EU colleagues on the Social Chapter.  [158611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Since fulfilling our manifesto commitment to end the UK opt out to the Social Chapter, the Government have participated at EU Council and other meetings at which measures brought forward under the Social Chapter have been discussed. I last met with EU colleagues on 20 December at the Employment and Social Policy Council.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what his Department's policy is regarding the purchase of <i>(a)</i> hydrocarbons and <i>(b)</i> other environmentally benign refrigerants to meet the refrigeration and other relevant energy needs of buildings and premises owned and leased by his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [160014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department's policy is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gasses, and other substances detrimental to the environment, from its buildings.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para0">When purchasing new or replacement equipment, the Department will therefore consider equipment using less environmentally damaging refrigerants where practicable.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which London headquarters building or premises owned or leased by his Department use <i>(a)</i> chlorofluorocarbons and <i>(b)</i> hydrochlorofluorocarbons for refrigeration and other relevant energy needs.  [160018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department has one HQ building, Kingsgate House, where a small proportion of the refrigeration and other energy needs are met using chlorofluorocarbons.




<P>
<P><I>1 May 2001 : Column: 548W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para1">Three HQ buildings (1 Victoria Street, 151 Buckingham Palace Road and Kingsgate House) have some of their refrigerant and other energy needs met by plant which requires the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to what extent his Department's headquarters buildings use hydrofluorocarbons for <i>(a)</i> refrigeration and <i>(b)</i> air conditioning; what amounts of hydrofluorocarbons have been purchased in each year since 1995; and what plans he has to phase out the (i) purchase and (ii) use of hydrofluorocarbons.  [160009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 One building (1 Victoria street) uses a small amount of hydrofluorocarbons for its refrigeration.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para2">Between the period April 2000 and March 2001 1 kg of hydrofluorocarbons was purchased. Data for previous years could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para3">When replacing plant which currently uses hydrofluorocarbons, the Department will consider plant using alternative refrigerants where practicable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Ryan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the current requirements for maternity pay and leave.  [160153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The responses to the consultation on the Green Paper "Work and Parents--Competitiveness and Choice" have confirmed that the existing rules for maternity pay and leave are unnecessarily complex for employers and employees. This complexity is particularly a problem for small businesses.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para4">Through the consultation process employers, their representatives, working parents and those representing unions and family groups have told us that they want to see simplification of these rules.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para5">I have responded to these strong calls for simplification by today publishing a framework for a simplified maternity pay and leave system, including an assessment of the likely benefits and costs of any changes.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para6">This new framework will deliver simplicity, certainty and improved planning time for both employers and employees. It sets out changes to the notification procedures and periods and unified and simpler qualification requirements.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para7">An integral part of the new system is the Government's decision, following the consultation, to allow mothers the choice to take up to a year's maternity leave in total. This was strongly supported by parents and their representatives. This will be another important step in the process of helping parents balance their work and home lives. It builds on the steps announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget Statement and by me, in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), on 25 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 280-81.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para8">I welcome comments on the framework and have placed copies of the document in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the terms of the settlement reached between the European Community and the United States of America concerning the importation of bananas from associated states of the Community and non- associated producers of bananas, together with the consequential effects on traditional imports from current and former members of the Commonwealth, and the consequent financial and social effects.  [158816]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para9">We have placed in the Library of the House copies of the "Understanding on Bananas", which sets out the basis of the agreement between the European Commission and the United States of America.
<P>

<a name="10501w01.html_para10">The new regime will enable Commonwealth banana-exporting countries in the Caribbean which have traditionally supplied the UK market to continue to do so. The precise quantities of bananas imported will depend on commercial decisions by banana traders. However, to the extent that contractions in the Caribbean banana sector which have been seen in recent years continue, it will remain essential that, in these countries, Community funds are used for viable development activities such as restructuring, diversification and safety net schemes to help cope with ongoing changes in the banana sector.

<a name="10501w01.html_para19">The practical measures on nuclear disarmament in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in July 1998 enabled the Government to show the commitment of the UK as a Nuclear Weapon State to make its own contribution to the goal of the global elimination of nuclear weapons. They included the reduction in the size of our deterrent and greater transparency about our nuclear and fissile material stockpiles. These SDR measures will help lay the ground for UK participation in multilateral negotiations when the conditions are right.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what inquiries <i>(a)</i> his officials and <i>(b)</i> the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down have conducted since 1 January 1997 into allegations that service personnel were duped into taking part in experiments at Porton Down when they believed that they were taking part in research to find a cure for the common cold; and when each inquiry was conducted.  [160061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Some research has been carried out in response to inquiries from former volunteers, parliamentarians and the Wiltshire police.
<P>

<a name="10501w02.html_para0">Many of the details of the trials that were undertaken at Porton Down are in the public domain, and papers in the Public Record Office. The subject has been covered in numerous publications. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has done selective research of the public record and the Porton archive in support of the Wiltshire police inquiry and the Volunteers helpline. However, there has never been an opportunity for MOD to conduct a full and thorough search of all the sources, in particular the Porton archives, which contain unpublished technical papers, the original experimental books, and other contemporary material.

[159542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There is no specific leaflet offering guidance to potential recruits on the compatibility of homosexuality and lesbianism with service in the armed forces. Such guidance pre-dated the change of policy announced in January 2000. The present version of the armed forces recruiting application form refers instead to standards of personal behaviour expected from all Service personnel. Such behaviour is governed by the Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct.
<P>

<a name="10501w02.html_para7">In introducing both the new policy towards sexual orientation and the Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct, the Department sought legal advice to ensure that the policies were within the law and respected the rights of the individual.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the initial teacher training providers that have not, in their admissions policy, accepted the equivalence to GCSE English and Maths of Curriculum 2000 Level Two Key Skills Qualifications in Communications and Application of Numbers.  [159287]<P>

<P>
<a name="10501w04.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 April 2001]:</i> This information is not held centrally. We do not require that initial teacher training (ITT) providers publish a list of those qualifications they accept as equivalent to GCSE English and maths. It is the responsibility of ITT providers to decide whether an applicant holds qualifications that meet the Secretary of State's entry requirements for courses of ITT, including those relating to the key skills of communication and the application of number. Qualifications must, however, be of the equivalent standard to a GCSE grade C, or above.

<P>
<a name="10501w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 I assume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to our target to increase by 20,000 the number of teaching assistant posts by 2002. Between 1999-2002 we are making available to local education authorities in England around &#163;350 million to meet the cost of recruiting and training the equivalent of 20,000 new teaching assistants. We have met our target a year earlier than expected--there has been a rise of over 25,000 full-time equivalent teaching assistants between 1999 and 2001. The appointment, training and deployment of teaching assistants are matters for schools and local education authorities to consider in the light of local needs and circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Mr. Taylor) of 9 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 764W, on student loans, if he will estimate the nominal rate of

interest required to hold the net present value of student loans at &#163;590 million, if the threshold of student loans repayment were increased to &#163;13,000.  [159543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The net present value of the estimated &#163;982 million income contingent loans issued in 1999-2000 to students domiciled in England and Wales is estimated to be &#163;590 million. The nominal rate of interest required to maintain this net present value with a threshold for repayment of &#163;13,000 per year is estimated to be around 3&#189; per cent. It should be noted that such calculations should be treated with caution, due to their dependence on the estimates of the resource cost of income-contingent loans. Any interest rate calculated will consequently be subject to some fluctuation.

<P>
<a name="10501w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 From September 2002, there will be a significant expansion of vocational opportunities for young people at Key Stage 4, with additional developmental funding of &#163;18 million in 2002-03 rising to &#163;20 million in 2003-04 being made available.

<P>
<a name="10501w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has no such plans. The appointment of a vice-chancellor is a matter for the governing body of an individual university to determine.

 In England, as of 16 March 2001, there were almost 70,000 students receiving EMAs in the 56 pilot local education authorities (LEAs). This number is constantly increasing as applications continue to be received by LEAs. Following is the information.

<P>
<a name="10501w04.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 On 30 March, my noble Friend the Minister for Education and Employment in the Lords made regulations allowing the Teacher Training Agency to make payments to any postgraduate currently in teacher training who did not qualify for a &#163;6,000 training bursary and who, in the Agency's opinion, has suffered financial hardship as a result. However, the Agency has since informed my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that unforeseen difficulties in setting up the hardship scheme would lead to any payments under the Regulations being delayed significantly beyond the start of the summer 2001 term.
<P>

<a name="10501w04.html_para0">The Regulations were designed to allow help to be offered this term to postgraduate trainee teachers whose courses began during the 1999-2000 academic year and who remain in training now, but are not eligible for any training bursary payments. Hon. Members from all sides of the House have made representations to my right hon. Friend about the hardship that this group of trainees has suffered as a result of being ineligible for the training bursaries. In view of this evidence, my right hon. Friend believes that it would be wrong to allow financial assistance to be delayed to an extent that might cause further disadvantage. Accordingly, he has decided that the trainees in question should be made eligible to receive full &#163;6,000 training bursaries with immediate effect, subject to the same conditions that apply to trainees whose courses began on or after 1 September 2000. My Department and the Teacher Training Agency are contacting training providers with details of these new arrangements.

 Fruit for the national school fruit scheme (NSFS) will be sourced from growers whose produce is grown according to the principles of integrated crop management, where pesticide inputs are minimised. In the case of United Kingdom fruit, only that from producers who meet the standards of the assured produce scheme will be used. Imported fruit used by the scheme will be required to meet similar standards.
<P>

<a name="10501w05.html_para5">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) was established in April 2000 to protect public health from risks which may arise in connection with the consumption of food, including risks caused by the way in which it is produced or supplied, and otherwise to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food.

the preparation of the fruit. The FSA and Chief Medical Officer have approved the development of the NSFS, and in particular the FSA has advised that it would not agree to the use of any pesticide if fruit or vegetables treated with it have to be washed or peeled to make them safe to eat.
<P>

<a name="10501w05.html_para6">The Chief Medical Officer's original precautionary advice about washing and peeling fruit and vegetables was issued in 1997 in the light of research and surveillance on pesticide residues conducted at the time.

However, the situation with pesticides has moved on and many of the pesticides of particular concern have been withdrawn or are undergoing review.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the revised meat inspection charging system that came into force on 2 April 2001 implements all the recommendations of the meat inspection charges task force (Maclean report) with one exception.
<P>

<a name="10501w06.html_para0">The exception was the recommendation that the FSA should carry out a full risk assessment of green offal inspection and veterinary involvement in ante-mortem inspection of young stock. The underlying intention was the removal of unnecessary burdens and costs (subject to amendment of the European Union Fresh Meat Directive) if the proposed assessment indicated that the procedures did not offer increased public health protection.
<P>

<a name="10501w06.html_para1">In its consultation package on the measures required to implement the recommendations of the Maclean task force, the FSA explained that the EU scientific steering committee is undertaking a risk assessment relating to all aspects of meat inspection in all member states. Any action that the European Commission proposes to take will depend on the committee's findings, and European legislation will be amended if required. In these circumstances the FSA considered that it would be unwise to act ahead of Europe on these issues. In addition, the FSA considered that the types of meat plants that would benefit from the removal of unnecessary inspections would, in any case, include those likely to benefit from the introduction of a revised inspection charging system based on headage payments.

 We are aware that there are variations in access to treatment across England. These may affect the number of mastectomies undertaken. The NHS Plan and the NHS Cancer Plan makes clear our targets to improve services to reduce variations. We have made available an additional &#163;255 million in this financial year to support the appointment of new consultants and help implement the National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidance to end the postcode lottery of care. In addition new equipment for diagnosis and radiotherapy is being targeted to reduce geographic variations in levels of service provision. Information relating to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are matters for the devolved assemblies.

 Key areas for the health related Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) research programme are epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, the investigation of different strains of TSEs, potential risks from blood and blood products and the decontamination of surgical instruments. Our total funding on TSE research for 2000-01 was in excess of &#163;30 million, of which &#163;4.0 million was for the Department's projects. For 2001-02, &#163;5.3 million has been allocated for the Department's funded research.

<a name="10501w06.html_para10">About 50 per cent. of all cases of meningococcal disease are laboratory confirmed, the rest are clinically diagnosed on the basis of symptoms only by the doctors treating the patient. Clinically diagnosed cases must also be reported to the PHLS and other laboratories and this enhanced surveillance allows estimates to be made of the total burden of meningococcal disease caused by each group.
<P>

<a name="10501w06.html_para11">The best estimate of the burden of group C meningococcal disease just before the introduction of the meningitis C conjugate vaccine, adjusted for under- reporting and non-typing, was 1,530 cases and 150 deaths in England and Wales in 1998-99. The vaccine has had a huge impact on the disease. During the last six months of 2000 cases in all under 18 years of age were reduced by 71 per cent. with reductions of up to 90 per cent. in those age groups immunised first.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has a duty to consult in regard to significant changes to services, and will take account of all representations made to him regarding any such issues. However, in most circumstances the naming of a hospital is not generally viewed as a significant change, and is therefore usually a matter for local management.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para1">Where the proposed name of the hospital includes a royal name or title, including the title "Royal", sovereign approval must be received. My right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the action being taken by the EU Commission to harmonise regulations on food supplements in member states.  [159180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w07.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The European Commission published an amended draft directive <sup>1</sup>  on food supplements on 19 March which takes into account a number of amendments proposed by the European Parliament. The directive would establish a framework for harmonised legislation covering the composition (vitamins and minerals which can be used and levels of use) and labelling of food supplements sold under food law. It would have no effect on products classified as medicines.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para2">Our view is that, in the interests of consumer choice, the market should be open to all food supplements which are safe and properly labelled. It also believes that the law should not prevent provision of true information unless it might mislead consumers. The Food Standards Agency, which is representing the Government in discussions on the proposal, is pressing this case in negotiations.

<P>
<a name="10501w07.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Moran: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the measures he has taken to tackle domestic violence since May 1997.  [159419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are committed to raising awareness of domestic violence and its impact on children, to tackling domestic violence on every front, and to ensuring that women and children are safeguarded and protected from abuse.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para3">In March 2000 we launched the "Domestic violence: A resource manual for health care professionals", and we are providing funding (from 2000-01 to 2002-03) under the Section 64 Scheme to the women's aid federation of England for their health and domestic violence awareness project to help implement the resource manual.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para4">Our NHS Direct East Midlands domestic violence pilot project aims to produce protocols for good practice, and train staff to be able to deal with victims of domestic abuse sensitively and refer them to appropriate agencies.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para5">We have also held preliminary discussions with representatives of the Royal Colleges to discuss a programme of education and training on aspects of domestic violence for health professionals.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para6">Recent work by the Department in relation to child protection in the context of domestic violence includes the "Making an impact--children and domestic violence training pack" which we published in 1998 to raise awareness about the impact on children of domestic violence and to develop professional understanding of how best to offer help and support.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para7">There is an undertaking in "Working together to safeguard children" our revised inter-agency guidance to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, published in 1999, to commission overview reports at least every two years, drawing out key findings of case reviews and their implications for policy and practice. The first overview report will have child protection in the context of domestic violence as its central theme. We have commissioned this report and it will be published later this year.




<P>
<P><I>1 May 2001 : Column: 575W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para8">In addition, we have provided Section 64 funding to a number of voluntary organisations for a range of projects designed to assist survivors of domestic violence and children caught up in such violence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w07.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent assessment he has made of the effect of shortages of the TB vaccine on the number of cases of TB; and if he will make a statement.  [158972]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w07.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> Our recommendation for the use of BCG vaccine is based on the advice of an independent expert advisory committee, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). They have advised that the degree of delay in children receiving their BCG would not be accompanied by significant public health risk.
<P>

<a name="10501w07.html_para9">The recent outbreak in Leicester is one such example. Nearly all the children involved in this outbreak had been immunised with BCG as babies or later. Unimmunised children in Years 10 and 11 had also been vaccinated in 1998 and 1999 before the national schools immunisation programme was interrupted. The temporary suspension of the schools BCG immunisation programme has not therefore been a factor.

We regret the current lack of progress in the talks but are confident that the UN will find a way to move the process forward. To that end we will continue to urge all those involved to be fully and positively engaged in the search for a solution.

 European democracy is strongest in the Parliaments within the member states. My right hon.

We secured agreement at Nice that the role of national parliaments would be one of the agenda items for the next intergovernmental conference.

<a name="10501w10.html_para0">At Nice we were also successful in securing the first ever increase in the voting strength of the UK in the Council of Ministers and acceptance of the democratic principle that votes should more fairly reflect population size.

 We remain deeply concerned about the situation in the refugee camps. We maintain regular contact with UNHCR and I discussed West Timor with Mr. Lubbers, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in Geneva on 22 March. Representatives from the British Embassy in Jakarta visited West Timor on 16-17 April to assess the situation there. Acquiring information in the field strengthens HMG's ability to influence the key players towards resolving the situation. We are also encouraging the UN to keep the situation in West Timor under review, so that UN agencies can resume operations in the camps as soon as possible.

<a name="10501w10.html_para1">The Indonesian Government have announced that from 21-24 May they will conduct a registration of the refugees remaining in West Timor with the aim of speeding up the

 One of the aims of franchise replacement is to secure improvements in facilities at stations.

 The current (1995) edition of Approved Document L indicates that if the relevant recommendations in BS 5422 (1990) for thermal insulation of heating and hot water pipes, ducts and vessels are adopted the requirements in the Building Regulations for this aspect of the conservation of fuel and power in buildings would be met. A consultation document on amendments to Approved Document L was published last summer and included references to the prospective new edition of BS 5422 (2001) for heating and hot water systems as before, and for air conditioning systems including their attendant chilled water and refrigerant services. These proposed amendments were accompanied by a regulatory impact assessment in which the beneficial effects of thermal insulation were taken into account, but BS 5422 was not explicitly identified. There was no adverse comment in the response to the consultation so the references to BS 5422 have been carried forward into the interim draft Approved Document L published on 9 April 2001.

 My right hon.

Those amendments did not require local authorities to undertake risk assessments before exercising the power. MAFF published a veterinary risk assessment on the risk of causing new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease if footpaths were open to the public on 22 March, which provided the basis of guidance to local authorities on reopening paths issued by MAFF on 28 March.

One of the Unit's key tasks will be to disseminate existing good practice to help authorities implement or pilot new ideas. It will help local authorities to set targets where appropriate, and to develop implementation programmes to meet those targets. As well as providing advice and

 We have today concluded a third group of local Public Service Agreements (PSAs). The agreements are with the following authorities: Camden, Coventry and Newham. The three signed today, taken together with recent signatories Milton Keynes, Newcastle and Surrey, mean that local PSAs have now been signed with all the 20 authorities that took part in the pilot scheme announced last summer.

<a name="10501w13.html_para5">Local PSAs will enable councils to deliver even greater improvements in services for local people. The targets set by councils have a direct impact on communities--from initiatives to tackle drug abuse among young people, dealing with abandoned vehicles, to strategies to reduce the number of deaths on the roads. We will be working with the pilot authorities and others to make them a success, and to roll out local PSAs to other upper-tier authorities over the next two years.

 The Government implemented Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996, with the exception of section 60 of the Act, in October 1997. Part IV of the Act provides for a single set of civil remedies to deal with domestic violence and to regulate occupation of the family home, through two specific types of order: the occupation order and the non-molestation order. These remedies are available at all levels of court (magistrates, county, High) with jurisdiction in family matters. The remedies are available to both men and women. A much wider range of people are able to apply for orders under Part IV than under the previous law. In addition, police powers to deal with domestic violence have been strengthened. Consideration is currently being given to the implementation of Section 60, which provides for third-parties to make applications under Part IV.

<P>
<a name="10501w14.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Rendering plants must meet a list of specifications, drawn up by the Ministry, in order to be permitted to receive carcases. It is crucial that all rendering plants used for the disposal of animals slaughtered as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak have adequate biosecurity measures in place. The Ministry also takes various factors into account when considering the use of a rendering plant, including the proximity of the nearest livestock holding and road access to the plant.
<P>

<a name="10501w14.html_para3">Any effluence from, and air exhausted by, the rendering plant is treated to kill the foot and mouth virus, and strict procedures are in place to ensure thorough cleansing and disinfection of all people and vehicles coming into contact with carcases.
<P>

<a name="10501w14.html_para4">Carcases for disposal at a rendering plant must be transported in leak-proof lorries. Leaks are checked for by part filling the lorries with water and tilting them to 30 degrees. All carcases are individually disinfected after slaughter and the lorries are covered with plastic sheeting, which is weighed down with straw or sawdust which is also heavily disinfected. The lorry is then covered with a tight fitting tarpaulin. This procedure reduces any risk of spread of the infection during transportation to a very low level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w14.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Pirbright Institute of Animal Health has informed the Ministry that the virus is inactivated at temperatures above 55 degrees centigrade. It is not possible to set a definite time required to reach this temperature. There may be small termo-resistant factions in which the virus survives up to 70 degrees, but the expert opinion is that these factions are insignificant in the possible spread of infection from pyres.
<P>

<a name="10501w14.html_para6">Once rigor mortis sets in (approximately 24 hours after slaughter) lactic acid accumulates, destroying the virus in the muscles. Carcases are sprayed with an approved disinfectant before being burnt which destroys a large amount of the virus, greatly reducing the risk of spread of infection from the outside of the carcase. These procedures ensure that much of the virus is destroyed before the pyre is lit, and reduces the risk of transmission of the disease via plumes from the pyre.

 On 1 February, the average price for clean lambs was 111.44p/kilogram liveweight. Liveweight sales are not currently taking place, but the average price reported by abattoirs slaughtering sheep for human consumption in the week ending 6 April (the latest week for which confirmed figures are available) was 193p/kilogram deadweight, equivalent to 91p/kilogram liveweight. Cows are not normally allowed to be slaughtered for human consumption and their market price is therefore determined by the rates of payment fixed under the over-30-months scheme. In February, the rate of payment was 50.936p/kilogram liveweight. The scheme is currently suspended but, were it operational, the rate for April would be 49.536p/kilogram liveweight. The change in rates results purely from movements in the euro/sterling exchange rate.

<P>
<a name="10501w14.html_spnew21"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 April 2001]:</i> We are conscious that there have been concerns about the ability of some farmers to dispose of animals through the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme. The scheme applies in Infected Areas as it does in all other parts of the country. Where premises are subject to more stringent restrictions, on-farm slaughter under the LWDS remains an option, and we are assessing applications to ensure that the most pressing welfare cases receive priority. We are endeavouring to maximise other avenues of disposal for animals in these areas, both in the LWDS and through slaughter for the market.

<P>
<a name="10501w14.html_spnew22"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 April 2001]:</i> The rates of payment for cattle entered into the over-30-months scheme are set by EU regulations.

In the meantime, cattle of all ages may be entered into the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme if the circumstances are appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10501w14.html_spnew23"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The UK and European Union import controls, based on recommendations in the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) International Animal Health Code, are designed to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases. This code sets out the conditions that will allow safe trade between countries of differing disease status.
<P>

<a name="10501w14.html_para8">The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country was in 1981. Investigations at the time indicated that the likely transmission of the virus was wind-borne from France. A range of controls to prevent the introduction of foot and mouth disease (e.g. on imports and waste food disposal) have therefore been effective for the last 34 years.
<P>

<a name="10501w14.html_para9">If the existing controls are fully observed, the probability of reintroduction of foot and mouth disease is low. In addition, my Department is looking at what lessons can be learned from the current outbreak. Including putting in place measures to strengthen our current controls.
<P>

<a name="10501w14.html_para10">Once the country is free of foot and mouth disease, and in the event of any future outbreaks, our control policy will be in line with the EC Foot and Mouth Control directive and OIE's recommendations for re-establishing disease free status.

 The Government recognise that this is a difficult time for farming, and has introduced a wide range of measures since 1997 investing around &#163;1.35 billion in the industry. This is over and above regular support for UK farmers available under the CAP, totalling about &#163;3 billion each year.
<P>

<a name="10501w15.html_para4">The CAP is clearly failing to deliver on its aim of ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community.

<a name="10501w15.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Government have agreed to transfer &#163;8.7 million per year for the next three years to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to enable them to implement the principal recommendations of the Maclean Task Force Report on charging for Meat Hygiene Service inspections in abattoirs and cutting plants. The Taskforce considered that in view of what it saw as a serious threat to small and medium-sized abattoirs and cutting plants, the Government should contribute to the costs of meat inspection in Great Britain. The Taskforce recommended that the Government should therefore change their policy of requiring the Meat Hygiene Service to recover as much as possible of its hygiene inspection costs from the meat industry (since this is not required by Eu rules on charging). It recommends that the current method of charging for meat inspections on an hourly basis should be changed and that, instead, all abattoirs and cutting plants should be charged the standard (headage) fees laid down in the EU Charges Directive or their actual inspection costs where these are lower.
<P>

<a name="10501w15.html_para7">Implementation of the Maclean recommendations will significantly reduce inspection charges levied on many small and medium-sized meat plants and will be of considerable benefit to rural communities.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effects of her Department's policies and actions on the constituency of Houghton and Washington, East since 2 May 1997.  [152995]<P>

 The Cabinet Office is responsible for a range of functions which cover England as a whole, or in relation to non-devolved matters, Great Britain or the United Kingdom. It is therefore not possible to say what their specific impact is on a particular constituency. Additionally any policy changes arising from reports by Cabinet Office units, such as the Social Exclusion Unit and the United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordination Unit, are implemented by the appropriate Government Department rather than by the Unit itself.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prison disorders have taken place in prisons in England and Wales during the last 12 months; and if he will list the prisons concerned.  [158387]<P>

<a name="10501w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The term "disorder" is understood as referring to incidents of concerted indiscipline. An incident is classified as concerted indiscipline when prisoners collectively: refuse to comply with a lawful order; or involve themselves collectively in disruption of an establishment's normal regime and the incident is not otherwise reportable in its own right, unless that reportable incident presents a wider threat to the good order or discipline of the establishment.
<P>

<a name="10501w16.html_para3">During the last 12 months, 103 incidents of concerted indiscipline have taken place in prisons in England and Wales. The prisons at which the disorders took place are listed in the tables:

<a name="10501w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The identification of suitable cluster areas for the dispersal of asylum seekers and their dependants is based on research conducted centrally by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). Information is obtained from local authorities and other organisations with an interest in asylum. The presence of asylum seekers already in the area will also be taken into consideration.
<P>

<a name="10501w17.html_para0">Only asylum seekers who request that accommodation be provided as part of a support package will be considered for dispersal. Asylum seekers making their claim in one dispersal area may, if they request accommodation, be required to move to another which is more suitable for their needs. An asylum seeker requesting support including accommodation who is already resident in a dispersal area may be housed here by NASS if his circumstances make this appropriate.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is responsible for the commission and finance of accommodation for asylum seekers. The voluntary sector supplies initial emergency accommodation for asylum seekers while their application for support is being considered.

 The probation service does not have any obligation to provide support to such former prisoners since they are not on licence. However, where resources permit, they may be prepared to do so on a voluntary basis. The Government understand the difficulties that such former prisoners may face in resettling in the community and the Home Office has set up a working party to look at what might be needed, in terms of advice and counselling. A consultant has prepared a report and recommendations will go to Ministers by the summer.

 The most significant aspect of violence against women is domestic violence. It is a serious and abhorrent crime which the Government are determined to tackle effectively, and we have made it one of our key priorities. We have emphasised that the domestic context in which it occurs is an aggravating not a mitigating factor and that it is an issue which we expect the local crime reduction partnerships set up under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to cover in their audits of local problems and strategies for addressing them.
<P>

<a name="10501w18.html_para0">Since coming to office, we have undertaken a broad range of measures to reduce the level of domestic violence and strengthen support for victims.
<P>

<a name="10501w18.html_para1">I have mentioned the Crime and Disorder Act; other early measures were implementation of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and of Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996. We followed this with the successful "Break the Chain" publicity and awareness campaign for domestic violence survivors and those who might be able to help them.
<P>

<a name="10501w18.html_para2">Within the last year we have: issued multi-agency guidance to agencies dealing with domestic violence and specific guidance to Health Service professionals; issued a new Home Office circular to the police; included domestic violence within police Best Value performance indicators; provided &#163;120 million additional capital funding for a new Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund for specified vulnerable groups, including the survivors of domestic violence; and, increased funding for Victim Support.
<P>

<a name="10501w18.html_para3">Last summer we provided &#163;7 million under the Crime Reduction programme for a violence against women initiative addressing domestic violence and rape and sexual assault by known assailants.

We have made excellent headway in tackling child poverty by helping parents back into work and ensuring that hard working families are rewarded through increases to the Working Families Tax Credit, and through the new Children's Tax Credit. All families with children have benefited from increases to Child Benefit. On 26 April, we outlined proposals to break the long-term cycle of disadvantage by setting up the new Child Trust Fund, starting at birth, with further investments at five, 11 and 16, to give young people a savings base with which to start their adult lives.
<P>

<a name="10501w18.html_para6">We have simplified and increased significantly maternity leave and pay, and announced the introduction of paternity pay ensuring that parents can spend time together as a family after the birth of a new baby. Parental leave provisions enable parents to take unpaid leave during the first few years of the children's lives. The National Childcare Strategy and free early education places for all four and many three-year-olds are providing an increasing number of high quality places for children, to enable parents to work. The Worklife Balance Campaign encourages employers to adopt flexible working practices which will enable employees to achieve a better work-life balance.

<P>

<a name="10501w18.html_para10">Predicted two-year reconviction rates used in the measurement of Public Service Agreement targets are not statistical forecasts, but are adjustments made once actual reconviction rates are known which make allowances for variations in the age, sex, offence and previous criminal history profile of persons commencing community sentences. These factors are known to be associated with the risk of re-offending. The purpose of the "predicted" rate is to ensure that comparisons between the reconviction rate when an improvement target was set and the reconviction rate when improvement is measured are meaningful.

 The final operational phase of the Airwave pilot, which started on 19 March, is continuing satisfactorily despite some technical problems. The service is now available in the two Divisions of Lancashire which are the subject of the evaluation. An interim review of the pilot began on 30 April and the final evaluation will be completed within five working days of pilot completion on 17 June.

 The Forensic Science Service has completed the latest round of tests in the re-examination of materials from exhibits in the Hilda Murrell murder investigation. The tests have not produced any significant DNA profile which advances the investigation at this stage. However, the results suggest that there is a realistic prospect that the next level of testing may produce a profile. In line with a strategy of sequential testing

 The identification of suitable cluster areas for the dispersal of asylum seekers and their dependants is based on research conducted centrally by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). Information is obtained from local authorities and other organisations with an interest in asylum. Before entering into a contract with an accommodation provider NASS consults local authorities through the regional consortia. Local authorities receive weekly information of the numbers of asylum seekers dispersed to their area.

 Work is in progress to develop an electronic custody system. Implementation within all forces is likely to be achieved within two calendar years of a product becoming available. There is currently no planned date for a custody product to be available. Development costs of the application have been at the suppliers own risk. Internal project costs are estimated as being approximately &#163;2 million. Central government is to provide &#163;46 million to implement the custody and an electronic case preparation system once plans have been agreed. The original delivery date for the custody application was August 2000 with roll-out to all forces by December 2002.

 In the light of evidence about the particular risks posed to the effective operation of our immigration controls by some members of certain ethnic groups, I have made an authorisation permitting members of the Immigration Service to discriminate, where necessary, in the examination of passengers belonging to the following ethnic or national groups: Tamils, Kurds, Pontic Greeks, Roma, Somalis, Albanians, Afghans and ethnic Chinese presenting a Malaysian or Japanese passport or any other travel document issued by Malaysia or Japan.
<P>

<a name="10501w21.html_para1">The decision on a passenger's entitlement to enter the United Kingdom will continue to be taken on the merits of the case in accordance with the Immigration Rules. The authorisation simply allows the Immigration Service to prioritise and manage its resources effectively in undertaking examinations necessary in order to reach that decision.
