To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what progress has been made in relation to the Review of Trust Ports in Northern Ireland announced on 26 August 1997; and if she will make a statement.  [41803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80512w01.html_spnew0"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The Review of Trust Ports in Northern Ireland which I announced last year has now been concluded. In general, the review findings serve to reinforce the strategic importance of the commercial Trusts Ports in relation to the Northern Ireland economy. However the review has identified the need to broaden and extend the powers of the commercial Trust Ports and to ease the financial controls under which they currently operate, to enable them to meet the challenges of the future. Further detailed consideration will now be given to these recommendations with a view to bringing forward suitable legislation at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para0">During the course of the review, Belfast Harbour Commissioners submitted to the Department of the Environment (NI) a proposal for the future development of the Port of Belfast. This followed careful consideration by the Commissioners of a range of possible future options. BHC's preferred option envisaged the transfer of the Port to the private sector by means of a placed flotation and the establishment of a public/private partnership, through the retention by the Government of a golden share in the successor company.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para1">The Harbour Commissioners consider that such a change to the status of the port is necessary to assure its long-term viability and competitive position, and offers the benefit of enabling the successor company to raise private equity and debt to finance its future development. The golden share arrangement is intended to ensure that the wider interests of the Northern Ireland economy are safeguarded.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para2">The Department accepts that transfer of the port to the private sector and the establishment of a public/private partnership, as outlined in BHC's proposal, represents the best option for the future and will enable the port to realise its full commercial potential. Accordingly the Department has today conveyed to BHC its agreement, in principle, to the proposal (subject to certain conditions) and invited the Commissioners to further develop the proposal with a view to bringing forward a Scheme for the Department's detailed consideration. Under the Ports (NI) Order 1994, any such Scheme will be subject to public consultation.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para3">There are no plans to change the current status of any other Trust Ports in Northern Ireland. However, following the review, in addition to widening the powers and easing the financial controls on the other commercial Trust ports,

<P>
<P>
<a name="80512w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Donaldson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans she has to introduce legislation for Northern Ireland containing provisions similar to those of the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>].  [40635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80512w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Different local administrative and legislative arrangements limit the applicability of much of the Crime and Disorder Bill to Northern Ireland. However, a small number of provisions will be introduced to Northern Ireland by means of a negative resolution clause in the Bill. These are the sex offender order, the drug treatment and testing order, TV links for pre-trial hearings, the abolition of <i>doli incapax</i> and powers for youth courts to deal with unrelated charges. In addition, should Parliament decide to retain the clause, introduced in the House of Lords, which abolishes the death penalty in respect of treason and piracy, then the relevant legislation in respect of Northern Ireland will be repealed by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para4">The potential impact of the remaining provisions will be assessed, taking account of experience in England and Wales, in order to determine whether similar measures should be incorporated in future Northern Ireland legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many and what proportion of her Department's appointees to non-departmental public bodies are (i) aged under 25, (ii) aged 25 to 30 and (iii) aged 31 to 35 years.  [40734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80512w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. Dates of birth of appointees were not recorded before 1 July 1996, the date on which the Guidance of the Commissioner for Public Appointments took effect. Details covering the period 1996-97 are available in the Secretary of State's First Annual Report on Public Appointments, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para5">The Government are committed to encouraging a wide range of candidates, including young people, to apply for positions on public bodies. This includes encouraging more young people to put themselves forward as potential candidates for public appointments. All appointments are made on merit, and candidates must demonstrate that they have the necessary skills and experience to match the needs of the public body on which they wish to serve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what response he has made to the Football Task Force report into racism in football.  [41866]<P>

<P>
<a name="80512w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 I welcome and fully support the practical recommendations made in the Task Force's report, which I believe can make a significant contribution to eliminating racism within the game. I have written today to the bodies identified in the report, asking them how they intend to take the measures relevant to them forward, and seeking a clear timetable for action.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para10">There are two specific recommendations that fall to Government: that the Football Offences Act 1991 should be amended to make racist abuse by individual spectators an offence; and that schoolchildren should have access to playing fields on a regular basis.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para11">The Government will be amending the Football Offences Act 1991 as soon as legislative priorities allow. There is no suitable legislative opportunity available at this time. In the meantime, the Home Office has written to all chief police officers in England and Wales reminding them of existing powers under the Public Order Act 1986, which makes it an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with the intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress to the person to whom such words or behaviour are directed.
<P>

<a name="80512w01.html_para12">The Government recognise that schoolchildren should have access to playing fields to enable them to participate in a range of sports. We recently announced how we will protect existing playing fields needed by schools and communities through new legislation requiring schools to seek consent for the sale of playing fields and by tightening planning controls.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80512w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The best estimates of the numbers of active professional divers in Great Britain come from the numbers of medical examinations notified to the Health and Safety Executive by approved medical examiners of divers under the Diving Operations at Work Regulations 1981 and the Diving at Work Regulations 1997. These figures are readily available only from 1989 and are shown in the table. Information for the period between 1985 and 1989 could be obtained only at disproportionate expense.

<a name="80512w02.html_para2">The medical condition causing divers to fail their medicals is reported to the Health and Safety Executive, but not the cause of that condition. The conditions are often those prevalent in the general population, for example hypertension, which may, or may not, be attributable to diving. It is not, therefore, possible to state which of the failures were the result of conditions caused by diving. The numbers of divers failing their medicals from 1989 is shown in the table.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 1998]:</i> I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Mr. Lawrie Haynes, to write to my hon. Friend.

<a name="80512w02.html_para6"><i>Letter from Lawrie Haynes to Helen Jones, dated 12 May 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Transport Minister, Glenda Jackson has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the effects of the proposed new Junction 8 on the M62 on the traffic flows and related pollutants on the A49 in Warrington. The proposal for a new junction is linked with that to widen the M62 between Junctions 8 to 9 and all the information given in this reply assumes that the full scheme is implemented.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have carried out air quality assessments at two locations adjacent to the A49 in Warrington: Winwick Link junction, north of M62, and Forton Leisure Centre, south of the motorway.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the northern location, traffic related pollutant concentrations are currently well within air quality standards and will remain so by the year 2003, with or without the construction of M62 New Junction 8.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Concentrations of particulates south of the motorway are within air quality standards but, because of the large volume of traffic on the A49, standards for carbon monoxide, benzene and oxides of nitrogen are already exceeded. However, by the year 2003, tighter emission controls which have already been introduced on new vehicles are expected to bring about an improvement, and traffic relief from the introduction of the new junction would mean that levels of all pollutants would be significantly lower than would otherwise be the case. Oxides of nitrogen are, however, still expected to exceed current standards with or without scheme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Taking the busiest peak hour, and assuming high growth in order to present a worst case, the estimated traffic flows on the A49 in Warrington are:</FONT></UL>

We support local authorities efforts with funding from the annual local transport budget, based on their Transport Policies and Programme submissions. This year, over 70 package bids are being supported, all containing cycling measures. We also provide technical support through an extensive range of Traffic Advisory Leaflets and other publications on cycling, and in response to day-to-day inquiries.

<a name="80512w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Copies of letters patent issued over the great seal between 1617 and 1831 could be enrolled in the Chancery patent rolls. Under the Public Records Act 1958, these patent rolls are open for consultation by the public in the Public Records Office.
<P>

<a name="80512w04.html_para4">Not all letters patent were thus enrolled and the system of enrolment broke down between 1648 and 1659, for which period few rolls survive. Original letters patent over the great seal were issued to the person to whom the grant was made. They thus passed into private hands, and were not subject to public holdings arrangements.

All appointments are made on merit, and candidates must demonstrate that they have the necessary skills and experience to match the needs of the public body on which they wish to serve.

 <i>[holding answer 30 April 1998]:</i> Planned income generated by activities in prison industries and farms is included in the voted provision contained in the annual Supply Estimate for the Prison Service as part of the receipts appropriated in aid of the gross expenditure borne on the Estimate. The relevant level of appropriations in aid is included in the budget allocated to each prison. We are shortly to issue guidance on new arrangements which will give governors greater flexibility to take up commercial opportunities which develop during the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80512w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Immigration Rules, set out in House of Commons Paper 395, provide for a British Overseas citizen to be granted indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom if he or she is in possession of a special voucher. This provision applies equally to both men and women.
<P>

<a name="80512w05.html_para0">A British Overseas citizen may be issued with a special voucher if he or she fulfils a number of requirements, one of which is that the person concerned is the head of their household. Women will be considered to be the head of their household if they are single, widowed, divorced or married to a man who is incapable of fulfilling the role of head of household for medical reasons, in accordance with a House of Lords ruling that this is not unlawful under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.

<a name="80512w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have no plans to ratify Protocol 4 at present. Ratification will be possible only if potential conflicts with our domestic laws can be resolved. There is a particular concern in relation to Article 3(2) of the Protocol, which protects the right of nationals not to be excluded from their home state. This could be taken as conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom on various categories of British nationals who do not have it.

<UL>(2) how many published and internal papers have been written by his Department on the health effects of CR gas sprays since 1991; and what are the current security classifications of the internal reports.  [38608]<P></UL>

<a name="80512w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 CR (Dibenz (b.f)-1:4-oxazepine) was considered in a report by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, commissioned by the Home Office, which reviewed the toxicology of CS (Orthochlorobenzylidene Malonitrile). The report, which was produced in December 1994, is unclassified and copies have been placed in the Library. The Home Office has not produce any other published or internal reports on CR.
<P>

<a name="80512w06.html_para0">Incapacitants considered in the 1994 report apart from CS and CR were CN (chloroacetophenone, commonly known as Mace) and oleoresin capsicum (commonly known as pepper spray). None of the alternatives to CS is considered to be an appropriate incapacitant for use by police officers in this country.

 One of the recommendations made in the Independent Review of the Armed Forces' Manpower, Career and Remuneration Structures by Sir Michael Bett was that promotion to 5-star rank should cease in peacetime. There is now no serving officer at Field Marshal rank. There are, however, eight retired Field Marshals retained on the active list. In terms of continuing duties and obligations some have retained honorary appointments connected with the Army which tend to be ceremonial and do not involve official commitment. These are: Constable Tower of London, Master Gunner St. James's Park, Vice Lord Lieutenant Wiltshire and Lord Lieutenant Greater London. In addition, two members of The Royal Family hold the honorary rank of Field Marshal, as does HM The King of Nepal.

 Young people on the New Deal for 18-24 year olds, who wish to train to work with children, can work towards an NVQ level 3 childcare qualification during their New Deal placement, if their previous experience and qualifications are appropriate. If they gain an NVQ level 2 or 3 qualification, this will help them find employment whether in the voluntary sector, private sector or with a local authority. There is currently no formal requirement within the Children Act 1989 that childcare workers should have qualifications, but, in

<P>

<a name="80512w08.html_para2">In some areas, individual local authorities have introduced, through their discretionary powers, requirements of registration to the effect that providers must either have, or be working towards, certain qualification levels. This should not, however, prevent childcare providers, including local authorities, from employing these young people under supervision, after their New Deal placement ends. Moreover, the local New Deal partnership may be able to arrange for the young person to work towards an NVQ level 3 qualification, after their New Deal placement ends, as part of the New Deal 'follow through' strategy. This could be arranged through the Training and Enterprise Council, using funding from the employer, or other sources--for example, the Single Regeneration Budget and the European Social Fund.

The estimated cost of preparing the temporary accommodation for use by the Parliament and for rent and rates over a 2-year period is estimated at &#163;6 million. This does not include heating, lighting, security or other building-related costs, or the provision of IT and broadcasting equipment, furniture and services. These costs are still being assessed.

 In view of the unacceptable situation experienced last year, in which students experienced very considerable delays in the processing of their applications for awards, I requested a Review of the Agency's operation arrangements; and established an independent Steering Committee, under the Chairmanship of Mr. G. Wilson CB, Head of The Scottish Office Education and Industry Department, to oversee the review. I asked for a report by April.
<P>

<a name="80512w09.html_para3">The Steering Committee reported to me on schedule, with a statement covering the Review report. The problems identified in relation to last year were difficulties with the new computer system and inadequate staff resources (as a result of staff reductions which took place during the period for the previous Government) to deal with the consequences of these difficulties. I am arranging for copies of the report and statement to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses; and to be made publicly available.

 Protection Orders are first and foremost intended to provide greater public access to angling.

Furthermore, arising from the Budget on 17 March, we have made an additional &#163;3.5 million available to the FEFCW to set up an 'Education for Industry Challenge Fund' to meet local adult skills needs and develop outreach provision. This amounts to a total of over &#163;10 million of new money to the further education sector.

<a name="80512w10.html_para2">Many small rural businesses looking to expand, but unable to take the initial risk of recruiting additional employees, will benefit from the employer subsidy available under the New Deal for 18-24 year olds. This, working in tandem with the Sole Traders Initiative, will encourage the self-employed to create new jobs. Others will be created under the self-employment route of the New Deal for 18-24 year-olds where young people can receive the support and guidance needed to set up their own businesses.

<P>
<a name="80512w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) is owned by the Department and is a powerful research and analytical tool. It is one of a number of data sources available to the Department, each of which has its strengths and limitations for specific purposes. For example, because of its general practice focus, the GPRD is well suited for many drug safety and pharmaco- epidemiological studies. However, because it is based on a sample of general practices, it is less valuable for making comparisons between health authorities. This would limit its use in resource allocation or in 



<P>
<P><I>12 May 1998 : Column: 98</I><P>
understanding waiting list issues at local level. The GPRD's lack of socio-economic data is also a factor in the way it can be used.
<P>

<a name="80512w12.html_para5">Data from the GPRD are published in <i>Key Health Statistics from General Practice</i> <sup>1</sup> , and extracts have also been used in the Chief Medical Officer's Annual Report.

The Medicines Control Agency, which is responsible for medicines regulation, uses data from the GPRD to investigate and evaluate drug safety issues.

Provisional waiting list/time information for 31 March 1998, based on the well-established series of quarterly returns from health authorities and trusts, will be published in week commencing 18 May 1998.

 It is open to the Access Committee for England (ACE) to apply for funding for projects under the general section 64 grant scheme administered by the Department for the financial year 1999-2000 onwards. Each project application will be considered carefully in the light of its likely furtherance of the Department's objectives, other applications received and the amount of money available. The decision was taken in March this year, following an inter-departmental review, not to renew core funding for ACE from the current financial year (1998-99). This was in line with our policy of time-limiting core grants of which all voluntary organisations receiving support from the Department under section 64 have been made aware. It is, therefore, unlikely that any future application for core funding from ACE would be successful.

 The theme of the UK Presidency is employability. We have been clear from the outset that this means the employability of women as well as men. That is why we called the meeting of EU Ministers for Women which we held in Belfast on 5-6 May.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From its launch in 1993, the Agency has taken on just under 2.4 million cases. In the last year, the Agency has started to clear the backlog of cases that had built up during the Agency's first two years, with the emphasis being on completing full maintenance assessments. The Agency's increased performance in this area is 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>12 May 1998 : Column: 104</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>well illustrated by the number of full maintenance assessments completed; in 1997/98 up to 31 January 1998, 132,724 full maintenance assessments had been completed compared to 97,542 for the same period the previous year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency is very aware of the need to assess maintenance applications as quickly as possible, and in 1997/98 had a Secretary of State target covering this area which included a volume element for the first time. The target required a total of at least 525,000 maintenance applications to be cleared; 60% of new maintenance applications to be cleared within 26 weeks and on 31 March 1998 no more than 5% of all maintenance applications received by the Agency to be over 52 weeks old. The volume element of the target was exceeded by 13% with 595,000 clearances achieved, a significant increase on clearances of 357,000 in 1996/97. Both percentage targets were also met. 71% of new applications were cleared within 26 weeks, against an achievement of 54% in 1996/97. This represented a total of 278,180 applications cleared within 26 weeks, an increase of 52% over the previous year. At the end of 1997/98, less than 5% of all applications received since the Agency's inception were over 52 weeks old. This was a major improvement on last year, when the target to have no more than 10% of cases over a year old was missed. The 1998/99 Secretary of State target requires 65% of new applications to be cleared within 22 weeks and on 31 March 1999 there to be no applications outstanding over 52 weeks old.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

Any maintenance application which is over 52 weeks old is considered to form part of the Agency's backlog--the large majority of these applications are a legacy from the difficult first two years of the Agency. At the beginning of 1997/98 the number of backlog applications amounted to 224,714; this has more than halved to 110,117 at 31 March 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency has developed and is now implementing a strategy for meeting its undertaking to clear all its backlogs. All Business Units have put in place operational plans which will guide them towards the achievement of our stated objective of clearing all the backlogs by 31 March 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are constantly looking at how we can adapt and improve our procedures to speed up the time taken to clear maintenance applications. The timescales for clearances have shortened considerably over the last 2 years. The Agency is now building more pro-active use of the telephone into its assessment process; an increased use of the telephone to gather information, should have a positive impact on timescales.</FONT></UL>

 Iraq's record on human rights is appalling, as our annual report on human rights made clear.

We and our EU partners are of the view that a political settlement is essential to bring to an end the suffering of the Sudanese people. As Presidency, we issued an EU Declaration on 1 May which voiced European concerns and called for an immediate cease-fire. At UK instigation, Sudan was discussed at the UN Security Council on 5 May and a press statement was made by the President expressing the UN's concerns. We have lobbied countries in the region to bring pressure to bear on all parties in the civil war to reach a comprehensive negotiated settlement at the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace talks held in Nairobi on 2 to 5 May.

 Our High Commission in Islamabad is monitoring Ayub Masih's case closely. His lawyers have lodged an appeal in the Punjab High Court against his sentence. I was shocked to hear of the suicide of Bishop John Joseph on 6 May, apparently in protest at Ayub Masih's sentence. Our High Commission has sent condolences to his family and community.

 This Department has had a long-standing programme of interchange with business. We aim to build on this. Last July, we announced a new programme of short-term business attachments to our missions overseas of business people to work on specific projects. The 14 recruited so far have added their expertise to our commercial effort. We also open some longer-term positions within this Department, at home and overseas, to business people. In addition, we second FCO staff to companies so that they can gain first-hand business experience.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs which body has final jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation of framework decisions taken under the proposed Article K.6(2)(b) and (c) of the Treaty of Amsterdam where Her Majesty's Government under Article K.7 does not accept a preliminary ruling of the European Court of Justice.  [41507]<P>

<P>
<a name="80512w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1998]:</i> Article K.7(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, confers jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of framework decisions and decisions adopted by the Council pursuant to Article K.6(2)(b) and (c). By virtue of Article K.7(2) a Member State may choose whether or not to accept that jurisdiction. Since the Government do not intend to accept that jurisdiction, if a framework decision or decision adopted pursuant to Article K.6(2)(b) or (c) fell to be interpreted by the British courts, the House of Lords would ultimately be the Court of final jurisdiction as far as the United Kingdom was concerned.

 As far as I am aware, none of my Department's public appointments is held by people aged under 25; three are held by those aged 25-30 and 51 by those aged 31-35.

<P><I>12 May 1998 : Column: 114</I><P>
sent from Georgia to Dounreay. For the majority of the material which is unirradiated, Tests 4 and 5 are relevant, in that useful material with a positive economic value to the UK can be recovered from it. Based on these tests alone, there would be an expectation that wastes produced would be returned to the country of origin. This is also true of the wastes arising from the reprocessing of the small quantity of spent reactor fuel.
<P>

<a name="80512w17.html_para3">However, Tests 9 and 12 are overriding for the whole consignment in that the quantity of radioactive waste arising would be too small for the recovery processes to be practicable in the country of origin. Furthermore, Georgia could not reasonably be expected to develop suitable disposal facilities of its own for such a small amount of waste. Test 10 is also relevant in that the material accepted does not significantly add to the wastes needing to be disposed of in the UK.

 An understanding of the UK's position in the global information age is essential for development of relevant and timely government policies, and is an important tool for UK companies in benchmarking their own development. This is why the Department of Trade and Industry has been carrying out a series of benchmarking studies, as part of the Information Society Initiative (ISI), to compare progress in the UK with other major economies (USA, Japan, Germany, and France). Today I published the latest report 'Moving into the Information Age--International Benchmarking Study 1998' and copies have been place in the Library of the House. Copies of the 1998 report (and last year's report) are also available by calling the ISI Business Infoline on 0345 15 2000, or by e-mailing info@isi.gov.uk, or through the ISI website at http://www.isi.gov.uk.
