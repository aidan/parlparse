 The community safety unit of the Northern Ireland Office has allocated a total of &#163;6.175 million to Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) to deliver local initiatives and projects over the 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 financial years. The indicative allocation for each CSP has been determined using a funding formula which takes account of population, levels of recorded crime and deprivation in each locality. As part of these funding arrangements, CSPs are required to submit annual action plans supported by a strategic assessment of local needs and to agree to a set of terms and conditions. In addition, they have been directed to take cognisance of the NIO Safer Communities Public Service Agreement Key Performance Indicators around reducing antisocial behaviour incidents and violent crime and to contribute to a range of regional priorities for community safety.</p>

 In terms of key performance indicator 6, which deals with the proportion of small claims (claims up to &#163;5,000) that are dealt with other than by a hearing (settlement), Kent has increased from 52.4 per cent. at the end of 2007-08, to 55.1 per cent. for the first six months of this year. Increased administrative support is being given to the Kent small claims mediator to improve the throughput of civil cases where the parties believe that mediation outside the courtroom may lead to settlement.</p>

Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, Kent has taken the following steps to improve the performance. On small claims cases, deputy district judge sittings have increased by an additional 66 days to improve performance. Greater use is being made of listing a block of cases before two or more district judges sitting on the same day at the same location, thus utilising judicial time more effectively. A pilot exercise is being undertaken whereby the Kent small claims mediator attends that same court to offer on-the-spot mediation to parties awaiting hearing who wish to take advantage of this free mediation service. Closer scrutiny of the reasons for cases not meeting target will be carried out by court managers from December 2008.</p>

A review of all multi-track cases at Canterbury county court was recently carried out by the designated civil judge to ensure that cases were being dealt with in a timely manner and not incurring avoidable delay.</p>

During the first part of the year in Kent, a number of county court manager roles were covered on a temporary basis at Canterbury (seven months), Medway (ongoing temporary promotion), and Tunbridge Wells (temporary promotion, four months), as well as at Maidstone county court. The majority of court manager vacancies are now filled and with the training of new staff that has taken place, improvement in the management of administrative process at these sites is anticipated.</p>

These recommendations are now being considered by the area director and the designated civil judge with a view to realigning judicial resource where appropriate to bring improvement in performance across all areas of civil work.</p>

 It is the Government's policy that HIPs should be available on the first day of marketing. The temporary concession to the policy served a valuable role in smoothing the introduction of HIPs. However, evidence from our area trials, consumer focus groups and gathered through our on-going monitoring of HIPs indicates that consumers are not being shown the HIP and that is in part due to the temporary exemption from the policy. Our decision is also supported by research from Europe Economics, which shows that HIPs have no impact on house prices or transactions.</p>

The first of these sets mandatory upper limits on permissible rolling resistance of tyres for passenger cars, light goods vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles in two stages.

The new strategy was published in June 2008, and included the report from the taskforce, which gave options for changes to carer&#146;s allowance.

1. Interpretation of this data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the Nomis website at:<br>
https://www.nomisweb.co.uk<br>
2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately the job opportunities actually available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

 The consultation period ended on 22 October 2008. The consultation asked specifically how we might reform Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit to provide better support to help people adjust to their new circumstances while maintaining the work focus of the modern welfare state, whether lump sum payments are a good way of meeting people&#146;s needs, whether they give people more choice and control and whether we could make more use of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_549"><a name="81216w0017.htm_para4"><a name="0812172001206">In the White Paper published on 10 December we have made it clear that while some respondents to the Green Paper consultation supported the principle of lump sum payments for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits customers, others commented that there was a need for ongoing support for some people injured or made ill by work, particularly for those with serious progressive illnesses. We believe that there remains a strong case for continuing to provide particular support for people whose disability arises from work and we think the current Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits scheme is the best way to do this.</p>

1. Interpretation of this data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the Nomis website at https://www.nomisweb.co.uk<br>
2. Notified vacancies includes any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately the job opportunities actually available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

3. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years. Three sample years have been combined for statistics covering London as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>

6. A dependent child is defined as an individual aged under 16. A person will also be defined as a child if they are aged 16 to 19 (or 16 to 18 in years prior to 2006-07); not married nor in a civil partnership nor living with a partner; living with parents; and in full-time non-advanced education or in unwaged Government training.<br>

 The Department for Work and Pensions has a substantial programme of research. Many of the Department&#146;s research projects have direct links to our understanding of child poverty and the development of our child poverty strategy (for example, evaluating the support provided for lone parents moving into work). While not their main focus, many other projects have implications for child poverty (for example, the evaluation of Pathways to Work).

However, nominal immigration and emigration totals are used in the projection process mainly to enable plausible age distributions to be calculated for the assumed net migration totals.</p>
</ul><a name="81216w0024.htm_brev5"><a name="08121714004859"><ul><p class="tabletext">The 2006-based principal (or central) projection assumed a long-term annual net inflow to the UK of +190,000 persons a year. In this projection, the population of the UK is projected to reach 70 million in 2028. To answer your question, further population projections have been produced by reducing the nominal immigration totals applied in the 2006-based principal projection, but leaving the fertility, mortality and emigration assumptions unchanged. Based on these assumptions, with a long-term net migration inflow of +60,000 a year, the population would reach 70 million in the 2070s. However, with a net migration inflow of +50,000 a year the population would be just below 70 million in 2081, although it would still be continuing to rise.</p>

If immigration fell permanently to levels well below those experienced in recent years, it is likely that this would, in time, lead to a reduction in the level of emigration as well, it is possible to have a range of combinations of levels of immigration and emigration consistent with any particular level of net migration and these would lead to different projected population sizes.</p>

1. The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) &#147;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&#148;.<br>
Includes activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
2. Finished admission episodes:<br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
3. Primary diagnosis:<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
 4. Secondary diagnoses:<br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
5. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis:<br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>

The annual levels of funding subsequently achieved represent a twenty-fold increase since 1999-2000. At the same time, a small number of centres of research excellence were established specifically to address the lack of critical mass in prostate cancer research. The work of these NCRI prostate cancer collaboratives is kept under regular review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_622"><a name="81216w0032.htm_para5"><a name="08121714002783">The usual practice of the Department's National Institute for Health Research and of the MRC is not to ring-fence funds for expenditure on particular topics: research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. Future levels of expenditure on cancer research will be determined by the success of relevant bids for funding.</p>

In 1997, the Office for National Statistics survey indicated that as many as 58 per cent. of male and 75 per cent. of female remand prisoners, and 39 per cent. of male and 62 per cent. of female sentenced prisoners met criteria for a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression.

 Access to direct payments should be available to all people eligible to receive them. There is evidence that the take up of direct payments is also sometimes hindered by a lack of adequate support or information, or unnecessarily complicated processes.

 The independent individual budget evaluation was designed to examine outcomes for specific groups of service users which include people with mental health problems. 13 local authorities took part in these pilots and of these, five local authorities included mental health service users in their pilots: Barnsley, Coventry, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Oldham, which was exclusively with mental health service users.</p>

A number of these service users had not found the services available under conventional arrangements to their liking, and saw an individual budget as an opportunity to access more appropriate support. Although not significant statistically, the data also suggest some tendency for psychological well-being to be better for those mental health service users receiving an individual budget.</p>

<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br>
1. A FCE is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> *Primary diagnosis</i><br>
2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
E66&#151;Obesity.<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis</i><br>
3. These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a HES record.<br>
<i> **Main procedure</i><br>
4. The main procedure is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedure.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
5. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
6. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
7. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br>
<i> Primary Care Trust (PCT)/Strategic Health Authority (SHA) data quality</i><br>
8. PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_678"><a name="81216w0036.htm_para3"><a name="08121714004542">London TB services are funded by the Department to run a pilot study using a mobile X-ray unit (MXU) to screen homeless hostels and prisons. Evaluation of the pilot showed the MXU to be an effective case-finding tool among these populations. In addition, since October 2007, the Department has funded Find &amp; Treat, a small multidisciplinary team of tuberculosis nurse specialists, social and outreach workers, to provide practical support and advice to TB services across London for around 300 patients with complex and challenging needs. Support includes: locating and re-engaging patients who have been lost to follow-up care; providing links between prison health and the MXU to NHS tuberculosis services; organising case conferences and directly observed therapy (DOT) partnerships and engaging relevant allied support services in the community to help patients complete treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="81216w0038.htm_para0"><a name="08121714004687">Retrofitting carbon capture and storage in 2010 or 2015 would mean deploying the technology before it has been demonstrated at full-scale, and therefore the cost and performance of the technology will be uncertain. Moreover, energy companies are likely to require a significant risk premium for investing in unproven technology.</p>

We also accept that the energy directive should incentivise deployment of renewable technologies outside the EU, as well as inside. Projects such as MARE may be a way of doing this, although issues such as the high cost of developing offshore platforms and long distance sub-sea connections would need to be addressed.</p>

 The National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) has been created from the BNFL subsidiary, Nexia Solutions Limited. HMG is currently running a competition to appoint a management contractor to manage the NNL and we expect that process to be completed next spring. Until then the NNL is operating very much as Nexia Solutions did and its results are included in the consolidated accounts of BNFL plc. The NNL is a commercial entity and as such derives revenues from its customers for contracted work. In 2006-07, Nexia Solutions (now the NNL) made an operating profit of &#163;7 million before exceptional items on a turnover of &#163;77 million. Once appointed, the managing contractor is expected to deliver growth and efficiencies, obtaining its fee from turnover with no requirement for separate funding from Government.</p>

 Ensuring that markets operate freely and fairly is a matter for the independent competition authorities. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) referred the market for the supply of domestic bulk liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to the Competition Commission (CC) on 5 July 2004. Following the report by the CC on 29 June 2006 on this market the CC made the first of two orders to remedy detrimental effects on customers so far as they have resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the adverse effects on competition specified in the report. From 13 April 2009, the first order will apply to all suppliers of bulk LPG for domestic use. A second order, which will apply to all suppliers of bulk LPG for domestic use on metered estates, is currently the subject of consultation and is expected to be published in early 2009. Once the orders are in place the OFT will monitor their effect.</p>

 From the retained records available to us details for licences granted in each of the last five years and the current year to date under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 are shown in the following table. A feature of the regulatory regime under the 1986 Act is the discussion that often takes place at an early stage between applicants (or prospective applicants) and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. When serious deficiencies are discovered with the proposals during these early discussions with the local inspectors this means that proposals unlikely to meet the Act's stringent requirements are revised or withdrawn before formal refusal becomes necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_777"><a name="81216w0044.htm_para8"><a name="08121770000040">This census shows that there were 34,390 pupils aged five to 19 attending primary, secondary and special schools classed as being in care as at January 2008. Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending 31 March 2008, shows 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after as at 31 March 2008. However the School Census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

We must ensure that financial constraints are not a barrier for young people. This will entail providing support to those who need it and we are looking at a variety of methods to ensure that this is done in the most effective way. This will include building on the education maintenance allowance, which from September this year links financial support more closely to attainment and behaviour. We will continue to look at ways of supporting all young people to enable them to participate.</p>

 Assessing the economic impact of EMA is not simple but our analysis of the education maintenance allowance shows that the expected economic benefits far outweigh the costs. For the first cohort of recipients in the national rollout in 2004-05, evaluation evidence suggests that an extra 18,000 more 16-year-olds participated in full-time education than would have done so without EMA and an extra 16,000 participated at age 17. This is estimated to have generated an additional 10,100 Level 2 and 11,900 Level 3 qualifications being gained by the age of 18. Based on these benefits, our best estimate of the net benefit to the economy from supporting this cohort is around &#163;880 million over the lifetime of these individuals. Given the range of assumptions that are necessary in carrying out such as assessment, our estimate should be seen as indicative.</p>

 The education maintenance allowance (EMA) has had the biggest impact on participation of any policy initiative in over a decade. From 2003-04 to 2004-05 the national participation rate for 16-year-olds in full-time education increased by 3.7 percentage points exceeding expectations. EMA was one of the key policies aimed at increasing participation and has been a major contributor to this increase. One of the factors that has contributed to the success of EMA has been its simplicity. There are a range of alternatives to using gross income to assess eligibility for EMA, including using net income. All of these have various advantages and disadvantages.  <br>

The partnerships are based on the idea that schools will be able to deal more effectively with challenging pupils if they can share expertise, resources and facilities for that purpose. Schools partnerships are voluntary, typically comprising 6-10 secondary schools, although primary and middle schools can join. Schools and local authorities have been encouraged to work in partnership through a series of Ministerial letters, and supported via several rounds of regional workshops, on-line guidance, and extensive support from the National Strategies. No additional funding available from the Dept. for partnership working. These partnerships to be made mandatory under the Children, Skills and Learning Bill.
