The regions and devolved Administrations have held over 400 games-themed events over last year, informing business about support services that can help them 'get fit' to compete for games-related and other contracts.</p>

The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic games (LOCOG) will run a fleet of buses and coaches to transport athletes to their events.

 The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the EU's instrument for the management of fisheries and aquaculture. We share the European Commission's vision for a healthy marine ecosystem that supports sustainable, profitable fisheries. Any reform should devolve fisheries management, away from current centralised control over detailed regulations, and enable fishermen to better plan for their businesses for the longer term. I am a firm supporter of genuine reform and convinced that we must grasp this opportunity in order to secure the prosperity and viability of our fishing industries in the medium term.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 6 July 2010]:</i> The requirement for battle casualty replacements (BCRs) is identified by the Permanent Joint Headquarters. The processes for generating BCRs, once this requirement has been confirmed, differ between the three single Services. For Army and Royal Marine units BCRs are drawn from a nominated cohort based in the Unit's rear party at the home location. This cohort will have been selected and trained at the same time as the deploying Unit and will be up to date on their core military skills. The exceptions to this are for some pinch point trades, where personnel are usually pulled forward from the next Brigade in line to deploy; and senior officer replacements, which are generated by the relevant headquarters.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has a particular responsibility to help seriously injured and disabled service personnel, and works closely with service charities in discharging this responsibility. One of the most important requirements of seriously injured service personnel is accommodation adapted to meet their specific personal circumstances, and the MOD provides some 1,300 adapted Service Families Accommodation (SFA) which includes over 2,000 specific adaptations (such as a stair-lift or walk-in shower) for either service personnel or their dependants. Personnel will continue to receive medical treatment from the Defence Medical Services for as long as they remain in the armed forces, and ongoing welfare support is available from the chain of command; through the Army Welfare Service; and from service charities.</p>

However, it was highly unrealistic to expect that underspending would have been sufficient to cover all these commitments. There is insufficient contingency in the Reserve to cover the remainder.

 Published statistics show that offenders subject to court orders under probation supervision have a lower reoffending rate than those sentenced to custody. Some of this effect may be because offenders discharged from prison have characteristics associated with a higher rate of reoffending, such as more previous convictions. But some may be due to the fact that offenders on community sentences are taking part in programmes which promote rehabilitation and because they have not been taken away from their homes, jobs and communities.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

* 0 ≤ CV&lt;5%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 ≤ CV &lt;10%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 ≤ CV &lt;20%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV ≥ 20%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
CV = Coefficient of Variation<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.).<br>

 The Government have set out a number of major welfare to work reforms, including a core integrated Work Programme and a number of measures designed to support people to find employment.

We will offer them stronger incentives to work with the harder to help, paying delivery partners out of the additional benefits they realise as a result of placing people into work.</p>
