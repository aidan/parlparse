<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what conclusions she has reached concerning the three paratroopers alleged to have shot Fahri Bici and Avni Dudi.  [1079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Fahri Bici and Avni Dudi were killed in Pristina in Kosovo on 2 July 1999. Three British servicemen who were part of the KFOR peacekeeping operation fired the shots that killed them. Fahri Bici had been sitting on the roof of a moving car firing a Kalashnikov automatic rifle into the air. The servicemen said Fahri Bici pointed the rifle at them after being told to drop the weapon. They said they shot at him as they feared their lives were in danger. Avni Dudi was a passenger in the car and was killed by bullets aimed at Fahri Bici. Two other passengers in the car were severely injured.

<a name="10702w01.html_para0">The Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police carried out an investigation. Following consultation with the former Attorney-General, Lord Williams, the Army Prosecuting Authority sought the advice of Treasury Counsel. Treasury Counsel advised the Army Prosecuting Authority that there was no realistic prospect of conviction of the three servicemen of any criminal offences. Lord Williams accepted the view of the Army Prosecuting Authority that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what measures he is taking to monitor and regulate companies recruiting and selling the services of mercenaries; and when he will publish a consultative paper on options for future regulation.  [979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spnew0"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The aim of the Green Paper, recommended by the Foreign Affairs Committee in its Report on Sierra Leone published in February 1999, is to set out options for the regulation of mercenaries and private military companies. Work on the Green Paper is continuing; the issues are complex. I am unable at present to give a specific date for publication of the paper.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will place in the Library a list of the titles and dates of films held by the chemical and biological defence establishment, Porton Down, which record the establishment's trials with biological warfare simulants in public places since 1971.  [997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No. The Chemical and Biological Defence Sector at Porton Down has been unable to identify any films recording trials with biological warfare simulants in public places since 1971.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_wqn7"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will instruct the chemical defence establishment, Porton Down, to conduct research to determine the long-term effects of a single dose of the oripavine derivative TL 2636 on the health of humans.  [989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No. The current evidence suggests that following single, acute doses of the oripavine derivative TL 2636 there are no long-term effects on health. The conduct of a study is, therefore, not warranted.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_wqn8"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the comprehensive survey of the service volunteer programme at the chemical defence establishment, Porton Down, announced on 1 May will examine allegations that service personnel were misled into taking part in experiments at Porton Down.  [1003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will place in the Library copies of technical reports compiled by the chemical and biological defence establishment, Porton Down, to record the results of trials carried out between 29 September 1975 and 21 October 1975 in which two simulants were disseminated from the Fleet Tender Cockchafer in Lyme and Weymouth bays.  [996]<P>

<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 4W</I><P>
papers in this series were produced in total; and if he will place in the Library a list of the titles and dates of each of the papers in this series.  [991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The MRD series of reports started in 1950 and finished in 1956. Of a total of 20 papers produced during this period, five were originally unclassified. However, Defence Records are now in the process of re-reviewing all 20 reports to establish whether the original classifications still stand. If declassification is possible, reports will be transferred to the PRO. I will arrange for a list detailing these reports to be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_wqn13"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what requests he has received from Wiltshire police to assist the Operation Antler team to locate official notices which are alleged to state that volunteers were needed to take part in common cold research at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down.  [1734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w01.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 My officials were asked to undertake a full search of all service instructions and notices dealing with the Porton Down Service Volunteer Programme. In addition, we have provided research support to the Wiltshire police in examining service unit records, as well as initiating a full trawl by service units and establishments for any relevant records or historical papers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what responsibility his Department has for the maintenance of navigation marks, with special reference to moorings and lighthouses; and what plans he has to review those responsibilities.  [1263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS), part of the Warship Support Agency (WSA), is responsible for the maintenance of some 224 navigational buoys, 148 moorings and 12 targets around the coast of the British Isles. The Chief Salvage and Mooring Officer (CSALMO), also part of the WSA, is the tri-Service manager and design authority for Ministry of Defence moorings and is responsible for the oversight of all maintenance work in the UK and of a further 54 moorings 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 5W</I><P>
and navigational buoys overseas. Responsibility for lighthouses rests with the three General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) administered by the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR). The GLAs are ultimately responsible through legislation for all navigational marks including those owned by the MOD.
<P>

<a name="10702w02.html_para1">The Government's Better Quality Services (BQS) policy encourages a robust review of services and the opportunity has therefore been taken to explore the obvious synergy between the GLAs and the RMAS.
<P>

<a name="10702w02.html_para2">Exploratory meetings with the GLAs have led to Trinity House, acting on behalf of the three GLAs and with the authority of the DTLR, making an offer for the absorption and maintenance of all MOD navigational buoys in UK waters. The MOD is now assessing the GLAs' offer and an initial meeting took place on 27 June 2001. Further work is required and the MOD and the GLAs have agreed to jointly examine their operations without commitment.
<P>

<a name="10702w02.html_para3">It is unlikely that any firm recommendations will be made before the end of 2001 and implementation will be subject to full consultation with staff and their representatives, as well as requiring ministerial approval in both Departments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2001]:</i> The apprentice school at Aberporth is run by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), and is staffed by DERA personnel. On completion of their apprenticeship the great majority of apprentices are employed by DERA. As a result, the school forms part of the undertaking that is planned to become QinetiQ plc, as part of the DERA Public-Private Partnership. DERA receives a contribution from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) for various aspects of the apprentice training at the school. The MOD will continue to contribute funding for the apprentices who are attending the school at the date of vesting of assets in QinetiQ plc. Discussions on the funding of future intakes of apprentices will take place during the summer between MOD, QinetiQ plc and trade union representatives, and are scheduled to conclude in September 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the recent agreement between his Department and the Horizon consortium to market spare training capacity in the RAF/Training Group Defence Agency.  [1594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The RAF has identified some unavoidable surplus training capacity, particularly in the area of engineering training. Although the RAF has had some success in selling this capacity, it was recognised that it does not have the necessary skills to market, promote and sell opportunities presented by the spare capacity. To maximise both the potential use of the capacity and income generation, the RAF has sought a commercial partner to provide the expertise required.
<P>

<a name="10702w02.html_para4">The Agreement for the Marketing Partnering Arrangement between the RAF and the Horizon consortium, consisting of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Westland Augusta, PERA and Bournemouth and Poole College, was signed on 30 May 2001. The agreement is for seven years.
<P>

<a name="10702w02.html_para5">In addition to increasing the income received from selling training capacity, the partnership will help to meet the increasing aerospace industry demand for technician training.

<a name="10702w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Four British observers are currently deployed in support of the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to extend the provision to permit benefit claimants to undertake therapeutic work.  [20]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 As the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley), said on 22 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 346W, from April 2002 we propose to introduce new rules for people who receive Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance and Income Support based on incapacity who want to undertake some form of paid work which may ease their way back into full-time employment. We are aware of concerns that the current therapeutic work rules may be of limited use where it is difficult to demonstrate that a particular job would be beneficial to a person's medical condition. The current rules also do not help someone who wants to work on a limited basis in order to have social contact if they do not satisfy the therapeutic requirement. This is why we have reviewed the current position and are introducing some improvements.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para0">Under the proposed changes, the therapeutic work rules will cease to exist. Instead we intend to introduce rules which will allow any person receiving incapacity benefits to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) work for less than 16 hours a week and up to &#163;60.50 for up to six months; with a six month extension for those working with a Personal Adviser, Job Broker or Disability Employment Adviser;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) work for maximum earnings of &#163;20 a week with no time limit and no hours limit.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para1">Claimants who undertake sheltered work or are undergoing a hospital treatment programme which includes work, will, as now, be able to earn up to &#163;60.50 a week (April 2001 rates) with no limit on the number of hours they work.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para2">We believe that these rules are much fairer than those that currently exist. Because we are opening up the rules to anyone on incapacity benefits we are giving more people the opportunity of trying paid work. This, together with our other measures to help people find suitable work, will enable people to move off benefits and into work. Also by allowing all claimants to do some paid work without time limit, we will be encouraging those who are otherwise excluded to take part in activities which will help them feel part of, and play a more active role in, their local community. Additionally, of course, there are the rules 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 9W</I><P>
which we already have in place to allow claimants to try full-time work or training and return to benefit at the same rate if they have to give up that work or training.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para3">These changes do not affect the position whereby people receiving Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance may do unpaid voluntary work for an unlimited period.

<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Departmental ministerial responsibility for these areas in the House of Commons is divided as follows: I am responsible for the Child Support Agency and the Integrated Child Credit; the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Our recent national take-up campaign on the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) was a success resulting in 110,286 successful claims to MIG. The average additional income awarded is &#163;20 per week.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para4">We have also increased the lower and upper capital limits to &#163;6,000 and &#163;12,000 respectively. These increases will result in more people becoming newly entitled to MIG and will increase the number of people who will become entitled to the full amount of the MIG.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para5">Additionally, we will continue to work in partnership with the voluntary sector and local authorities to find ways of identifying and encouraging those who are likely to benefit from MIG to claim.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para6">The delay in the implementation of NIRS2 caused arrears of work in both the Inland Revenue and the then DSS. These arrears are being managed through a recovery plan that has been developed by both Departments and continue to be cleared as quickly as possible. Compensation is being paid as a result of the delays.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para7">Compensation payments to 31 March 2001 total &#163;65.1 million. The estimated compensation costs for 2001&#150;02 cannot yet be quantified.

 My Department will be working with local authorities when they develop and implement schemes, to carry out before and after studies to assess schemes' impacts, including changes in levels of air pollution. Modelling work for the Government's 10-Year Plan for Transport published in July 2000 forecasts significant reductions in particulate and oxide of nitrogen emissions by 2010 from a range of measures in the plan, including the introduction of urban congestion charging in a number of towns and cities.

<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Railtrack's Network Performance Report for the four-week period to 26 May 2001 shows that 6 per cent. of delays were attributable to gauge corner cracking. This includes both passenger and freight services.

<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what progress has been made in the appointment of a public interest director to the board of Railtrack.  [1020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of the Statement of Principles agreed between the Government and Railtrack, the company announced on 2 April the decision to appoint, in consultation with Government, a non-executive director to its main board with the background and credentials to provide a powerful public and consumer interest voice around the boardroom table. The appointment of such a director is currently under review by the nominations committee of the Railtrack Board.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how much money has been granted to Railtrack from public funds over the past year; and what contractual safeguards exist to ensure that the money is used for its intended purposes.  [1023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In 2000&#150;01, train operating companies (TOCs) were paid &#163;847 million in Support for Passenger Services (SPRS) by the Franchising Director and the Strategic Rail Authority and &#163;185 million in grants by Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs). Since some 85 per cent. of Railtrack's income is paid to the company by TOCs in access charges, Railtrack's revenue is contingent on that indirect subsidy.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para8">In future, Railtrack will also receive considerable sums in direct grants for track renewals. As part of the Statement of Principles agreed on 2 April between the Government and Railtrack, the Government agreed to bring forward the timing of &#163;1.5 billion of payments due to the company under the Periodic Review. In doing so, the Government have attached strict conditions of increased public accountability and Railtrack has undertaken to spend the Government revenues strictly on improving the railway. A copy of the Statement of Principles has been placed in the Library. None of this new funding has yet been paid.
<P>

<a name="10702w03.html_para9">The main safeguard in respect of all subsidy to Railtrack is the Network Licence and the conditions attached to it by the Rail Regulator. The Regulator's reformed regulatory structure is nearing completion. It comprises the Periodic Review; a strengthened network licence; and new model clauses for clearer and simplified track access agreements with Railtrack's customers, the passenger and freight train operators. The Transport Act 2000 has also strengthened the regulation and accountability of Railtrack. The Regulator now has the powers and resources to ensure that Railtrack delivers on its public service commitments.

 The 10-Year Transport Plan recognises that coach services have a valuable role in expanding transport options including for commuting journeys into major cities. Coach services will benefit from increased investment in the strategic road network, including measures to tackle bottlenecks and improve network management.
<P>

<a name="10702w04.html_para15">The public consultation draft of the Mayor of London's Transport Strategy said that additional commuter and scheduled express coach services on particular routes could fulfil a valuable role in supplementing rail capacity. It said that Transport for London would work with coach operators to review opportunities for extending the role of commuter coaches, taking account of traffic and parking issues. I understand that the Mayor will publish his final Transport Strategy shortly.

<a name="10702w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department, together with the Housing Corporation, is taking a number of measures to improve the energy efficiency of registered social landlords' (RSLs) properties.
<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para1">For existing properties, the Housing Corporation's Performance Standards require RSLs to assess the energy efficiency of their housing stock and, through planned improvement work, to help local authorities to meet their obligations under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995.




<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 16W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para2">The Housing Corporation is also promoting the adoption of sustainable development action plans in the RSL sector. These will require RSLs to adopt environmental good practice across a range of activities including refurbishment, management and maintenance of their existing stock. An environmental management system specifically designed for RSLs is being developed and will be launched later this year. In addition, the Housing Corporation's Innovation and Good Practice (IGP) programme will continue to fund projects that raise awareness of environmental considerations. A number of good practice guides and tools to help RSLs address energy management for affordable warmth and energy services has already been developed.
<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para3">For new build schemes and the rehabilitation of existing dwellings, the Housing Corporation's Scheme Development Standards specify a minimum Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) energy rating which must be achieved. In its guidance the Corporation strongly encourages the achievement of SAP ratings above the minimum level.
<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para4">In addition, from 1 April this year, RSLs have been required to use a recently developed system of Housing Quality Indicators (HQIs) in planning new schemes. HQIs provide a basis for assessing the quality of schemes against 10 key aspects of design, including energy efficiency and sustainability.
<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para5">The Housing Corporation is investigating the potential for RSLs to use Combined Heat and Power (CHP) schemes as part of its wider promotion of energy efficiency. Most CHP schemes are on a scale which is not generally suitable for RSL properties, but the Corporation is currently participating in an EU-wide project to scope the potential for micro-CHP systems. We will consider the scope for greater use of CHP in relation to RSL properties in the light of the fundings in this report.
<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para6">The Housing Corporation is actively encouraging RSLs to consider the use of Photovoltaic (PV) roofs and solar water heating. A number of RSLs now use these systems and a network of RSLs with an interest in PV roofs is being established to address areas of concern and to develop good practice guidance on the use of PV roof and solar water heating systems within the sector. However, at present the costs are high with conventional systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what further changes he is intending to make to regional planning guidance for Yorkshire and the Humber about the distribution of housebuilding in west Yorkshire.  [2073]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Over 800 comments have been received in response to the proposed changes to draft Regional Planning Guidance for Yorkshire and the Humber which were published in March 2001. Many of the consultation responses welcome the proposed changes as they improve RPG and provide a clear strategy for sustainable development in the region. An issue has been raised about the distribution of housing in west Yorkshire which we consider needs to be resolved by publishing further changes to RPG for public consultation.




<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 17W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10702w05.html_para7">The level of housing provision in west Yorkshire published for consultation in March 2001 was 6,175 dwellings per year, some 800 more than originally proposed in the Regional Assembly's draft RPG. However, where these additional 800 houses per year should be located within west Yorkshire was not specified. Instead, it was proposed that it be established in the next review of RPG in a few years' time. The Regional Assembly and the local authorities have not objected to the proposed increase. Environmental groups have objected, while developers have expressed support or argued that provision should be further increased. There were also significant arguments put forward that the distribution of the additional housing within west Yorkshire should be determined now rather than left to the next review of RPG. In the light of all comments received, we are proposing that there should be no further change to the overall amount of housing in west Yorkshire, but that its distribution between local authorities should be set out now. This will provide greater certainty in the planning system, and will assist urban renaissance by helping to reduce the need to travel by providing homes near to jobs. The following annual rates of housebuilding are proposed:

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he intends to commission a strategic study on the environmental impacts of aviation in the UK to match the strategic study of the economic impacts of aviation included in the Developing Aviation White Paper process.  [1587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In December last year we published a consultation document, "The Future of Aviation". This examined the main issues underpinning air transport policy, including the need to tackle the environmental effects of aviation. We are giving careful consideration to the responses to the consultation document and propose to publish a summary of them later this summer. Alongside the consultation document, we published a paper, "Valuing the External Costs of Aviation", which reviews some of the literature about the valuation of noise, air quality and climate change impacts and considers the implications of aviation meeting its estimated external costs.
<P>

<a name="10702w06.html_para0">The study of regional airports and regional air services announced in the 1998 Transport White Paper, covering the north of England, the midlands, the south-west of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland was completed last year. The findings are currently being reviewed as part of a UK-wide Regional Co-ordination 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 19W</I><P>
study. A key component of this process has been the commissioning of studies on the impact of air transport (including associated surface transport) on local air qualify and noise at 23 regional airports. This work will provide an important input to a comprehensive appraisal of options for development of capacity at regional airports under a range of potential national policy scenarios.
<P>

<a name="10702w06.html_para1">We are also studying issues in the south-east and east of England. The South East and East of England Regional Air Service Study (SERAS) is examining all options for future development of airports in the south-east and east of England. The appraisal process includes an examination of environmental impacts, including noise and local air quality, climate change, urbanisation, land-take, biodiversity, landscape, heritage and designated areas. We propose to issue individual regional consultation documents for all these regions around the turn of the year.
<P>

<a name="10702w06.html_para2">All of these strands of work will feed into the new air transport White Paper, which we hope to publish next year.

 The statutory instalment scheme gives council tax payers the right to pay their council in 10 monthly instalments. However, local authorities can agree to a different payment regime, such as 12 monthly payments or 52 weekly payments. I believe it is right that local authorities should be able to make such decisions in response to individual or local circumstances because they are ultimately answerable to local people for the service they provide.

 The tables show waiting times for waiting list and booked admissions to National Health Service hospitals in England and the Northern and Yorkshire region for the years 1997&#150;98 to 1999&#150;2000 for hip replacements, heart operations, and cancer treatment. Data have been given on the distribution of waiting times to give a more informative picture than the two most extreme results. Data for 2000&#150;01 are not yet available.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

An FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year.<P>

The main operation is the first of four operation fields in the HES data set, and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode.<P>

Operation (OPCS4R) and diagnosis (ICD10) codes used are as follows:<P>

Primary hip replacement operations&#151;operation codes W37&#150;39 and W46&#150;48, excluding emergency admissions, and those with primary diagnosis S72 (fractured neck of femur). Revision operations&#151;W37.3, W38.3, W39.3, W46.3, W47.3, W48.3, excluding emergency admissions and those with a primary diagnosis of S72 (fractured neck of femur).<P>

Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

Data in this table are not adjusted for shortfalls.<P>

Patients whose waiting time is 'not known' are from a waiting list or booked admission where the date of decision to admit was invalid, therefore a duration of elective wait cannot be calculated.<P>

The main operation is the first of four operation fields in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode.<P>

The main diagnosis is the first of seven diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<P>

Operation (OPCS4R) and diagnosis (ICD10) codes used are as follows:<P>

Cancer (1)&#151;Diagnosis 'COO-C97 Malignant/Neoplasms'<P>

<a name="10702w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are implementing a range of measures to improve recruitment and retention in the National Health Service for all staff, including London. Examples include investing in fair pay, encouraging the NHS to become a better employer, increasing training commissions for all professional groups, attracting former staff back to the NHS, encouraging flexible retirement, and supporting more effective, collaborative international

recruitment where appropriate. We are also funding a recruitment campaign to raise the profile of social work and improve recruitment rates into social work.
<P>

<a name="10702w08.html_para0">In places where recruitment is most difficult, we are also looking at accommodation issues. For example, a NHS housing co-ordinator has been appointed in London to improve the recruitment and retention of key workers. The NHS Plan aims to provide 2000 residential units in London by 2004.
<P>

<a name="10702w08.html_para1">From March 2000 until May 2001, 661 nurses and midwives returned to practice in London.
<P>

<a name="10702w08.html_para2">By 2004 we will increase the number of general practitioners, nationally, by at least 2000 and increase the number of GP training places by 550. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State also announced a package of measures aimed at improving recruitment and retention of GPs on 13 March 2001. Other measures such as personal medical service pilots will attract GPs into deprived areas. In London we already have 265 GP registrars in training

and are looking to increase training capacity to increase local supply. We are also seeing if we can increase the number of feeder senior house officer posts to increase the flow into the GP registrar grade. Increasing numbers of newly qualified pre-registration house officers are now getting exposure to general practice as part of their year's training.

<a name="10702w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have received one representation in the last three months about additional funding being given to London health authorities in recognition of the additional costs incurred by the health services in London.
<P>

<a name="10702w08.html_para3">Following the planning round an additional &#163;155 million for 2001&#150;02 has been made available to the National Health Service, partly in recognition of additional financial pressures. London received &#163;25.4 million of this.

 At the end of each financial year, whole-time consultants are asked to submit a return to their National Health Service employer, indicating that their annual gross income from private practice has not exceeded 10 per cent. of their gross NHS salary. An employer may require fully audited accounts if they consider that they have grounds for seeking more information. Consultants on other types of contract are not required to disclose their private practice earnings to their NHS employer.

 We fully recognise the vital role played by carers and are doing much to improve the support and services available to help them in their caring role.
<P>

<a name="10702w09.html_para3">Our approach to support carers is outlined in "Caring About Carers", the report of the National Carers Strategy which highlighted the need for better information for carers, better support for carers and better care for carers. Two of the objectives of the strategy were to ensure more breaks are available to carers and to provide services direct to carers and to support them in their caring role through the carers grants.




<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2001 : Column: 31W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10702w09.html_para4">We will increase the amount of money put aside specifically to support carers in England through the carers grant from &#163;50 million last year to &#163;70 million this year, &#163;85 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;100 million in 2003&#150;04; this will be an important step towards ensuring that up to 75,000 more carers receive a break from their caring duties.
<P>

<a name="10702w09.html_para5">In addition to this, The National Service Framework for Older People was published on 27 March 2001. The NSF builds the needs and appropriate support of carers into all the standards it sets.
<P>

<a name="10702w09.html_para6">Standard 7 of the NSF relates to mental health and will ensure that older people with dementia and depression have access to integrated health services to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support for them and their carers.
<P>

<a name="10702w09.html_para7">Importantly, this standard will also ensure that carers receive the information, advice and practical help such as counselling services or short-term breaks to support them in caring for the older person.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our aims for a comprehensive school system are to give all young people the opportunity to acquire the skills, attitudes and formal qualifications necessary for their personal development, lifelong learning, work and citizenship. This means that all schools must deliver a broad and balanced curriculum including literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology. At secondary level they must also provide high-quality pathways able to meet the needs of individuals, be they academic or vocational. In order to better achieve these aims, we want to increase diversity by enabling each school to develop a distinct mission, ethos and character and, provided it demonstrates success, have the autonomy to manage its own affairs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have listened carefully to representations that we should seek to reverse the effect of the Greenwich Judgment. However, when we consulted on the Bill that became the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 there was no evidence of a groundswell of opinion nationally for doing so, and we have no reason to alter that view. The judgment was a sensible recognition of cross-LEA patterns of travel to schools. It prevented LEAs from refusing applications for schools simply on the basis that a child might not live in their specific administrative area.
<P>

<a name="10702w10.html_para0">Parents can apply for any school, regardless of where they live. If a school is oversubscribed, admission criteria are applied to decide which applicants should be allocated the available places. The Code of Practice on School Admissions encourages admission authorities to operate admission arrangements which reflect the reality of pupil admission patterns, especially where there tends to be a high level of cross-border movement.
<P>

<a name="10702w10.html_para1">Typical criteria used give priority where there is a sibling already at the school, to those who attend a named feeder school, who have a medical condition, live in a defined catchment area or who live closest to the school. Admission authorities for schools must review and consult on their admission arrangements each year, and this gives an opportunity to introduce any changes they consider to be in the best interests of local parents and children.
<P>

<a name="10702w10.html_para2">In many cases, a child's nearest school may be in another authority area. This is one reason why there is so much cross-border travel. Cross-LEA travel to school is a well-established practice in London, and pre-dates the Greenwich judgment. It is one of many factors that LEAs must take into account when planning and organising the provision of school places in their area.
<P>

<a name="10702w10.html_para3">Supply and demand of places is finely balanced at present in Bromley with significant growth predicted. A new secondary school will open in September 2003.

full-time equivalent teaching assistants rose by over 25,000 between 1999 and 2001. During the period April 1999 to March 2004, we are making available around &#163;750 million to local education authorities in England to meet the cost of recruiting, maintaining and training this level of new teaching assistants. The Department has allocated funds this year to LEAs on the basis of 80 per cent. to primary and nursery schools and 20 per cent. to secondary and special schools and Pupil Referral Units.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Data on the number of teachers qualified to teach these languages are not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="10702w10.html_para4">The total number of teacher training places available for all modern languages is set annually by the Government and allocated to providers by the Teacher Training Agency. In 2001&#150;02, 2,050 places on courses of initial teacher training in modern languages will be available. That figure does not include the employment- based training places for modern languages available though the Graduate and Registered Teacher Programmes. Providers themselves determine the languages in which they will offer training courses.

 As part of the consultation exercise on the Green Paper "Schools&#151;Building on Success", we received 421 responses from a number of organisations, LEAs, teachers, governors and parents which commented on secondary schools, some of which addressed admissions directly. Common themes have been the need for maximum access to good local schools, and for admission authorities to adopt a more co-ordinated approach to the admission process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We introduced a new admissions framework for all schools in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Its aim was to promote parental choice and make the admissions system fairer and easier for parents. A new statutory requirement was imposed on admission authorities requiring them to consult each other annually, before determining their admission arrangements. Where local agreement cannot be reached, admission authorities can object to an independent Schools Adjudicator or, where appropriate, to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="10702w11.html_para3">School admission arrangements are decided locally and admission authorities are free to choose what arrangements to use, although they must be clear, fair and objective and operated in a reasonable manner in line with guidance contained in the Code of Practice on School Admissions.

The idea behind the certificate was to encourage all young people to stay in learning until 19.

Of these, 21,500 appeals were decided in the parents favour, representing 34 per cent. of all appeals heard by a panel.

At primary level, where class size legislation has placed restrictions on appeal panels, there has been a drop in the percentage of successful appeals over the last three years, from 47 per cent. in 1997&#150;98 to 39 per cent. in 1999&#150;2000.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> Between the coming into force of the main provisions of the Competition Act 1998 on 1 March 2000 and the end of May 2001, the Office of Fair Trading has received over 5,000 complaints alleging a breach of the Competition Act 1998, or the complex monopoly provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973. These complaints have resulted in 2,065 preliminary inquiries being opened to consider the allegations. Of these, 68 resulted in investigations of which 34 investigations are on-going.

This will apply to all new incinerators by this date, and to existing plant by 28 December 2005. This directive tightens dioxin limits to 0.1ng/m <sup>3</sup> .

<P>
<a name="10702w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am writing to report the outcome of the Environment Council in Luxembourg on 7 June. As the Council fell on the same day as the General Election, there were no Environment Ministers available to attend, and the UK was represented by Bill Stow, Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU. The Council reached a political agreement on six common positions, two of which allowed agreement to be reached with the European Parliament at first reading. The UK abstained on the vote on a proposed Directive on low-temperature emissions from motor vehicles, and voted in favour of the other common positions. The Council also adopted five sets of conclusions.
<P>

<a name="10702w14.html_para3">Political agreement was reached on a Decision of the Commission and European Parliament on the Sixth Environment Action Programme. This will set out the EU's environmental priorities for the next 10 years, focusing on climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health, and sustainable management of natural resources and waste. The UK achieved its objectives of a commitment to improve the policy process, a clearer priority for climate change action, and of a commitment to further analysis before the development and adoption of detailed targets. Political agreement was also reached on a proposal to amend Directive 90/313, giving the public enhanced rights of access to environmental information in line with the more demanding requirements of the Aarhus Convention.
<P>

<a name="10702w14.html_para4">In reaching Political Agreement on a Directive seeking to reduce the quantity of waste from electrical and electronic equipment and increase recycling, the UK achieved its objectives. The Directive delivers environmental benefits, and is in line with the Government's objectives on waste, and Council has avoided changes which would have made it more inflexible and less workable. In particular, the UK secured additional flexibility for small manufacturers and on the arrangements for retailer takeback. Member states agreed that collection systems will have to be set up within 30 months of the Directive coming into force, with distributors having to take back used equipment free of charge on a like-for-like basis either in-store or through third parties. Producers were made responsible for reaching recovery and recycling targets within 46 months. A target of recycling 4 kg waste per person per year by 36 months following entry into force of the Directive was also agreed. Agreement was also reached on a related Directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, protecting the environment from potential damage arising form the disposal of this equipment, and

The Commission will be responsible for bringing forward proposals for measures aimed at the progressive reduction and, for Priority Hazardous Substances, at the cessation or phasing-out of emissions, discharges and losses. A first reading agreement was also reached on a Directive regulating emissions from motor vehicles starting in cold conditions. The UK abstained on the basis that the costs of implementing the proposal were disproportionate to the limited environmental benefits it would bring about, and recorded its position in a statement for the Council minutes.
<P>

<a name="10702w14.html_para6">The Council's conclusions on climate change reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its willingness to negotiate constructively at the resumed COP6 in July. Ministers reiterated the target of ratification and entry into force of Kyoto by 2002. The Council also held an informal discussion on climate change over dinner.
<P>

<a name="10702w14.html_para7">In response to the Commission's White Paper on EU chemicals policy Council conclusions were agreed. Ministers offered broad support for the proposal that existing and new substances would in future be subject to the same authorisation process ("REACH"&#151;Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals) while stressing the need for realistic deadlines. The conclusions recommend an objective of phasing out uses of chemicals that lead to a significant negative impact on the environment by 2020, while maintaining the competitiveness of the chemicals industry. The Conclusions also call for a minimum of animal testing and increased public access to information about chemicals. Separately, in response to a suggestion by the Netherlands, the Council agreed conclusions calling on the Commission to clarify the legal situation and possible consequences of the phase-out of mercury in the chlor-alkali industry, and report back to Council.

Council also agreed conclusions on a strategy for an integrated product policy, the overall aim of which is to reduce the environmental impact of products across their whole life cycle.

 Under the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) recruitment initiative, Hertfordshire constabulary has been allocated a total of 107 additional officers, over and above the force's previous recruitment plans for the three years to March 2003.
<P>

<a name="10702w15.html_para1">I know that the force has been experiencing difficulty in attracting recruits and was not able to recruit any of its CFF allocation in 2000&#150;01. In recognition of these difficulties, the force has been allowed to defer its allocation from 2000&#150;01 into 2001&#150;02. The force will now be able to recruit up to 70 officers through the CFF in 2001&#150;02.

 As I said in response to a question from the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) answered on 27 June 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 97W, the police and local authorities have powers under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to direct travellers or other trespassers to leave land when the appropriate statutory requirements are met. We have no plans to amend this legislation at present, although its effectiveness is kept under review. But the reduction of antisocial behaviour, by whoever it may be committed, is a prime objective of the Government, and our strategy for tackling it is set out in the Report of Policy Action Team 8 on AntiSocial Behaviour.

 Both the police and local authorities have powers under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to direct travellers or other trespassers to leave land when the appropriate statutory requirements are met. These are discretionary powers and it is the operational responsibility of the chief officer of the force concerned to decide when and how to enforce these powers.

<a name="10702w17.html_para3">The Chief Constable of Northamptonshire police informs me that about 1,000 people attended the illegal rave at Borough Hill, which began on Saturday 23 June and lasted until the afternoon of Monday 25 June. I understand that it was not considered practicable in the circumstances to bring the event to a conclusion before Monday. Police have since met with council officials to discuss the problems caused by this event and the strategies needed to be put in place to prevent any recurrence and have held a public meeting with residents to discuss the issues arising from the incident and to reassure them should anything similar happen in the future.

 The police, and other criminal justice services, were closely involved in the design of the victim personal statement scheme, and every effort was made to keep the procedures as simple and straightforward as possible for victims and police alike. It is difficult to assess what additional administrative effort may be needed to run the scheme, since factors such as the level of take-up by victims and the nature and content of the statements made will clearly play a part. However, both the introduction of the scheme in October and its subsequent operation will be carefully monitored and evaluated.

 The Government have introduced procedural reforms which were implemented in November 1999, which require that any person (with or without previous convictions) who is charged with an offence must be brought before a magistrates court without delay. As a result the average time from charge to first listing has fallen from 20 days in June 1999 to six days in March 2001. Further action is under way to speed up the progress of cases from their first appearance until completion.
<P>

<a name="10702w17.html_para5">Under s.51 of the Crime and Disorder Act, which was brought into effect nationally on 15 January 2001, cases involving adults charged with indictable-only offences are no longer subject to committal proceedings but must be sent straight to the Crown court from a first appearance before the magistrates. Although no data are yet available, it is hoped that these serious cases will as a result be brought to trial more quickly.
<P>

<a name="10702w17.html_para6">In addition, good progress has been made towards halving the time taken from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders: the national average fell from 142 days in 1996 to 83 days in March 2001.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much VAT revenue he forecasts will be raised in the current financial year as a result of the introduction of the climate change levy and consequent application of VAT.  [1168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Business will be able to reclaim the majority of VAT paid on the Climate Change Levy (CCL). We estimate therefore that the introduction of the CCL might lead to additional VAT receipts of around &#163;30 million, significantly below the &#163;1 billion expected to be raised by the levy in the first year. All revenues from the CCL will be recycled back to business through a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers' national insurance contributions and additional support for energy-efficient measures and energy-saving technologies.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what assessment he has made of the impact of the aggregates tax upon each local authority in the United Kingdom in respect of the cost of purchasing aggregates for construction and maintenance work;  [860]
<P>
<UL>(2) what impact the aggregates tax will have on actual costs to the end user;  [861]

(3) what assessment he has made of the impact of the imposition of the aggregates tax from April 2002 on <i>(a)</i> the importation of aggregates, <i>(b)</i> the number of small quarries and <i>(c)</i> the use of road transport for transportation of aggregates.  [863]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10702w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Budget 2000 announced that the Government had decided to introduce an aggregates levy with effect from April 2002. It will be charged at &#163;1.60 per tonne on the commercial exploitation of primary aggregates in the UK, including those imported from abroad. Aggregates exported from the UK will be exempt.
<P>

<a name="10702w19.html_para0">A full Regulatory Impact Assessment was published at the time of Budget 2000.
<P>

<a name="10702w19.html_para1">A higher price of primary aggregate will provide an incentive to all users, including the public sector, to make more efficient use of aggregates and better use of recycled aggregates as an alternative. The impact on the actual costs to the end user will be dependent on the commercial decisions of aggregates suppliers.

<P>
<a name="10702w19.html_spnew10"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government have said that they will complete another assessment of the five tests within two years of the start of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="10702w19.html_para2">Before any such assessment is started, the Treasury must continue to do the necessary preliminary work for the analysis&#151;technical work that is necessary to allow the Treasury to undertake the assessment within two years as promised.

<P>
<P>

 The determining factor underpinning any Government decision on membership of the single currency is the national economic interest and whether the economic case for joining is clear and unambiguous.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

Grant-in-aid has been allocated, wherever possible, to the local authority benefiting from the grant; where a grant benefits more than one local authority the amount has been apportioned. Grants benefiting more than one local authority but which cannot be apportioned exactly between authorities are classified as County, Metropolitan Regional, or Shire County areas, or Regional grants as appropriate.<P>

Allocation by local authority has a wider benefit as audiences and participants are often drawn from several counties, both within and outside the west midlands region. <P>

I have today placed the information requested in respect of Lottery awards made in England and Wales in the Library of the House. I will write to the hon.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> Our proposals for reforming the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws were published in the White Paper "Time for Reform" (Cm 4696) in April last year. In May this year, following a public consultation, the Government confirmed their intention to legislate to introduce these proposed reforms, with one change concerning the procedure for appealing against adverse licensing decisions. We remain fully committed to bringing forward legislation to reform the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws as soon as parliamentary time permits.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The Government will maintain analogue terrestrial broadcasts until everyone who can currently receive the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form can receive them on digital systems, switching to digital is an affordable option for the vast majority of people, and, as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers have access to digital equipment. We are committed to develop a strategic plan which will lead the UK to meet these criteria on affordability, availability and accessibility within the period 2006 and 2010.

 The Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 will be the biggest multi-sport event ever held in the United Kingdom. They will leave a lasting sporting, economic and social legacy.
<P>

<a name="10702w22.html_para2">The Minister of State, Cabinet Office explained, in evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on 20 March 2001, that Manchester City Council, with the Government, had arranged a review of the finances and organisation of the Commonwealth Games in Manchester next year as a build up to the Games moves from the planning to the implementation phase.
<P>

<a name="10702w22.html_para3">Following the review, conscious of the benefits the Games will bring to the nation as a whole, the Government have agreed to provide from existing resources up to &#163;30 million to support the Games. Sport England has agreed to provide up to &#163;30 million to support the Games' costs in addition to its existing contribution to capital facilities, and Manchester City Council will make available a further &#163;35 million. &#163;25 million of these funds will be held jointly by the three parties as a contingency fund. This support is additional to the &#163;10.5 million which the Government have already made available towards the costs of the opening and closing ceremonies for the Commonwealth Games, and marks the full extent of the financial support that the Government are prepared to make available.
<P>

<a name="10702w22.html_para4">The Government consider that this package should give the Games' organisation sufficient certainty to deliver the Games. Manchester City Council continues to retain ultimate financial responsibility for the Games.
<P>

<a name="10702w22.html_para5">Discussions continue about the make up and timing of the package of financial support. The Government, Manchester City Council and Sport England will working with the Games' organisers so strengthen the management arrangements for the control of expenditure.
