To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to give local authorities more control over land development.  [112614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under our modernising planning initiative, local planning authorities, acting through regional planning bodies, are now responsible for preparing draft regional planning guidance. Local planning authorities have always been responsible for development plans and, in the first instance, for determining planning applications. We are committed to the plan-led system under which it is the local authority's development plan which provides the framework for decisions on the control of land development.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what legal advice he has received in the last year on proposals to change the powers of local authorities in respect of airports they own.  [114573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Local authorities are currently required to exercise their control over public airport companies in such a way that the companies do not engage in activities in which the local authorities themselves have no power to engage. Manchester Airport asked my right hon. Friend to remove this limitation by means of a provision in the Local Government Bill under which he could make regulations extending the powers of airport companies and their subsidiaries in relation to specified types of activity. We consider that the clause which Manchester Airport wished my right hon. Friend to add to the Bill for this purpose would have been outside its scope.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the potential benefits of extending the powers of local authorities in respect of airports they own.  [114574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We largely agree with Manchester Airport's own assessment of the potential benefits of wider powers for local authority airport companies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the potential use that local authorities might make in respect of airports they own of the new obligation on local authorities to promote economic and social well-being.  [114575]

<a name="00317w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Part I of the Local Government Bill gives local authorities broad new powers to do anything that contributes to the economic and social well-being of their areas. Subject to the terms of their Memoranda and Articles of Association these powers will also apply to local authority airport companies.

<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Dawson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he is taking to ensure that the money paid to <i>(a)</i> Bus Employees Pension Trustees Ltd. to settle the action of the Bus Employees Superannuation Trust and <i>(b)</i> the National Bus Pension Fund Trust on 1 August 1999 is actually paid to pensioners.  [114721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2000]:</i> Responsibility for distribution of the settlement sum to pensioners rests entirely with the trustees of the two funds who are independent of the Government. We have however made clear to the trustees that we are very concerned about the time it is taking to resolve this matter. I met them in February to discuss progress and emphasised the need to take matters forward as swiftly as possible.
<P>

<a name="00317w01.html_para0">I was pleased to be able to say on 7 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 17-18W, in answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), that the trustees intend to make initial payments to some 8,000 older pensioners in March and April and are urgently investigating the feasibility of making initial payments to other pensioners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 This information can be found in Table X.28, page 119, Chapter 10, Part III of the 1977 Housing Policy Green Paper (Cmnd. 6851). A copy of this Green Paper should be available in the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what guidance he has given to planning authorities about the protection of privacy for neighbours;  [114921]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to introduce measures to improve protection of privacy for neighbours.  [114920]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2000]:</i> Under our plan-led system of development control, decisions on planning applications have to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. We advise in our Planning Policy Guidance Note 1 "General Policy and Principles" that good neighbourliness and fairness are among the yardsticks against which development proposals can be measured and that, for example, it might be material to consider the question of 'overlooking' or 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2000 : Column: 341W</I><P>
loss of privacy experienced by a particular resident. It is for local planning authorities to determine what considerations are material to any particular case.
<P>

<a name="00317w01.html_para1">Planning conditions may also be used to protect privacy. The Department's Circular 11/95 suggests, for example, that a local planning authority may wish in appropriate circumstances to attach to a planning permission a condition preventing the use of the roof area of an extension to a dwellinghouse as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without further permission from the authority. We are not proposing planning to introduce any further specific planning measures to improve the protection of privacy for neighbours, although we will continue to keep the matter under review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what additional resources have been allocated within his Department to oversee the regulation of the water industry.  [115012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2000]:</i> Departmental resources for overseeing the regulation of the water industry have been kept broadly constant in real terms since the election. The Department's Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) regulates drinking water quality on behalf of the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales. DWI expenditure in 1998-99 was &#163;2.1 million, and is expected to be &#163;2.2 million in 1999-2000, compared with &#163;1.8 million in 1997-98.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what timetable he has agreed in respect of the 31 January announcement on consultation about the implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and access to taxis.  [115082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We are reviewing the policy options and will consult with the taxi trade, disability organisations and local authorities on the final proposals, including the timetable for implementation in due course. An announcement with further details will be issued when the timing is clear.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Kaufman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will call for a report from London Underground on the continuing failings of the signalling system on the Jubilee Line, with particular reference to delays on the southbound line on the morning of Tuesday 14 March; and by what date this line is expected to be working efficiently and punctually.  [115127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I note my right hon. Friend's request for a report. This is an operational matter for London Underground Ltd., who have informed me that they are doing all they can to identify and resolve recurring faults. This work has already started to pay off in terms of improved train reliability. Indeed, work is currently in hand, in particular on signalling, which should improve performance significantly over the next few months.

<P>

<a name="00317w01.html_para2">I understand that on the morning of 14 March services were suspended for 25 minutes at the request of the Metropolitan police while they investigated a suspect vehicle parked outside Westminster station. There was no signal failure.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to paragraphs 113 and 126 of the Ministerial Code, what steps he took to avoid conflicts of interest in respect of the renting of a flat from the RMT and other financial arrangements with the RMT.  [115211]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has been a tenant since 1970 of a flat owned by the RMT. Like about 200,000 other pre-1989 private sector tenancies, it is a regulated tenancy under the Rent Acts and is subject to 'fair rent' control. My right hon. Friend has written to the Parliamentary Commissioner explaining to her the reasons why he sees no need to declare the tenancy in the Register of Members' Interests, but for the avoidance of doubt, he has asked for her advice on the issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if there is an exemption order for the Class 460 trains to be introduced into service by Gatwick Express in respect of provisions of the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998; and if he will make a statement.  [115700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As my predecessor explained in her answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) on 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 167W, we are expecting to receive a number of exemption applications from train operating companies whose designs for new rail vehicles were well advanced prior to the 1998 Regulations coming into force.
<P>

<a name="00317w02.html_para0">We have received an application from Gatwick Express relating to the new Class 460 trains they wish to introduce into service. The exemptions, have been discussed with our statutory advisers the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. An exemption Order relating to the exemption of these trains has been laid in Parliament today. Copies are available from the Library.
<P>

<a name="00317w02.html_para1">The exemptions will not prevent disabled people from using the new trains. Indeed, we believe that their introduction will make a significant contribution to improving mobility opportunities for disabled people.

<P>
<a name="00317w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> The staffing costs of the new HQ 2 Division are expected to be of the order of &#163;8 million per annum. The travel and subsistence costs of HQ 2 Division consequent on its relocation to Edinburgh have not been identified separately. The move will save in the region of &#163;4 million per annum in HQ costs compared with HQs in both Edinburgh and York.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service personnel, in each of the armed services, who served in the Gulf War have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder; how many have been treated successfully; how many have left the services on grounds of ill health; and if he will make a statement.  [113959]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) does not keep a central record of all medical diagnoses and subsequent treatment for currently serving personnel. Responsibility for the health of ex-Service personnel, if resident in the UK, lies with the NHS, which similarly does not keep a central record of all diagnoses and treatment. Neither does the NHS routinely communicate diagnostic or treatment information to the MOD. No arrangements are in place to monitor the health of ex-Service personnel living overseas. Therefore, the total number of British Service personnel who took part in the 1990-91 Gulf conflict who have been diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), their Service and their subsequent treatment is not known.
<P>

<a name="00317w02.html_para2">However, the MOD holds information on those Gulf Veterans who were referred by their Service Medical Officer or GP for assessment at the MOD's Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme (MAP). Since its establishment in October 1993, MAP had seen a total of 2,934 patients (up to 31 January 2000). Of these, 245 personnel (nine Royal Navy/Royal Marines, 213 Army, and 23 RAF) had a recorded diagnosis of PTSD confirmed by a consultant psychiatrist.
<P>

<a name="00317w02.html_para3">As at 31 January 2000, of the 53,462 Service personnel who deployed to the Gulf, 846 personnel (189 Royal Navy/Royal Marines, 554 Army and 103 RAF) had been

<P><I>17 Mar 2000 : Column: 344W</I><P>
medically discharged. Of these, 37 (10 Royal Navy/Royal Marines, 24 Army and three RAF) had been medically discharged following a diagnosis of PTSD. Of the 37 cases, nine (two Royal Navy/Royal Marines and seven Army) are included in the figure of 245 who had been to MAP.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> The L27 Anti-Tank Mine was withdrawn from service in 1997 because it was obsolete and no longer required for service use.

 <i>[holding answer 10 March 2000]:</i> Prior to April 1998, the DfEE distributed hard copies of press notices via the Central Office of Information delivery service. After April 1998, all press releases have been distributed electronically via the News Distribution Service managed by the Central Office of Information.

<a name="00317w06.html_para4">The first of these, EC Regulation 49/2000, amends Regulation 1139/98 on the labelling of foods containing GM soya and maize, to extend the scope of the requirements to include foods for catering establishments, and to establish a 1 per cent. de minimis threshold for the adventitious contamination of non-GM material, below which GM labelling will not be required. The second, EC Regulation 50/2000, will require for the first time, the labelling of foods and food ingredients which contain GM additives and flavourings.
<P>

<a name="00317w06.html_para5">The Government are determined that consumers should be able to make informed choices about whether or not to eat genetically modified foods, and these new Regulations will strengthen further the arrangements already in place for this purpose.

<P>
<a name="00317w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Before making their recommendation on the level of the accommodation offset for the introduction of the national minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission undertook an extensive and wide ranging consultation exercise, which included written and oral evidence from organisations and individuals in various sectors that provide accommodation for workers. They also examined current charges in the agricultural and hotel industries and took account of the rates set in the former Wages Councils. In view of the representations received during the consultation exercise on the draft National Minimum Wage Regulations, the Government asked the Commission to look again at this issue in February 1999. The Commission also considered the offset for their second report, which monitored the impact of the minimum wage since its introduction in April.
<P>

<a name="00317w07.html_para2">The Government believe that workers should be paid a reasonable wage and not have to rely on benefits in kind.

 The maximum amount which can be offset against national minimum wage pay by employers who provide accommodation is &#163;19.95 a week. This is to be calculated at either &#163;2.85 per day or 50p an hour, up to the maximum. The two different methods of calculation ensure that part-time workers do not lose out.

I am satisfied that the basis of the Government's participation in this risk sharing partnership is fully justified by the benefits it will secure for the UK economy, by ensuring substantial UK involvement in the design and production of this advanced aircraft. Supporting innovation and enterprise, improving productivity and developing skills is the only way forward in the knowledge-based economy of the 21st Century.

It is an established principle in the public service that civil servants in their official capacity should not accept invitations to conferences convened by, or under the aegis of, party political organisations. The situation is, of course, different when Ministers require officials to be in attendance at party political events in order to enable the Minister to carry out urgent departmental business.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2000]:</i> Dome tickets can be purchased through National Lottery outlets, travel operators, the New Millennium Experience Company's website and a call centre as well as at the dome. It should be borne in mind, however, that when people purchase dome tickets, particularly those bought at the dome itself but also those purchased through the other outlets, their location at the time is not always an indication of their place of residence. For example, 7.9 per cent. of tickets were bought on the door and are counted in the proportions as having been bought in England. Of the total sales as at 7 March, 97.2 per cent. were purchased in or from addresses in England, 1.3 per cent. in Wales, 1.1 per cent in Scotland and 0.4 per cent. in Northern Ireland.

<a name="00317w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We have received several letters and telephone calls over the past year concerning delays in obtaining criminal record checks. Under arrangements agreed with the Home Office, police forces in England and Wales aim to reply to employers and other agencies within 10 days, unless inquiries need to be made of other forces in which case the aim is to reply within three weeks. However, these targets are subject to the allocation of resources within each police force which is the responsibility of the Chief Constable.

<a name="00317w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Apart from those cities that enjoy city status by ancient prescriptive usage, city status is an honour conferred by the Sovereign by Letters Patent. As it is a matter for the Royal Prerogative, the Sovereign can strip a city of its status, but this has never been done. Any city acknowledged by ancient prescriptive usage would be expected to have had that status confirmed by local government legislation during the last 100-150 years. It is possible, however, under local government re- organisation legislation, for a new local authority to lose the city status previously enjoyed by part of that authority.

 The cost of a scheme would depend on the number and size of donations (up to a &#163;500 limit) in respect of which qualifying political parties claimed relief. The Government's White Paper on the Funding of Political Parties in the United Kingdom, published in July 1999, estimated the loss of revenue at upwards of &#163;4 million or &#163;5 million a year. This estimate was based on an assumption that the three main parties would claim relief on an average donation of &#163;20 from each of their members.

When curfewees are apprehended following a period unlawfully at large, they are required to serve the full period of time outstanding at the point their licence was revoked.
<P>

<a name="00317w12.html_para10">As of 29 February, the Prison Service had received notification of 182 curfewees who had been charged with an offence committed while subject to the Home Detention Curfew scheme, rather than the figure of 194 given in my previous reply.
<P>

<a name="00317w12.html_para11">A revised breakdown of the offences with which the curfewees were charged is shown in the table. This breakdown has been prepared from information supplied by police forces and drawn from the police national computer. As previously indicated, further analysis of re-offending by those subject to Home Detention Curfew, including the procedures for notification of further charges to the Prison Service by the police, is currently under way as part of a long-term evaluation of the scheme.

by the curfew. The scheme only applies to short-term prisoners and no prisoner can be granted Home Detention Curfew without first passing a risk assessment. Overall, the Home Detention Curfew scheme has an impressive success rate of 95 per cent. of curfewees completing their period of curfew licence. However, as I made clear in my previous reply, we are not complacent about any re-offending on curfew and the scheme is strictly enforced.

<a name="00317w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many courts have <i>(a)</i> been due for closure and <i>(b)</i> closed in each of the last four years; and what estimate he has made of the costs saved by each closure.  [114732]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w13.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The number of magistrates courts assessed by local Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs) as due for closure is: 1996--20, 1997--24, 1998--25, 1999--8. The number of courts closed is: 1996--20, 1997--22, 1998--24, 1999--8. The Government's policy is that magistrates courts are best managed locally by MCCs, and that decisions and costings concerning the number of magistrates courts in its area are for the MCC to determine. The cost saving achieved by the closures is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="00317w13.html_para2">The Chief Executive of the Court Service has supplied the following information.
<P>

<a name="00317w13.html_para3">Since 1 March 1996 to date, public consultation on the question of closure has been authorised in respect of 37 county courts, of which 25 have been closed or amalgamated.
<P>

<a name="00317w13.html_para4">The number of county courts closed in each of the last four years since 1 March 1996 is: 1996--7, 1997--8, 1998--6, 1999--2. Two county courts have been closed to date since 1 January 2000.

<a name="00317w13.html_para5">The financial savings to the Court Service are chiefly in terms of rent and accommodation charges, running costs such as telephone, postage, and maintenance of buildings. Figures on all the savings accruing from county court closures since 1996 are not kept centrally by the Court Service. However, a broad conservative estimate of accommodation charges saved and general running costs would indicate a minimum saving of around &#163;3,000,000 over the four year period since March 1996. During the period there were no Crown court closures, actual or contemplated.

 Court fee increases in November 1996 were estimated to cost the legal aid fund some &#163;14 million. No estimate was made of the small increase in fees in 1997 and there were no increases in 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00317w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Act allows the Lord Chancellor to set a rate by which lump sum awards for damages are discounted to offset the advantage to the claimant of receiving his money all at once. In Wells <i>v.</i> Wells [1999] 1 A.C. 345 the House of Lords ruled that the rate should be based on the return available from Index Linked Government Securities (ILGS) because the claimant must be assumed to pursue risk-averse investments. The Lord Chancellor has today issued a consultation paper seeking comments on how the discount rate should be set and reviewed. In the light of responses he will decide whether, and if so how, to exercise the power under section 1 of the Act.
