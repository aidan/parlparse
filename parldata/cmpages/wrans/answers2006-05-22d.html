Development agencies and non-governmental organisations have evacuated staff for their security and protection and recovery programmes have been suspended. In addition, regular economic activities and recovery work undertaken in communities without external assistance has also been affected by military activity. Able-bodied men are being mobilised for LTTE service, and people are being displaced by fighting, or the fear of fighting.</p>

The international community, including the United Kingdom, is working hard to encourage the Government and the LTTE to curtail violence and to return to the negotiating table. Once the security environment improves we will renew efforts to help ensure delivery of development assistance to communities.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="06052325000190"><a name="60522w0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="06052325001881"><b>Mr. Thomas:</b> The UK Government's approach to promoting reproductive health is set out in the DFID position paper, "Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights". Our approach to achieving the fifth Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health is outlined in the DFID strategy paper, "Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and Action". Both were published in 2004 after extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community, NGOs, parliamentarians and civil society groups. A web-based consultation was also held as part of this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="60522w0001.htm_para7"><a name="06052325000191">Our understanding of the so-called "Mexico City Policy" is that it requires non-US NGOs to agree that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive US funding. This means, for example, that non-US NGOs who accept US funding are not allowed to use their own funds to provide information or counselling for abortion care, or to promote awareness of the benefits of legal reform. As the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) "Death and Denial: Unsafe Abortion and Poverty" report makes clear, the policy forces NGOs to choose between carrying on work to protect the health and rights of women or lose funds. No reproductive or maternal health NGOs affected by the policy work to "promote abortion as a method of family planning", and indeed this would be contrary to the global consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). What they try to do is to provide a comprehensive range of information and services that can help save women's lives, and reduce the need for abortion. The US policy means that the work of such organisations is compromised, and that is why my Department is opposed to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="60522w0001.htm_para8"><a name="06052325000194">One challenge is the lack of data, especially at the regional and provincial level.

Nearly 5,000 megawatts (MW) have been added to the national grid since 2003, but Iraq&#146;s average electricity generation has not improved over that period. This is because at the same time as capacity is being added through reconstruction projects, breakdowns of the pre-existing dilapidated systems, shortages of fuel supplies and sabotage are reducing capacity. So Iraqis are not getting the full benefit of those extra megawatts. Demand for electricity also continues to rise dramatically, as the economy grows and more people own and use electrical goods such as fridges and air-conditioning units. The new Iraqi Government will be starting work on a long-term power sector strategy, with DFID&#146;s support.</p>

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="06052325000212"><a name="60522w0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="06052325001887"><b>Mr. Thomas:</b> DFID is the only major bilateral donor to already have a specific strategy focusing on maternal health: &#147;Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action&#148;, which was launched in 2004. We have disseminated this comprehensive maternal health strategy throughout the international system, with other donors, the UN, and most importantly, with the developing partners we support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="60522w0001.htm_para21"><a name="06052325000213">The strategy provides the basis for DFID support to improve maternal health at country level, which we do through a combination of programmes to strengthen health services and improve overall reproductive and child health, along with specific maternal health programmes and HIV interventions. Long-term support for maternal health in Nepal, for example, is demonstrating significant increases in women&#146;s access to emergency obstetric care in remote areas and in a fragile state. This work highlights the importance of support for community level action to overcome cultural and socio-economic barriers to accessing care, as well as the importance of addressing infrastructure (roads, bridges) and communications issues to ensure an effective referral system. In Malawi, DFID is supporting an Emergency Human Resource Programme to address the acute shortages of health workers, an issue which has been compounded by the AIDS epidemic. Overall investments for maternal health (including reproductive health services) have increased by over 40 per cent. over the past three years, to &#163;242.9 million in 2004-05.</p>

We are seeking to highlight the importance of maternal health within the current G8 process, although the prime health theme at present is infectious disease. We are also working to ensure that the new Partnership for Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health can play a useful role in advocating more action on maternal health, and to improve the way UN agencies work together on this issue.</p>

Getting reliable information on maternal deaths is difficult in most developing countries where maternal deaths are not recorded and where more than half of all births take place at home, without a skilled attendant but either with relatives or alone. This is why DFID, along with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation, supports IMMPACT, the only global research initiative which is successfully identifying effective ways in which maternal deaths can be measured and the statistics used for high level advocacy. DFID further supports a recent global partnership, Health Metrics Network, which aims to provide country level support to Governments to get better data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="60522w0002.htm_para12"><a name="06052325000281">In late 2005, the DPRK said that it would no longer accept international humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, it has increased the already significant restrictions it places on the humanitarian community, with the consequence that DFID can no longer feel confident that programmes of assistance are appropriate and are reaching those who need it most. All World Food Programme (WFP) operations are funded solely from voluntary contributions and the UK is not contributing to the one in the DPRK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="60522w0002.htm_para14"><a name="06052325000285">Prior to 16 March 2006 the air route in the vicinity of West Somerset and Sedgmoor was Airway N864 with an axis 190°/010°, a lateral extent of 10 nautical miles and with the centreline approximately over Blue Anchor Bay. The vertical limits of the route extend from FL55 (5,500 feet above mean sea level) to the north of the coastline and FL65 (6,500 feet amsl) over land to an upper limit of FL245 (24,500 feet amsl). The volume of airspace within the airway is defined as controlled airspace. Above FL245 is the Upper Airspace Control Area, which covers the whole of the United Kingdom. Within the Upper Airspace Control Area above West Somerset and Sedgmoor existed the routes UN864, UN862, UM140, UM17 and UW501.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="60522w0002.htm_para15"><a name="06052325000286">The changes on 16 March did not affect N864, UN864, UM140, UM17 and UW501. However, a new route called N90 was introduced to the east of N864 for use between Friday evenings and Monday mornings. The lateral extent of the new controlled airspace is 12 nautical miles from the eastern boundary of N864 and with a lower limit of FL105 (10,500 feet amsl). In the Upper Control Area UN90 was introduced above N90 and UN862 was moved two nautical miles to the east to be above N862. A new Upper Air Route called UN22 was introduced parallel to and 12 nautical miles west of UN864.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="60522w0002.htm_para16"><a name="06052325000287">Additionally, there are proposed changes to controlled airspace associated with Bristol and Cardiff airports, which are intended to introduce new controlled airspace over part of West Somerset and Sedgmoor. It should be noted that aircraft operations associated with these airports occur today and the proposed new controlled airspace is designed to provide additional protection to these flights. The proposals have been the subject of public consultation, which included Members of Parliament, local authorities, representatives of areas of natural beauty and other interested parties within the areas affected. These changes are currently subject to regulatory consideration by the CAA.</p>

For example, the UK has given up both the nuclear Lance missile and artillery roles we undertook previously with US nuclear weapons held under dual-key arrangements, along with our maritime tactical nuclear capability, so that Royal Navy surface ships no longer have any capability to carry or deploy nuclear weapons. In 1998, the UK withdrew and dismantled the last air-launched nuclear weapon, the Royal Air Force&#146;s WE117 nuclear bombs. The dismantlement of the last remaining Chevaline (Polaris) warheads occurred in April 2002, so that Trident is now our only nuclear weapons system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="60522w0014.htm_para4"><a name="06052325001656">In all, there has been a reduction of the UK&#146;s operationally available stockpile of nuclear weapons to fewer than 200 warheads, representing a reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. Only one Trident submarine is on deterrent patrol at any one time and that submarine is normally on several days &#145;notice to fire&#146; and its missiles are not targeted at any specific country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="60522w0014.htm_para5"><a name="06052325001657">In addition, the UK announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and we continually press for negotiations to begin on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. We have also been more transparent about our nuclear and fissile material stockpiles, publishing an historical account of plutonium stockpiles, along with an account of our highly enriched uranium earlier this year.</p>

mobility. Its central purpose is to equip both young people and adults with the skills for productive and rewarding employment in a modern economy. In England we will continue to spend between &#163;2.8 billion and &#163;2.9 billion a year of taxpayers&#146; money on support for adult learning. The broad volumes of publicly funded education and training will be maintained; however the balance will shift. We believe that it is right to focus help more on those who need it most,&#151;thatis, those without the basic skills or a full level 2 qualification needed if individuals are to become effective and fulfilled members of the work force, their families and local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="60522w0018.htm_para0"><a name="06052389000520">This does mean that those outside our priority areas may have to pay more for their courses. It does not mean that courses which are valued by learners and providers should close because public funding is reduced. The experience of many colleges, for example the City college, Brighton and Hove, is that it is possible to increase fees and the number of enrolments at the same time as providing safeguards for those adults on benefits. I would look to providers in other areas, including Bath, to follow these examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="60522w0018.htm_para1"><a name="06052389000521">In the White Paper &#145;Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&#146; we reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard funding for Personal and Community Development Learning with a budget of &#163;210 million in 2006/07, including family learning, family literacy, language and numeracy and neighbourhood learning in deprived communities. In addition we set out our intention to reinvigorate this type of learning to improve its planning, its quality and to gear it more to the needs of local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="60522w0018.htm_para2"><a name="06052389000522">As to the specific questions of funding in each area, the Department allocates funds for the post-16 education and training sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices.

However, the average cost of a completed Academy with 1,300 pupils and a sixth form in a high-cost inner-city area is &#163;25-30 million. The average cost of a new secondary school of this size and location is similarly &#163;25-30 million. For example, the average cost per pupil of new build voluntary aided schools which the Department is currently funding is &#163;23,886, and the total cost of these new VA schools ranges up to &#163;35,578,800.</p>

We and the other signatories to the National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload, believe that well-trained and experienced support staff (such as higher level teaching assistants), can, under the direction and supervision of a teacher, play a valuable role in taking whole classes, while teachers are undertaking PPA activities.

Such designations should therefore only be maintained, or, exceptionally, extended where it can clearly shown that criteria-based policies cannot provide the necessary protection.

Over the past decade energy prices in the UK have been amongst the cheapest in the EU, but I do recognise the serious recent difficulties for all sectors. However, I remain optimistic about investment by local authorities in sports facilities, which will amount to some &#163;1 billion over the next three years. In addition, since 1997 Government and lottery distributing bodies between them have invested over&#163;3 billion in physical activity and sport.</p>

This includes formal Regulatory Impact Assessments where appropriate, as well as wider cross-Government work on Better Regulation. The tourism sector is also represented on my Department's Better Regulations Task Group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="60522w0030.htm_para0"><a name="06052389004013">The Quality Assurance Schemes operated by VisitBritain, the Automobile Association, VisitScotland, and the Wales Tourist Board, are voluntary in nature. Participating businesses pay to be quality inspected, and derive marketing and other benefits from inclusion in the Schemes. The Schemes have, from May 2005, been improved and standardised following work commissioned by VisitBritain and led by Alan Britten CBE. Both inbound and domestic visitors now have confidence in a standardised inspection regime across Britain. This has led to some changes in classification as it affects the descriptions used by hotels and guest houses in their own signage and promotional material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="60522w0030.htm_para1"><a name="06052389004014">The changes to the Quality Schemes followed wide industry consultation, and assessments of the cost and benefits to affected businesses. My Department is satisfied that the consultation carried out was more than adequate to reflect the views of affected businesses. The general consensus across the industry was that the changes in classification were highly beneficial in terms of improved consumer certainty when booking accommodation. In addition, my Department considers that the resulting changes to the VisitBritain Quality Scheme (which is funded through grant-in-aid) were primarily operational in nature. It was not, therefore, considered necessary to conduct a formal Regulatory Impact Assessment in these circumstances.</p>

The TPS scheme provides protection to consumers from cold-calling if they have previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or have been registered with the TPS for at least 28 days. Those making cold calls from within the UK or on behalf of UK companies from outside the European Union are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS list. However, cold calls from non-UK companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the TSP scheme, as the companies and products have no link with the UK.

property is most often an issue in divorce proceedings. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 governs the division of property on divorce and sets out a number of factors to be taken into account by the courts when considering that division. The prime consideration is the welfare of any children. Other factors include the contribution, both financial and other, that each spouse has made and the length of the marriage. The courts often make property adjustment orders as part of an assessment based on the future needs of the divorcing spouses and the needs of any children involved. Every marriage is different and circumstances vary so much that it would not be equitable in many cases to impose an automatic equal right.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Data for 1986-87 to 1995-96 reported under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 1985; data from 1996-97 reported under RIDDOR 1995. Injuries comprise fatal, major and over three-day injuries to workers.<br>
2. The annual basis is the planning year from 1 April to 31 March.<br>
3. RIDDOR statistics are those reported by employers and others to all enforcing authorities.<br>
4. Estimates of work-related injuries have also been available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) since 1994-95. Comparing LFS estimates with the injuries reported suggests that not all non-fatal accidents are reported, and that the level of reporting by employers has varied between 41 per cent. and 48 per cent. However, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) does know about all fatal injuries at work.<br>

It is appreciated that without a record of the conversation held between Mrs Fordyce and the Benefit Enquiry Line it is difficult to confirm what was actually said. However, as explained, our advisors are fully conversant with the rules for claiming CA and deal with a great number of enquiries on this very issue on a daily basis. I am confident, therefore, that they would have provided the correct advice to Mrs Fordyce. In view of this a special payment could not be made.</p>

With new legislation, brought in from10 April 2006, there is no longer the need to claim both benefits at the same time. As long as the claim for CA is made within three months of the decision being made on the claim to DLA the carer can request backdating to the start of the DLA award date. Although this will not help Mrs Fordyce it should ensure that this situation does not reoccur and affect other carers.</p>

Clearly, this caused difficulties in trying to respond to simultaneous incidents. In addition, many smaller forces did not provide their own (expensive) specialist firearms services but looked to neighbouring forces to assist them as and when incidents occurred, relying on goodwill and building in a delay to what is often an urgent requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="60522w0054.htm_para0"><a name="06052439002391">The impact of restructuring will be that new forces will have sufficient resilience to provide armed response units dedicated solely to this function. This will allow them to gain greater skills and experience and have sufficient capacity to focus on not just responding to firearms incidents but also preventative work. Forces will be of sufficient size to allow them to develop their own dedicated, specialist firearms services, improving their training, expertise and experience of incidents as well as negating their reliance upon others for those services.</p>

This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work. Earlier estimates are from the New Earnings Survey (NES) which used a similar definition for earnings estimates.</p>

Estimates of changes between years are subject to sampling variations. In particular some changes prior to the introduction of ASHE in 1997 should be treated with caution. The occupational classification used for ASHE have only two levels of classification relating to police officers, which are given in the attached tables. Current prices refer to figures expressed in terms of the prices that were current for the period. Consequently figures for 2000 are in terms of prices that were current in 2000 and figure for 1990 are in terms of prices that were current in 1990.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>
The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>
The above estimates have a CV of less than 5 per cent.<br>
The median replaces the mean as the heading statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data<i> .</i><br>

The Commission made a wide range of recommendations. For example, its report is known to have influenced legislation governing police powers in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and also the establishment of an independent Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. There does not appear to have been a formal published Government response to the recommendations in the report and it is not possible to supply the detailed information requested. In the 25 years since the report was published there have been a number of other enquiries, most recently, Sir Robin Auld's Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales in 2001.</p>

The annual allocation is&#163;30 million. As part of the police funding settlement for 2006-07 and 2007-08, we have consolidated four specific grants, including the Rural Policing Fund, into a single provision for each police authority to give them more control over how they may be used.

We have also made a commitment that by April 2007, Neighbourhood Policing will have been introduced to every area in England and Wales.</p>

This data cannot be used to calculate mortality rates attributed to medicines for a number of reasons. Importantly, not all adverse reactions are reported and the level of underreporting differs between medicines. Furthermore, doctors are asked to report suspected adverse reactions regardless of any doubts about a causal association with a medicine. Therefore, a report of a particular adverse reaction on the yellow card database does not necessarily mean that the drug caused it, and other factors such as an underlying or new medical condition may have played a role. Any comparison between products is invalid as the usage of these products and the other factors which affect the level of reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions vary greatly between products.</p>

<p><a name="st_778"><a name="06052439005436"><a name="60522w0067.htm_spnew6"><a name="06052439006310"><b>Caroline Flint:</b> The Immigration Act 1971 gives immigration officers the power to refer people who are subject to immigration control and who are seeking entry to the United Kingdom to a medical inspector for a medical examination. The immigration officer may take the findings of the medical examination into account when deciding whether to admit the person to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_656"><a name="60522w0067.htm_para6"><a name="06052439005437">The long-standing policy of successive Governments are that people who come from a country with a high annual incidence rate of tuberculosis (over 40 cases of TB per 100,000 population) and who are seeking leave to enter the UK for more than six months and port asylum claimants should routinely be referred for medical examination. In addition, immigration officers should refer for medical examination anyone who appears ill, or who mentions health or illness as a reason for coming to the UK. Because of the large numbers of travellers passing through Heathrow and Gatwick airports, there are three x-ray machines at Heathrow and one at Gatwick for taking chest x-rays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_657"><a name="60522w0067.htm_para7"><a name="06052439005438">The time pressures at points of entry mean that it is not possible, even where x-ray machines are available, to carry out there all the tests that would be desirable, or to make firm diagnoses of TB. That is why long-standing policy is that checks carried out at points of entry should be followed up by the national health service. This was reinforced by the &#147;NICE TB Clinical Guidelines&#148; published on the 22 March 2006, which make clear recommendations to the NHS to identify new entrants for TB screening from port of arrival reports (that is, information from medical inspectors), new registrations with primary care, entry to education (including universities) and links with statutory and voluntary groups working with new entrants. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence also have provided screening protocols and toolkits for the NHS for new entrant screening. The Department does not routinely collect figures from points of entry on the numbers of immigrants screened for TB. Follow up health checks on immigrants may take a variety of forms, in a variety of settings, and are not identified as such in statistics about NHS activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_658"><a name="60522w0067.htm_para8"><a name="06052439005439">As announced in February 2005, in the Home Office&#146;s five-year asylum and immigration strategy &#147;Controlling our Borders&#148; (Cm 6742), the Government plan to increase the number of routine TB checks that are done abroad. Checks overseas can be more thorough than those that can be made under pressure of time at points of entry, and those found to have infectious TB are required to complete treatment before entry clearance to the UK is granted. Phase one of this overseas programme began in autumn 2005 has been operational in six countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Sudan, Tanzania and Thailand) since spring 2006. Phase two is planned to start later in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_659"><a name="60522w0067.htm_para9"><a name="06052439005440">The Department and the Home Office commissioned a review of the operational arrangements made at points of entry in England both for medical examinations under the Immigration Act and for discharging responsibilities under the Public Health (Aircraft), (Ships) and (International Trains) Regulations with a view to strengthening those arrangements.
