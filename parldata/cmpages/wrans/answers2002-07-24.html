To ask the Solicitor-General when the Attorney-General will announce the outcome of the review of the role and practices of the Crown Prosecution Service in cases arising from a death in custody.  [73440]
<P>

<P>
<a name="20724w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Attorney-General hopes to make an announcement around the end of September. He had hoped to do so before Parliament rose this month, but because of the thought provoking contributions that have been made, and because he wishes to examine aspects of the handling of a trial which ended in acquittal earlier this month, he has decided to extend the period of the review. He is grateful to all those who have so far responded to the consultation paper or contributed their views in other ways.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the Honours and Decorations Committee re-opened the case to consider awarding a 1951&#150;54 Suez Canal Campaign Medal; who requested that the matter be reviewed; and when he expects a decision to be made.  [61264]

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister gave on 17 June 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 43W to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard).
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para2">The Government considers it important to respect the principle that where there is a clear, demonstrable decision taken within five years of a campaign that a General Service Medal should not be awarded, that decision should not be reopened.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para3">The evidence relating to consideration of a General Service Medal for the Suez Canal Zone is however less clear-cut. A number of representations.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para4">In view of these exceptional circumstances, the Government is setting up a small sub-committee of HD Committee under the chairmanship of General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank to report on the case for an exceptional award of a General Service Medal for the Suez Canal Zone without creating wider precedent or breaching longstanding principles which underpin the making of such awards.

<a name="20724w01.html_wqn3"><B> Ann Clwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the UK Government's policy towards the surrender of UK nationals where accused of a crime in connection with a UN peacekeeping or enforcement operation committed after 1 July upon request of the International Criminal Court.  [66479]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), investigation and, if necessary, prosecution of any allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide by United Kingdom nationals would be carried out by the UK. The purpose of the ICC is to bring to justice those who commit these crimes and to act as a deterrent against their being committed. The UK strongly supports the ICC and these aims. The ICC will intervene only when it determines that a state is unwilling or unable to pursue a particular case, but it is inconceivable that this would ever apply to the UK. We do not, therefore, envisage that the UK would ever be required to surrender its nationals to the ICC.

<a name="20724w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what date the closure of RAF Chilmark was announced; what was the <i>(a)</i> planned date and <i>(b)</i> actual date of closure; what was the (i) estimated and (ii) actual date of disposal; what was the (A) estimated and (B) actual sale value of the site ; what was the (1) estimated and (2) actual cost of remediation; who calculated the estimated sale value of the site and on what basis; what the (x) estimated and (y) actual annual running costs of the site were between closure and disposal; and what the annual costs have been of decontamination work since the announcement of closure.  [68927]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The closure of RAF Chilmark was formally announced in September 1992, with a planned closure date of April 1995. The site closed on 1 April 1995.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para5">RAF Chilmark originally comprised separate sites at Dinton and Chilmark. Sales of the various parts were planned to follow clearance of explosive ordnance devices and any necessary decontamination, although it was accepted that final clearance of the entire site could take a considerable time.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para6">The first major sale was completed in July 1995, with seven further sales since. Chilmark HQ site and land at Ladydown are the only parts remaining unsold.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para7">No formal estimate was made of overall sale receipts, since at the time of closure, no firm estimation could be made as to the eventual timetable for sale.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1106W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para8">Receipts from those parts sold since closure total approximately &#163;1.5 million.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para9">No formal figure was prepared prior to the results of the Land Quality Assessments and prior to the introduction of more refined investigatory equipment.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para10">The cost over the first five years since closure of clearing explosive ordnance has been in the region of &#163;1.7 million. A further &#163;371,000 has been spent on preparation of Land Quality Assessments and remediation. Later figures have not yet been compiled.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para11">The values of those parts already sold have been assessed either by consultants to the Ministry of Defence or by the District Valuer. All sales have been at not less than open market value.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para12">The total of the actual holding costs of the site from closure in 1995 to 31 March 2002, excluding remediation works but including the cost of security guarding, is in the region of &#163;1.9 million (excluding VAT). Estimated costs are prepared on an annual basis, and have proved to be very close to the actual costs.
<P>

<a name="20724w01.html_para13">The future cost of any necessary decontamination of the remaining parts at Chilmark HQ site and Ladydown cannot be assessed until clearance of explosive ordnance is complete.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The cost of maintaining Britain's nuclear weapons has been about 1 per cent. of the total annual defence budget and is expected to remain at around that level for each of the next five years.

<a name="20724w02.html_para0">The 2001&#150;02 figures are provisional. Routine repairs within the required time scale have consistently achieved or exceeded the targets. The achievement on urgent repairs continues to fall slightly short of the target but still represents a year on year improvement. There has also been a slight shortfall against target emergency repairs for the past two years. The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) is addressing areas of under-performance and will take remedial action to improve their service to service families. The DHE is also developing a more sophisticated system of measuring its performance on repairs which will take into account quality and customer satisfaction.

 No changes have been made to the configuration of troop seating in the RAF C130J aircraft. A maximum of 128 personnel can be accommodated in the C-Mk 4 and 91 people in the C-Mk 5. At present, however, passenger seating in the cargo compartments of both C130J marks is restricted while an investigation is carried out into the cause of noise and vibration within the compartment and its effect on passengers. This has temporarily reduced the seating capacity by 22 seats on the C-Mk 4 and 23 seats on the C-Mk 5.

 I refer the hon. Member to my answer of 30 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 565W to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws). On the basis of provisional outturn for 2001&#150;02, United Kingdom defence spending as a percentage of UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in that year is now estimated to be 2.5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20724w03.html_para1">All the figures are based on cash outturn and include the unprogrammed cost of operations and other additions to the planned budget provided in Supplementary Estimates.

Outturn figures are likely to be higher than these plans, when the costs of operations and any other in-year additions are taken into account, and this would increase the share of GDP represented by defence spending in these years.

<P>

<P>
<a name="20724w03.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Defence and the Social Security Minister announced on 20 July 2000 that changes would be made to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) to allow widows and widowers in receipt of an Attributable Forces Family Pension to retain their pension if they remarry or cohabit. These changes took effect from 31 October 2000. Previously, an attributable widow(er)s' pension was withdrawn on remarriage or cohabitation, although it would have been automatically restored on second widowhood or at the end of a period of cohabitation. Those widows or widowers who had already remarried, and have had their attributable pension withdrawn, were not included in the change. Those in receipt of a War Widows' Pension payable under the Naval, Military and Air Force etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, or a non-attributable widows or widowers' AFPS pension, are also not affected by the change; their pensions will still cease on remarriage or cohabitation.
<P>

<a name="20724w03.html_para5">No further changes to widow(er)s' pensions under the current pension scheme are envisaged, however, the review of the AFPS currently proposes extending the October 2000 change to non-attributable pensions. On current plans, this would only apply to those joining the new scheme.

<a name="20724w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is widely recognised that the Test and Evaluation (T&E) business has been in need of radical restructuring for many years. As part of tackling this problem head on, a long-term partnering contract is currently being negotiated with QinetiQ for the delivery of the T&E capability. The process includes the Ministry of Defence setting challenging targets to ensure that the T&E structure is more closely aligned with MOD's requirement for T&E capabilities. To achieve this within the taut budget, QinetiQ has put forward a number of proposals, which aim to remove excess capacity, duplication and obsolete facilities.
<P>

<a name="20724w06.html_para11">QinetiQ has identified three major rationalisation proposals for the air ranges. These are: conversion of the Aberporth range to an instrumented training range, the closure of Llanbedr airfield, and the reduction to campaign operation status of the West Freugh range.
<P>

<a name="20724w06.html_para12">The proposals will potentially deliver net savings in excess of &#163;300 million across the life of the 25-year contract, and will transform the T&E business into the effective, modern organisation that we require.
<P>

<a name="20724w06.html_para13">The delivery of these savings is likely to lead to around 400 job losses, spread across all three establishments. I will be writing today to fully inform interested parties, including the unions, about the proposals beginning the consultation process.

 Approximately half of infectious disease deaths in developing countries can be attributed to three diseases: HIV, TB and malaria, which cause more than five million deaths per year. DFID is working to strengthen developing countries' health systems to deliver effective services to the poorest. We have committed more than &#163;1 billion to that purpose since 1997. The UK has also taken an active role in the establishment of the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, which is designed to improve provision of drugs and commodities to treat those diseases. DFID has pledged $200 million over five years for the fund.

<a name="20724w06.html_para15">First, the Everything but Arms initiative (EBA), which grants the worlds 49 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) duty and quota free access to EU markets for all their export products, excluding arms and munitions.

These EPAs will seek to create WTO compatible free trade areas between coherent groups of ACP countries and the EU.

 The UK understands the damaging impact of subsidised agriculture exports on developing countries. We recognise that subsidised agriculture exports have a dampening effect on world prices and thus constrain agriculture investment and growth in developing countries. The UK is therefore pressing for substantial CAP reform under the current mid-term review, to reduce EU subsidies.

However, serious challenges remain. Chronic malnutrition, food shortages and socio-economic vulnerability are still alarmingly high. According to the UN, almost one third of the Afghan population is dependant on some form of emergency assistance. In many parts of the country these challenges are compounded by problems of access due to continuing insecurity, the presence of land mines and UXOs, and, in the later winter months, will be further complicated by heavy snows and extreme cold temperatures.

At the Annual Meetings of the World bank and IMF we asked the World bank staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including HlPCs. The IMF and World bank analysis shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens as a result. Following UK pressure, the World bank and IMF Boards have agreed to provide additional relief to countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the Spring meetings, in April, and Burkina Faso became the first HIPC country to benefit from 'topping up' at Completion Point.

<P>
<a name="20724w09.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department is working in many different ways to ensure that all water companies who engage in water supply projects cater for all, especially the poor. Our policy for achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people without access to safe water by 2015 is set out in the strategy paper "Addressing the Water crisis&#151;Healthier and More Productive Lives for Poor People". The policy seems sustainability in water supply and sanitation service delivery with a proper pro-poor focus. We are working with developing country Governments to ensure priority for pro-poor water supply and sanitation services within the Poverty Reduction Strategy processes. We are also supporting a considerable body of research that is seeking specifically to develop mechanisms by which the private sector is able best to provide for the poor.
<P>

<a name="20724w09.html_para1">My Department has been at the forefront of developing new facilities to ensure that the engagement of the private sector in water supply and sanitation addresses the needs of the poor.

 Like all 36 signatories to the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises (MNEs), the UK has a national contact point (NCP), responsible for ensuring effective implementation of the guidelines, this includes contributing to the resolution of concerns about the behaviour of MNEs raised with it. The UK NCP is based on the Department of Trade and Industry working in liaison with other Government Departments. Signatories to the guidelines recognise that there are greater difficulties in implementing them in non-adhering countries (which includes almost all developing countries), not lest because they do not have NCPs. However, the Government's expectations of UK MNE behaviour are the same wherever they operate. In developing countries positive co-operation between the NCP, UK Government representation locally, business, unions, NGOs, and individuals is important for successful implementation and promotion. The UK Government are working hard to raise the profile of the guidelines in developing countries, for example through the recent G7/8 Action Plan for Africa initiative, through UK overseas

 We understand that the new Population and Family Planning Law in China, which is due to come into effect on 1 September this year, does not include detailed population quotas. The law sets out the rights and responsibilities of the state and individuals in the areas of reproductive health and family planning. Birth targets and quotas remain a feature of population policy in China, but we are supporting the work of the United Nations population fund which seeks to demonstrate to the Chinese authorities that a client-oriented quality of care approach is a viable alternative to the current administrative family planning approach. Birth targets and quotas have been removed in counties where UNFPA is operating.

 The planned increase in my Department's budget announced in the 2002 spending review settlement will enable us to increase significantly our bilateral contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and to play a greater role in strengthening the contribution of the international system. There is no room for complacency. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will entail a massive collective effort by the entire international community, developed and developing countries, to support poverty reduction. This includes further progress by donors towards the 0.7 per cent. target; delivering on the Doha commitments to make trade fairer for developing countries; improving the effectiveness of development assistance through sharpening its poverty focus; untying and promoting harmonisation of donor practices to reduce transaction costs. for developing countries it means tacking responsibility for developing and implementing poverty reduction policies and tackling the constraints on pro-poor growth including corruption, weak governance and conflict.

 DFID's current support for the civil society campaign for good governance is committed for two years.

 In response to the wishes expressed by civil society, soon after the conclusion of the peace agreement signed at Lom&#233; in July 1999, I agreed to support a project that would help restore the machinery of government at the local level in Sierra Leone. This entailed returning Paramount Chiefs to their Chiefdoms.
<P>

<a name="20724w10.html_para0">A project was designed for this purpose and became known as the Chiefdom Governance Reform Programme. It had three components: the construction of a chiefdom house from where chiefdom business is conducted; the filling of chiefdom vacancies (there are presently more than 60 and the drafting of a code of conduct that would constitute a uniform set of regulations determining chiefdom administration and practices.

 Children live on the streets because of poverty in their communities.

Some of these will be street children. Support for children's rights to basic health care, education, nutrition, shelter, and protection from violence and abusive labour, along with work on sustainable livelihoods for their parents, is central to our effort towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

The proportion subject to physical checks is dependent on the product&#151;for example, at least 20 per cent. of beef, pork and lamb and at least 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1141W</I><P>
50 per cent. of consignments of poultry, game and honey are checked to ensure they comply with the appropriate rules. The cost of these checks are recovered from importers.
<P>

<a name="20724w11.html_para6">Checks on other consignments not declared as meat or animal products are targeted on a risk basis.
<P>

<a name="20724w11.html_para7">There are enforcement officers employed by local and port health authorities, HM Customs and Excise, Meat Hygiene Service and DEFRA who contribute directly or indirectly to policing laws on meat imports. Total numbers are not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="20724w11.html_para8">Targeted checks for illegal imports of meat and animal products are carried out at sea ports and air ports. We do not hold information centrally on the costs of these checks.
<P>

<a name="20724w11.html_para9">Through its action plan published in March, the Government are stepping up activities to improve the prevention and detection rates for illicit trade. Measures include improved co-ordination and co-operation with, and between, enforcement agencies. Certain measures in the action plan measures will have implications for future arrangements. For example the volume and type of checks made will be informed by the outcome of a disease risk assessment, and how checks are arranged, by the outcome of a Cabinet Office review of the current enforcement arrangements. Both reports are due this autumn.

<P>
<a name="20724w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The strategy to tackle illegal imports is to assess the disease risks linked to imports; identify the critical control points that need to be strengthened in order to reduce those risks, and to maximise opportunities for the prevention and detection of illicit trade. The strategy is underpinned by improved communication, including campaign to increase public awareness of our import rules and reasons for them.

<a name="20724w11.html_para10">The various measures we are taking are set out in the action plan published in March, and which have been endorsed by the Curry, Follett and Anderson reports. I refer the hon. Member to our progress report published on 8 July: a copy of which can be viewed on the illegal imports pages on the DEFRA website (www.defra.gov.uk/ animalh/illegali).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what criteria the Government have set for the removal of the 20 day standstill rule on livestock movement.  [72006]
<P>

<P>
<a name="20724w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is firm veterinary and scientific advice in support of the present 20 day standstill, as a means of helping protect against the rapid spread of any new incursion of disease. Such a standstill both improves the prospect of identifying disease on infected premises before animals move off and slows the rate of spread of any undetected disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what help she plans to give <i>(a)</i> rural farms to help with modulation and <i>(b)</i> environmental schemes (i) in national parks and (ii) elsewhere.  [71297]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Because of the requirement for match-funding, modulation means an increase in the national funds available to farmers. Depending upon their ability to deliver the objectives of agri-environment or other rural development schemes, farmers may have access to additional funding streams. In England, the Government plan to roll-out a new "broad and shallow", entry-level agri-environment scheme during 2005&#150;06, following a successful pilot. This scheme will be widely drawn so that most farmers will be eligible to enter.
<P>

<a name="20724w12.html_para1">The scheme will be introduced as an addition to the existing agri-environment schemes, Countryside Stewardship, Environmentally Sensitive Areas and the Organic Farming Scheme. Under the England Rural Development Programme the Government planned to spend a total of &#163;1 billion on these schemes in the period 2000&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="20724w12.html_para2">There are currently no plans to give English rural farms within national parks additional help with national modulation or environmental schemes over and above that which they receive at present or may be eligible to apply

 Regional Fisheries, Ecology and Recreation Advisory Committees were established under the Environment Act of 1995 to replace the previous Regional Fisheries Advisory Committees. Their principal remit is to deal with issues of relevance to fishing. Representation of fishing interests therefore form the majority of their members. There is no statutory requirement to have recreation and navigation interests represented on these committees but the Environment Agency with the approval of Ministers, has agreed that these interests should be represented. The committees comprise no more that 21 members and each has at least two members representing recreation interests.

<P>
<a name="20724w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Contaminated Land Supplementary Credit Approval (SCA) programme has provided support to English local authorities' capital works for 12 years. It assists local authorities to fulfil their responsibilities under the contaminated land regime which was introduced on 1 April 2000, under part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The regime makes local authorities 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1148W</I><P>
responsible for identifying contaminated land as defined in the Act, and they may also be responsible for its remediation in their capacity as regulators or in carrying some responsibility for the land's condition. The SCA programme assists local authorities to meet these obligations.
<P>

<a name="20724w13.html_para0">I have agreed the programme for new projects to start this year. The Department has already written to the successful authorities notifying them of the allocations which have been made for these new projects, and in respect of continuing commitments for projects approved in previous years.
<P>

<a name="20724w13.html_para1">Some bids are still being discussed with the authorities concerned, and there may be further allocations in respect of these and any further bids received later this year.

<a name="20724w13.html_para4">It is planned that the remaining parts of the Framework&#151;covering Waste, Energy, Procurement, Estates Management, Biodiversity, and Social Impacts&#151;will be rolled out over the coming year.
<P>

which were born before 1 August 1996 is less than 500, representing approximately three per cent. of the UK national flock. This is incorrect. The number of sheep still alive which were born before 1 August 1996 is 500,000, representing approximately three per cent. of the national flock of around 17 million breeding sheep.

 Over 7,000 communications were received following my statement to the House on 21 March. The majority were pro-hunting and came in response to a pro-hunt campaign. These have to be balanced against a smaller number of anti-hunting representation received immediately prior to the statement. We have also received many contributions providing evidence and referring to practical experience from a variety of viewpoints.

 In answer to the first part of the question the information is in the tables.

The second table shows Council regulations agreed in 2002 for which DEFRA took the lead. Regulations have a direct effect in the laws of member states and do not usually require Governments to take action to implement them. The table does not show Commission regulations.

 Producer interests wish to see a positive approach taken by local planning authorities when planning permission is needed for new or enlarged poultry units. Other interests are concerned about the environmental effects of some proposals. Government planning policies for local authorities make clear that an efficient and competitive agricultural industry is very important. In particular, local authorities are encouraged in general to support proposals relating to the requirements of new environmental, hygiene and welfare legislation.
<P>

<a name="20724w15.html_para2">DEFRA contributes to both national and regional planning and, through Government offices, provides technical advice to local authorities to help achieve sustainable development. This includes advice on giving farmers flexibility to adapt to changing animal welfare legislation and market conditions. In doing so, local authorities are enabled to take due account of these aspects as part of considering all economic, environmental and social issues when preparing their local development plans and assessing individual planning applications.

They concluded that on the basis of current knowledge the parts of ruminant hides used for the production of collagen do not present a risk with regard to TSEs, provided contamination with potentially infected material is avoided. It is a regulatory requirement that food and food products (including collagen) must not be derived from BSE cases or suspected cases, or from specified risk material.

<a name="20724w15.html_para9">Imports of poultry meat from third countries to other EU member states must enter the EU through designated BIP where they may be subject to checks for chloramphenicol and nitrofurans. Once a food product is in free circulation within the EU it is not subject to routine checks at points of entry to the UK under EU single market requirements.
<P>

<a name="20724w15.html_para10">In response to concerns that poultry meat from South East Asia may be contaminated by illegal residues of veterinary medicines, the Food Standards Agency initiated a retail survey. As a consequence of the publication of these results and others from the Netherlands, an EU Commission Decision has recently required sampling and testing of poultry meat coming from Thailand. This requirement to sample and test applies to all EU member states.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what mechanism there is to ensure Government Departments produce explanatory memoranda on proposed EU legislation in time for proper consideration by the European Scrutiny Committee.  [71654]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government is committed to the effective scrutiny by Parliament of proposed EU legislation and has given an undertaking that Ministers will not agree to proposals in the Council of Ministers until scrutiny by Parliament has been completed. This undertaking is the cornerstone of the scrutiny process and is embodied in a Resolution of the House of Commons dated 17 November 1998.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para0">The Government is committed to depositing proposals for primary EU legislation in Parliament within 48 hours of receipt by the Government, and to the provision of an Explanatory Memorandum (EM) within 10 working days of an EU document's deposit in Parliament, wherever practicable.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para1">The Cabinet Office is responsible centrally for the maintenance of scrutiny procedures, working closely with Departments and the staff of the European Scrutiny Committee. Where EMs cannot be submitted quickly, the Cabinet Office ensures that the lead Department provides the European Scrutiny Committee with an explanation for any delay together with an assessment of the impact on the opportunity for consideration by the Committee. The Cabinet Office also liaises with Departments to ensure Departments plan ahead effectively to avoid occasions

when late submission of an EM will cause difficulties for the proper consideration of issues by the European Scrutiny Committee.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what recent meetings he has had regarding young people's involvement in the political process; and what the outcomes of those meetings were.  [72386]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para2">I have held a number of meetings with young people, members of the UK Youth Parliament, hon. Members, and the media, relating to the re-engagement of young people in democracy and voting. Those discussions have supported the recommendations of the YVote?/YNot? project published on 3 July.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w18.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what <i>(a)</i> legislation is in place and <i>(b)</i> programmes are being funded that encourage young people's involvement in the political process.  [72387]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para3">The Government have taken several legislative steps in recent years to modernise and simplify electoral law and processes so that they are more relevant to modern lifestyles, including those lived by young people. These measures should make access to the process more flexible and make it easier both to register to vote and to cast a ballot. The Government, with the help of others such as the Electoral Commission, will continue to consider carefully any suggestions for changes that will lead to increased involvement of the young in the electoral process.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para4">The National Curriculum Order for Citizenship laid before Parliament on 23 June 2000 sets out the statutory requirements for citizenship education. The subject will be part of the national curriculum for secondary schools from this August. It will consist of three main strands: political literacy, social and moral responsibility and community involvement. These will help young people to develop the skills and confidence they need to engage in active citizenship and understand their role in the political process.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para5">The Children and Young People's Unit will continue to work with a range of organisations to support the action recommended in the YVote?/YNot? project. The independent Electoral Commission, with whom the Children and Young People's Unit has been working closely, has a statutory responsibility for raising public awareness of the electoral process and democratic systems, and has run focused advertising campaigns aimed at encouraging higher levels of voter participation within specific communities, including young people. The commission intends to continue to run bi-annual advertising campaigns, linked to key dates in the electoral calendar, including local and national elections and the annual registration canvass. The commission will also be launching later this year a 'New Initiatives Fund' which will provide grant funding to individuals and organisations outside government to test innovative ideas aimed at increasing participation in elections by young people and others.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires any public authority, including this House, to develop and implement a publication scheme setting out details of the classes of information which it publishes or intends to publish. I am pleased to announce that the House of Commons scheme has now been approved by the Information Commissioner and will be available on the parliamentary website at www.parliament.uk from Wednesday 24 July. Paper copies are available to hon. Members in the Library and to any member of the public on request from the House of Commons Information Office.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 At 30 June 2002, the House employed 1,373 full-time staff and 90 agency staff, out of a total work force of 1,740 individuals. Thus full-time staff represent 79 per cent. of the total, and agency staff represent 5.2 per cent.

<a name="20724w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para6">Hon. Members will wish to know that Mr. Speaker has amended the "10-year rule", governing the display of representations of politicians in the main building of the Palace. A portrait, bust or statue of a politician other than a Prime Minister may be displayed once 10 years have passed after their death. A portrait, bust or statue of a former Prime Minister may now be displayed either once five years have passed after their death, or when three Parliaments have elapsed after they have resigned the office of Prime Minister (provided they are no longer Members of the House and that a minimum of 12 years has elapsed), whichever of these events comes first. There remain no restrictions on the siting of representations of living politicians in the outbuildings of the Palace.
<P>

<a name="20724w18.html_para7">Accordingly the bust of Sir Edward Heath may now be displayed in the main building of the Palace. It is the intention that it should be sited in Members' Lobby from later this year.

Since then the National Statistician has issued a National Statistics Code of Practice for public consultation. This showed widespread support for the Code of Practice and its aim of promoting and demonstrating the independence and quality of National Statistics. The final version of the Code of Practice will be published shortly.

 The current definition of Research and Development (R&D) in the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry's guidelines is based on UK accounting principles&#151;in SSAP (Statement of Standard Accounting Practice) 13&#151;and on international standards established by the OECD. It was introduced in 2000 and underpins both the R&D tax credit for SMEs, also introduced in 2000, and the new R&D tax credit for large companies, in the current Finance Bill.

 The existing reduced rate applies to installations by contractors of certain energy-saving materials whose primary purpose is to save energy. European law does not permit a reduced rate for energy-efficient or energy-saving materials sold direct to the public, but the Government has pressed the European Commission to bring forward proposals to allow a reduced rate for energy-saving materials.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 2 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 120W, on PFI contracts, what estimate his Department has made of the payments under PFI contracts for each year from 2002&#150;03 to 2027&#150;28 for Government PFI deals which are expected to reach preferred bidder stage in the next three years.

 During the competitive process, before a preferred bidder is selected, it is not possible to determine with any degree of accuracy exactly what the long term payment obligations are likely to be for any project. However, once projects have reached preferred bidder status, Departmental estimates of the relevant future service payments are published twice a year.

 The Office for National Statistics publishes annual figures on inward investment into the United Kingdom in its Foreign Direct Investment Business Monitor (MA4). It also publishes quarterly estimates as part of the Balance of Payments First Release. Both of these can be found on the ONS website (statistics.gov.uk). The UK has continued to attract the largest share of inward investment in Europe and announcements made in this year's Budget will further serve to consolidate the UK's lead position.

 The amount allocated to the Department for Transport to spend on transport provision in England, and the national rail system, is given in the Spending Review 2002 White Paper, table 8.1. (An amended version of this table follows, which corrects a misprint. A corrigendum will be issued shortly.). The line in this table which gives an estimate of total UK transport spending does so on the basis of estimated spending by local authorities and devolved Administrations. It is of course a matter for devolved Administrations as to how they spend their allocated budgets.

The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question on the survival rate for throat cancer in the UK in the last 12 months. I am replying in his absence. (71097)
<BR>
Cancer of the larynx is commonly referred to as "throat cancer". Information on laryngeal cancer survival for the UK as a whole is not available. Survival rates for the constituent countries of the UK are not comparable.
<BR>
Cancers of the throat and related areas are formally classified to codes C13 and C14 (malignant neoplasm of hypopharynx, and malignant neoplasm of other and ill-defined sites in the lip, oral cavity and pharynx) according to the International Classification of Disease tenth revision (ICD10). There were 311 newly diagnosed cases of cancers in these locations in England in 1998, the most recent year for which information is available. No information on survival is available.

<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1179W</I><P>

<BR>
Information on survival from cancer of the larynx for patients diagnosed in England and Wales is summarised in chapter 21 of the book Cancer Survival Trends <sup>1</sup> . This publication present cancer survival trends in patients diagnosed between 1971 and 1990 and followed up for at least five years to the end of 1995.
<BR>
For men, the most recent information available relates to diagnosis in 1991&#150;93 and follow-up up to the end of 1998 (Health Statistics Quarterly 6 <sup>2</sup> ). The crude survival rate was 51% and relative survival 64%, based on 4,501 men diagnosed. Women are not included in the analysis, as they represent less than 20% of all the cases of cancer of the larynx.

The figures for patients diagnosed in 1986&#150;90 and followed up to the end of 1995, are given in the table below.

* Cancer of the larynx has been defined to the International Classification of Disease eight and ninth revision (ICD8 and ICD9) code 161 for the period 1975&#150;1994, and to the code C32 according to the International Classification of Disease tenth revision (ICD10) from 1995 onwards.  <P>

Crude survival is the proportion of a cohort of subjects alive at the end of a specified time interval since diagnosis (irrespective of the cause of death).

Of these, three were made from foreign vessels in Scottish waters. Two of the three seizures were made in 1998, one from a German and one from an Irish vessel. The third seizure was made in 2000, from a Maltese vessel. A total of 80 kilograms of amphetamine, 120 tonnes of cannabis, 14 and a half tonnes of cocaine, and 25 kilograms of heroin were seized as a result of these 58 cases. The three seizures in Scottish waters resulted in the recovery of 17 tonnes of cannabis.

 Donors will be encouraged to comply with the World Health Organisation's Guidelines for Drug Donations.

<a name="20724w24.html_para1">Where a company makes a gift from its trading stock it would normally be required to bring the market value of the gift into its tax computation in order to reflect the sales proceeds foregone. The relief in Clause 55 of the Finance Bill 2002 works by removing this charge, subject to certain conditions. If stock is unsaleable because it is time expired or nearly so, there would be little or no tax charge to add back&#151;therefore the tax relief would be of little or no value to the donor company.

 Customs officials are in the process of consulting with legal advisers on the implications of the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-62/00, Marks and Spencer plc v the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.
<P>

<a name="20724w25.html_para2">As the ECJ has endorsed the UK's three year time limit for repayments of overpaid VAT, Customs' view is that the judgment will only affect certain claims which were made, or could have been made, around the time when the cap was introduced in 1996.
<P>

<a name="20724w25.html_para3">Customs will be publishing guidance on the wider implications of the judgment for VAT registered businesses soon.
<P>

<a name="20724w25.html_para4">We are currently unable to provide an accurate estimate of the total revenue effect of this judgment, nor of its effect on claims relating to particular types of product. However, given the limited scope of this judgment, it is not expected to have a significant revenue effect.
<P>

<a name="20724w25.html_para5">This judgment is not thought to have implications for the current consultation document on 'VAT on Face Value Vouchers'.

 The percentage change in spending on salaries for the Treasury, including what is now the Office of Government Commerce, can be seen in the table. Data for years before 1996&#150;97 could only be collated at disproportionate expense. Growth rates may be affected by changes of functions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans there are to monitor annual progress against long term targets set out in public service agreements.  [71614]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> Progress against all targets in public service agreements (PSAs) is set out in departmental reports and autumn performance reports. The Government will provide regular web-based reports on all the new PSA targets from next year.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> Departments are accountable to the public and Parliament for their performance against their public service agreement targets (PSAs). Performance is also one of a number of factors taken into account during a spending review, where performance can indicate where resources can best be deployed and the need for action and reforms to ensure delivery.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer why there is no public service agreement target for Customs and Excise in respect of the illicit market share for oils in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement.  [71607]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w26.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> As explained in "Measuring Indirect Tax Fraud", published in November 2001, the non-UK duty paid share of the road fuel sector in Northern Ireland is more complex than in the rest of the UK. Because of the long land border with the Republic of Ireland, Customs are unable to distinguish clearly between legitimate cross-border shopping and fraud there in the same way they are able to on the UK mainland.
<P>

<a name="20724w26.html_para0">As a consequence, while the Government have judged it right to set a PSA target for reducing the size of the illicit market for England, Scotland and Wales, it is not yet possible to set a comparable target for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20724w26.html_para1">The Government are, however, determined to tackle road fuel fraud in Northern Ireland and Customs have, over the last two years, enhanced its enforcement activity by increasing the number of officers tackling oils fraud in Northern Ireland from 25 officers to over 160. This has resulted in the first increase in the volume of UK duty paid fuel delivered into Northern Ireland for over four years.
<P>

<a name="20724w26.html_para2">The Government still consider the level of fraud to be unacceptable and Customs is pursuing, with other agencies and in addition to steps taken on mainland oils fraud, ways in which the impact on oils fraud in Northern Ireland can be increased.

<P>
<a name="20724w26.html_wqn4"><B> Andrew Bennett: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many people have applied for conditional exemption from inheritance tax in the last 12 months; and how this tax relief is being amended to take into account the implementation of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 about access to the countryside.  [72185]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w26.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 In the last 12 months the Inland Revenue have received eight inheritance tax exemption claims involving land. Of these, only one covers land in England not associated with a building where access may in due course be available by virtue of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000; the remainder are outside the territorial scope of the Act, or relate to the land surrounding a historic building, or both. Given this limited overlap, and the other public benefits secured by inheritance tax exemption, we are not persuaded that early change to the inheritance tax rules is called for: but we will keep the matter under review.

4. A monetary value cannot be associated with demolitions.<P>

5. Sales under the Home Buy scheme are not reported on separately the RSR&#151;but it is likely that they have been included in the Shared Ownership total.<P>

<a name="20724w30.html_para0">The market values of sales are "estimated" rather than "actual" because not all sales are reported in CORE. Consequently the average value derived from CORE may not be the actual average value of the total sales as reported in the RSR.

 We intend to publish shortly a consultation document giving details of our proposals to reform fire safety legislation by means of a Regulatory Reform Order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The aim of the reform is to simplify, rationalise and consolidate fire safety law. It would provide for a risk-based approach to general fire safety allowing more efficient, effective enforcement by the fire service and other enforcing authorities. It would reduce the burden on business by removing the confusion caused by overlapping fire safety regimes. We hope to make the Order next year.

 As my right hon.

He said he would announce further details later in the year, in the light of discussion with key stakeholders.

<a name="20724w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 I am today announcing the conclusion of stage two of the Review of English Partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20724w30.html_para1">English Partnerships will be a key player in the delivery of my new "living communities" agenda. As I announced in my Statement to the House on 18 July, I am instructing English Partnerships to use its new role to search out and deliver even more land for housing and sustainable urban development. I also want English Partnerships to help in regenerating those places most badly affected by abandonment and decay.
<P>

<a name="20724w30.html_para2">Stage one of the Review confirmed English Partnerships as having an important role as an agency for best practice regeneration and development of brownfield land. I am keen that it develops that role, and in particular, I am asking the organisation to draw up plans to meet the following objectives:
<P>

<a name="20724w30.html_para3">

<BR>
To bring about speedy development of new schemes that can help meet the objectives set out in my policy statement of 18 July. In particular, I am determined to see a step change in both the quantity and the quality of new development in those areas that are facing acute demand pressures. I am therefore today announcing an initial list of their sites on which I wish EP to concentrate, as shown in the table, and we will be consulting on the way forward for those sites. A further list of sites will be announced in the autumn.
<BR>
2. To work closely with the Housing Corporation, and with other key agencies including the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), to ensure effective co-ordination in the delivery of plans for key worker and affordable housing within the wider context of "living communities".
<BR>
3. To advise on the efficient and effective development of surplus Government land and buildings that may help deliver new communities where most needed.
<BR>
4. To help with the assembly of sites for regeneration and sustainable development purposes.
<BR>
5. To produce and maintain a national brownfield strategy, to include best practice guidance in the assembly, remediation and development of land and buildings, to help drive forward the Urban Renaissance.
<BR>
6. To continue to operate its innovative programmes, including the Coalfields Programme, Millennium Communities, support for Urban Regeneration Companies (URCs), the English Cities Fund, the National Land Use Database (NLUD), Priority Sites Ltd, Land Stabilisation Programme, and Englishsites.com, and to develop new ideas for extending good practice.
<BR>
7. To operate a regime that enables developers to use approved 'gap' funding for the delivery of housing projects that would otherwise be commercially unviable.

 The allocation of the Land and Property (L&P) budget (from April 1999) between the RDAs and the LDA (from July 2000), took into account both their anticipated capital receipts arising from the L&P programme and the level of European funding they expected for L&P purposes. This was achieved by adding the total of all capital and European receipts to the grant in aid to create a 'gross' L&P budget that was then allocated to the RDAs and LDA.

 The Government have today published revised planning policy on open space, sport and recreation. Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 17 replaces PPG17 published in 1991. It contains a range of policies designed to protect and enhance open spaces and sports and recreational facilities.
<P>

<a name="20724w31.html_para8">PPG17 sets out how the Government expect local authorities to plan for the delivery of high quality open space, sport and recreational facilities in a sustainable manner. The policies it contains are crucial to our efforts to deliver an urban renaissance and rural renewal by ensuring that everyone has access to high quality and well maintained and managed open spaces, sports and recreational facilities. It will be a vital tool in delivering the Government's agenda for sport by providing an up-to-date strategic framework within which local authorities can plan effectively for new sports and recreational facilities. The policies in PPG17 will be supported by Good Practice Guidance on how to plan effectively for open space. This will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="20724w31.html_para9">The Government remain fully committed to the protection of playing fields. PPG17 sets strict criteria to limit the circumstances in which playing fields can be developed for non-sporting and recreational purposes. Additionally I intend to reduce the threshold for the size of playing field upon which Sport England must be consulted when a planning application for development is submitted from 0.4ha to 0.2ha. This will enable Sport England to be consulted on planning applications affecting these smaller playing fields, and help to protect these important facilities which are used by young people for the small sided games of football and rugby.

Friends, the Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor) are entitled to a severance payment equal to one quarter of their final ministerial salary on leaving office, provided that the individual has not attained the age of 65 or been appointed to another paid office within a period of three weeks. The salaries of Ministers who left the Government in June are already in the public domain.

 My office aims to be as helpful as possible in responding to hon. Members' questions. Where it is helpful to refer hon. Members to other documents as part of the substantive reply, this may be done by making hard copies of documents available in the Libraries of the House, or by reference to material available on the office's website.
<P>

<a name="20724w32.html_para3">Minimum requirements for the type of documents which should be published on Government websites are set out in guidance issued by the Office of the E-Envoy, 'Guidelines for Government Websites' (Illustrated Handbook for web management teams section 2.2 'What content should be on your website?' and section 2.3 'Cross-government requirements'). In addition to setting out guidelines on documents for inclusion, the guidance explicitly requires Departments to ensure that content of the site as a whole is up to date and current, and where it is necessary to update the content of individual documents, to show the latest date of amendment clearly on the document concerned. Section 1.2.7 deals with the issue of Record management and the Office of the e-Envoy currently has a consultation paper out on archiving websites. The purpose of this draft annexe to the Illustrated Handbook is to provide government website managers with a framework towards developing within their website management policy suitable procedures and systems to assist in the management, appraisal and preservation of electronic records.

 We estimate that approximately 1.3 million council homes (45 per cent.) did not have any double glazing in 2001. This estimate comes from 1996 English House Condition Survey, which showed that two million council homes did not have any double glazing (about 60 per cent. of all council homes), updated by data provided by local authorities on the works they carried out between 1996 and 2001. Final 2001 estimates will be available when the 2001 English Housing Condition Survey results are published later this year.

 One representation from the British Aggregates Association has been received since the levy came into effect on 1 April. The Aggregates Levy has been introduced to address the environmental impacts of the extraction and transportation of aggregates, including noise, dust, vibration, visual intrusion, loss of biodiversity and amenity. The levy will result in prices for primary aggregates which better reflect these environmental costs, and so encourage both the use of recycled aggregates as an alternative and more efficient use of aggregates.

This study is informing the evaluation of those options. It would not be appropriate to place the CAA study in the Library at this time, as to do so might undermine the UK's position if further bilateral aviation talks were to be held.

 A number of groups have made representations on Crossrail either to my Department, the Strategic Rail Authority, or Cross London Rail Links Ltd.&#151;particularly in response to the CLRL's Stakeholder Consultation document issued in May. The Royal Docks Crossrail Group is one. CLRL will give full consideration to all these representations in reaching a view on a preferred scheme, which will be reported to Ministers, the Mayor of London and the Strategic Rail Authority in October.

<P>
<a name="20724w38.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> The Strategic Rail Authority issued a consultation paper on fares on 19 July. The document sets out current policy and practice on fares regulation, and invites views. We will review our current policy on fares regulation in the light of responses to this consultation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made as to the changes in the level of unregulated rail fares in comparison to the RPI in each of the last three years; and if he will list those train operating companies that have increased unregulated fares above the RPI, in each of the last two years.  [71385]

<a name="20724w38.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> The level of unregulated fares is a matter for train operating companies. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has responsibility for monitoring fare levels and pricing policies. As part of its duties, the Authority has compiled a 'fares index', published in the June (2001&#150;02 quarter 4) edition of National Rail Trends, available in the House Library. This details the average increase in unregulated fares since January 1999 by class of operator. Information on company specific increases is commercially confidential and is not published by the SRA.

<a name="20724w38.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what value for preventing a fatality is used by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Highways Agency when assessing cost benefit ratios on (i) the roads and (ii) the railways; and how these are calculated.  [72943]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w38.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department and the Highways Agency use an appraisal figure of &#163;1.14 million (in 2000 prices) per fatality prevented when assessing the costs and benefits of road investments. The Department uses the same appraisal figure of &#163;1.14 million for valuing road and rail fatalities prevented through railway investments. The final decisions on all transport investments are not just based on cost benefit ratios, but a wide range of criteria, namely: environment, economy, safety, accessibility and integration.
<P>

<a name="20724w38.html_para1">The appraisal value was derived from research into individual's willingness to pay for reductions in highway risk. Full details of the road values used are published annually in Highway Agency's Economics Note No. 1, which is available in the Library of the House and on the Department's website. The value is updated annually for inflation and economic growth.

 Performance figures for each of the train operating companies are published by the Strategic Rail Authority in their quarterly publication, "National Rail Trends", and in more detail in their six-monthly publication, "On Track".

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w39.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our policies are aimed at encouraging the greater use of buses in all parts of the country. Implementation at local level is a matter for the local transport authority, in this case, Somerset county council, through its local transport plan. The Department is providing local authorities, including Somerset, with substantially increased capital funding and on-going increases in revenue funding to enable them to plan and implement a range of measures to improve bus services in their areas.
<P>

<a name="20724w39.html_para0">In addition, Somerset county council has been allocated &#163;1.49 million for the support of rural bus services in the current financial year. Since 1998, the council has also been successful with nine bids under the Department's Rural Bus Challenge scheme, including an award last year of &#163;100,000 towards a community transport service for the areas around Wiveliscombe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what value for preventing a fatality is used in assessments conducted <i>(a)</i> by and <i>(b)</i> for his Department from the fitting of (i) train protection and warning system, (ii) ERTMS level 1, (iii) ERTMS level 2 and (iv) ERTMS level 3.  [72944]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w39.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive tell me that in the regulatory impact assessment, which they conducted for the train protection and warning system, a figure of &#163;2.65 million (1997&#150;98 prices) was used for the prevention of fatalities in railway accidents. This is broadly equivalent to the figure of &#163;3.46 million (2002&#150;03 prices) currently used by Railway Safety for the prevention of multiple fatalities or where the risks are close to intolerable.
<P>

<a name="20724w39.html_para1">The report on ERTMS, published earlier this year by Railway Safety and the Strategic Rail Authority, did not use an explicit value for preventing a fatality.
<P>

<a name="20724w39.html_para2">Following research into the willingness of individuals to pay for reductions in risk and independent expert evidence given to the Ladbroke Grove public inquiry, the Health and Safety Executive no longer encourages the use of a higher figure than that used by the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency for appraising road risk. This is &#163;1.14 million at 2000 prices.

 The UK actively promotes the wider use of alternative fuels through the low rates of duty on liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, biodiesel and hydrogen road fuel; the lower rates of vehicle excise duty and company car tax on alternatively-fuelled vehicles; Enhanced Capital Allowances for investment in compressed natural gas and hydrogen fuel infrastructure; and the TransportAction programmes of grants for purchase of or conversion to alternatively-fuelled cars, buses and goods vehicles. There are also fuel duty exemptions under the Green Fuels Challenge, subject to European agreement, for three pilot projects relating to the capture and use of landfill bio-gas, hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and the use of methanol, with a further round of the Green Fuels Challenge currently in progress, offering support for the pilot testing of further promising alternative fuels.

 The pedestrian safety refuge and bollards at Little Beckford are part of a general scheme of traffic calming through the village to enable pedestrians to cross the A46 safely. A road safety audit carried out after installation has shown no major problems with the scheme design and the police have not identified any safety concerns as a result of their accident investigations. To remove any of the refuges would reduce the effectiveness of the traffic calming and thus increase the risks to road safety. The Highways Agency will, however, continue to monitor the performance of these measures to ensure that they remain effective.

<a name="20724w40.html_para3">However, my Department is preparing guidance in the form of a traffic advisory leaflet on the use of vehicle activated signs. This new guidance will reflect the results and conclusions of these earlier trials. We expect to publish by the end of the year, and at that time, a copy will be placed in the Library.

<a name="20724w41.html_para0">The British Grand Prix is an important global showcase for the UK motorsport industry, which is estimated to contribute approximately &#163;5 billion annually to the national economy. In addition it brings about &#163;30 million to the local economy over the Grand Prix weekend. In the light of doubts expressed by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) about retaining the British Grand Prix at Silverstone because of access problems in previous years, Ministers felt that the wider national interest would be best served by speeding up the Silverstone project and thereby providing the best available road access for this year's event.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="20724w41.html_para4"><i>Letter from Tim Matthews to Mrs. Theresa May dated 24 July 2002:</i>
<P>

<a name="20724w41.html_para5">

<BR>
I have been asked by the Transport Minister to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the estimated number of people living within 600m of a trunk road; the length of trunk road that has been given lower-noise surfaces; the average noise level at 100m, 300m and 600m away from a trunk road; and the length of strategic road network widened in each of the last three years.
<BR>
The Highways Agency estimates that there are over 2.1 million households located within 600m of the trunk road network. In the National Office of Statistics 'Living In Britain' publication (published 2000) the average number of people per household was 2.3. it is therefore estimated that approximately 4.83 million people live within 600 metres of the trunk road network.
<BR>
Since July 2000, 3,257 of the 34,000 trunk road lane kilometres have been laid with lower noise surfacing. Between April 2001 and March 2002 lower noise surfacing was laid on 1,611 lane kilometres and between April 2000 and March 2001 this figure was 1431 lane kilometres. Prior to April 2000 this information was not collated by the Agency.
<BR>
It is not possible to provide average noise levels at given distances from a trunk road because the noise level arising from any major road is determined by the characteristics of the traffic it carries, principally the amount of traffic and the percentage of heavy goods vehicles. The type of road surface and other noise mitigation measures will also affect the noise level. Provided that other factors remain the same, the effect of traffic growth year on year is minimal.
<BR>
A number of important widening schemes are currently under construction, but none have been completed in the last three years. The M1 to A1 Lofthouse&#151;Bramham Link Road DBFO was completed in May 1999 and this contained within it some stretches 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1255W</I><P>
of widening of the A1, the M1 and the M62 totalling 9.9km. These stretches were completed by February 1999, just prior to the three-year period in question.

<a name="20724w42.html_para6">In 1998&#150;99 we introduced new funding to improve accessibility to bus services in all rural areas. Since that year, Rural Bus Subsidy Grant has supported 1,800 new or improved bus services in rural England. The grant was extended in 2001&#150;02 to cover all areas outside towns with a population of 25,000 or more and has now been increased to &#163;47.5 million this financial year. In addition, we are now supporting over 200 rural transport projects under the Rural Bus Challenge scheme, which was also first introduced in 1998&#150;99.The source is the National Travel Survey and normally three years of data are aggregated. However, the sample numbers for rural areas were exceptionally low for 2000, casting doubts on the validity of using the data for that year within the indicator. To provide consistency across areas, the average for 1998 and 1999 has been used instead of the average for the three years 1998&#150;2000, as previously published. Figures for the average of 1999 and 2001 will be published when the results for 2001 are released on 25 July.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> Bus services in London are the responsibility of the Mayor and Transport "for" London (TfL), and my Department does not routinely collect this information. However, I understand from TfL that there are currently 322 high frequency routes (every 12 minutes or better) and 185 low frequency routes. These exclude school routes, mobility services and night services. Figures for previous years are not available.
<P>

<a name="20724w42.html_para8">Bus service frequencies are planned by TfL to allow the majority of passengers to use the network on a "turn-up-and-go" basis, with as many routes as possible running every 12 minutes or better. In general, service frequencies will not fall below hourly, including night services where applicable.

 The Government have introduced a range of fiscal incentives to encourage the wider availability and use of cleaner fuels such as ultra-low sulphur petrol and diesel and road fuel gases such as LPG and natural gas. These incentives are relevant to all road vehicle sectors including buses and taxis.

<a name="20724w43.html_para1">In addition, my Department has set up the New Vehicle Technology Fund to support the demonstration of innovative clean, fuel-efficient technologies such as fuel cells and hybrid vehicles.

<a name="20724w43.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 While we are responsible for the legislative framework for taxis throughout England and Wales, taxi licensing rests with local authorities; it is up to them to use their licensing powers to ensure that their local taxi system is of a satisfactory standard.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w43.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Under the legislation governing taxi licensing in England and Wales, a taxi must be a vehicle with fewer than nine passenger seats. Within this broad provision, it is up to local licensing authorities to determine which vehicles they consider suitable for licensing as taxis, bearing in mind that taxis are licensed for the purpose of enabling both individuals and small groups to hire them at a rank or hail them in the street.

<a name="20724w43.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has made no specific assessment of the Smart car or any similar vehicle for use as taxis in city areas. Decisions about which vehicles to license as taxis are made by local licensing authorities based on their assessment of local conditions and circumstances. They would, of course, want to bear in mind the needs of people who wish to travel in small groups as well as those of disabled people, some of whom may need to travel in a wheelchair.

 Fresh guidance on the range of flexible public transport services, which can currently be undertaken, will be published later this week. It is aimed at bus, taxi and private hire vehicle operators, local authorities, transport partnerships and voluntary groups because many may not be aware of the opportunities available. We want to encourage greater use of these services because they can bring more benefits both to passengers and providers and help improve public transport provision. We are distributing the document, which is a free publication, widely as well as publishing it on our website. Although this guidance has been produced as a follow up to the rural White Paper and gives examples of schemes being undertaken in rural areas, I would stress that the services apply equally for urban areas.

 Precise information on the number of transport schemes in rural areas is not available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, funding for transport schemes in rural areas is available through the Government's targeted programme for improvements (TPI) to the trunk road network, the local transport plan (LTP) system and the rural bus challenge.
<P>

<a name="20724w44.html_para1">Of the schemes in the TPI, one rural bypass has been completed and a further 15 rural bypasses and road improvements are under construction. Under the LTP system, local authorities have been allocated ring-fenced capital funds for major schemes costing over &#163;5 million, some of which will benefit rural areas, and block allocations for smaller scale schemes. Authorities have reported in their LTP annual progress reports that capital allocations for local transport are expected to deliver 31 schemes in rural areas in 2000&#150;01 and 55 schemes in 2001&#150;02. This covers rural bypasses on local roads, quiet lane schemes and rural 20-mph zones. The rural bus challenge supported 77 innovative public transport projects in 2000&#150;01 and 85 such projects in 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w45.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. Satellite-based positioning systems do not of themselves permit the movement of vehicles to be monitored. However, many commercial "intelligent transport systems" such as those used for fleet management purposes by operators of commercial vehicles, do make use of satellite-based navigation technology, in conjunction with communication systems. Galileo could improve the performance of such intelligent transport systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimates have been made by his Department of the extent to which the proposed Galileo satellite navigation system will duplicate services available under the Global Positioning System.  [70708]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w45.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 At present the civil community makes use of an open access signal provided by the US Global Positioning System (GPS) but this is subject to US national security interests, is not guaranteed and is not adequate for some safety critical uses such as in air traffic management. GPS is managed and operated by the US Government and funded by the US Department of Defense (DOD). It was developed primarily as a military system with the main purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of US military forces. Through co-operation agreements, the US has made available the GPS military signals to NATO and individual States such as the UK. GPS will continue to be used by NATO and the UK for military applications.
<P>

<a name="20724w45.html_para2">Galileo has the potential to provide Europe with its own purpose built civil navigation and positioning system which could generate strategic and economic benefits to the UK, Europe and globally. For example, in transport it could help in the development of traffic management and intelligent transport systems across all modes of transport to help control congestion, reduce pollution and contribute to improved safety. Additionally, as it is intended that it should complement and be interoperable with the civil signal (and future planned signals) provided by GPS, users should obtain improved availability and reliability particularly in urban areas. The two systems could provide the integrity of service required for greater use of the technology in safety critical applications such as air traffic management.
<P>

<a name="20724w45.html_para3">The Government intends to work to ensure that there is co-operation with the US, so that Galileo is interoperable with GPS civil signals and is developed in such a way as to give value for money to UK and European taxpayers and users.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w45.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A study carried out last year by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) on behalf of the Commission has put the capital cost of Galileo at euro 3.4 billion, with annual operating costs of euro 224 million over a 20-year concession period. PWC considered that the programme would require some continued public funding for deployment of the system and payments during operation. Total public sector funding was estimated at some euro 3.8 billion, depending on the private sector assessment of revenues and risks, and subject to the outcome of a competitive tendering process for a public-private partnership (PPP) for the deployment and operational phases.
<P>

<a name="20724w45.html_para4">The UK is helping to fund Galileo through contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA), which is jointly funding and carrying out the programme with the European Union. For the definition phase (1999&#150;2000) and some early development work (2001) the Government contributed about &#163;10.4 million. For the development and validation phase (2002&#150;05) which was approved in March by the EU Transport Council, negotiations within ESA over member states' contributions are still progressing. Funds for the development and validation phase are also being provided from the budget of the European Communities to which the UK contributes.
<P>

<a name="20724w45.html_para5">Galileo has been discussed at a number of European Councils including the Laeken Council in December last year, which reaffirmed the strategic importance of the project to Europe. The UK has always supported the Council's conclusions on Galileo as it recognises

<a name="20724w46.html_para14">The Commission has not yet brought forward its proposals. And, at this stage, it is unclear what it wants to achieve by proposing a common methodology across all modes. Clearly, it would need to be demonstrated that these measures are necessary at a Community level and respect the principles of subsidiarity. It would also be essential that any proposals are based on the appropriate Treaty provisions.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, when the EU Committee on the service in the member state of judicial and extrajudicial documents and on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters is next due to meet; whether representatives of the Scottish Executive <i>(a)</i> have been and <i>(b)</i> are members of it; and if she will make a statement.  [70926]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w48.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 There are two separate committees, one relating to the regulation on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents and the other relating to the regulation on co-operation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters. No meetings are scheduled for the former. The latter will not meet until after the regulation applies from 1 January 2004. It will meet only when it is necessary to review the standard forms in the annexe to the regulation. The Scottish Executive is regularly consulted on, and is fully involved in, discussions at official and Ministerial level, with the Lord Chancellor's Department on the formulation of EU policy which touches on matters which fall within the responsibilities of the Scottish Executive. A representative of the Scottish Executive attended the one previous meeting of the former committee and a representative is likely to attend further meetings as well as any meetings of the latter committee.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when the EU Committee on the jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses and on the jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I and II) is next due to meet; whether representatives of the Scottish Executive <i>(a)</i> have been and <i>(b)</i> are members of it; and if she will make a statement.

 Consideration of the draft 'Brussels I' and 'Brussels II' Regulations was concluded by the end of 2000 and both Regulations are now in force. The Scottish Executive was fully represented throughout. The Scottish Executive is regularly consulted on, and is fully involved with discussions on the formulation of EU policy by the Lord Chancellor's Department which touch on matters which fall within the responsibilities of the Scottish Executive.

<P>
<a name="20724w48.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 My Department aims to be as helpful as possible in responding to hon. Members' questions. Where it is helpful to refer hon. Members to other documents as part of the substantive reply this may be done by making hard copies of documents available in the Libraries of the House, or by reference to material available on our Departmental website.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para2">My Department aims to ensure that it follows guidance issued by the Office of the e-Envoy "Guidelines for UK Government Websites" and that records are kept for a period appropriate to their use.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para3">The website does not have any local policies which go beyond the requirement set out in the e-Envoy's guidelines but aims to follow Departmental policy on record management, namely that policy documents are subject to first review after five years after the last-dated correspondence, and second review 25 years after first-dated correspondence.

<P>
<a name="20724w48.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Watts: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, what plans she has to regulate and control solicitors and companies who provide bonded legal assistance; and what plans she has to review her policy on protection for parties to civil actions by bonds.  [73360]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w48.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Solicitors and companies providing legal assistance are regulated by a range of bodies, including the Law Society, the Financial Services Authority and the General Insurance Standards Council. The possibility of further regulation is kept under review.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para4">Parties to civil actions have a range of methods by which they may fund their litigation. These include public funding, conditional fee agreements, trade union support or the purchase of insurance against the risk of losing and paying costs. Bonds are not one of these methods, as far as the Government are aware.

<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para5">Insurance cover is available to protect against the risk of losing and paying costs. The cost of the premium is dependent on the extent of cover, the complexity and type of case and any inherent risk. With effect from 1 April 2000 it has been possible to recover the premium from the losing party as an item of costs, subject to the normal rules of court. Where the court is called on to assess those costs the court will allow only such costs as are reasonable and proportionate.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will set up a Thematic inquiry into the way rape trials are dealt with by the judiciary; and if she will make a statement.  [65209]

<P>
<a name="20724w48.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has no proposal to set up a Thematic inquiry into the way rape trials are dealt with by the judiciary. The conduct of a rape trial is a matter for the judge in the exercise of his or her judicial discretion.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para6">To assist those who have to give evidence the Government will be introducing special measures for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in the Crown court from today. These will be subject to judicial discretion but they will, for example, allow witnesses to give evidence over a live television link from outside the courtroom.

 My noble and learned Friend, the Lord Chancellor, is concerned that only those Judges with the appropriate experience and sensitivity hear rape cases.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para7">Section 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 states that the Lord Chief Justice, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, can, by means of a practice direction, determine the cases or classes of cases suitable for allocation to High Court Judges, Circuit Judges and Recorders. From time to time successive Lord Chief Justices have issued such practice directions. In October 2001 the current Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, issued a practice direction which, again, determined that all High Court Judges and those Circuit Judges and Recorders, approved for that purpose by the Senior Presiding Judge, with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice can hear rape cases.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para8">In practice, primarily those High Court Judges assigned to the Queen's Bench Division hear rape cases. Authorisations of Circuit Judges and Recorders are sought by the Presiding Judge of each Circuit in consultation with the Resident Judge of the relevant Crown court. The Senior Presiding Judge then makes the decision on the basis that the Judge is suitable to try sensitive cases.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para9">Those Judges selected for authorisation have to attend a Judicial Studies Board seminar on serious sexual offences before they are formally authorised. They also have to attend further seminars from time-to-time. The names of Circuit Judges currently authorised to hear rape cases are listed.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para10">There is no "outside inspection" of a Judges' conduct prior to authorisation. If he thinks it appropriate, the Lord Chief Justice can remove an authorisation.
<P>

<a name="20724w48.html_para11">All 35 Judges of the Court of Appeal were formerly Justices of the High Court and could hear rape cases when they held that office. All Judges of the Court of Appeal can hear rape appeals without any further authorisation.

<a name="20724w49.html_wqn1"><B> Jim Knight: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on the progress of discussions between the Lord Chancellor's Department and Fujitsu Services on the Libra project to provide IT services for the magistrates courts in England and Wales.  [73445]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w49.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 There are two parts to the Libra project: the provision of a modern IT infrastructure and network to link the magistrates courts with other parts of the criminal justice system and the special software for case management, accounting and other administration within the courts. Installation of the infrastructure and network is 75 per cent. complete and will be completed during the first half of 2003. The specialised software has been delayed.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para0">The Department has now signed a variation to the contract with Fujitsu Services (formerly known as ICL) in respect of the Libra project.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para1">Under these new arrangements, Fujitsu Services will continue to deliver the IT infrastructure and network and provide support until March 2007.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para2">However, the Department has decided that Fujitsu Services will not be required to continue with the development of the specialised software for case management, accounting and other administration. Serious concerns arose last year when delays in delivery of the software and increases in their costs led Fujitsu Services to seek to renegotiate the contract. As many courts and offices had already been equipped with the IT infrastructure, a basis for renegotiation was agreed. 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1289W</I><P>
Despite intensive negotiation however, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the specialised software at an acceptable price, which will deliver value for money for the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para3">Instead, the Department will procure application services separately. Assessments show that robust, tried and tested software, is now available in the marketplace, which could meet requirements at a lower cost than that on offer from Fujitsu Services.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para4">The original 1998 contract was valued at &#163;183 million to run until July 2009. A variation to this was signed with Fujitsu/ICL in 2000, which was valued at &#163;319 million and was to run until 2013. This was not a real price increase as the extra cost was for the extra years and other benefits. In each case the contract with Fujitsu Services was for the delivery of both the infrastructure and the specialised software.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para5">The estimated value of the revised contract with Fujitsu Services is &#163;232 million which includes some &#163;31 million paid under the existing contract from 2000 to the end of June 2002 for the delivery and operation of the infrastructure services received by the magistrates courts. In addition, the Government have paid Fujitsu Services &#163;6.8 million for design products produced as part of the software application development that can be reused. Apart from this amount, the financial and management risks of developing the software have been borne by the supplier.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para6">A number of studies have been carried out by external organisations to provide assurances on the way forward, including a benchmark exercise on the infrastructure costs and an assessment of the costs, timescales and market capacity to deliver the software application services.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para7">The benchmarking exercise shows that the cost of the provision of the infrastructure service in the revised contract is in line with the cost of similar services provided to organisations of similar size, structure and complexity in the private and public sectors. It is possible, but by no means certain, that a new competitive procurement could deliver the services for less cost, but the Department's assessment of the costs of delays and procurement and completing the implementation of the service to all courts shows that the revised contract provides best value for money to the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para8">The studies on the software application services indicate that the services can be delivered by the end of 2004&#151;a delay of nine months on the original 1998 contract&#151;and at a price that will be affordable and provide value for money. The Department is planning on this basis. However, these services will be subject to new procurements and the House will be informed of the outcome when the procurements have been completed.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para9">There are lessons to be learned for all parties from the project. Since the original award of contract a range of Government guidelines on managing IT contracts and on PFI/PPP contracts has been issued. These have been fully utilised in the recent negotiation. Improvements introduced on Libra in the last 12 months include strengthening of the governance arrangements, better risk management, the use of external benchmarking and an

<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1290W</I><P>
external review under the gateway process. This has provided more effective controls for the negotiations and future plans. The new arrangement separates the delivery of the infrastructure from the application which is designed to better ensure the success of the overall programme and at the same time place appropriate risk with the respective providers and the Department.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the personal delivery of some appeal determinations to asylum seekers.  [73102]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w49.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Under the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 2001, the Home Secretary has been responsible since 7 January 2002 for the delivery of asylum appeal determinations to appellants who have no further rights of appeal within the Immigration Appellate Authorities (IAA). While the majority of these determinations have been served by post, some determinations have been deemed suitable for delivery in person either by a home visit or at a reporting centre.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para10">A pilot scheme to test the effectiveness of personal delivery procedures commenced on 7 January in the areas covered by Croydon, East Midlands and Leeds Local Enforcement Units and more recently Eaton House (Heathrow). The primary focus of the pilot scheme has been to establish that the correct procedures are in place to ensure that determinations are delivered promptly and that asylum seekers have access to their legal representatives and to the courts.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para11">The Home Office has set targets of 48 hours for posting determinations and six weeks for those being served personally. This allows the Home Office, where appropriate, to serve the determination at a time when the appellant attends a reporting centre, in line with any reporting conditions, or by home visit. Where the Home Office is unable to deliver the determination in person within six weeks, it is posted to the appellant.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para12">The first evaluation of this pilot has now been completed and the results are as follows. Between 7 January and 31 May 2002 the average time taken to deliver a determination in person (including those delivered at reporting centres when a person attends for their regular appointment) has been 19 days. A copy of the determination has been forwarded to the appellant's representative within a maximum of two and a half hours of personal delivery. For those appellants who were removed by 31 May, the average time between delivery of the determination and removal has been 13 days and the minimum time was one day.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para13">Failed asylum seekers who have been taken into detention or removed have been informed of their right to contact a legal representative and given reasonable opportunity to do so. Those wishing to apply for judicial review have had three working days in which to submit an application and a day in which to obtain the High Court reference number. During this time removal directions have been suspended.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1291W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para14">Two such applications for judicial review were made between 7 January and 31 May. There have been no applications for a review (under rule 16 or 19 of the Immigration and Asylum (Procedure) Rules) by the Chief Adjudicator or President of the Tribunal respectively.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para15">As of 31 May 2002, of the 76 determinations deemed suitable for personal delivery, 34 were successfully delivered in person and 24 people have been removed from the country.
<P>

<a name="20724w49.html_para16">The Home Office is now considering expanding the scheme in the light of the evaluation results.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department on what grounds a freedom of information request can be denied by the Government; and how many of these requests have been denied in the last five years, broken down by reason for denial.  [70886]

<a name="20724w50.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The right of access to information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will come into force on 1 January 2005. Until that date, requests for Government information will be dealt with in accordance with the non-statutory Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Under the code, the approach to release of information should in all cases be based on the assumption that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest, as specified in Part II of the code. Part II of the code sets out categories of information that are exempt from the commitments to provide information under the code. These exemptions are listed in table 2.
<P>

<a name="20724w50.html_para1">Table 1 gives details of the numbers of requests under the code that were received and the number of code requests refused in the last five years for all of the bodies covered by the code. We do not have records of the reason for denial for each of the requests refused. However, if an applicant is dissatisfied with the response to their request they can ask the Department to review that decision internally. Table 2 sets out the number of times each exemption has been cited at this stage in the review process for the last five years. Monitoring reports on the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information are published annually and copies are available in the House Library.

The Commission's second corporate plan, for the period 2002&#150;03 to 2003&#150;04, sets out its 54 performance targets. These are broken down into 24 Community Legal Service targets, 13 Criminal Defence Service targets and 17 targets on the work of the Commission. These are set out in the following list.

<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Commission's project to produce accurate statutory charge statements has depended upon its Land Charges Department carrying out a number of data cleansing exercises. Those exercises, and the first stage of the project, are expected to be completed by the end of August 2002. The Commission will then carry out checks to ensure that no further data cleanse is required.

<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Steps have been taken to improve the knowledge and understanding of all staff within the Commission who deal with the statutory charge. A programme of two days' training for 160 staff including those within the land charge department has taken place. The training covered the nature of the charge; the circumstances in which it arises; how its value is determined; the conditions on which the Commission can postpone its enforcement; the technicalities of how the charge is secured by registration on land; and the rules on payment of interest where enforcement is postponed by registration on the client's home.

 The Legal Services Commission is in the final stages of testing the system for the production of statutory charge statements.

 The Legal Services Commission intends that all clients will receive a statutory charge statement by the end of August 2003.

<a name="20724w51.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on the draft guidance to doctors "Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good Practice in Decision Making", in particular the recommendation that a junior doctor be removed from the care of a patient should they have a conscientious objection to ending a patient's life by withholding fluids.  [67211]

<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 It is not appropriate for me to make a statement on the draft guidance "Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good Practice in Decision-Making" which has been recently issued by the General Medical Council. My officials are currently considering this guidance and in the meantime, I would welcome the comments of the General Medical Council on the Government's current consultation paper "Making Decisions: Helping People who have Difficulty in Deciding for Themselves".

<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department with reference to consultation on "Making decisions: helping people who have difficulty in deciding for themselves", what legal advice is available to patients faced by a doctor's decision to withhold food or fluid.  [70171]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The current legal position, and the advice available, is set out in the consultation paper referred to by my hon. Friend. Usually agreement can be reached between health care professionals, the patient and people close to the patient about the best treatment and whether treatment should be continued. Artificial hydration and nutrition can only be withdrawn if that is clearly in the patient's wishes or, in circumstances where the patient is unable to give consent, if receiving it is no longer in his or her best interests. Where the patient is in a persistent vegetative state, authorisation must also be sought from the court. If there is doubt in a particular case, the court may be asked to decide what is in the patient's best interests. In such cases, where the patient lacks capacity to be able to instruct his or her own solicitors, the Official Solicitor will be appointed to act on the patient's behalf.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department whether it has been assumed that ending the life of a patient on grounds of poor quality is standard practice in her consultation on "Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good

<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w51.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 "Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good Practice in Decision Making" has recently been produced by the General Medical Council, not by my Department. My Department is however consulting on guidance explaining mental incapacity issues in "Making Decisions: Helping People who have Difficulty Deciding for Themselves". This consultation paper reflects our view that decision-making relating to withdrawal of medical treatment which may lead to the death of a patient is a most sensitive area of medical practice and must be carried out according to strict guidelines and procedures. The draft guidance contained in my Department's consultation paper refers readers to guidance produced by the British Medical Association and by the General Medical Council which assist in promoting high-quality decision-making in this difficult area. The Government welcome responses on all issues addressed in the consultation paper and these will be thoroughly considered and will inform the guidance leaflets when they are published later this year.

 A criminal trial is deemed as being ineffective when, for some reason, it cannot proceed on the day it has been listed for hearing and has to be re-listed at a later date. Figures relating to the proportion of ineffective criminal trials in the Crown court are set out in the table. This information is not available for the magistrates courts. Data on ineffective cases in the magistrates courts did not start to be collected on a national basis (England and Wales) until April of this year. The first quarterly figures should be available in September 2002.

 The overall value for money and cost effectiveness of the Lodgings network is under continual review and has been so since the publication of Lord Justice Auld's report.
<P>

<a name="20724w52.html_para0">In terms of the general administrative efficiencies, of which the hon. Member is already aware, a general cost reduction of approximately &#163;300k p.a. across the network had been expected. The estimate is now that this will rise as far as &#163;400k p.a. These efficiencies include discontinuing the use of the Lodgings at Mold.

 The first round of parliamentary elections in Mali was on 14 July. The second is due on 28 July. Turnout for the first round was low, at under 20 per cent. However the Malian Government has worked hard to overcome some of the problems experienced in the presidential elections earlier this year. The elections are being observed by a number of Malian NGOs, who will not release their assessments of the elections until after the second round. Our Embassy in Bamako is also monitoring the elections closely.

<P>
<a name="20724w52.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We are concerned about the fighting in Liberia. Our Embassy in Abidjan regularly presses the Government of Liberia to end the fighting. In meetings of Security Council members we have urged all parties to the conflict to begin ceasefire negotiations. We have called on all states to stop supporting armed groups in Liberia. We believe that providing military assistance to any armed group in Liberia would be a breach of Un sanctions against Liberia (as renewed by UN Security Council Resolution 1408 on 6 May 2002). We support the efforts of the various regional and local initiatives under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African States, King Mohammed of Morocco, the Liberian Leadership Forum and the Inter-Religious Council of Liberia, to find a solution to the conflict in Liberia. A Security Council Workshop on the Mano River Union (Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea), which was held on our initiative and chaired by my noble Friend Baroness Amos on 18 July, identified the need for greater co-ordination between these initiatives. We also provide political and diplomatic support to the EU presidency representative to the Mano River Union.

 The relationship between the Central African Republic (CAR) and its neighbours is linked to political and social tensions within the country. There was an attempted coup in May 2001 and fighting in November, and serious economic difficulties continue.
<P>

<a name="20724w53.html_para0">Relations with Chad deteriorated late last year when President Deby granted political asylum to General Bozize, former Chief of Staff of the CAR armed forces, allegedly implicated in the May 2001 coup attempt. There was fighting in the border area, but the two governments are now working to reduce tension.
<P>

<a name="20724w53.html_para1">Relations with the Government of DRC are minimal, but the border area is under the control of DRC rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba. CAR's relations with Bemba were reportedly strained because the CAR Government believed that he had supported the May 2001 coup attempt; and exacerbated when 23,000 civilians and 1,250 soldiers fled to DRC. Most refugees have now returned with the opening of dialogue between the Government of CAR and their political opposition.
<P>

<a name="20724w53.html_para2">Sudan and CAR currently enjoy good relations. The Sudanese were the first to respond to President Patasse's request for a peacekeeping force following the coup attempt in May 2001.

 With the assistance of the United Nations, regional countries and the UK, Sierre Leone is emerging from over a decade of civil war and destruction. President Kabbah has appointed a new government following peaceful elections in May. The focus is now moving from conflict resolution to development. The challenges facing the new government have been identified by the UN to include security, reintegration, governance/corruption, poverty reduction and human right/reconciliation. The UK remains strongly committed to helping rebuild Sierra Leone. My noble Friend the Baroness Amos chaired a meeting of the Security Council on 18 July, which considered how best the international community could continue to engage in Sierra Leone and reduce conflict in the Mano River Union.

<P>
<a name="20724w53.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Ending the conflict in Sierra Leone after more than a decade of brutal civil war and destruction is a remarkable achievement. It comes as a result of the sustained engagement and commitment of the international community, particularly the United Nations, the UK and regional leaders. But the peace will remain fragile as long as many of the root causes of the war are not resolved. This is why it is so important for the international community to continue to support the efforts of the new Government of Sierra Leone, formed by President Kabbah after his re-election in May.
<P>

<a name="20724w53.html_para5">We expect to spend some &#163;100 million in Sierra Leone related activities in 2002&#150;03, including &#163;36 million in assessed contributions to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).

stability in Sierra Leone by <i>(a)</i> President Charles Taylor of Liberia and <i>(b)</i> Revolutionary United Front insurgents and Kamajor militia inside Liberia.  [72174]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w53.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The role of President Taylor in destabilising Sierra Leone and prolonging the war there through his support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels has been well documented in the reports of the UN Expert Panel on Liberia. Although the conflict in Sierra Leone has now ended and UN sanctions against Liberia have disrupted President Taylor's links with the RUF rebels, we believe that Taylor still has links with the RUF and harbours intentions to cause renewed instability in Sierra Leone.
<P>

<a name="20724w53.html_para6">One of the risks to stability in Sierra Leone is that the fighting in Liberia could spill into Sierra Leone. There are reports of RUF fighters fighting on President Taylor's behalf in Liberia, and of Kamajor (or Civil Defence Force) fighters from Sierra Leone fighting for the Liberian dissident group, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). To ensure that our large commitment to restoring peace to Sierra Leone is not wasted, we will monitor closely the threats posed by President Taylor, RUF fighters in Liberia, incursions by armed groups from Liberia and flows of deserters and refugees.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w53.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The legislative and presidential elections held simultaneously in May 2002 were free from violence and generally credible. Eminent international observers representing the EU, the Commonwealth, the OAU and ECOWAS, and the Carter Foundation noted that, while the elections were not flawless, the overall results reflected the will of the overwhelming majority of ordinary Sierra Leoneans.
<P>

<a name="20724w53.html_para7">The success of the elections was a remarkable achievement for a country just emerging from over a decade of war and destruction, and is further evidence of the international community's commitment to resolving conflict and bringing peace to Sierra Leone. Despite Opposition concerns over the conduct of the elections, they have decided to accept the results in the interests of moving the country forward. We have reiterated to President Kabbah our continued support to his efforts to consolidate the peace, improve governance and bring prosperity to Sierra Leone for the benefit of all Sierra Leoneans.

 The end of the conflict in Sierra Leone does not mean that sustainable peace has been achieved. Consolidating the peace will require the continued engagement of the international community for the foreseeable future.

A police project was designed for implementation over a period of three to five years, commencing December 2000.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w53.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We take very seriously the threat posed by Liberia to peace in Sierra Leone. We have worked with the Government of Sierra Leone to ensure that the new Republic of Sierra Leone armed forces (largely trained by the UK) are deployed in strength on the Liberian border and regularly patrol the border. Some UK military advisers are deployed alongside these Sierra Leonean units. We have also encouraged the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL, to maintain regular patrolling of the border areas. Sierra Leonean armed forces and UNAMSIL have successfully intercepted armed groups crossing from Liberia into Sierra Leone. We played a leading role in securing the renewal of UN sanctions against Liberia in May. These sanctions, which include an arms embargo, a ban on the export of diamonds and a travel ban on President Taylor and his associates, continue to put pressure on President Taylor to break his links with the RUF rebels and restrict his ability to procure arms and destabilise Sierra Leone. We have made it clear to the Government of Sierra Leone and the Government of Guinea that they should take steps to prevent the recruitment of fighters, including from the Civil Defence Force and Kamajors, for the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) within their countries. But Sierra Leone's stability will be threatened for as long as there is fighting in Liberia. We are supporting international and regional moves to promote a ceasefire in Liberia.

In the coming months the UK will also be seeking greater and more effective dialogue between G8 countries and the private sector on ensuring better accountability and greater transparency, and on promoting the adoption of voluntary principles of corporate social responsibility by companies involved in developing Africa's economic resources.

<a name="20724w55.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The United Kingdom's overseas territories are expected to co-operate internationally and regulate their financial services sector in line with international standards. The Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and the Turks and Caicos Islands Financial Services Commission respectively are responsible for the regulation of the financial sector in the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, including licensed company service providers who are responsible for ensuring that non-resident companies comply with the laws and regulations of the territories concerned. The regulatory and criminal investigation authorities in both territories are actively assisting the Securities and Exchange Commission and other relevant authorities in the United States, where the investigation into the Enron case is currently focused. In the event that regulatory or criminal offences involving Enron subsidiaries were to be discovered in either jurisdiction, it would be for the legal and regulatory authorities in the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, in co-operation with the US and other authorities, to consider appropriate action to enforce the law.

<a name="20724w55.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We are monitoring the developments in the USA although we have had no formal discussions on this issue at this point. The Terrorism and Prevention System is a US Department of Justice proposal to develop a reliable and comprehensive national system for reporting suspicious and potentially terrorist-related activity. The system is to be developed in conjunction with federal agencies and industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how he plans to hold to account countries that have reneged on their ratification of global treaties on the spread of weapons of mass destruction.  [71940]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w55.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 When a country ratifies an international treaty, it places itself under the obligations of that treaty once it is in force. The global treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, such as the existing chemical weapons convention and the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, have mechanisms aimed at ensuring compliance with their provisions. While the biological and toxin weapons convention has no comparable mechanisms, procedures exist for clarifying concerns.
<P>

<a name="20724w55.html_para1">The UK routinely monitors the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and is a strong supporter of the effective functioning of treaty compliance mechanisms. We also work with the OPCW and IAEA to ensure that the verification and inspection mechanisms are as effective as possible. Other methods may also be employed as appropriate, including bilateral discussions. We have to be ready to make full use of all instruments to deter and uncover those who do not comply with their international obligations.

An estimate of the likely impact upon business of the Data Protection Act 1998 is contained in the December 1997 Regulatory Impact Assessment on the EC data protection directive to which the 1998 Act gives effect. This shows recurring costs to business of &#163;630 million a year, and non-recurring costs of &#163;836 million.

<P>
<a name="20724w58.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Making such proposals is a commercial matter for the oil and gas companies; the Department stands ready to assess such proposals for the purpose of issuing the necessary consents, notably production licences and pipe-line authorisations. Meanwhile the Department and Ofgem are ensuring industry and public awareness of the case for additional gas storage facilities, whether offshore or onshore, through the work of the Joint Energy Security of Supply Working Group (JESS). JESS's first report, published in June, noted that there is uncertainty about the adequacy of gas supplies to meet demand from consumers during a period of sustained peak demand from about 2004&#150;05, and that additional infrastructure (including gas storage) may be the most efficient way of ensuring security of supply.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessments she has made of the <i>(a)</i> current volume of depleted gas reservoirs in offshore fields and <i>(b)</i> potential volume of gas reservoirs in offshore fields, which could be used for re-injected gas storage; and if she will make a statement about gas reservoir depletion.  [71467]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w58.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 It is for the oil and gas companies to make such assessments, and to come forward with commercial proposals. As gas production from some gas fields on the UK Continental Shelf stops, there may well be further opportunities&#151;following the example of Rough&#151;to use a number of reservoirs for gas storage. Whether a particular reservoir is suitable will depend on such factors as: how far it is depleted; whether it has the right physical characteristics, including "cushion gas" to permit easy injection/withdrawal without excessive production of liquids; and its proximity to shore.

<a name="20724w58.html_wqn14"><B> Ann Winterton: </B>

<P>
<a name="20724w58.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department discusses such schemes with oil and gas companies, and other interested parties, from time to time. Details of such discussions are commercially confidential. In correspondence with Cheshire county council my Department has noted that gas storage facilities make a valuable contribution to the reliability of physical gas supplies and to maintaining competition in the gas supply chain, and that consumers (including electricity consumers who indirectly rely on gas) benefit in both ways. I am placing a copy of my Department's letter of 27 March in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="20724w59.html_para9">The Government support the principle of individual producer responsibility, but believe that making this mandatory might impose disproportionate cost and administrative burdens on some firms, especially SMEs with little additional environmental gain.

<P>

<a name="20724w59.html_para10">We have negotiated hard in Brussels for as much flexibility as possible in the directive and will implement in the most cost-effective manner permitted by the final text, while maximising the environmental benefits.

<P>
<a name="20724w60.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Responsibility for energy security under the law is shared by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Ofgem. My right hon. Friend is responsible for setting the overall regulatory framework for the supply of gas and electricity. A key part of that framework is set out in the Electricity Act 1989 and the Gas Act 1986. These provide that in carrying out their functions the Secretary of State and Ofgem shall have regard to the need to secure that all reasonable demands in Great Britain for electricity and (so far as it is economical to do so) for gas are met.
<P>

<a name="20724w60.html_para7">Under this legislation, the powers of the Secretary of State and Ofgem relating to security of supply are mainly exercised through their licensing functions. My right hon. Friend has laid down Standard Licence Conditions which apply to all classes of licensees. Power to modify these rests with Ofgem, with reference to the Competition Commission if a company and Ofgem cannot agree. My right hon. Friend has a power to veto agreed modifications. Enforcement of licence conditions is for Ofgem.
<P>

construction and settlement of disputes about access to pipelines. She also has general responsibility for gas regulation and for strategic international issues including European policy, and hence for security of supply issues falling within these areas. There are also provisions under HSE's Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 and under the Electricity Supply Regulations 1988 which provide for maintaining security of supply.
<P>

<a name="20724w60.html_para9">The Electricity Act 1989 gives my right hon. Friend powers to require particular measures to be taken by licence holders in the event of an electricity supply emergency. The Government may also use the powers contained in the Energy Act 1976 and the more general powers in the Emergency Powers Act 1920, which is the responsibility of the Home Office.

 BNFL announced its results for 2001&#150;02 on 16 July 2002. The company reported a loss after tax and exceptional items of &#163;2,090 million, caused primarily by exceptional charges of &#163;1.9 billion relating to a review of strategy for historic waste management and &#163;375 million for the early closure of the Magnox nuclear power stations Calder Hall and Chapelcross. Before tax and exceptional items, the company made a profit of &#163;22 million.
<P>

<a name="20724w60.html_para10">BNFL also announced a net asset deficit of some &#163;1.85 billion. However, the Company has a strong cash position. Further, in November 2001 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced proposals to establish a Liabilities Management Authority (LMA) which will take on financial responsibility for the nuclear legacy liabilities. The Government are committed to pushing ahead with the proposed LMA at the earliest opportunity and published on 4 July 2002 a White Paper "Managing the Nuclear Legacy" which, among other things, sets out in more detail the plans for the LMA.

Copies of the reports have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="20724w61.html_para2">Schedule 11 of the Companies Act 1989 sets out the requirements which a body must meet to be eligible for recognised supervisory body status. These include requirements to have adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with its rules relating to membership and eligibility (e.g. holding an appropriate qualification, being a fit and proper person, working to technical and ethical standards, maintaining competence), discipline and investigation of complaints. In these reports, the recognised bodies inform the Government about their activities in relation to these arrangements. We shall discuss the reports with the bodies shortly, and will do so in the light of the interim report of the co-ordinating group on audit and accounting issues.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> As a matter of law, the conduct of a maintained school must be under the direction of a school's governing body. That duty is re-enacted in clause 20 of the current Education Bill. (References are to HL Bill 51 (Rev) as first printed for the Lords.) This statutory position is referred to in both lines 1 and 2 of column 67 of the <i>Official Report</i> for 15 July 2002 and in lines 58&#150;59 of column 157 of the <i>Official Report</i> on Standing Committee G on 13 December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20724w62.html_para0">It would not therefore be possible for a company or any other body to "take over the running of the school", because the governing body cannot contract out the duty to conduct the school.
<P>

<a name="20724w62.html_para1">Nothing in the Bill means that governing bodies have greater powers to enter into contracts. By virtue of schedule 10 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, governing bodies already have the power to enter into contracts, which may include elements of the operational management of the school.
<P>

<a name="20724w62.html_para2">Clause 10 (1)(a) gives groups of schools the power to form a company to deliver services to other schools. Thus, clause 10(1)(a) means that a governing body may contract with a school company on the same basis as with other bodies.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> Cr&#232;ches operating for two hours or less per day are not regulated in the same way as childcare facilities operating for longer periods. There are no particular requirements for staff to be checked by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED), for information to be supplied to parents, or for qualified staff. However, people providing such facilities have a general duty of care for the children being looked after, and should therefore ensure that they employ people suitable for the job. Within the last twelve months, the Department for Education and Skills has received only one complaint about the quality of care in cr&#232;che facilities operating for less than two hours per day. We keep under regular review the provisions of the Children Act relating to the regulation of childcare.

 At the UN General Assembly Special Session, countries committed themselves to developing or strengthening national policies with the goals agreed in the Plan of Action set out in the final declaration. In the Government's over-arching strategy for children and young people, which will cover all departments and which will be published later this year, we will ensure that the commitments in the Plan of Action are reflected.

<P>
<a name="20724w63.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Teachers' Pension Scheme is subject to regular actuarial reviews by the Government Actuary. A review of the position as at 31 March 2001 is underway and the report is due to be published at the end of the year. Actuarial reviews include full allowance for the effects on the scheme liabilities of such factors as price inflation, salary growth, membership changes and pensioner mortality. Intermediate valuations are produced to provide updated liability figures for the purposes of Resource Accounting, and are generally based on the assumptions adopted for the latest full review.
<P>

<a name="20724w63.html_para1">Information is not readily available in the form requested. The liabilities of the scheme were calculated to be &#163;76 billion for the actuarial review as at 31 March 1996, and were estimated to be &#163;98 billion for the Resource Accounts as at 31 March 2001. Changes in price inflation, real wage inflation and in the membership are the main factors underlying the higher liabilities. The increase in liabilities caused by the extension of the rights of part-time workers was not significant over the period.

 The Department for Education and Skills commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to carry out a research project into additional educational needs or deprivation. The project was steered through the Education Funding Strategy Group, the Department's group of external stakeholders. The project used a survey to determine the cost and incidence of additional educational needs in 42 local education authorities, covering all types of LEA. Data from the survey has been used to inform the choice of indicators and the weights assigned to them in the formulae which underlie the exemplifications issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 8 July.

In the education options in the consultation paper issued on 8 July, the overall Index of Multiple Deprivation has not been used: it is not suitable as a basis for reflecting deprivation in the distribution of funding for additional education needs, since it incorporates many measures of deprivation not relevant to the educational needs of children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list in respect of each training and enterprise council the number of staff <i>(a)</i> employed at the end of 1999&#150;2000, <i>(b)</i> transferred to the Learning and Skills Council, <i>(c)</i> transferred to the Small Business Service, <i>(d)</i> transferred to Business Links, <i>(e)</i> transferred to other organisations and <i>(f)</i> made redundant by the TEC prior to 31 March 2001.

<a name="20724w65.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Please following table shows the number of staff employed by the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) for the period 1999&#150;2000. These figures were taken from the TEC audited Statutory Accounts. As TECs were private limited companies engaged in a wide range of activities the Department was not in a position to monitor the actual destination of each individual employed by them.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para0">However the Department can confirm that of the staff in post at March 25 2001, 3750 transferred with TUPE rights of employment to the LSC and just over 320 to the Employment service. A further 520 staff with transfer rights took voluntary severance or were made redundant for technical reasons.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list the aggregate amounts for each year from 1995&#150;96 to 2000&#150;01 to which her Department gave consent to transfer by training and enterprise councils between budget heads, showing for each budget head the total amount transferred out and the heads to which it was transferred.  [71171] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w65.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 This information is not available. Training and enterprise councils obtained approval from Government Offices to transfer between budget heads on an individual TEC basis. This information was not collated centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidance was given by her Department to training and enterprise councils on the virement of funds between the budgets allocated for work-based training for young people and adults and those for central TEC administration, for each of the years 1995&#150;96 to 2000&#150;01.  [71170]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w65.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The guidance relating to the virement of funds between budgets allocated for work-based training for young people and adults was detailed and complex but in essence prior to 1999&#150;2000 TECs were allowed to vire up to 10 per cent. of their surpluses from one "budget" (funding block) to another subject to them meeting certain minimum performance targets.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para2">This guidance was revised in the 1999&#150;2000 TEC Licence to formally restrict the levels of surpluses that could be generated and switched from one funding block to another to 7 per cent. in total.

<P>
<a name="20724w65.html_wqn6"><B> Paul Holmes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list in respect of each training and enterprise council <i>(a)</i> her estimate of the aggregate of training and enterprise council surpluses attributable to public funds, <i>(b)</i> the amount paid over to public funds to date in respect of those surpluses, and <i>(c)</i> the action her Department is taking to recover outstanding amounts.  [71174]
<P>
<P>
<P>

 We are not yet able to give a final account of the individual or aggregate amounts of Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) surpluses

attributable to public funds and we will not be able to do so until the Liquidators appointed to wind up the TEC companies (59 of the 72 TECs) have completed their work. In the case of the remaining TECs who are to continue trading, we will not be able to give the figures until we have finally resolved the amount of attributable reserves due back to us.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para3">However the Department believes that by March 2003 they will have received back from the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) approximately &#163;250 million worth of reserves. This amount includes &#163;127 million in respect of Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs), &#163;45 million in legacy funds for the Learning and Skills Council, &#163;40 million in fixed assets transferred to a range of successor bodies or for use in the local community and &#163;38 million for the National Transition Budget which is used to meet specific costs incurred in setting up the LSC, e.g., new IT system.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para4">To date we have received &#163;100 million for ILAs, &#163;24 million for LSC legacy funds and 16m towards the National Transition Budget.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para5">The return of funds has taken longer than initially expected due to the variety and complexity of issues which have had to be resolved, prior to TECs being able to appoint a liquidator or agree a clean break with the Department where the TEC have decided to continue. The Department are currently working closely with the relevant TECs and liquidators to ensure that outstanding issues are resolved and funds released as a matter of urgency. We have on occasions threatened the appointment of an administrative receiver where we have failed to secure the level of co-operation needed.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para6">In return for releasing funds the Department is offering TEC Boards and or liquidators financial guarantees in the form of indemnities that ensure the funds will be repaid if they need them to meet genuine contractual commitments. In our experience all liquidators have been reluctant to release reserves until they have completed the wind-up, which in most cases is proving a complex and time-consuming process that can take over a year from appointment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) if she will list in respect of each training and enterprise council for 2000&#150;01 the proportion of total expenditure on Government-funded programmes represented by central administration costs; and what assessment she has made of whether the sums spent on central administration represented value for public money;  [71172]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will list <i>(a)</i> the total sums made available by her Department or its predecessors to training and enterprise councils for their central administration costs and <i>(b)</i> the amounts actually spent by TECs on central administration for each year from 1995&#150;96 to 2000&#150;01.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w65.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Information on central administration costs is not available. Training and enterprise councils were not provided with specific funds for their central administration costs. They received payments for programme and strategic budgets deemed to include an unspecified contribution towards administration costs. The amounts spent by TECs on administration and its disclosure were a matter for individual TECs and varied 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1359W</I><P>
between them. Some TECs showed no administration costs within their statutory accounts under this heading, while most excluded the costs of staff involved in the direct delivery of their programmes. However, all TECs had to show staffing costs as a note within their accounts.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para7">While this understates administration costs, as it does not cover expenditure on premises, information technology and other support systems, it is the best proxy for the information sought. I have therefore provided

below figures for each of the financial years from 1995&#150;96 to 2000&#150;01 showing spend on staffing costs of each of the former Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England as stated in their consolidated annual statutory audited accounts for the full range of activity TECs undertook.
<P>

<a name="20724w65.html_para8">Any direct comparison of staff costs between TECs is misleading, both because there is no statutory definition of staff costs and also because the range of training and enterprise activities differed between TECs.

 The next meeting of the EU Advisory Committee on vocational training (ACVT) is due to take place on 9 and 10 December 2002. Members of the Scottish Executive have not been and are not members of the committee. The ACVT was established by Council Decision No. 63/266/eec dated 2 April 1963 which laid down general principles for implementing a common vocational training policy across the EU. Its purpose is to offer advice and submit opinions to the European Commission on vocational training policy which the Commission is obliged to take account of. Membership of the committee comprises Government officials and representatives from employers' organisations and trades unions. Member States are represented by one person from each group making a total of three per delegation. The representative of Government for the UK is an official from the Joint International Unit of the Department of Work and Pensions and the Department for Education and Skills, who routinely consults policy colleagues in the Scottish Executive, Northern Ireland Executive and the National Assembly for Wales on issues to be discussed by the Committee. These arrangements are in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations.

These are directed by the young people at three main groups: politicians; Government and the Electoral Commission; and the media. The Children and Young People's Unit

will be working with the Electoral Commission and a wide range of young people's organisations to extend the debate on these findings.

<a name="20724w66.html_para0">We also plan to make the materials from the project available to teachers, youth workers and organisations working directly with young people. We shall be working with the All Party Group on Youth Affairs to explore how Honourable Members can be helped to improve their communication with young people. The report also identified the importance of information about the political process and this will be a key feature of citizenship education, which will be part of the National Curriculum for secondary schools from August 2002.

<a name="20724w66.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Nationally, about 20 per cent. of Education Standard Spending is based on additional educational need (AEN). The additional support provided to a particular school with a high number of pupils from deprived backgrounds will depend on decisions made at local level through the Fair Funding formula operated by its local education authority (LEA).
<P>

<a name="20724w66.html_para1">Around 25 per cent. of the Standards Fund, or &#163;800 million of grant in 2002&#150;03, is allocated to LEAs using deprivation factors, normally the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals. All schools will receive a devolved Standards Fund budget, based on a distribution agreed with their LEA, including any factors for deprivation.
<P>

<a name="20724w66.html_para2">The Standards Fund includes &#163;255 million of targeted support in 2002&#150;03 for deprived communities through grants for Excellence in Cities and Excellence Clusters. The Government is also providing &#163;64 million to Education Action Zones, based in deprived areas, to run programmes to achieve pre-agreed targets and objectives in zone schools.

Information about the cost and saving of statutory instruments to public funds is not held centrally and would cost a disproportionate amount to establish. Similarly the cost and saving to businesses and individuals is not held centrally and is not available.

<P>
<a name="20724w66.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> The Department does not collect any statistics by English parliamentary constituency as such. Data to compile statistics are collected either from individual education or training institutions, or from local administrative bodies such as Local Education Authorities. In the former case statistics can generally be derived on a parliamentary constituency basis by aggregating data from the relevant education or training institutions. This is not carried out routinely, but is done when requested (for example in a Parliamentary Question), subject to considerations of proportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20724w66.html_para3">I understand that the honourable Member has also received a <i>letter from</i> the National Statistician on this matter.

<a name="20724w67.html_para0">Minimum requirements for the type of document which should be published on Government websites are set out in guidance issued by the Office of the E-envoy, "Guidelines for UK Government Websites" (Illustrated Handbook for web management teams section 2.2 "What content should be on your website?" and section 2.3 "Cross-government requirements". In addition to setting out guidelines on documents for inclusion, the guidance also explicitly requires Departments to ensure that the content of the site as a whole is up to date and current, and where it is necessary to update content of individual documents, to show the latest date of amendment clearly on the document concerned.

<a name="20724w69.html_para5">The Wales Office 2000 report cost less than the other reports because it was shorter and very basic, compared with the later reports. It was done in black and white and the pages were simply folded and stapled whereas the Wales Office 2001 and 2002 reports were bigger, spine-bound, in colour and were altogether less simple in style.
<P>

<a name="20724w69.html_para6">Another factor affecting the cost is the subsidy paid by the Department to determine the cover price. Because Wales Office reports are bilingual they have twice as many pages as a comparable single language report. The subsidy the Department pays, therefore, enables it to keep down the cover price to something comparable with a single language report. There are other factors which affect the amount paid but these are a commercial matter for the Stationery Office.

 The interim programme of action to tackle TB in Wales announced on 29 May 2002 gives priority to tackling the backlog of overdue tests. The State Veterinary Service in Wales has already acted to minimise the spread of TB through the introduction of movement restrictions on herds in annual testing parishes with overdue 6 and 12-month check tests. Prioritisation has also been given to those herds with tuberculosis tests that are overdue. Significant progress has been made. In Wales the number of overdue tests has reduced from 5,135 at 30 November to 3,450 at 30 June 2002.

Chief executive salaries are not collected centrally.<P>

Of the 8 primary care trusts in Derbyshire, only Central Derby Primary Care Trust was operational in 2000&#150;01. The total expenditure, or gross operating cost, of the primary care trust for that year was &#163;70.08 million. Total expenditure figures for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 are not yet available.<P>

For each of the three years, the Department has made allocations to health authorities, and health authorities have subsequently made allocations to primary care groups and primary care trusts within their area.<P>





<P>

Table 2 shows the allocation and distance from target in 2000&#150;01 for the 9 previously existing primary care groups (PCGs) in Derbyshire. All of the primary care groups became part of primary care trusts in 2001.<P>

 The Department is aware of only two instances of companies withdrawing a branded drug from the market shortly before patent expiry. In both cases, the "replacement" products were no more expensive than those that were withdrawn, and there was every reason to expect that generics would be available when the patent on the withdrawn product expired. In both cases, therapeutic alternatives were available for patients.

<a name="20724w72.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg (the morning-after pill) was authorised in the UK as a prescription only medicine in November 1999. This followed advice from the committee on safety of medicines (CSM) who were satisfied as to the evidence of quality, safety and efficacy of levonorgestrel 0.75 mg for emergency contraception. The evidence considered by CSM included two World Health Organisation (WHO) sponsored pivotal studies. One study involving approximately 2000 women in 14 countries including the UK, has been published in the Lancet (1998). The other, published in the journal Human Reproduction (1993), involved 880 women. Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20724w72.html_para0">The WHO study published in the Lancet demonstrated that this method of emergency hormonal contraception prevented 86 per cent. of pregnancies when treatment was initiated within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The trial also showed that the efficacy is higher the sooner the product is taken after unprotected intercourse. If it is taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex the product is 95 per cent. effective, and this falls to about 56 per cent. if taken within 49 to 72 hours.

<a name="20724w72.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Within the National Health Service, abortions have traditionally been carried out in gynaecology wards and day care units. A 1999 survey showed that women can wait up to four or five weeks for an abortion in some parts of the country. There is clear evidence that the earlier in pregnancy an abortion is performed the lower the risk of complications. We therefore want to ensure that women who have legal grounds can access an abortion within three weeks as recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists evidence based clinical guideline <i>The Care of Women Seeking Induced Abortion.</i>
<P>

<a name="20724w72.html_para1">We plan to test, at a very limited number of sites on hospital premises, whether providing early medical abortions in a setting such as a family planning clinic can help to reduce waiting times. We will also monitor the impact on local hospital services, particularly whether greater use of medical abortion reduces waiting times for surgical abortion and whether staff and operating theatre time is released for other procedures.

 Peer education is recognised as having the potential to contribute to the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy by complementing classroom based Sex and Relationships Education (SRE). This is reflected in key SRE guidance documents (DfES, 2000; Ofsted, 2002). The Teenage Pregnancy Unit is working closely with the Department for Education and Skills to disseminate effective peer education approaches more widely.

<a name="20724w73.html_para1">The available research evidence concludes that peer education can be effective in increasing young people's knowledge, can have positive impact on attitudes, intentions and self-esteem and, in some instances, can change behaviour. Young people like peer approaches; involvement in programmes raises the self-esteem of peer educators; and peer education projects give young people control over their own health.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2002]:</i> Information on the ratios of general practitioners (GPs) to patients is held at primary care trust (PCT) level but I am advised by the PCTs that this varies around the Surrey and Sussex Health Authority area, from 1,782 patients per GP in Bexhill and Rother PCT to 2,050 in Crawley PCT. In Worthing I am informed that the ratio is 1,885. I recognise that local GPs are under pressure and this concern is shared by Adur, Arun and Worthing PCT, which has advised me that it is concerned about the level of access to GP services in some practices. The PCT is actively working to improve the situation though a number of actions including effective use of incentive schemes.

<a name="20724w75.html_para2">As part of the Department's commitment to improving access to primary care nationally, we have increased the PCT primary care access fund by &#163;83.5 million to &#163;168 million, with at least &#163;48 million dedicated in 2002&#150;03 to improving access in primary care and implementing advanced access. Significant funding has also been made available to enhance primary care services in Worthing. The former Worthing Primary Care Group invested &#163;235,000 in 1999&#150;2000 rising to &#163;691,000 in 2001&#150;02.

As part of this work, the CMO and the officials assisting him have met with representatives of several of the organisations that responded to our "Call for Ideas" on clinical negligence reforms. The CMO is now preparing a report with recommendations for reform, which I will be considering over the summer. Once the outcome of this work is published we will consider any further requests for meetings we may receive.

 In May 2002, we welcomed the publication of the government funded national sentinel audit of epilepsy-related death. The audit looked at investigations into epilepsy deaths, care provided prior to death and contact with bereaved families. We have given a commitment to consider in full the recommendations of the audit including the issues raised by the hon. Member and to develop an action plan later this year to address the key issues. It will need to take account of and feed into a range of other initiatives including the national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions, which will have a focus on neurological conditions such as epilepsy. We expect to meet with the epilepsy voluntary organisations shortly, and will consult with others as appropriate.

<BR>
Developed the expert patients programme, which aims to provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase will include people with epilepsy.

 Personal social services (PSS) funding is distributed using information about the social care needs of each area, including demographic, physical and social characteristics.

 Reducing the routine wait times for appointments in primary care is a government priority. By the end of March 2004, all patients will be able to see a primary care professional within 24 hours and a general practitioner within 48 hours.

<a name="20724w79.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The National Health Service and BUPA have agreed commercial terms and are now going through a process of consultation with medical and other staff who will be affected by the diagnosis and treatment centre. An announcement will be made once this process has been completed and an agreement signed.
<P>

<a name="20724w79.html_para6">Consultation is essential not just in terms of good practice but to agree the medical manpower plan with consultants. This will not delay the opening of the centre.

 The Department's workforce censuses do not collect information on the number of neurologists, paediatric neurologists or nurses with a specialism in the treatment of epilepsy.
<P>

<a name="20724w79.html_para7">The numbers of doctors working in paediatric neurology is not collected centrally, it is a sub-specialty of neurology. As at 31 March 2002, the numbers of consultants working in neurology was 372. This is an increase of 34 per cent. since 1997.
<P>

<a name="20724w79.html_para8">We are investing in extra training places in neurology and have agreed an increase of up to fifteen specialist registrars in neurology for 2002&#150;04. The Department's current workforce projections suggest that by 2004, there may be around an additional 80 trained specialists available to take up consultant posts in neurology, over a 2000 baseline of 326.
<P>

<a name="20724w79.html_para9">We continually review future requirements for trained specialists as part of the National Health Service's new multi-disciplinary workforce planning processes.

<a name="20724w80.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The rules are set out in regulations (13) and (14) of the National Health Service Trusts (Membership and Procedure) Regulations 1990 (SI No. 2024). Chairs and non-executives board members of trusts are appointed by the National Health Service appointments commission. However, vice chairs are appointed from amongst the non-executives by all the other directors of the trust.

<a name="20724w80.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2002]:</i> Since publication of the NHS Plan, patient environment action teams (PEATs) teams have undertaken four rounds of assessment visits to acute National Health Service trusts. The first was made in Autumn 2000 to "spot check" the quality of the patient environment, validate the trusts' action plans, and identify what work still needed to be done to raise standards. Subsequent visits were made during Spring and Autumn 2001 and Spring 2002, to assess improvements made and to determine whether trusts had been successful in bringing standards up to a higher level.
<P>

<a name="20724w80.html_para2">PEAT visits have largely concentrated on the acute sector and assessments have taken place at all of the acute trusts; some of the larger mental health units have also been assessed. To date a total of 1,289 unannounced inspections have been carried out. Details of all the trusts' including examples of advancements in improvements made, can be found in "The NHS Plan&#151;Clean Hospitals" report which can be located on the clean hospitals web site at www.cleanhospitals.com
<P>

<a name="20724w80.html_para3">The clean hospitals' programme has been a clear success and has had a significant impact on standards of cleanliness, decoration and supporting services. Patient areas, visitors' toilets, outpatients and accident and emergency units have been thoroughly cleaned and maintained. Many have been refurbished and redecorated. Trusts have increased resources devoted to maintaining standards of cleanliness&#151;some have employed additional cleaning staff, others have increased the frequency with which their hospitals are cleaned. There are now no hospitals in England where cleaning standards are found to be less than acceptable.

 Information is not held centrally on the numbers of patients who have not had neurological treatment recommended by their doctors. Surrey and Sussex Health Authority has advised me that waiting times for non-urgent neurophysiology tests are longer at Hurstwood Park Neurological centre than the other service providers in London, although an urgent or priority request is dealt with on the same day or within 1&#150;2 days depending on clinical priority. Waiting times for magnetic resonance imaging scans are also determined by the urgency of the case. Close links are maintained between local consultants and specialist service providers so information on waiting times is readily available, allowing patients to be kept informed of the expected waiting time for their treatment.

The Department fully supports the need for an increase in the number of neurologists. Indeed, recommendations by the medical workforce review team are for the numbers of consultants in Neurology to grow by some 50 per cent. by 2010, from 326 in 2001 to 496 in 2010.<P>

Workforce has been recognised as key to the successful delivery of the NHS Plan and the national service frameworks. New national workforce planning and development structures have been set up to help deliver a multidisciplinary and integrated health and social care workforce to support service improvement.<P>

<P>
<a name="20724w81.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Health and Safety is a major issue for the National Health Service, and one that is taken very seriously. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1972 all employers, including NHS organisations, must ensure as far as is reasonably practicable, that people not employed by them but affected by their undertaking (such as patients and visitors) are not exposed to health and safety risks.
<P>

<a name="20724w81.html_para7">Whilst there is no legal requirement for people to co-operate, patients and visitors have a responsibility to behave in a manner that does not put others at risk, and to respond to staff's requests and hospital regulations for the protection of themselves and others. Where a patient or visitor is observed to be acting in an unsafe manner, measures to minimise the risk must be undertaken by the NHS trust.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> The development of early intervention in psychosis teams as outlined in the NHS Plan is aimed at reducing the length of time that young people wait for appropriate treatment in first onset psychosis. Shorter periods of untreated psychosis are associated with a better outcome. By 2004 fifty early intervention teams will provide treatment and active support in the community to these young people and their families.

 The Department is aware of the recent survey by Green Audit of cancer in Burnham on Sea, however, it has not been provided with details of the results of the survey. Government is advised on cancer clusters near to nuclear installations by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) which was set up in 1985. This committee is carrying out a very large study of childhood cancer in Great Britain which includes all cases registered since the 1960s (some 33,000 cases). This study is expected to report in 2003 and will include areas around all nuclear installations in Great Britain including Burnham on Sea. The small area health statistics unit (SAHSU) is considering the feasibility of a study of all adult cancers in the areas around nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom.

 Henoch-Schonlein Purpura is most common among young children and may occur after an infection. Most children make a good recovery, with no specific treatment, but a few can develop serious complications. Whilst funding is not allocated specifically for combating Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, funding is allocated to health authorities and primary care trusts (PCT) on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each health authority's/PCT's share of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need.

<a name="20724w83.html_para1">We do not collect information on the numbers of agency staff who work in child care settings. Information about the number of child care positions unfilled is not collected on a regular basis.

The last survey undertaken in this area was for community homes for children looked after run by local authorities in England and Wales and it was undertaken in 1999. This survey stated that in England the overall full-time and part-time vacancy rates were both 10.3 per cent.

 Following the emergence of safety concerns in Europe, the issue of liver toxicity in relation to the use of medicinal products containing the herbal ingredient kava-kava was reviewed by the committee on safety of medicines (CSM) in December 2001. The herbal sector voluntarily withdrew stocks of products containing Kava-kava while the safety concerns were under investigation. In the light of further data that has since become available the CSM has recently given a provisional opinion that the possible therapeutic benefits of medicinal products containing kava-kava can not be considered to outweigh the safety risks and that consideration should be given to appropriate regulatory action.
<P>

<a name="20724w84.html_para2">The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is currently aware of 68 cases worldwide of liver problems suspected to be associated with kava-kava. These include cases of liver failure resulting in six liver transplants and three deaths. There have been three reports of liver toxicity in the United Kingdom suspected to be due to consumption of kava-kava.
<P>

<a name="20724w84.html_para3">Following the committee's advice, the MCA will be consulting on proposals to make an Order under Section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968, prohibiting the sale, supply or importation of unlicensed medicines containing kava-kava. Regulatory action is in progress in relation to licensed medicines containing kava-kava.

<P>

<a name="20724w84.html_para5">Pending the outcome of consultation and any regulatory action which may follow, the MCA and the FSA have indicated to the relevant sectors that they would welcome continuing support for the voluntary withdrawal of kava-kava products in the interests of public safety.

<P>
<a name="20724w85.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is responsible for providing advice on this issue. It advised consumers on 24 April 2002 that there was no need to change their diet as a result of research published that day by the Swedish National Food Authority, which had found previously unexpected levels of acrylamide in a range of cooked and heat-processed foods. Further information on the levels of acrylamide in food and their significance to public health has since been published by FSA and others. The FSA has reiterated, in statements on 17 May and 27 June, that on the basis of current evidence people should eat a balanced diet including a variety of fruit and vegetables, and that as part of a balanced diet people should moderate their consumption of fried and fatty foods. The FSA has not advised people to stop eating any of the foods tested. The same advice has been issued by an expert consultation convened by the World Health Organisation and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, and has been endorsed by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food. The FSA will publish further information on acrylamide in food as it becomes available, and will keep its public advice under review.

 RU-486, now more commonly known as mifepristone (Mifegyne), is licensed for use in medical termination of pregnancy. Information on how to use mifepristone, as well as information on possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) and for patients in the patient information leaflet (PIL).
<P>

<a name="20724w85.html_para6">Warnings and contraindications for the use of mifepristone which are included in the SPC and PIL are as follows: allergy to mifepristone or any component of the product, suspected ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy not confirmed by ultrasound scan or biological tests, chronic adrenal failure, severe asthma not controlled by therapy and presence of a inter-uterine device in situ. In addition, special care should be given to patients with haemostatic disorders with hypocoagulability or with anaemia, and patients on long term therapy with corticosteroids since corticosteroid efficacy can be decreased by concomitant treatment with mifepristone. Mifepristone is not

recommended for use in patients with hepatic or renal failure or in women over 35 years of age and who smoke more than ten cigarettes a day.

 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists's evidence-based guideline "The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion" (2000), which applies to both medical and surgical abortions, recognises the importance of women seeking abortion receiving accurate impartial information. Verbal advice must be supported by printed information which every woman considering abortion can understand and may take away and read before the procedure.
<P>

<a name="20724w85.html_para12">Clinicians caring for women requesting abortion should try to identify those patients who require more support in decision making than can be provided in the routine clinic setting. Facilities for additional support, including access to social services, should be available. Appropriate information and support should be available for those who consider, but do not proceed to, abortion.
<P>

<a name="20724w85.html_para13">Professionals should be equipped to provide women with the information they need in order to give genuinely informed consent:


<BR>
that abortion is safer than continuing a pregnancy to term and that complications are uncommon;
<BR>
description of the abortion methods that are available;
<BR>
immediate complications;
<BR>
complications in the early weeks following abortion.

<P>

<a name="20724w85.html_para14">During the procedure, staff are on hand to give support to women.
<P>

<a name="20724w85.html_para15">The guideline also considers the mental health implications of termination and concluded: "Only a small minority of women experience any long term, adverse psychological sequelae after abortion. Early distress, although common, is usually a continuation of symptoms present before the abortion. Conversely, long-lasting, negative effects on both mothers and their children are reported where abortion has been denied."
<P>

<a name="20724w85.html_para16">Referral for further counselling should be available for the small minority of women who experience long term post abortion distress.

<a name="20724w86.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Patients, including pensioners, who are likely to have difficulty in paying for dental treatment are entitled to financial help with the charges. Many pensioners will be able to afford to pay for treatment, but where they cannot they can apply for help under the low income scheme and may be entitled to free treatment, or partial help with the cost of treatment.
<P>

<a name="20724w86.html_para2">The Government believes that it is a better use of limited resources to base help with charges for National Health Service dentistry on the individual's ability to pay, so ensuring that help is focused on those who need it most. The Government meets over two thirds of the total cost of dentistry. Many patients including pensioners, receiving NHS dental treatment are either exempt from charges or can receive help through the low income scheme.

 The European Union Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) concluded in their 1999 opinion on the safety of caffeine and other constituents of energy drinks that further studies would be required in order to be able to establish upper safe levels for daily intake of taurine and glucuronolactone.

<P>
<a name="20724w86.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the cost to the National Health Service of medicines licensed under the European Orphan Drugs Regulations. Four drugs have been authorised to date and approximately 200 others have been designated and are in the pipeline for authorisation. Until the prices of these medicines and the number of patients requiring them are known it is difficult to quantify the cost. Where companies make excessive profits on branded medicines these are recovered under the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS) and statutory powers are available to deal with medicines not covered by that scheme.

 The European Commission published proposals for wide ranging amendments to the regulatory regime for human and veterinary medicines in December 2001. The proposed changes include a new definition of a medicinal product.
<P>

<a name="20724w86.html_para9">The Government recognises the need to ensure that the definition of a medicine is drafted in such a way that will allow new therapies to be appropriately regulated. However, the United Kingdom's view is that the extension of the scope of the medicines legislation, particularly when linked to the new definition, is unwarranted and unacceptable as it would capture many products, including certain food supplements, that are already covered by other sectoral legislation. The Government sees no justification for this proposal and will continue to resist it. This position is shared by most other Member States.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> The available requested information is given in the tables. For the number of offences, the number of recorded crimes are given, from which the rates per population and detection rates are calculated.
<P>

<a name="20724w87.html_para0">It should be noted that there was a change of counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, and so numbers of recorded crimes and detection rates before and after that date are not directly comparable. Also, some forces will have introduced the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard ahead of its national implementation on 1 April 2002, and so this will be reflected in the England and North West Region figures. The counting rules for detections changed on 1 April 1999, so that numbers of detections before and after that date will not be directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="20724w87.html_para1">It should be noted that recorded crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. For example, the number of common assaults in England and Wales recorded in the British Crime Survey, which measures victims' experience of crime, decreased by an estimated 24 per cent. from 1999 to 2001&#150;02. However, common assaults recorded by the police in that area over that period increased by 23 per cent. Offences recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of the real level of offences, or trends for offences.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many successful applications have been made since 1999 under the concession for over-age applications for entry clearance, following DNA testing; and if he will make a statement on the future of this concession.  [72777]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w88.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 On 1 January 1991 a concession was introduced concerning over-age applicants for entry clearance, following DNA testing. It enabled those dependent children who had previously been refused entry to join their parents in the United Kingdom owing to doubts about their being related as claimed, to re-apply if a DNA test now confirmed the relationship. Amongst other requirements, they had also still to be dependent upon their parents and unmarried. By July 1991, some 550 cases relating to the concession had been considered of which 115 were conceded. However, in recent years use of the concession has been nil. Each year between five and 10 people who have already re-applied once and been refused, have applied again, but no applications have been granted under the concession.
<P>

<a name="20724w88.html_para6">Last year, some members made representations to my predecessor, urging that the concession be widened so as to allow people who had been refused as minors to re-apply. The Government had considerable sympathy with their views and with the people yet more who were wrongly refused before the introduction of DNA tests made such decisions much more reliable. However, this situation arose owing to technological advances and we have already attempted, by way of the present concession, to correct any previous injustices resulting from decisions which were taken in good faith on the available evidence at the time. It is now no longer possible to identify those people who may have been wrongly refused due to doubts about their relationship to a United Kingdom sponsor, as many records of earlier decisions have been destroyed.
<P>

<a name="20724w88.html_para7">Given that it is not possible to widen the concession, and given that the concession is not being used and has not been used for some time, we have decided that the concession should end. After 24 August 2002 no new applications under the concession will be considered. There remains within the immigration Rules provision for dependent relatives who find themselves in distressed circumstances to apply to join a sponsor in the United Kingdom. Any future applications will instead be considered under the existing immigration Rules governing dependent relatives.

<a name="20724w89.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The market test for the management of Brixton did not attract bids from the private sector, partly because of its poor physical condition and location. The in house bid, while being impressive, was not affordable. Therefore, instead of operating under a Service Level Agreement, the prison will continue to be run under existing management arrangements. However, a performance baseline will be set with challenging improvement targets, and progress will be closely monitored.

<a name="20724w89.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under existing procedures, an applicant who is not issued with a Statement of Evidence Form (SEF) to complete prior to their asylum interview is allowed five days after their substantive asylum interview to make further representations before a decision is taken on their asylum claim.
<P>

<a name="20724w89.html_para0">Those asylum applicants issued with an SEF prior to any substantive interview do not benefit from this arrangement. This is because applicants issued with an SEF form are given 10 working days to submit the completed form to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. We think this gives applicants a reasonable period to set out their claim and time to seek legal representation if they wish for the submission of further supporting evidence.
<P>

<a name="20724w89.html_para1">We have decided that asylum applicants who go through the induction centre process will no longer benefit from the five day period to make further representations. The induction centre process is designed to familiarise an asylum applicant with the asylum procedures, providing the asylum seeker with detailed briefings on different aspects of the asylum process and to explain to applicants what their obligations are. All asylum applicants who go through the induction centre process are told that all information relevant to their claim must be available by the time they are substantively interviewed because decisions on claims will be made shortly after the interview. The interview itself will be scheduled to take place two weeks after the applicant has gone through the induction process. We consider that this two week period offers the applicant sufficient time to prepare for the interview and gather any supporting information he considers necessary.

 As at 10 July, a total of 236,191 applications have been received by the Criminal Records Bureau for criminal record checks. Information relating to the number of applications received from local authorities and the delays in responding is not available in the format requested. I will write to my hon. Friend when the information becomes accessible.
<P>

<a name="20724w90.html_para0">Measures continue to be taken to overcome the early operating difficulties experienced by the Bureau, which have led to delays in responding to applications. The Criminal Records Bureau is determined to meet the high standards of service that it has made clear it will deliver to its customers, and expects to see increasing service improvements during the coming weeks.

 Re-offending rates are not normally measured as they rely on the self-reporting of offending by offenders. Such an approach can lead to questions over the reliability of data based on individuals' recollection and willingness to impart their offending behaviour to an official source.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w90.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned for, convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of insanity of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act to provide certain details to the police. There is, however, no "register" of sex offenders, as such; nor are sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Act separately identified as such in criminal statistics.
<P>

<a name="20724w90.html_para2">Until recently, data on the number of sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Act was collated biannually on a national basis from the police national computer. However this arrangement has been overtaken following guidance issued by the Home Office in respect of the provisions in section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The guidance requires information about the number of sex offenders subject to

<a name="20724w91.html_para1">Some police forces, such as Avon and Somerset, adopted the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in advance of the national implementation in April 2002. Changes in crime statistics in these forces will be strongly influenced by the changes in recording practice, and the impact will vary for different types of offences. Details of the impact of the recording changes are included in chapter three of the above bulletin.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724w91.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. John Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2002]:</i> The additional counter terrorist funding announced following the budget was additional and complementary to existing funding streams for ports security and counter terrorist operations. The sums allocated were the result of full consultation between individual forces, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office. Sussex Police already receive funding through established routes for airport security within the police authority area. Shoreham Airport is policed by resources already in place.
<P>

<a name="20724w91.html_para2">In addition to extra funding for ports security and counter terrorist operations announced on 10 June, we also announced extra funding for 10 forces taking part in the Government's crackdown on street crime. These 10 forces account for 82 per cent. of robbery across the country. Sussex is not among these 10.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> Responses to six questions in the British Crime Survey (BCS) will be taken as indicating the state of public confidence in the criminal justice system. The relevant questions are whether the public is confident that the criminal justice system:


<BR>
&#151; respects the rights of the accused and treats them fairly;
<BR>
&#151; is effective in bringing people who commit crimes to justice;




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2002 : Column 1460W</I><P>

<BR>
&#151; meets the needs of victims;
<BR>
&#151; is effective in reducing crime;
<BR>
&#151; is effecting in dealing with young people.

<P>

<a name="20724w91.html_para3">A target was set for the first time in SR2000 and we therefore do not have information before that period. Our first set of findings (31 January 2001) were:


<BR>
&#151; 69 per cent. of people are confident that the system respects the rights of the accused and treats them fairly (the confidence rates were 70 per cent. for white people, 52 per cent. for black people and 66 per cent. for Asians);
<BR>
&#151; 46 per cent. are confident that it is effective in bringing people who commit crimes to justice (46 per cent. white, 51 per cent. black and 55 per cent. Asian);
<BR>
&#151; 34 per cent. are confident it deals with cases promptly and efficiently (34 per cent. white, 38 per cent. black and 48 per cent. Asian);
<BR>
&#151; 26 per cent. are confident it meets the needs of victims (25 per cent. white, 37 per cent. black and 42 per cent. Asian).

<P>

<a name="20724w91.html_para4">New questions, which address crime reduction and tackling youth crime, were included in the most recent survey and findings will be published in the Autumn. Therefore, due to changes in the collation of the BCS, we do not have two sets of directly comparable data available.

<P>
<a name="20724w92.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Heroin availability can be defined and measured in a variety of ways. The clandestine nature of drugs supply and consumption also mean that definitive figures on heroin availability are not possible. However, the Home Office has produced figures on the size of the United Kingdom (UK) heroin market.
<P>

<a name="20724w92.html_para1">The method for producing these figures draws on general population surveys, and on the urine testing and surveying of arrestees in police custody. These allow estimates to be produced on the total number of regular heroin users, frequency of heroin consumption and level of consumption. A figure can then be calculated for total amount of heroin consumed and therefore an overall estimate for the value of the UK heroin market.
<P>

<a name="20724w92.html_para2">A more detailed outline of the above method and the estimates produced can be found in "Sizing the UK Market for Illicit Drugs" (Home Office Research Development Statistics Occasional Paper No 74. 2001).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of <i>(a)</i> registered young offenders, <i>(b)</i> registered offenders, <i>(c)</i> young offenders resident in youth offender institutions, <i>(d)</i> offenders resident in adult prisons, <i>(e)</i> persons convicted of drug-related offences and <i>(f)</i> persons convicted of violent crimes are known to have a history of being in care.

<a name="20724w92.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
 No data are held centrally on the upbringing of persons in prisons in England and Wales. This means that it is not possible to provide specific answers to questions <i>(a)</i> to <i>(f).</i> However, according to the Criminality Survey 2000, 31 per cent. of the sentenced male prison population (excluding sex offenders) had been taken into local authority care as a child.
<P>

<a name="20724w92.html_para9">In 1997, a survey was carried out by the Office for National Statistics, called "Psychiatric Morbidity Among Prisoners in England and Wales". A sample of around 1,200 male remand, 1,200 male sentenced and 800 female prisoners were interviewed. 33 per cent. of the males on remand and 26 per cent. of the males under sentence had been taken into local authority care as a child. 29 per cent.

of the females on remand and 25 per cent. of the females under sentence had also been taken into local authority care as a child.
<P>

<a name="20724w92.html_para10">According to the National Prison Survey 1991, when interviews were conducted with around 4,000 sentenced and remand prisoners (juveniles and immigration detainees were excluded): "26 per cent. said that they had at some point before the age of 16 been taken into local authority care. As many as 38 per cent. of prisoners under 21 reported that they had had such an experience".

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which statutory body has responsibility for the welfare of children in care who have been committed to a young offender institution or adult prison; and if he will make a statement.  [73058]

<P>
<a name="20724w92.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Prison Service, on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, has responsibility for the day-to-day welfare needs of everyone who is committed to a young offender institution or adult prison, including those who are "looked after children".

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> We are considering how best to carry out the consultation exercise on the regulation of access to communications data to ensure a wide-ranging and detailed debate of the issues raised and how to balance the individual's right to privacy with legitimate arrangements to safeguard national security and protect the public.

For more details about the scheme, and the funding formula used, I would refer the hon. Member to the Written Answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) on 6 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 984W.<P>

I placed in the Library at the same time a paper showing the allocation of funds to individual projects for 2001&#150;02. I hope to announce shortly the projects we shall be funding in 2002&#150;03.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to make retail crime a best value indicator for police force performance.  [54623]

<P>
<a name="20724w93.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. John Denham: </B> 
 The Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs) for 2002&#150;03 came into effect on 1 April 2002, following consultation with the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Following the Home Secretary's commitment in September last year to halve the number of indicators, there are currently 18 BVPIs as compared with 32 in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="20724w93.html_para0">Whilst we have no plans to introduce an additional national performance indicator on retail crime, a police authority would be able to set a local performance indicator relating to retail crime should this be a particular problem locally.

<a name="20724w93.html_para2">The budgeted strength is not an establishment figure. Differences between actual and budgeted strength have a variety of causes. They may arise because patterns of recruitment to and wastage from the police service are different or because targets for strength at the end of the financial year reflect planned changes in strength, for example the allocation of officers recruited through the Crime Fighting Fund.

Grant also includes provision to offset costs incurred in transitional arrangements: &#163;7.0 million in 1999&#150;2000, &#163;5.5 million in 2000&#150;01, &#163;1.61 million in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;0.8 million for 2002&#150;03.<P>

2. The reduction in grant in 2002&#150;03 reflects a shift from local to central financing of National Crime Squad (NCS) National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) from 1 April 2002. However, on a like-for-like basis, government grant in 2002&#150;03 shows a 2.2 per cent. increase in cash terms or 1.2 per cent. increase in real terms compared to 2001&#150;02. Actual cash figures with the like-for-like percentage change are included above.<P>

3. Real terms figures are given at 2001&#150;02 prices (GDP deflator)<P>

4. The additional payments were specific to particular years, and have therefore been excluded from the year-on-year comparison.<P>

5. Capital grant only.<P>





<P>

In addition, under the Crime Reduction Programme over &#163;3.7 million has been allocated since 1999 to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships for projects in Surrey.<P>

<i>Police numbers</i><P>

Figures for police numbers and spending are available nationally and for the Cleveland Authority. They are not available for individual councils or parliamentary constituencies.<P>

On 31 January this year there were 128,748 police officers in England and Wales, a record number and 4,578 more than in March 2000. Spending by the police has increased by &#163;1.27 billion (+ 17.9 per cent.) since 1997 to &#163;8.361 billion in 2002&#150;03.<P>

Between March 2000 and January 2002 police numbers in the Cleveland Police increased by 33 to 1,437. The increase in numbers has been made possible by the extra recruits allocated to the Cleveland Police under the Crime Fighting Fund over the three years to March 2003. Cleveland Police has been allocated a total of 74 Crime Fighting Fund recruits. 20 were recruited in 2000&#150;01 and 36 were recruited in 2001&#150;02. The force is expected to take on a further 18 Crime Fighting Fund recruits in 2002&#150;03. Spending on policing by the Cleveland Police Authority has increased by 24 per cent. (+ &#163;18.57 million) since 1997 and now totals &#163;95.13 million for 2002&#150;03.<P>

However, last year the Government introduced the Private Security Industry Act 2001. The Act specifies the creation of a Security Industry Authority. It is hoped that the authority, which will regulate the industry through licensing, will begin operations in 2003; it will have wheel-clamping as one of its priority areas.

Complex issues need to be resolved in order to find a way forward.

Section 92 (10) of the Police Reform Bill amends the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 so as to grant the Home Secretary the power to call for reports from Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships annually. This will enable Crime Reduction Directors to ensure that partnerships have appropriate strategies to deal with anti-social behaviour and that they are implemented effectively.

A recent research study "Mobile Phone Theft" (by Victoria Harrington and Pat Mayhew, Home Office Research Study 235) contained a number of estimates. On the basis of figures from six police forces extrapolated to England and Wales, there were an estimated 330,000 offences recorded by the police in 2000&#150;01, while the best estimate from analysis of data from three surveys indicates that there were some 710,000 phone thefts occurring annually at this time.

A start has been made, but more needs to be done before Britain's mobile phone system can lead the world in security.

 The only definition of an operational (frontline) officer which currently exists is that in the Report of the Working Group on the Classification of Police Service Personnel in September 1999 which was commissioned by the then Home Secretary (Mr. Straw). It describes such an officer as any officer, including covert officers, whose primary role (i.e., over 50 per cent. of the time) is directly to deliver the overarching aims of the police service.

The CRB has appointed a Complaint Mediator to resolve any complaint where a customer remains dissatisfied with the Chief Executive's reply.

<a name="20724w97.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. John Denham: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is an executive agency of the Home Office. The principal arrangements for monitoring and managing its work are as follows. Each year, the Bureau will continue to produce corporate and business plans, and an annual report and accounts, all of which will need to be approved at Ministerial level, and will then be published. The Bureau will also produce weekly and monthly operational performance reports for my information. The Bureau's work is overseen by an Advisory Board which meets frequently and reports directly to me. The Board is chaired by the Home Office Director of Crime and includes senior representatives from the Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Skills, the National

 The package of measures which is being implemented by the Criminal Records Bureau is structured on the basis of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Of the three levels of Disclosure that the Bureau will issue, Basic Disclosures will contain details only of convictions that are not spent under the 1974 Act. Standard and Enhanced Disclosures will also include spent convictions, but will be issued only to applicants for positions that fall within the Exceptions Order under the 1974 Act.

<a name="20724w98.html_para1">We are working with the police and the mobile phone industry to reduce mobile phone robbery, undertaking public awareness campaigns and joint tracking exercises. Our discussions with the operators have recently borne fruit. By the summer all five of the main operators will be able to bar stolen handsets by reference to the unique IMEI number which identifies the handset. All of the operators are also working together to develop a shared database of stolen phones, which will allow them to disable stolen phones if there is an attempt to use them on a different network. We believe that this is a very important step forward, as it should remove one of the major incentives for robbery.
<P>

<a name="20724w98.html_para2">Operators have also agreed to improve security as they invest in new systems. We are pressing the handset manufacturers for similar commitments. A start has been made, but more needs to be done before Britain's mobile phone system can lead the world in security.

 It is not possible to account for all funds directed to recipients in the Luton South constituency because funds are not allocated on the basis of Parliamentary Constituencies. However, I am pleased to publish the table showing the following grants made to organisations in Luton in the last years as shown. This demonstrates a substantiated investment in Luton by the Home Office.

 The Interception of Communications Act 1985 did not provide for access to communications data. The Metropolitan Police made approximately 127,000 separate requests for communication data under the Data Protection Act 1998 in the last year. The access to communications data provisions in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) have not yet been implemented.

<a name="20724100.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, has withdrawn the order made under s.25(1) of RIPA adding a number of other public authorities to the access to communications provisions in the Act to allow for wider consultation before bringing forward new proposals.
<P>

<a name="20724100.html_para6">Chapter II of Part I of RIPA deals with the acquisition of data. The subsequent use made of that data is regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998 and by the statutes governing the Intelligence agencies.

 The Government is committed to ensuring that policing services meet the needs of the local community. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Police Standards Unit monitor policing at a local as well as at force level. Police authorities are also required to publish information about their performance against a range of Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs), including those that address community issues such as police visibility and public satisfaction with the standards of service they receive from their local force.

 Prior to the Trade and Industry Committee report on Mobile Phone Masts the Home Office had asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to assess the health and safety aspects of the TETRA technology used by Airwave. The NRPB report concluded that it is unlikely that the unique features of TETRA pose a hazard to health. The Home Office has nonetheless set up a comprehensive research programme to ensure that any residual health and safety covers that has been revised by forces and users are addressed.

 The Offender Assessment System (OASys) has not been fully introduced into the Prison and Probation services. The National Probation Service has started implementation of paper-based Offender assessments, while the Prison Service is intending to roll out on a computer-based system from April 2003.
<P>

<a name="20724101.html_para0">The combined development costs for OASys from 1999&#150;2002 are approximately &#163;883,000. The cost to the National Probation Service of implementing the paper-based system for the financial year was approximately &#163;173,000.
<P>

<a name="20724101.html_para1">It has been estimated that on average it will take, on paper, 210 minutes for a Probation Officer and, electronically, 315 minutes for a Prison Officer to complete an initial OASys assessment.

<a name="20724101.html_para2">OASys effectiveness will be monitored through comprehensive Management Information Systems developed by each service and when OASys is bedded in, performance targets for both services will be defined and monitored. The OASys Central Research Unit will continue to carry out investigations into the validity and reliability of the OASys system as well as the effectiveness of interventions designed and implemented across the Services. In addition, independent evaluation will be carried out or managed by the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate.

<a name="20724102.html_para1">The term registered drug addict was based on the Home Office collection of data between 1968 and 1997. Since 1997, the description problem drug users has been used for people who present to treatment services.
<P>

<a name="20724102.html_para2">Nationally, the number of individuals in drug treatment has been estimated from the number of reports made to the regional drug misuse database, which records information on an individual for the first time that person visits an agency, and for the first re-visit in six months or more. These data, therefore, underestimate the total number of individuals receiving specialist drug treatment in any given year. The number of reports made to the Merseyside and Cheshire drug misuse database by Merseyside drug treatment agencies is shown in the table:

In 1996, an additional drug treatment monitoring database, which was prevalence-based, was established in Merseyside and Cheshire. The period prevalence database records information from drug treatment agencies on individuals seen by the agency within a year, regardless of how long they have been in contact with services. These figures give the numbers of individuals receiving structured treatment in-year. The numbers for Merseyside drug treatment agencies were as follows:<P>

<a name="20724102.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2002]:</i> We have bilateral prisoner transfer agreements with 66 countries. Requests from prisoners who are nationals of these countries to serve their sentences in their own country are normally approved where they meet the criteria set out in the relevant agreement, namely: prisoners must normally be a nationals of the country concerned; have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment which is final and enforceable (i.e. no outstanding appeals against conviction or sentence); and have at least six months left to serve at the time the application is submitted. Decisions on individual applications require the consent of both jurisdictions. It is at present our policy normally to refuse requests if, as a consequence, the prisoner would be likely to receive a significant reduction in time to serve.
<P>

<a name="20724102.html_para3">We are working to increase the number of countries with whom we have repatriation agreements and expect to have signed up to nine more agreements in the course of this year.

On a Saturday the cost to support the entire network of 15,000 desktops across England and Wales would be &#163;8,704. On a Sunday, the same cost would be &#163;11,600.

 There is currently no system for informing victims about the release from hospital of a person who has committed serious offences whilst insane, as this information has been considered to be subject to medical confidentiality. However, the Government believes that victims of their offending should have the same rights to information as victims of any other serious offending.

 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> Two innovative and integrated Criminal Justice Centres are being developed in Warwickshire. The Centres will speed up justice, give a better service to victims, witnesses and defendants and help in the local efforts to reduce crime and improve public safety by co-locating all of the county's criminal justice agencies.
<P>

<a name="20724105.html_para5">Practitioners from the courts, Crown Prosecution Service, police, Probation Service and Youth Offending Teams will be working together with the National Health Service and voluntary organisations to create new partnership arrangements and modernise the existing single agency approaches. The Centres will deliver joined-up justice through improved business processes and Information Technology systems. This innovative approach will improve the quality and timeliness of prosecutions which should speed up the processing of cases.
<P>

<a name="20724105.html_para6">Victims and witnesses will receive a better service through the new integrated Centres by receiving help and support at all stages of the justice process, especially while they are at court.

In relation to those leaving Her Majesty's Prison Young Offender Institutions during 1997, before the youth justice reforms took effect, 76 per cent. of male young offenders and 58 per cent. of female young offenders were reconvicted within two years of release from custody during 1997.
<P>

<a name="20724105.html_para9">Reconviction rates for those sentenced in July 2000, shortly after the new Detention and Training Order was introduced, are due in early 2003.

<P>
<a name="20724105.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> The Home Office played no role in the release arrangements for Mr. Strang. I regret that because of an unfortunate administrative error in the Home Office, authority for his detention as a restricted patient lapsed on 2 August 2000. Accordingly, his discharge was a matter for his hospital care team. Since his discharge, the Home Office has liaised closely with the local Multi Agency Public Protection Panel and established what the arrangements are for his safe care and supervision in the community. We have also learned of the concerns of the victims about his offence.
<P>

<a name="20724105.html_para10">I take these concerns extremely seriously. It is not right that victims of such terrible events should have to learn from the media that the offender has been discharged. We have therefore published proposals in the Mental Health Bill to bring the rights of victims of mentally disordered offenders into line with those of the victims of violent or sexual offending in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.

 Figures published in the Prison Service Annual Report and Accounts for 2001&#150;02 show that Whitemoor (high security) prison had the highest cost per prisoner at &#163;54,184 and Ford open prison the lowest, at &#163;14,968.
<P>

<a name="20724106.html_para9">Cost per prisoner figures shown in the annual report for private sector establishments include an element of capital repayment and the figures are not comparable with the public sector.
<P>

<a name="20724106.html_para10">Criteria used to determine the allocation of funds include internal benchmarking of prisons of similar size and category and assessments of the grading of staff necessary to maintain a safe, decent and healthy environment and to deliver regimes effective in reducing crime. Full consideration is given to the security classification of prisons within the estate, costs being higher in high security prisons and lower in the open estate where the risk of escape and danger to the public is reduced.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> All prisons, including those holding category B prisoners, are required to work with their local National Health Service (NHS) partners to identify the health needs of their local prison population and provide appropriate services to meet those needs.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> Information is not collected centrally in the form requested. Prisoners who are awaiting transfer to secure National Health Service (NHS) hospitals are normally located in the prison healthcare centres. Where prisoners have to be placed in segregation, for control or other reasons, Prison Orders require that they be visited by a doctor or registered nurse, as a minimum requirement, at least once every three days, and visited more frequently where health needs dictate.

<P>

I am informed by the Chief Constable of Cheshire that the force has recently improved sickness absence management procedures and are now seeing an improvement in sickness absence for both police officers and support staff.<P>

In 1997 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary published a report "Lost Time" about sickness absence in police forces. The Home Office has recently published "In Sickness and In Health: Reducing sickness absence in the police service', which reported the results of research into this subject. The reports made a number of recommendations to Chief Constables aimed at improving the management of sickness absence.<P>

The Home Office is currently developing the Strategy for a Healthy Police Service, in consultation with the police service, which will help bring about substantial reductions in police sickness.<P>

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in replying to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency promised a substantive reply by me.
<BR>
You ask if the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will investigate the level of accuracy of Child Support Agency assessments.
<BR>
The Agency makes great efforts to ensure the accuracy of child maintenance assessments. These include;
<BR>
&#151;requesting verification of all income declared by clients before the maintenance is calculated;
<BR>
&#151;training and coaching at all stages of a maintenance application through workshops and weekly meetings to establish common understanding and best practices;
<BR>
&#151;establishing checking teams to assess the accuracy of work being processed;
<BR>
&#151;checking the cash value accuracy of a percentage of assessments by a centrally based team, the Monitoring and Guidance Unit.
<BR>
All this has contributed to the achievement in the last year of accuracy, to the nearest penny, on the last action taken on a case of 82.5 per cent. against a target of 78 per cent.

I am sorry that I cannot provide the costs of the new IT for the Child Support Agency as it is commercially confidential. I can say that the planned total cost of the project to implement Child Support Reform over the 10 year period of the business case was &#163;651 million.

The planned delivery date for the new system that was specified in the contract was in line with the timetable for the implementation of the Child Support Reforms in April this year.

<BR>
You have asked five questions:
<BR>
1. "In how many cases a reduced benefit was given under section 46 of the Child Support Act 1991 in each year from 1993&#150;94 to 2001&#150;02";

<BR>

<BR>
Following the introduction in April 1998 of face-to-face interviews with parents with care claiming benefits, there has been a sharp rise in compliance and a corresponding fall in the number of reduced benefit directions issued. These interviews provide the opportunity to explain to parents with care the advantages of co-operating with the Agency as well as the good cause rules.
<BR>
2. "How many maintenance application forms were (a) issued and (b) received by the Child Support Agency in each year from 1993&#150;94 to 2001&#150;02".

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions of the lone parents subject to sanctions for non-attendance at compulsory personal adviser meetings, what was the average value of the sanction in terms of lost benefit; how long, on average, the sanctions were applied for; what was the longest period of sanction; how many lone parents subject to suspension had their sanctions reversed and under what circumstances; what analysis has been undertaken of the reasons for non-attendance at interview; and what evaluation has been undertaken on the effectiveness and impact of sanctions.  [67550]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724110.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We are giving lone parents more choices and more help than ever before to move off welfare and into work, in return for greater responsibility to consider the help that is on offer. On 30 April 2001 we introduced compulsory Personal Adviser (PA) meetings for lone parents across the country to ensure that they are aware of the help available. In cases where a lone parent is unable to attend a PA meeting, or the lone parent's circumstances mean that the meeting would not be appropriate, then the requirement to take part in the PA meeting can be deferred to a later date or waived completely.
<P>

<a name="20724110.html_para0">When PA meetings were introduced they were compulsory for all lone parents making a new or repeat claim for Income Support whose youngest child was of school age. From April 2002 these meetings have been extended to all lone parents making new or repeat claims with a youngest child aged three years or over. In addition, since October 2001, any lone parent making a new or repeat claim for benefit at one of our integrated Jobcentre Plus offices is required to take part in a Work Focused Interview, regardless of the age of their youngest child.
<P>

<a name="20724110.html_para1">Attendance at a PA meeting at the new/repeat claim stage is a condition of entitlement to benefit. If a lone parent chooses not to attend the meeting they will not receive any benefit. For the majority of lone parents who do attend, review meetings are held six months into their claim and then annually while they are still in receipt of Income Support.
<P>

<a name="20724110.html_para2">At the same time as PA meetings were being introduced for new/repeat claims they also began to be rolled out to lone parents already in receipt of Income Support. During 2001&#150;02 annual PA meetings became compulsory for lone parents in receipt of Income Support with a youngest child aged between 13 and 15 years old. From April 2002, the annual PA meetings were extended to include lone parents with a youngest child over the age of 9.
<P>

<a name="20724110.html_para3">These lone parents are given up to three pre-notified appointments and if they fail, without good cause, to take part in the PA meeting they are subject to a benefit sanction. This sanction is equivalent to 20 per cent. of the Income Support personal allowance for a single person aged 25 or over (currently &#163;10.74 per week). This sanction remains in force until the lone parent takes part in a PA meeting.

Adverse decisions can be overturned if the lone parent demonstrates that they had good cause for not attending the meeting. Information on the individual circumstances of the lone parents is not collected centrally.<P>

 Benefits may be paid into a wide range of accounts, including standard current accounts, building society accounts, basic bank accounts and, from 2003, the card account at the Post Office. The Financial Services Authority publish a leaflet ("No bank account? Why it could pay you to have one") setting out the generic features of the different types of bank account. The most important differences between the different types of account are:


<BR>
&#151;Current accounts normally offer a cheque book and overdraft facilities;
<BR>
&#151;Basic bank accounts and, from 2003, the card account at the Post Office are operated using a plastic card and a PIN number and do not provide overdraft facilities;

&#151;Basic and current accounts offer facilities to pay for goods and services in shops, to pay bills by Direct Debit and Standing Order, to accept payment in of wages and other credits, and to obtain cash in a variety of ways, including from cash machines and "Cashback" in some shops;

 We encourage jobseekers to participate in voluntary work and recognise that it can play an important role in preparing people for paid employment. People of working age in receipt of benefit can now do unlimited voluntary work as long as the usual entitlement conditions are met, and we have recently extended the disregard of reimbursed expenses for people in receipt of income-related benefits to help those wishing to take up voluntary work. To encourage more unemployed people to participate in voluntary work, the Department's leaflets have been, or are in the process of being, revised to ensure that they contain positive messages on volunteering.
<P>

<a name="20724111.html_para2">We are also removing other obstacles to work within the benefit system. For example, we have extended the Incapacity Benefit linking rules to 52 weeks, or 2 years for people receiving Disabled Person's Tax Credit, allowing disabled people to try out work safe in the knowledge that they can return to the same rate of benefit if the job doesn't work out. We estimate that 10,700 <sup>1</sup>  people in Great Britain have benefited from this change since October 1998 and, of those, 1,600 <sup>1</sup>  were in Scotland and around one hundred <sup>1</sup>  in the City of Glasgow. No reliable data are available by parliamentary constituency.
<P>

<a name="20724111.html_para3">In addition, linking rules for people receiving income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or Income Support were changed from 9 April 2001 to allow them to re-qualify for help with mortgage interest straight away if they reclaim benefit within 52 weeks of starting full-time employment. In Great Britain, we estimate that around one hundred people <sup>2</sup>  in receipt of income-based Jobseeker's Allowance have benefited from this change. No reliable data are available by country, local authority area or parliamentary constituency. Data for those in receipt of Income Support benefiting from this measure are not held centrally.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Administrative penalties, as an alternative to prosecution, were introduced by the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act (1997) with effect from December 1998. Cautions were made available to local authorities as a sanction from the start of 2001&#150;02.<P>

2. Figures for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 are taken from local authority management information returns. It is possible that there could be some double counting with DWP data if there were cases which involved a joint prosecution.<P>

3. Management information data for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 is not available for all local authorities. The total for Great Britain includes estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents. The figures for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 have been rounded to two significant figures.<P>

4. Information for 2001&#150;02 is from a count of prosecutions and sanctions completed by all local authorities; this data is collected from local authority subsidy returns. Subsidy data may differ from management information data (shown for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01) at local authority level; however, analysis shows a high level of consistency between the two data sources at national level.<P>

 Sure Start Maternity Grants were introduced on 27 March 2000 and complement the Sure Start programme, which is helping many thousands of children from the most deprived areas to get the best start in life. Sure Start Maternity Grants are now worth up to five times as much as the Maternity Payments they replaced and provide more help to the neediest families.

<a name="20724113.html_para1">The scheme means more than just a cash payment. To ensure that vulnerable people have at least one contact with a health professional during pregnancy or following childbirth, we introduced a new condition of entitlement which requires people to provide evidence of having received advice on either child or maternal health from a health professional. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the vast majority of those people refused a grant for failing to produce a certificate from a health professional subsequently successfully reclaimed.

As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the information which we collate for each of the new Jobcentre Plus Pathfinder areas on the number of new claims for incapacity benefit broken down by the categories you set out. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.

 Information is not available in the format requested.

In order to receive a Child Dependency Increase the person claiming Incapacity Benefit must be either entitled to Child Benefit for the child or treated as entitled to Child Benefit by virtue of their spouse or partner receiving it. We cannot, therefore, give accurate figures for the number of Incapacity Benefit recipients who also receive Child Benefit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to ensure that those on incapacity benefit who reach their 65 birthday and move on to retirement pension do not experience a benefit gap between the end of the benefit and the start of the pension.  [72204]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724114.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The principle of paying Retirement Pensions in whole weeks stems from the fact that the benefit week is traditionally paid in advance. Entitlement to Retirement Pension begins with the pay-day on or following the pensioner's 60 or 65 birthday. Changes in entitlement, for example a decrease because of a prolonged stay in hospital, also takes effect from the pay-day following the change of circumstances. The same rule applies with the termination of the award.
<P>

<a name="20724114.html_para6">Incapacity Benefit is traditionally paid in arrears so in the transition between these benefits the claimant may experience a perceived gap in benefit. However, the claimant does not lose any payment days because payment of Retirement Pension will continue after the change in circumstances or the end of the claim for Retirement Pension until the next pay-day.

<a name="20724115.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The medical assessment procedure involves several stages including gathering information from the person and their GP or other health care professional and arranging and carrying out examinations. The most recent study of a sample of cases found that on average the whole process took 11.4 weeks where entitlement was confirmed and 17.5 weeks where benefit was withdrawn. The available information on the number of medical examinations carried out is in the table.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2002]:</i> The role of the Departmental approved doctor differs from the more familiar role of the GP, whose primary function is to make a diagnosis and arrange treatment. The Departmental doctor is a medical analyst who has received special training and is therefore able to provide a fully explained opinion of the person's functional ability, within the framework of the relevant legislation. Such opinion, together with any other evidence considered necessary, enables the Department to make an informed decision as to whether a person satisfies the criteria for entitlement to the benefit.
<P>

<a name="20724115.html_para0">The Department is aware of, and has taken account of, concerns expressed by GPs about difficulties in answering the functionally-based questions, such as how far someone can walk and whether they can prepare a main meal, currently contained in reports. Subject to satisfactory evaluation of trials we intend to introduce a new GP report, which asks for purely factual clinical information. The introduction of the new report will be accompanied by training for Decision Makers covering most appropriate sources of evidence, the interpretation of such evidence and how to resolve conflict in the evidence.
<P>

<a name="20724115.html_para1">Disability Living Allowance can be paid to severely disabled people both in and out of work. Entitlement depends on the extent to which a person needs help with personal care, needs supervision or has difficulties with walking. There have therefore been no applicants who have been refused Disability Living Allowance on grounds of ability to work.

 Disability Living Allowance is a contribution towards the extra costs incurred by people who have long-term severe disabilities. Disability Living Allowance is paid from the date from which it is awarded. There is no delay of six months or any other period and, hence, the circumstances cited by the hon. Member do not arise.
<P>

<a name="20724115.html_para5">However, Disability Living Allowance cannot be awarded unless a severely disabled person has satisfied the conditions of entitlement for a period of at least three months and is likely to continue to satisfy them for a further period of at least six months. In some cases, therefore, people can be notified that they have been awarded Disability Living Allowance from a prospective date and the payment will start from that date. These qualifying rules establish that the severe disability and the extra costs arising from it are of a long-term nature and ensure that Disability Living Allowance is only awarded to people with long-term severe disabilities.

<a name="20724116.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Guidance for decision makers on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's Social Fund Direction Four is in the Social Fund Guide, a copy of which is available in the Library. The guidance makes clear that the term "exceptional pressure" is designed to encompass a wide variety of special circumstances. However, the guidance does not attempt to give priority to different sets of circumstances or types of application because this would limit the decision maker's discretion and penalise or deter those applicants who have urgent need but whose circumstances do not fit into a pre-defined category.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20724116.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The community care grant scheme is administered through 127 cash-limited District budgets. The discretionary nature of the scheme means that there will always be variation in the amounts awarded depending on location, because customers' characteristics, needs and priorities are not directly comparable across areas. Budget allocations are designed to anticipate as far as possible, the nature and extent of local demand in order to achieve consistency in decision making. The scheme is kept under close review during the year to monitor the extent to which this objective is met.
<P>

<a name="20724116.html_para10">It is for each District to set the level of priority that can be met from their community care grant allocation. All Districts are required to give priority to high priority needs throughout the period of the allocation, working within the boundaries of the Secretary of State's directions and guidance.

As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the conversion of Jobcentres to Jobcentre Plus offices. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.

Jobcentre Plus has brought together the working age parts of the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service. We began the process of bringing the work of Benefit Offices and Jobcentres together with the opening of 56 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices in 2001. We have also announced plans to open more integrated offices in 25 of our 90 Districts by the end of March 2003. I have arranged for a list of these Districts to be placed in the Library.

Plans are currently being developed for conversion work to take place later in 2003 and beyond. It is not therefore possible to provide an overall number of offices which may close over the roll out period.I hope this is helpful.

 A decision has been made to expand, through negotiation, the existing PFI arrangements under the PRIME contract to include the ex-Employment Service buildings. If these negotiations with the current PFI service provider are not considered to be offering value for money, the Department will seek an alternative commercial solution. Work on an alternative commercial solution is being developed in parallel with the negotiations with the PRIME contract supplier.

 Attendance Allowance is a contribution towards the extra costs incurred by people over the age of 65 who have long-term severe disabilities. Attendance allowance is paid from the date from which it is awarded. There is no delay of six months or any other period and, hence, the circumstances cited by the hon. Member do not arise.
<P>

<a name="20724118.html_para2">However, Attendance Allowance cannot be awarded unless a severely disabled person has satisfied the conditions of entitlement for a period of at least six months. In some cases, therefore, people can be notified that they have been awarded Attendance Allowance from a prospective date, and that payment will start from that date. The six-month qualifying period establishes that the severe disability, and the extra costs arising from it, are of a long-term nature and ensures that Attendance Allowance is only awarded to people with long-term severe disabilities. We have no plans to change the qualifying period.

 We believe that the overall framework of pension policy is the right one. The Basic State Pension will remain the foundation of income in retirement: while Second pensions are being reformed to help more of tomorrow's pensioners build up better pensions. We have introduced Stakeholder Pensions which are a flexible, low charge product enabling many of those who could not previously do so, to save for their retirement. And, we have put in place the Pension Credit to make sure that it pays to have saved even modest amounts for retirement.
<P>

<a name="20724118.html_para8">It is important that policy is informed by accurate statistics on pensions contributions.

Any changes would re-introduce this complexity and go against our commitment to simplify benefit administration wherever possible.

<sup>(134)</sup>Figures are rounded to the nearest hundred and are expressed in thousands.<P>

<sup>(135)</sup>Figures are based on a 1 per cent. sample up to and including February 1993, and a 5 per cent. sample thereafter. Numbers are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<P>

<sup>(136)</sup>Numbers and amounts marked "*" are based on very few sample cases and are therefore subject to a high degree of sampling variation. They should be considered a guide to the current situation only.<P>

<sup>(137)</sup>"&#150;' indicates figures are nil or negligible.<P>

<sup>(138)</sup>"..' indicates figures are not applicable.<P>

<sup>(139)</sup>JSA(IB) figures will include cases where there is an underlying entitlement to contribution-based JSA.<P>

<sup>(140)</sup>IS figures for 1992&#150;93 are based on May 1992 data and represent cases and average amounts in that enquiry week. IS Figures from 1993&#150;94 are based on a four quarter average of caseloads and average amounts paid at the enquiry dates in May, August, November and February of each year. JSA(IB) figures are a four quarter average, with the exception of 1996&#150;97 which is based on two quarters (November and February) following the introduction of JSA(IB) to replace IS for the unemployed in October 1996.<P>

<sup>(141)</sup>The component IS/JSA(IB) totals for 1996&#150;97 do not sum to the overall total, due to the method used to calculate the averages over two and four quarters. The overall total is however representative of the total caseload.<P>

<sup>(142)</sup>Totals may not sum due to rounding.<P>

<sup>(143)</sup>Data were only collected from 1994 onwards.<P>

<sup>(144)</sup>The number of deductions for mortgage interest payments rose sharply between May 1992 and May 1993 following the introduction of mandatory deductions at the end of 1992.<P>

<sup>(145)</sup>Council tax replaced Community Charge in 1993. Figures here relate solely to Council tax arrears from its introduction.<P>

<sup>(146)</sup>Deductions for Council tax arrears are a last resort where other methods of payment have failed and where it is in the interest of the family in order to prevent the prosecution of the vulnerable for debt.<P>

 The terms of reference of the current evaluation of Employment Zones are to assess the contribution of Zones to helping long-term claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance aged 25 and over find and retain jobs.
<P>

<a name="20724120.html_para0">The current evaluation will be completed with the publication in May 2003 of a cohort study comparing characteristics and outcomes of Zone participants with those of similar long-term unemployed people.
<P>

<a name="20724120.html_para1">Our evaluation to date shows that Employment Zones are making a positive contribution in helping long-term unemployed people in deprived areas move off benefit and into work. The 15 Zones have already helped over 23,600 people into jobs. We have recently extended the current Zone contracts to March 2004 and we will also be testing the Employment Zone approach with other groups such as lone parents and people returning to the New Deals.
<P>

<a name="20724120.html_para2">A qualitative study of Zone operations between winter 2000 and summer 2001 was published on 17 July 2002 (Working Age Evaluation Series, Number 124). A copy is available in the Library. The report highlights some encouraging findings about the Zones, recognising, for example, that they have a genuinely innovative delivery system and underlining the importance of the flexibility afforded to Personal Advisers in helping people move into jobs. We will study the report's findings closely and consider what lessons can be learnt from the Employment Zone approach.

<a name="20724120.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The use of a uniform Housing Benefit/Council Tax Benefit claim form by the North Nottinghamshire Private and Voluntary Sector pilot has not been formally evaluated. However, informal feedback suggests that the introduction of the form has achieved savings on printing costs for the local authorities concerned, and that staff can also complete and check the form more quickly, providing a more efficient service to customers.
<P>

<a name="20724120.html_para3">Building on the experience of the ONE pilots, the Customer Management System, which we plan to introduce early next year, will result in a uniform, single claims process for customers. Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit information will be gathered when a claim is made to either Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance or Incapacity Benefit, so that customers will need to provide information only once.

<P>
<a name="20724120.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Strategic Training in Apparel and Textiles (STAT) programme, which was launched in April 2001, was developed as a specific response to a decline experienced in the textile industry. The programme was designed to improve the competitiveness of the industry by helping businesses with staff training and business planning. STAT received a fixed allocation of funding until June 2002, but due to an underspend in the early months, the programme has continued beyond this. There are no plans to extend it any further but the apparel, footwear and textiles sector now receives support through Skillfast-UK, one of five trailblazer Sector Skills Councils launched earlier this year. Skillfast-UK will ensure that people in the apparel and textiles sector continue to receive strategic training and support.

<a name="20724120.html_para7">Working with its partners, Jobcentre Plus will offer a tailored, co-ordinated package of support appropriate to the needs of the workers being affected by the redundancies. This will include information and advice on all aspects of job search, skills and training analysis to help identify individuals' transferable skills and any training needs. Early access to a range of Jobcentre Plus programmes, including the New Deals, will be offered and, where appropriate, re-training will be given. Funding will also be available to pay for one-off support to address individual barriers to re-employment linked to specific job offers.
