<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Sources of timber: it is the employer's policy to purchase only timber products from sustainably managed sources. When requested, the contractor must submit to the project manager documentary evidence (which has been or can be independently verified) that the timber supplied under this contract has been lawfully obtained from forests and plantations which are managed to sustain their bio-diversity, productivity and vitality and to prevent harm to other ecosystems and any indigenous or forest-dependent people."

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para0">The UK fully supports the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement (LMA) as the basis for sustainable peace in Cote d'Ivoire. Our engagement has included &#163;3 million to support the work of the European Community of West African States Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (ECOMICI), the West African regional peacekeeping force. We have also provided &#163;1 million in humanitarian aid. We have been concerned at the growing fragility of the peace process since September, including attempts by armed elements to cross the ceasefire line on 29 November. We are working closely with the French and others in the international community to urge continued respect for the ceasefire; underline the importance of the government of National Reconciliation meeting again in full; and of swift progress on implementation of the LMA, including measures for disarmament and demobilisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions he has had with his counterparts in EU accession countries about an increased focus on <i>(a)</i> poor countries and <i>(b)</i> poverty reduction in future EU development assistance.  [140871]

<a name="31208w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 EU Enlargement should be an opportunity to mobilise even greater support for the Millennium Development Goals and a pro-poor development agenda.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para1">During the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Trieste, where many of my accession colleagues were present, broad development policy issues were discussed. I will also be meeting a number of my counterparts from key Accession Countries after the New Year to stress the importance of securing wider agreement on poverty reduction as the central objective of EU development assistance.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what his policy is towards the proportion of European Union Development Assistance that should go to low income countries.  [140872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 DFID has consistently pressed for the proportion of EC overseas development assistance spent in low income countries to reach the level of 70 per cent. The target date for this achievement is 2006.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para2">According to the available provisional figures, over 50 per cent. of all EC overseas development assistance was spent in low income countries in 2002. This represents an increase in this proportion for the second year running.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent discussions he has had with his colleagues in the European Union about the <i>(a)</i> nature and <i>(b)</i> extent of EU assistance for middle income countries.  [140873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 During the Trieste informal meeting of EU Development Ministers last October, I had an opportunity to share our current thinking on how best to allocate Community aid between countries. In this context, I reiterated the importance of allocating Community aid to countries based on needs and performance, and to seek a greater differentiation between the development instruments we use in low versus middle income countries.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para3">In practice, this would imply a larger share of EC overseas development assistance going to low income countries, and a focus of allocations to middle income countries on those with large number of poor people which pursue reformist policies. It would also mean an increased use of instruments such as concessional lending and technical assistance in middle income countries.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para4">I have also discussed this bilaterally with some UK members of the European Parliament during the autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the <i>(a)</i> status, <i>(b)</i> start date and <i>(c)</i> expected completion date is of the Arun Valley rail upgrade.  [140485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Arun Valley upgrade was proposed by GoVia as part of their plans for a 20 year franchise. The Strategic Rail Authority subsequently agreed a shorter franchise with GoVia. The development of infrastructure upgrades will be taken forward by the SRA separately from franchise replacements. The focus currently is on the major upgrade of the power supply in the Southern Region. The Strategic Rail Authority has developed a Capacity Utilisation Policy which seeks to make the most efficient use of the existing network. Work on a Route Utilisation Strategy for the Brighton Main Line has begun. This will help to inform the need for any future infrastructure upgrades.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department for Transport greatly values the contribution that the voluntary and community sector makes in the transport field and is committed to the Government wide Compact on working with the voluntary sector. The Department has produced a draft Strategy and Action Plan detailing how it will work with and engage the sector over the coming year and we are currently consulting on that draft.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para6">The Department has also set up a Compact working group with membership drawn from the voluntary and community sector to progress this work and to help us ensure that we have a clear understanding of their issues and priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what support his Department is giving to voluntary organisations in the transport sector.  [142435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department for Transport directly supports voluntary organisations in a number of ways. For example, it funds the information and advice service provided by the Community Transport Association. The CTA provides an extensive service to community transport operators and local authorities on a range of legal and operational issues. The Department also publishes guidance on the type of services that can be run and the legal framework for them. The Department also provides funding for 12 mobility centres in England, which give information and advice to disabled and older people on driving and other aspects of personal mobility and to Mobility Choice, the charity that runs the annual Mobility Roadshow.
<P>

<a name="31208w01.html_para7">In addition, funding the rural and urban bus challenge enables the Department to aid schemes run by community transport groups and last year regulations were introduced to extend the Bus Service Operators Grant.

 The Department has received many representations on the use of mobile phones while driving. The vast majority has been broadly in favour of a ban on the use of hand-held phones by drivers. There were over 1,000 responses to the Department's consultation document of 20 August 2002 on this. The results of that consultation were summarised in a document attached to the Department's decision letter of 24 June 2003. A copy was placed in the Library and is available on-line at: www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft rdsafety/documents/page/dft rdsafety 508356.pdf

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is creating two new franchises to serve Yorkshire. The TransPennine Express franchise will commence early next year, with planned investment of around &#163;260 million which will include a new fleet of trains. Local and regional services will be provided by the new 'Northern' franchise, the competition for which is well under way. The SRA is considering proposals from four counterparties and expects to announce a preferred bidder in the Spring. The SRA will consult on an East Coast Main Line Strategy early next year, and has

<P>
<a name="31208w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The target stated in the 10-Year Plan for the reduction of noise from the motorway and trunk road network is that 60 per cent. of the network including all concrete roads will be surfaced with quieter surfacing by March 2011. All resurfacing work now uses quieter surfacing, and work is proceeding in line with maintenance need.

 The Secretary of State announced on 1 April 2003 a programme of measures to reduce the impact of traffic noise. Details were placed in the Library of the House together with details of the criteria used for prioritisation. We do not use the average levels of noise over a wide area as a criterion. However, the measures indicated in the 10-Year Plan to surface approximately 60 per cent. of the strategic road network with quieter surfaces, including all of the concrete trunk roads and motorways, by March 2011 are expected to provide the benefit of significant reductions in the level of traffic noise for approximately three million people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether badgers infected with tuberculosis are capable of depositing infectious tubercular material sufficient to cause infection in cattle on open pasture and other areas to which cattle have access.  [141078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Although it is likely that badgers infected with tuberculosis are capable of infecting cattle, the routes of transmission of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent for bovine tuberculosis) from cattle to cattle, and between badgers and cattle, are not fully understood.
<P>

<a name="31208w05.html_para0">The Randomised Badger Culling Trial is designed to provide information on the role of badgers in cattle TB. Other research investigates the pathogenesis of M. bovis in cattle. These form part of a broad programme or research designed to deliver information on improved diagnostics, how TB is transmitted, how TB develops in affected animals, and on the interaction with wildlife.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what badger latrines are; and what relevance they have in the spread of M.bovis to cattle.  [141079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Badger latrines are areas where the animals habitually defecate. Typically, they comprise several small pits 10 to 20 cm diameter containing badger droppings, usually contained within an area up to five metres across. Latrines are found within and on the periphery of badger social group territories. Badgers also urinate around latrines and smear their scent on the ground. Badgers infected with M. bovis (the causative organism of bovine tuberculosis) may excrete the organism in their faeces and/or urine. Therefore if badger latrines occur on pasture, or in areas frequented by cattle they may pose a risk of M. bovis infection for cattle.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how adult badgers infected with M. bovis transmit the infection to their young.  [141080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is possible that a sow badger infected with M. bovis (the causative organism of bovine tuberculosis) may transmit infection to her cubs through contaminated milk, or by aerosol in the confines of an underground nest chamber. Badgers may also infect each other by bite wounding, either during play fighting or through more aggressive territorial and mating encounters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what conclusions have been drawn on routes of transmission from post-mortem examination of badgers for TB in the past 10 years.  [141084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Post-mortem examination of badgers is used as part of the process of determining if badgers are infected with Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. Post-mortem findings do not provide a basis for ascribing the source or route of infection. However, the location of visible lesions may be indicative of the route of infection e.g. lesions in the lung tissue would suggest a respiratory route of infection. The distribution of lesions in badgers examined by Defra from 1990&#150;99 indicates that infection may have occurred through the respiratory or oral routes, as well as through infection from bite wounds.

 In the absence of any means to estimate badger populations accurately, either prior to or post culling, it is always going to be difficult to make such assessments. In the randomised badger culling trial, post-culling surveys have indicated that, in the best conditions and allowing for a proportion of trap-shy animals, about 80 per cent. of the population may be culled using cage traps. In less than optimal conditions this figure can be substantially lower.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what European Union funds are available to farmers on whose cattle TB restrictions are imposed; how much is payable per head of cattle; whether match funding is required; and what claims the Department has made.  [141087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We are not aware of any EU funds payable to farmers under TB restrictions. The Government currently pays farmers 100 per cent. of market value for cattle removed under TB control measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 This information cannot be provided, except at disproportionate cost. There are seasonal trends in the detection of incidents of bovine TB but it is impossible to determine from currently available information whether these trends reflect seasonally in exposure to the disease.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para5">The Randomised Badger Culling Trial, alongside the Road Traffic Accident survey and the TB99 epidemiological questionnaire, is providing data about the prevalence of TB in badgers in areas of high incidence in cattle herds, for analysis by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB.

<a name="31208w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A possible long-term objective in terms of control of bovine TB could be to achieve Officially Tuberculosis Free status as defined by the EU and the OIE. In the short term, Defra is seeking to arrest the geographic spread of the disease, and is shortly to consult on proposals designed to do this. Defra is also soon to consult on a new TB Strategy, looking at the roles of industry and Government, as well as considering what might be achievable in terms of TB control over next 10 years.

<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not possible to ascribe the source of TB infection in cattle, as the routes of transmission of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent for bovine tuberculosis) from cattle to cattle, and between badgers and cattle, are not fully understood.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para6">The Randomised Badger Culling Trial was designed to provide information on the role of badgers in cattle TB (as well assessing the effectiveness of two badger culling options as control measures). Other research includes investigation of the pathogenesis of M. bovis in cattle. This forms part of a broad programme designed to deliver information on improved diagnostics, how TB is transmitted, how TB develops in affected animals, and on the interaction with wildlife.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para7">In addition, a survey is underway to assess potential risk factors that may predispose herds to TB outbreaks. A preliminary analysis is set out in the Third Report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB.

<a name="31208w06.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the use of polymerase chain reaction testing instead of culture testing for the confirmation of TB in bovine samples.  [141385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Veterinary Laboratories Agency is collaborating with the Imperial College in the design and optimisation of a Mycobacterium bovis-specific polymerase chain reaction (or PCR) assay for the detection of M. bovis DMA in bovine TB lesions. Any new laboratory test is likely to complement rather than replace existing culture techniques.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason hauliers are prohibited under certain circumstances from collecting full loads of TB reactors, comprising animals from different farms, for delivery to slaughterhouses.  [141386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Any animal movement constitutes a health risk. Under post-FMD movement controls, Defra allowed a round of collections of animals from different farms only if all of the farms involved each had multiple pickup approval.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para8">There are farms which do not want approval or which cannot meet approval requirements. Where farms do not want approval or cannot meet approval requirements, the haulier must transport TB reactor animals direct to the slaughterhouse.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK broadly adopts the TB control measures set out by EU Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine. It is understood that the arrangements in the Republic of Ireland are similar.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to compensate farmers who suffer consequential losses as a result of TB infection in their herds following the failure of the reactive component of the randomised badger culling trials.  [141388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have no plans to compensate farmers who suffer consequential losses as a result of TB infection in their herds following the suspension of badger culling in reactive areas of the randomised badger culling trial. The payment of consequential loss to producers falls within the definition of State Aids and cannot therefore be paid without the agreement of the EU Commission.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para10">There has always been an element of risk in participation in the trial, although the majority of farmers might have presumed that culling badgers would only help reduce the risk of TB in their herds. Nevertheless all farmers took part in the trial on a voluntary basis, having had the choice to opt out totally, agree to survey operations only, or to surveying and culling operations, and to change their level of involvement at any time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Pasteurisation is effective in eliminating the risk from <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (the causative organism for bovine TB) in milk. Milk from herds under TB restrictions is permitted to be sold for human consumption after it has been heat treated. Milk hygiene legislation requires that raw milk and raw milk products for direct human consumption are produced from milk from officially TB free herds.

<a name="31208w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Department has provided a significant amount of advice and codes on the health and welfare of livestock. The Defra leaflet, "TB in Cattle&#151;Reducing the Risk" suggests that farmers consider moving to a closed herd system. However, such a system still needs to be combined with other disease prevention measures to reduce risks of disease introduction and spread. Defra has also produced a leaflet "Golden rules for a healthy herd" that gives specific advice on preventative strategies for avoiding introduction of the most important cattle diseases, including TB during restocking.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para11">Defra has also produced a concise list of disease prevention measures, including the need to always know the health status of animals being bought or moved, in the form of a yellow card which was developed with livestock industry representatives and vets. It was sent to all livestock farmers in 2002, and is available on the Defra website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether M. bovis isolates can be characterised to determine its genetic relationship to other isolates by using the technique of DNA fingerprinting; and whether there has been such fingerprinting of TB isolates from cattle and badgers in order to identify epidemiological relationships.  [141396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Spoligotyping is used to determine molecular type for all isolates of the bovine tuberculosis bacillus (M. bovis) obtained from badgers and cattle. Variable Number Tandem Repeats (or VNTR), a technique able to subdivide some spoligotypes, is also used. Generally the different strain types of M. bovis that these techniques identify exhibit distinct and probably longstanding geographical clustering. Within each geographical cluster the same strains tend to be found in badgers and cattle. Even where the same strain has been found in two different species in the same locality, it is difficult to deduce the direction of interspecies transmission, how often it occurs, and how much transmission there is between animals of the same species.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The tuberculin skin test for cattle has been compulsory in Great Britain since 1950. This is the test prescribed by the OIE for international trade, as well as under EU Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Improved diagnosis of TB in cattle is a major objective of Defra's wide-ranging research programme. The current most promising candidate is the gamma interferon test, a laboratory-based blood test that measures the immune response to <i>M. bovis</i> (the causative agent for bovine TB) of T-cells in cattle blood.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para12">This test was officially recognised by the EU in July 2002, but only for use as a supplement to the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Test (SICCT) in TB affected herds. The test is considered more sensitive than the SICCT, but less specific, meaning that it results in a higher probability of false positives. For this reason, the gamma interferon test cannot be used on its own as a screening test for TB for the time being.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para13">In October 2002, Ministers announced the field evaluation of the gamma interferon test, to assess the potential for its use in GB.

<a name="31208w06.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Interference with badger traps laid in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial is variable between operations. It is usually quite geographically localised and repetitive within a culling operational area. Management records indicate that&#151;over 116 culling operations, across 19 trial areas, between December 1998 and 10 October 2003, during which 15,666 traps were sited&#151;there were 8,981 individual occasions where a trap was interfered with, and 1,827 individual occasions when a trap was removed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the current status is of research on vaccines suitable for application to <i>(a)</i> badgers and <i>(b)</i> bovine animals to protect against TB infection; and when she expects commercial vaccines will become available.  [141976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra's extensive bovine TB vaccine research programme is aimed at identifying the most effective vaccine candidates and the most appropriate vaccination programmes to reduce the incidence of bovine TB. Depending on the outcome of this research, it will be necessary to gain approval for the selected vaccine or vaccines to be used in cattle or badgers or other susceptible species.
<P>

<a name="31208w06.html_para14">The current situation is that the progress on research on vaccines is broadly in line with the timeline set out in the Krebs report, published in 1997. This estimated:

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations have been made by her Department to insurance providers and underwriters on the funding of a joint venture to top up compensation paid for TB reactor cattle above the proposed cut to average market value.  [141999]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In developing proposals for a fundamental overhaul of our animal disease compensation arrangements, Defra met with representatives of insurance companies earlier in the year to explore a number of different options. It was concluded that "top-up" insurance schemes for loss of high value animals to notifiable animals diseases is not currently a viable option, as the market is not sufficiently developed. Top-up insurance is not set out as a short-term option for compensation for high-value animals in the current consultation on proposals to rationalise compensation for notifiable animal disease control. Under our proposals animals worth significantly more than the average market value can

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to fund average cull-price for TB-infected animals and reactors with an industry levy on <i>(a)</i> milk and <i>(b)</i> beef.  [142001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government are working on proposals for an animal disease levy, which might include TB. The funds raised would be used to pay for, among other things, the costs of compensation for animals which are compulsorily slaughtered. At the moment the option we favour is a levy on live animals rather than animal products, but no decisions have been taken. We intend to consult on our proposals in the first half of next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w06.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Maintaining a closed herd can eliminate the risk of introducing cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis. The risk of spread of infection from nearby herds and wildlife can be reduced by adopting husbandry and biosecurity measures, as described in the freely available Defra booklet "TB in Cattle&#151;Reducing the Risk".

 This information is as follows:

<P>

<a name="31208w09.html_para0"><i>(a)</i> Seed potato growers entering crops for classification under the Seed Potato Classification Scheme are advised that it is a condition of the acceptance of applications by Defra and the National Assembly for Wales that no liability shall attach to either Department or any of their officers in connection with any inspection carried out, or in respect of certificates and reports which are based on the examination of crops and tubers, or in any other way in connection with the operation of the arrangements for certification and classification. The Seed Potato Classification Scheme facilitates the classification of crops in order to meet the requirements of the Seed Potatoes Regulations 1991 (as amended).
<P>

<a name="31208w09.html_para1">Defra regularly produces publicity material to assist seed potato growers in the identification of pests and diseases. This information is sent to growers and is also available on the Defra web-site.

<a name="31208w09.html_wqn1"><B> Andrew George: </B>

<P>
<a name="31208w09.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to stop the disease of potato ring rot from spreading in Wales.  [141167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As soon as the disease was detected on a routine sample of seed potatoes from the farm in mid Wales, a statutory notice was served under the Plant Health Order 1993 to prevent movement. Three deliveries which had already been made from the farm to customers in England were traced and placed under notice.
<P>

<a name="31208w09.html_para3">All 22 stocks of seed potatoes on the farm have now been tested. Although infection has been found on some samples of one other variety, DNA testing suggests that this is likely to be due to an admixture with the original infected variety at harvest. The other 20 stocks have been found free from the disease. However, none of the seed potatoes from the outbreak farm can be planted.
<P>

<a name="31208w09.html_para4">Five farms in England grew crops this year with a varietal link to the infected stocks. As a precautionary measure these stocks were placed under notice and sampled. No ring rot was found in tests on these samples and the stocks are being released.
<P>

<a name="31208w09.html_para5">There is no reason to believe that infection was present on the affected farm before this year, but as a precautionary measure last year's deliveries of seed are being traced, so crops grown from them can be sampled and tested.
<P>

<a name="31208w09.html_para6">A new publicity leaflet on ring rot has been prepared and will be sent to all potato growers shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her Department's policy on sea angling.  [140463]

<a name="31208w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government recognise sea anglers as parties with an interest in fish stocks, and consult angling interests on a wide range of fisheries management issues to ensure that their views are taken into account. Sea angling is a selective, environmentally friendly and low impact fishing activity. We fully recognise the important contribution that recreational angling and associated activity can make to the coastal economy. To help to quantify this contribution, a Defra-funded study into the commercial value of angling to local economies in England and Wales is currently underway.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w09.html_wqn4"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she will introduce a shellfish licensing scheme.  [141114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A restrictive licensing scheme for shellfish (crabs and lobsters) will take effect from 1 January 2004 for vessels over 10 m and from 1 April 2004 for vessels under 10 m. Shellfish entitlements are being granted to existing fishing vessels which, with their current licences, have taken more than 200 kg of lobsters or 750 kg of crabs in any 12 month period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. The scheme will apply to vessels under 8 m which will account for more than 40 per cent. of the vessels qualifying under the scheme. Anyone wishing to take up shellfishing will need to acquire an appropriate fishing vessel licence carrying a shellfish entitlement from an existing vessel. Licensed fishing vessels without a shellfish entitlement will be permitted to land up to five lobsters and 25 crabs per day.

 On 10 October the Icelandic Government responded to the UK-led demarche of 10 September. On 20 November the UK Ambassador to Iceland delivered a Note Verbale to the Icelandic Government regarding points raised in that response, and in particular their decision to undertake lethal scientific research. The Note Verbale restated the UK Government's opposition to the research, which it considers unjustified and unnecessary, and again called upon the Government of Iceland not to carry out any further lethal research on whale species.

 The Japanese programme of so-called 'scientific' whaling is an ongoing one. The UK Government, in common with those of a majority of IWC members, has regularly criticised the programme as being of little scientific value and urged Japan to end its scientific whaling activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK Government have not specifically commissioned research on the Southern Ocean Sanctuary, but we do receive information from scientists and from the British Antarctic Survey. The UK chaired the Working Group on Reviewing Sanctuaries and Sanctuary Proposals at this year's International Whaling Commission meeting in Berlin. This Working Group evaluated criteria for the Sanctuaries and Sanctuary Proposals. The UK also has delegates on the Steering Group, which is responsible for designing the evaluation process for the Sanctuaries and Sanctuary Proposals. Hence, we have had considerable input into choosing experts and the terms of reference for the review.

<a name="31208w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Afghan National Drug Control Strategy was adopted in May 2003. The objective of the strategy is to reduce opium poppy cultivation by 70 per cent. within five years and to eliminate it in 10 years. The UK has allocated &#163;70 million over three years and posted additional personnel to Afghanistan to assist the Afghan authorities to implement a range of activities coherent with the strategy. Eradicating illicit poppy crop will form an important part of the drug control effort. However an eradication-led approach will not provide a sustainable solution to eliminating the cultivation of opium in Afghanistan and must be supported by other measures to build up law enforcement capacity, promote alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers and improve the effectiveness of Afghanistan's principal drug control institutions.

<a name="31208w11.html_para7">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 2003 survey showed an 8 per cent. increase in cultivation to 80,000 hectares and a 6 per cent. increase in production to 3,600 hectares.

 Afghanistan is the source of 95 per cent. of the heroin exported to the UK. There are no reliable figures for the level of heroin production in Afghanistan. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) does however conduct an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production. It has reported levels of cultivation and production since 2000 as follows:

 Although Colombia does not have its own programme under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP), the Security Sector Reform (SSR) strand of GCPP is used for military assistance projects for Colombia when they meet SSR criteria.

 The Colombian Government did not make any pledges at the London Meeting on International Support on Colombia about specific legislation, but they did pledge to implement recommendations made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR). There are legitimate concerns about the proposal to grant judicial police powers to the Colombian armed forces in the proposed Constitutional Reform Bill 223 of 2003. In July the EU made a demarche to the Colombian Government about this, reiterating the concerns of UNHCHR in Bogota, in particular where proposed articles were incompatible with Colombia's human rights and international humanitarian obligations. We shall continue to urge the Colombian Government to adopt the practice of adjusting all anti-terrorist legislation in line with Colombia's international obligations.

<a name="31208w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We advise UK citizens against all travel to Manipur. This advice is reviewed on a monthly basis, most recently on 24 November 2003. A number of militant and criminal groups operate in the state; and whilst foreigners are not generally targets of violence, attacks can be indiscriminate. For example a German aid worker was kidnapped by one group earlier this year close to the capital Imphal. We currently see no grounds for changing the travel advice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much the pilot scheme developed by the Energy Services Working Group to scrap switching rules for energy supply is estimated to cost in each of the next five years.  [142143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There are no costs to the Government, apart from the administrative costs relating to evaluation of the pilots. The trial relaxation of the 28-day rule for energy service contracts enables energy companies, if they wish, to market energy service packages to their customers as an alternative to a supply contract only. We expect this to be profitable for companies to do, while, at the same time, consumers will benefit from reduced energy bills as a result of the energy efficiency investments that companies make in their homes.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate she has made of the effect on energy efficiency of the pilot scheme developed by the Energy Services Working Group to scrap switching rules for energy supply in each of the next five years.  [142144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government expect that energy services contracts will deliver a reduction of at least 10&#150;15 per cent. in energy use in households that sign up to them. The actual reduction in a household will depend on the energy efficiency measures that are carried out as part of an energy services contract. In a typical 1960&#150;70s semi-detached house heated by gas, an insulation package consisting of cavity wall insulation, topping up the loft insulation and improved insulation on the water tank could save over &#163;130 per annum compared to previous running costs.
<P>

<a name="31208w14.html_para10">As part of the trial relaxation of the 28-day rule, energy companies will be able to offer energy service contracts to up to 4 per cent. of their customers or 50,000 customers whichever is the larger. In total, nationally, up to one million households could benefit.

 MAN Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS) are rated under both category ML4a and category ML4b. Of course there is other equipment also rated under these categories. To carry out a search of how many licences were approved and refused for export since 1997 would require a search first by category, bringing up in all probability thousands of goods lines, followed by a search, both of computer records and a manual search, of each of those goods lines, to determine whether the goods listed under the relevant category contained any equipment for MANPADS.

 The process for obtaining approval for the development of an offshore wind farm falls into two main stages.

<a name="31208w16.html_para10">First developers need to obtain a site lease from the Crown Estate. In July 2003, the Crown Estate invited bids for seabed leases for offshore wind in three strategic areas; Thames Estuary, Greater Wash and the North West. The criteria being used to assess bids include the financial standing and experience of the applicant, environmental aspects of the proposed site location and the impact on other marine users, and the coherence of the business development plan.
<P>

<a name="31208w16.html_para11">Second developers must obtain statutory consents including the Electricity Act 1989 (Section 36) and Coast Protection Act 1949 (Section 34) or the Transport and Works Act 1992. In both cases, a licence under Section 5 of the Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) 1985 is needed. Developers are required to submit environmental impact assessments to support their applications, which are considered on a case by case basis.
<P>

<a name="31208w16.html_para12">In assessing whether consent will be granted, departments will take into account the benefits the project will bring in meeting the Government's renewable energy and environmental targets, as well as the impact of the development on the environment, and the other users of the sea, including the fishing and navigation interests.

 Statistics on the export of horses and ponies to Great Britain are not collected as these animals move freely without any form of certification being required. The European Commission contracts a private company, Eurokom, to collect information on movements of live animals between Member States. They have supplied the following figures for the export of horses from Northern Ireland to European countries other than France and the Republic of Ireland.

 The scope of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is clearly restricted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. However, the UK raised the issue of the possible malevolent use of high-level radioactive sources by terrorists in its Statement to the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the NPT 2005 Review Conference on 6 May 2003.

 It is not yet clear when the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigation will conclude: some evidence has yet to be collected and some witnesses have still to be interviewed. A briefing will be offered to Sergeant Roberts' widow as soon as is practicable once the SIB's findings are known.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence by what means the policy for purchasing timber and timber products of <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> each of its agencies ensures that they are obtained from legal and sustainable sources.  [141345]<P>

<P>
<a name="31208w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has addressed issues about timber through the introduction of a Defence Contract Condition (DEFCON Number 691) in August 2002. This Contract Condition has three main aims: to inform contractors of the Government policy to procure timber and products containing wood from

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what costs he estimates will be incurred by the proposed development of a joint NATO and European amphibious capability;  [142284]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no proposal to develop a joint NATO and European amphibious capability, hence no additional costs are anticipated. Under the five-nation European Amphibious Initiative the amphibious forces of United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy work together on interoperability and doctrine, and co-ordinate training (which may be with NATO). National amphibious forces are used for NATO or EU crisis management operations only on the decision of the nations concerned. In the case of the UK/Netherlands Amphibious Force, the agreement of both countries is required. There are no plans for this to change.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps are being taken to ensure that non-British naval ships docked within United Kingdom waters are not <i>(a)</i> posing environmental problems and <i>(b)</i> a target for potential terrorist activities.  [142281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Foreign warships visiting ports within the UK have to comply fully with the relevant environmental legislation, including EC directives, which are no different for visiting Royal Navy vessels. Comprehensive arrangements are put in place for the routine disposal of all forms of waste and for rapid response to any leak or spill. Foreign nuclear-powered warships are required to produce assurances concerning reactor safety, aspects of design, crew training and operating procedures, and that they will meet their environmental responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="31208w21.html_para0">Force protection for visiting warships is provided by a combination of on-board and external security measures, the former being the responsibility of the visiting nation while the latter rests with the UK as host. Where the visit takes place outside a Naval Base, the external security measures fall under the responsibility of the relevant Police Authority. For visits to HM Naval Bases, the Naval Base Commander has overall responsibility for security arrangements, which are kept under constant review. In each case, a security assessment is undertaken in close consultation with the visiting nation to identify which measures need to be put in place commensurate with any perceived threat. These measures can vary considerably depending on the nature of the visit and the threat assessment at any given time.

<P>
<a name="31208w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The new benchmarking site was a joint development between the DfES, Ofsted and the Audit Commission building on the already successful Audit Commission site. It allows, for the first time, for all maintained schools in England to be able to compare and contrast their income and expenditure with other similar schools in a consistent way. The ability to benchmark financial information allows schools to identify areas in which savings in school budgets can be made that can then be reinvested into further improvements or redistributed to areas of greatest educational need. The website will also allow schools and LEAs to identify ways in which to improve performance in education at minimal additional cost.
<P>

<a name="31208w21.html_para1">The cost of designing and building the newly completed Schools Financial Benchmarking website was approximately &#163;220,000. The cost to maintain the website will be just over &#163;10,000 per year. Other costs may be incurred if the application is to be developed further as a result of user feedback.

A recent survey of Connexions One-Stop-Shops and Access Points found that over half were open in the evenings or at weekends and a third were linked to the Connexions Direct telephone helpline providing out of hours support to young people. As more One-Stop-Shops and Access Points are opened and Connexions Direct is rolled out nationally there will be further improvements in the availability of services in the evenings and at weekends.

 The Government encourage the use of family mediation as an alternative to court proceedings in appropriate cases. Mediation can be particularly beneficial in resolving disputes over child contact. Public funding for family mediation is now available throughout England and Wales through the Community Legal Service.
<P>

<a name="31208w22.html_para2">Courts can allow cases to be adjourned so that parties can attempt to resolve the dispute by using family mediation. As part of its project to reduce the proportion of cases resolved by resort to the courts the Government have arranged a pilot whereby selected courts send out information about family mediation to parties in various family proceedings, including child contact disputes.
<P>

<a name="31208w22.html_para3">The Government are also testing the provision of a Family Advice and Information Service (FAInS) which will provide advice for people with family difficulties and will facilitate referrals to other appropriate agencies, including family mediation services.

 Higher education is undoubtedly a good investment for the average graduate. Individuals with higher education qualifications earn on average around 50 per cent. more than those without. Separate analysis of the benefits of higher education estimates that first degree graduates earn on average around &#163;120,000 more&#151;in present value terms&#151;over their working lives than those with two or more A-levels <sup>1</sup> . This estimate is technically different from the 50 per cent. graduate premium because it controls for background factors that affect earnings, independently of the qualification itself.
<P>

<a name="31208w23.html_para0">No specific estimates have been made of the extra lifetime earnings of graduates by degree subject, profession or gender. However, other studies suggest that there will inevitably be some variation in the lifetime differential because graduate earnings are influenced by a number of factors, including subject studied and occupational choices, which in turn may differ by gender.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> <sup>1</sup>  The 50 per cent. graduate earnings premium is derived by dividing the raw average earnings of those with first or sub-degrees by the average earnings of non-graduates. The &#163;120,000 differential is derived by constructing a lifetime earnings stream for first degree graduates and comparing it against the lifetime earnings of A-level holders. Both earnings streams are discounted, adjusted for real earnings growth and other factors affecting earnings, other than the qualification itself. The difference between the two earnings streams sums to &#163;120,000.</FONT></UL>

 Figures at constituency level are not currently available. However, the available information on participation rates by local authority and region shows the proportion of 18-year-olds entering full-time undergraduate courses in the UK via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), and is given in the table. Comparable figures for the years prior to 1994 are not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="31208w23.html_para4">It should be noted that the proportions in the table are based only on the number of 18-year-olds entering full-time HE. This is a different definition to the Department's main measures of HE participation: the Age Participation Index (API), which measures the proportion of UK domiciled students who enter full-time HE by the age of 20, and the Initial Entry Rate (IER) which measures the proportion of 17&#150;30 year old English domiciled first time entrants to full or part-time HE. Neither the API nor the IER are calculated for each LEA, because of the lack of detailed data at local authority level.

In recent research commissioned by the Department for Constitutional Affairs in three County Courts from year 2000 files, there were indications that in 22 per cent. of the cases reviewed, physical or emotional abuse towards a family member was indicated. A more specific reference to child sexual abuse appeared in 6 per cent. of cases, though there may be overlap between the two categories.

 We have received few recent representations about school funding issues in North Yorkshire and the City of York.

Further information about funding for next year was announced on 19 November as part of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement. In 2004&#150;05 all authorities will see an increase in their School Formula Spending Share of at least 5 per cent. per pupil: North Yorkshire's increase is 6 per cent. and the City of York's is 6.8 per cent.

 On 29 October my right hon. Friend announced proposals to restore stability to school funding. Among the package of measures, we are ensuring that for 2004&#150;05 all schools will see a guaranteed minimum increase in their per pupil budget amounting to 4 per cent. per pupil where pupil numbers remain the same. In addition, we have ensured that schools will receive an increase in the amounts of Standards Fund, School Standards Grant and funding from the LSC for sixth forms in line with the minimum guarantee.
<P>

<a name="31208w24.html_para6">We are increasing the School Formula Spending Share by a minimum of 5 per cent. per pupil&#151;North Yorkshire's increase is 6 per cent.

Friend will be prepared to consider bringing forward grant payments from my Department, so that the LEA will have funds available in 2004&#150;05 for this purpose, with the expectation of a consequential reduction to what they will receive in future years. The maximum amount that North Yorkshire might be able to bring forward in this way is would be &#163;604,000.

<a name="31208w26.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the reasons are for the increase in interest rates on student loans from 1.3 per cent. to 3.1 per cent.; and what the criteria are for calculating the interest rates applied to student loans.  [142291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w26.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Student loans are not commercial loans. The Government subsidises the actual cost of interest on the loans. However, to make sure that all borrowers pay back the same amount that they borrowed in real terms, the Government uprate the value of what is owed in line with the general rate of inflation. This is done by using the Retail Prices Index (RPI) and fixing the interest charged to that rate. The interest rate on student loans is set every year from 1 September and is based on the RPI for the financial year ending the previous March. For last year this was 1.3 per cent. and for this year it is 3.1 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w26.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The level of loan a student accrues as an undergraduate will depend on the level of fee charged by the university they choose to attend, how much loan they take out to cover that fee, and how much maintenance loan they take out. The time taken to repay that loan will depend not only on the threshold above which repayment commences, but also on the graduate's salary in the years following graduation, and whether they experience any periods during which their earnings drop below the threshold, for example because of career breaks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to introduce value added data into secondary school performance tables for England which take account of external influences on performance, with particular reference to pupils' economic, social and cultural backgrounds.  [141809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The publication in performance tables last year of value added measures based on the prior attainment of each pupil&#151;by far the most important factor in explaining pupil performance&#151;was a ground breaking step forward. It is largely thanks to that publication that value added is now generally understood by the wider educational establishment and is becoming familiar to parents. Now that those foundations have been laid, we can begin to explore more sophisticated systems of adding context to the national test and examination results by exploiting the wealth of pupil level data that are becoming available. Other contextual factors account for only a small further element, and taking them into account would make our approach to value added far more complicated. We therefore need to balance all of these considerations before deciding on the way forward for performance tables. In the meantime, we provide LEAs and schools with a wealth of benchmarking material which allows them to assess their performance and that of their pupils using tools such as the Pupil Achievement Tracker.

<a name="31208w27.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills contributes in a number of ways to reducing suicide and deliberate self-harm among young people. This involves minimising so far as possible the risk factors that may lead to suicide or self-harm. We are doing this by ensuring that all children and young people have the support and services they need, and have a structured programme of learning opportunities through which they can develop self-awareness and confidence needed for life.
<P>

<a name="31208w27.html_para0">We also seek to raise awareness of these issues. In June 2001 the Department published guidance "Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings". The guidance and the summary provide useful tools for local education authorities, schools and others who are striving to ensure that the mental health needs of children are met. The guidance includes specific advice on useful approaches to addressing the needs of children and young people who show deliberate self harm or suicidal behaviour. We also encouraged schools to celebrate World Mental Health Day on 10 October.
<P>

<a name="31208w27.html_para1">Across England, children with behavioural problems, learning difficulties and those exhibiting antisocial behaviour are receiving the greatest proportion of investment from the Children's Fund. This investment underpins the priority being given to mental health and well-being and to the gains to be made in improving self-esteem and consequentially performance at school. 21 per cent. of Children's Fund services which provided information during April-June 2003 explicitly target children with mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="31208w27.html_para2">The Government's proposals in the Children Bill and the other non-legislative measures in the Green Paper "Every Child Matters" will help us build on the support for young people we have already put in place through Sure Start, full service extended schools, Child and adolescent mental health services, the Connexions Service and the PSHE curriculum and anti-bullying measures in schools. Children's Trusts will provide the means to deliver of integrated, multi-agency services to all children and young people in an area. This will enable the provision of high-quality preventive measures and early interventions tailored to help individual children who may already be considering suicide or engaging in self-harm.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w27.html_wqn2"><B> Charles Hendry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidance is issued through the Connexions service to <i>(a)</i> parents, <i>(b)</i> young people, <i>(c)</i> schools and <i>(d)</i> organisations working with young people on (i) suicide and (ii) deliberate self-harm in young people.  [140656]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w27.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Connexions service does not issue specific guidance on these subjects. Suicide and deliberate self-harm are very serious issues requiring specialist advice and support. Where young people present with such issues or give cause for concern or where parents, schools or other organisations approach Connexions for guidance. Connexions will take responsibility for ensuring that they are quickly and efficiently linked up with specialist organisations who offer the necessary support and guidance. In all cases, robust child protection policies and procedures will be adhered to.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w27.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Connexions Personal Advisers are trained in an awareness of mental heath issues and in identifying young people who demonstrate behaviour which could indicate mental health disorders but they are not experts in mental health matters. Connexions Personal Advisers can access a range of specialist services for young people. They have links with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and other services that provide the specialist help on mental health problems.

 The majority of the funding for alcohol treatment is spent via the general budgets of primary care trusts and local social service departments, consistent with provision being determined following a local consideration of need. Latest estimates indicate that around &#163;95 million is spent each year on treatment in England, and that most of this funding is provided by the Government.

<a name="31208w27.html_para4">Increases in the workload have meant additional work for all grades of ambulance staff. Clinical and technological advances have extended the nature and range of pre-hospital interventions available. Front line ambulance staff&#151;both technician and paramedic&#151;have undergone further training and developed additional treatment skills leading to higher standards of patient care.
<P>

<a name="31208w27.html_para5">This has included expanding the role of paramedics to provide more out of hospital care through the administering of clot busting drugs and in some areas being based in general practitioner surgeries. New ways of working have seen ambulance services introducing community/first responder schemes in a number of areas across the country.

 The anti-TNF drug, Remicade (Infliximab), is licensed for ankylosing spondylitis for patients who have not responded adequately to conventional drugs. It is given by injection into a vein (intravenously) every four to eight weeks.
<P>

<a name="31208w27.html_para7">Infliximab for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis was referred to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in October 2003. Until NICE publishes its guidance on treatments for ankylosing spondylitis, national health service bodies are expected to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the technology first became available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence. Funding for such treatments should not be withheld simply because of an absence of guidance from NICE. The anticipated date for publication of the NICE guidance is due on its website at www.nice.org.uk shortly.
<P>

<a name="31208w27.html_para8">Information is not collected centrally on the number of patients who benefit or who might benefit from anti-TNF treatment. However, the table shows figures which relate to hospital admissions.

<i>[holding answer 4 December 2003]:</i> Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for those women who were not urgently referred with breast conditions and who were later diagnosed with cancer. The two week waiting time standard has been a success with over 98 per cent. of women with suspected breast cancer now seeing a specialist with two weeks of urgent referral. It is vital that general practitioners (GPs) refer suspected breast cancer appropriately and we have issued GP cancer referral guidelines to assist GPs in determining those patients who need to see a specialist urgently within two weeks.
<P>

<a name="31208w28.html_para1">However, the two week waiting time standard should not be seen in isolation but as part of the Government's wider programme for improving and modernising cancer services. We are making significant extra investment in cancer services (an extra &#163;570 million a year in 2003&#150;04); the biggest ever single cash investment in cancer equipment; extending breast cancer screening, ensuring the provision of additional doctors and nurses working in new ways, and modernisation of care provision through the cancer services collaborative.
<P>

<a name="31208w28.html_para2">The maximum waiting time standard of one month from diagnosis to first treatment, from December 2001, also applies to those women who were routinely referred to ensure they receive speedy treatment following diagnosis.

<a name="31208w30.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to reduce the number of epilepsy sufferers estimated to be misdiagnosed or inappropriately treated following referral to an epilepsy clinic.  [141877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w30.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 4 December 2003]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave him on 19 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1111W. We expect several related policies to help reduce the number of people who may be misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated following referral to an epilepsy clinic.
<P>

<a name="31208w30.html_para0">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has already made its report of the "National Clinical Audit of Epilepsy Related Death" available to local national health service clinicians and organisations to help improve the management of epilepsy and epilepsy-related death. The NICE clinical guideline for the diagnosis, management and treatment is planned for publication next year and will be available to the NHS to support improvements in services. Additionally, implementation of the clinical quality standards of the new general medical services contract from next April will help improve the management of epilepsy in primary care.
<P>

 The proposed Directive on the quality and safety of human tissues and cells, will, if adopted, set common standards covering donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage and distribution. It will be a legal requirement for all establishments undertaking activities within the scope of the Directive to be inspected and accredited by a designated body in each member state. However, the precise standards of quality and safety required for accreditation have yet to be developed. The Directive will provide for an expert committee to develop detailed annexes setting out the requirements.

Our "sex lottery'" campaign is designed to improve awareness of STIs and how to avoid them. The Department has invested over &#163;35 million in the past two years in specialist genito-urinary medicine clinics, including an additional &#163;15 million just announced for capital investment. This funding will increase capacity in services and reduce waiting times, thereby helping primary care trusts to offer quicker access to diagnosis and treatment. We are also rolling out a chlamydia screening programme and investing &#163;8 million to convert laboratories in every area to a superior and more reliable test for chlamydia.

 As part of the agreement with trades unions earlier this year on the new national health service pay system, "Agenda for Change", NHS speech and language therapists, like other health service workers, will receive a minimum 10 per cent. increase in basic pay over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. It is too early to assess in more detail the impact of "Agenda for Change" on speech and language therapists' pay levels. The impact will vary between posts depending on a range of factors, including the national job profile to which the particular post matches or&#151;where there is no match with a national profile&#151;the results of local job evaluation. The national job profiles for speech and language therapists have only recently been agreed with the trade unions.

<a name="31208w32.html_para0">"Agenda for Change" will provide a framework for pay and career progression that is fair, consistent and transparent across all groups of NHS staff. It provides greater opportunities to recognise and reward NHS staff who take on extra responsibilities and use increased knowledge and skills in their work. It provides greater scope to create new roles that enable staff to deliver more patient-centred care.

 The National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England recognises that the factors associated with suicides are many and varied. This is why the strategy sets out a broad approach, involving a wide range of organisations and individuals in the public, private and voluntary sectors. The strategy also identifies some groups that are at high risk of suicide and has targeted them for specific action, although the winter months of December and January are not singled out for special attention. Whatever the causes of suicide, and we do not fully understand them all, it is a matter of great concern to the Government and to those delivering mental health services. Improving mental health services is a priority.

<a name="31208w32.html_para3">In 2002&#150;03, the allocation of the LDDF capital was handled centrally. Learning disability partnership boards were invited to submit bids as part of their joint investment plans. &#163;16.7 million of the &#163;20 million available was allocated to support the development priorities for capital investment in the learning disability White Paper "Valuing People". It was not possible to spend the full amount because of the long lead in time on capital projects and the remaining &#163;3.3 million was therefore used on other centrally funded projects.
<P>

<a name="31208w32.html_para4">In accordance with our policy of decentralisation, it was decided to simplify the procedure for 2003&#150;04 and enable decisions about the use of the money to be taken as closely as possible to the point of spending. The &#163;20 million per annum LDDF capital was therefore distributed to SHAs as part of their three-year strategic capital allocations. This enabled us to issue their funds to them more quickly. Given the long lead in for many capital schemes, making three-year allocations should also enable the SHAs to make better use of the money. SHAs were informed about the change of procedure through the Chief Executive's Bulletin and a more detailed note setting out the priorities for use of the fund was included on the Department's web site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w34.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Since pension provision by employers is voluntary, the levels of contributions are a matter for agreement between pension scheme trustees and sponsoring employers.
<P>

<a name="31208w34.html_para6">Under the new scheme-specific funding regime, which is intended to replace the Minimum Funding Requirement, trustees and sponsoring employers will be required to develop and agree, with the scheme actuary's advice, the funding principles for their scheme&#151;including a determination of whether the level of contributions is sufficient to meet a scheme's long-term pension commitments.
<P>

<a name="31208w34.html_para7">The new proposed, simpler tax regime for approved pension schemes (set out in the document "Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice and flexibility for all" (December 2002)) would abolish the rules requiring approved occupational pension schemes to run off their surplus funds (for example by agreeing contributions holidays) or lose their full tax-exempt status. In addition, the document "Action on Occupational Pensions" announced that pension funds will be able to make payments to employers from an actuarial surplus only where the scheme is funded above a level sufficient to secure full buy-out of scheme liabilities".

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many births to girls conceiving under the age of 16 there were in each local authority in Wales in each of the past 20 years, as expressed as a percentage of the total population of girls under 16 in each local authority area.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Population figures by local authority prior to 1991 are not available by single year of age. It is therefore not possible to provide percentage calculations for under 16s for this period.</FONT></UL>

As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking when the results of the 2001 Census at parish level will be published. (142330)
<BR>
The results of the 2001 Census for parishes in England and communities in Wales form part of the series of reports to Parliament. Although the remaining release timetable is currently under review, it is planned to release the parish results in March 2004.
<BR>
Results for many parishes can already be derived using the results for small areas published in August-September 2003, together with information also available from the Office for National Statistics on how these small areas relate to parishes.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates in the following table are produced from the Office for National Statistics' analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income" published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003 at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,500 households in the UK and sample sizes are only sufficient to give approximate estimates. In particular, results for the lowest quintile are less reliable than for others because of greater variability. The Family Resources Survey would have been an alternative source with a larger sample size, but the taxes and benefits analysis has been used for consistency with answers to other recent parliamentary questions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The table shows, from 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02, the net council tax paid by all households in Great Britain as a percentage of gross income and for each income quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Council tax is not paid in Northern Ireland. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and discounts. The table also shows the boundaries between equivalised disposable income quintiles for GB. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of those households are estimated to lie.</FONT></UL>

 UK criminality is becoming ever more sophisticated and organised. To meet these threats Customs need to change tactics and respond by operating more flexibly and organising and targeting their law enforcement activity to respond to the greatest risks.
<P>

<a name="31208w36.html_para5">The activities carried out by Customs staff based in Shoreham are no longer concentrated in and around the locality. More often the operational teams will be working together with colleagues from larger principal offices dealing with criminals who operate on a UK-wide scale. Customs have therefore outlined proposals to consider bringing together posts from Shoreham with other Law Enforcement staff in larger centralised locations by 2006.
<P>

<a name="31208w36.html_para6">I am informed that discussions with local staff affected by these proposals and with the departmental trade union will take place before any final decisions are taken.

<P>
<a name="31208w37.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government believe it is vital that the EU puts development assistance to the most effective use and maintains flexibility in the budget to meet new international challenges such as Iraq. Research evidence strongly suggests that development assistance is most effective when focused on the poorest regions that want to reform, and on poverty reduction programmes. In addition, the ED, through its member states, is committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goals, placing poverty reduction at the heart of the Union's development objectives.
<P>

<a name="31208w37.html_para0">However, the proportion of EU assistance spent on poverty reduction is still only around 50 per cent. (provisional figure for 2002). A substantial shift in favour of poorer regions, poverty programmes and quality is

called for. To support this my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, presented at ECOFIN in May an action plan, designed to improve the effectiveness of EU development assistance, particularly in terms of poverty reduction and meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The action plan covers the remainder of the current Financial Perspective and seeks to ensure that reform is institutionalised after 2006.
<P>

<a name="31208w37.html_para1">The action plan builds on the Commission's on-going reforms and has been well received by Finance Ministers and by the Commission. Some elements of it are already being implemented, albeit at the early stages. However, it will take time to bear fruit: the Government does not expect significant changes in the allocation of EU development assistance before 2007, when most assistance programmes are due for renewal. The Government will be working in ECOFIN and the General Affairs and External Relations Council, to pursue implementation of the plan.

 HM Treasury uses a variety of methods to engage small businesses in consultation exercises.

 In financial terms, we estimate that the amount of deposit currently wrongly withheld from tenants (which they would receive under a compulsory deposit protection scheme) is &#163;20.1 million per year.

: The current law already provides property and landowners with the right to take legal action against trespassers where appropriate. Landowners whose property boundary has been breached by an unlawful visitor may seek an injunction to restrain the continuation of the trespass. The landowner may also

To ask the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many persons were interviewed for the position of Chair of the Electoral Commission when it was first established.  [141901]<P>

<P>
<a name="31208w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 There was not a separate application process for the position of Chair of the Electoral Commission. An open competition was held and applicants were asked to indicate if they wished to be considered for Chair and/or as a member. As a result of this process 16 people were invited to attend an interview, and the selection panel determined which, of those that had shown an interest in the position, should get the job of Chair.

To ask the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many and what value of court-imposed fines were defaulted on in <i>(a)</i> each London borough and <i>(b)</i> England in each year since 1997.  [140857]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2003]:</i> Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates' courts and the Crown Court. Data on the number of court imposed fines are not collected at present. Information on the value of fines is available only from 1999&#150;2000 when a new data collection procedure was implemented. The debt collected includes not only fines, but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not yet possible to separate out fines only from the total so the figures provided in the following table include all the elements above. The data available covers Greater London only as separate data are not available for each London borough. Also, separate data are not available for England only, so information provided is for England and Wales.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what proportion of fines imposed have been collected by courts in each county in each of the last five years.  [141063]<P>

<P>
<a name="31208w41.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Information on the proportion of fines imposed that have been collected is not available for each county. The information provided is for the 42 Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) in England and Wales. A new data collection procedure was implemented in 1999&#150;2000 and comparable figures are therefore only available from that period.

<a name="31208w41.html_para1">In addition, earlier this year, I agreed to a revision of the fine enforcement payment rate target so that it provides a far clearer focus for the performance of those involved in this vitally important area.

Nevertheless, we now have a much more robust baseline data on performance and early signs are encouraging.

no plans to provide training in shorthand. Neither are there plans to introduce formal examinations for the judiciary. An appraisal system is, however, already in place for a number of part-time judicial post-holders.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps his Department is taking to ensure the impartiality of juries.  [142085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31208w42.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Juries play a vital role in the criminal justice system. The Government are committed to ensuring that jurors are impartial; that the risk of jury tampering is minimised; and that jury panels are representative of their community.
<P>

<a name="31208w42.html_para0">There are a variety of safeguards in place to ensure that juries try cases fairly, impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented at trial (and only in accordance with that evidence). For example, jurors are randomly selected; they are told (in jury leaflets and videos shown on arrival at court) that they must disclose any connection with the people involved in the trial and tell court officials if anyone tries to influence them in their decision. This last point is being reinforced by the introduction of posters in all Crown Courts advising jurors they are to report any attempts made on them to influence their decisions.
<P>

<a name="31208w42.html_para1">Jurors are also required to swear an oath, the message of which is reinforced by directions from the trial judge at the end of the trial. It is also common practice for the judge, at the outset of the trial, to inform jurors that they can at any time, including during deliberations, raise questions or concerns with him or her.
<P>

<a name="31208w42.html_para2">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 contains measures which will provide for a trial to be conducted without a jury where there is evidence of a real and present danger of jury tampering, or continued without a jury where the jury has been discharged because of jury tampering.
