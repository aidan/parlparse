<a name="70516w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Olner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will now declare Zaire to be a country in which there has been a fundamental change of circumstances under the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996. [628]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70516w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In view of the current situation in Zaire, I have decided to declare that that country has undergone such a fundamental change in circumstances that I would not normally order the return of a person to that country for the time being. The effect is that a Zairean national who applies for asylum other than on arrival, within three months of this declaration being made, becomes eligible to claim social security benefits while their application is considered by my Department.

<a name="70516w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 In their shadow year, authorities have no source of funding other than the resources made available to them through the Local Government Reorganisation Costs Scheme. Under the scheme for 1997-98 I have decided to allocate an initial amount of &#163;1,000,000 to each of the 4 shadow authorities recently elected for: Hertfordshire, Worcestershire, Malvern Hills and Medway Towns. Each shadow authority will be invited to submit a formal bid for costs at the mid year stage of the scheme in the autumn and I expect to make further awards at that stage.
