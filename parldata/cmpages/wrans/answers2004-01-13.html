To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking following the meeting on 6 January between her Department's Ministers and industry and other representatives to ensure compatibility of chemicals used in agriculture and horticulture with the regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); what consultation has taken place with farming organisations; and if she will make a statement.  [147177]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 To ensure compatibility of regulation, the REACH proposal allows for certain substances to be exempt or considered as automatically registered where environmental or human health protection is already adequately covered by existing regimes such as for pesticides, biocides and veterinary medicines. Discussions have therefore focused on those industry sectors and uses most likely to be affected by the proposals, such as manufacturers of industrial chemicals, and we have not been approached by farming organisations to discuss REACH.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para0">We will shortly issue a public consultation paper, which will offer all interested parties, including farming organisations, a further opportunity to provide us with their views. There are also plans to hold a stakeholder conference during the consultation period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which Council of Ministers formation her Department has called on to lead the debate on the forthcoming EU chemical regulation.  [147230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Given the wide-ranging nature of the forthcoming EU chemical regulation, the Government have always considered it essential that the expertise of both the Competitiveness Council and the Environment Council would be needed in coming to decisions on the regulation on registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para1">Following the decision of the Italian presidency to ask the Competitiveness Council to lead this debate, we welcome the formation of an ad-hoc working group between the two as a way to enable this wide input to detailed policy discussions. Such an approach is essential if we are to make good progress with this long awaited legislation. I recently visited Brussels to discuss the issues with parliamentarians and the Environment Commission's team and in the UK Ministers at Defra and DTI are working closely with each other and with

<P>
<a name="40113w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency is currently determining a permit application under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 from SembCorp Utilities Teesside Limited who operate the Teesside power station. The company plans to burn tallow that is currently held in storage as a result of the Over Thirty Month (Slaughter) Scheme (OTMS).
<P>

<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para6">As required by the Regulations, the Agency sent a copy of the operator's application to the local Primary Care Trust. The Agency has received a response on their behalf by the Tees Local Health Protection Unit. The response stated that the information from the application had been considered, together with additional information provided in a report by the European Commission's Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) entitled "The Safety of Tallow Obtained from Ruminant Slaughter By-products" and a "Risk Assessment for the Transport and Combustion of OTMS Tallow" by Det Norske Veritas Limited (DNV).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w01.html_wqn6"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason pesticides still hold provisional approval after five years; what the longest period is for which a pesticide has held provisional approval; and what she estimates the total tonnage used in the UK of pesticides provisionally approved in each category to be in the most recent year for which figures are available.  [145176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w01.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 All pesticides must meet a minimum standard of safety and efficacy before any approval is given, provisional or otherwise. Provisional approvals are given in order for confirmatory data to be provided for example in areas such as efficacy. The precise requirements and time allowed for the generation of those data vary depending on individual products.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para10">The product that has held provisional approval status for the longest time was first given that status in 1988. Safe use of the product was established, but confirmatory efficacy data were required for full approval. Consequently, a series of different provisional approvals were issued in response to separate applications for approval concerning changes to the product label and its intended uses.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para11">The most recent estimates of the total tonnage of all provisionally approved pesticides used in the UK (in 2002) are as follows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) whether local authorities will be fully compensated for costs incurred under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive;  [146980]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether she intends that manufacturers and retailers of electrical goods should contribute to costs incurred by local authorities under the Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment Directive;  [146981]
<P>
(3) what estimate she has made of the cost to local authorities of complying with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive in relation to <i>(a)</i> start-up costs, <i>(b)</i> storage costs, <i>(c)</i> collection costs and <i>(d)</i> disposal costs.  [146982]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para12">The implications of the EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) for local authorities, manufacturers, retailers and others are set out in a consultation paper which the Government published on 25 November 2003. This is available at or may be downloaded from the Department's website at http://www.dti.gov.uk/sustainability/weee/index.htm. Copies are available in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para13">This consultation paper invites views on the Government's preferred approach to implementing the Directive. It includes proposals for implementation of the Directive's provisions on producer responsibility and retailer take-back.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para14">The WEEE Directive places no obligations on local authorities. The Government have made it clear that there will be no new unfinanced burdens on local authorities as a result of the Directive. However, the Government aims to encourage increased separate collection of WEEE in line with the Directive's objectives and, in this context, it makes sense to build on existing collection activity at civic amenity sites. The Government wishes to encourage local authorities to consider upgrading and/or introducing WEEE collection facilities at their amenity sites. It is proposed that money will be made available, via a fund, into which local authorities may bid to finance improved or greater separate collection of WEEE at their civic amenity sites.
<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para15">The consultation suggests that this fund would be provided through a retailer take-back compliance scheme. The Government propose that the retailer scheme should provide funding initially of at least &#163;5 million for civic amenity site upgrades in each of the five financial years between 2005&#150;10, with an interim review in 2008, when the Directive is expected to be revised. It is expected that most of the early expenditure would relate to capital costs and any initial operating costs.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2004 : Column 631W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40113w01.html_para16">The Government have included in its consultation package a report by consultants Network Recycling on the scope for upgrading and expanding WEEE collection at civic amenity sites around the UK. In summary, this report indicates that over half of civic amenity sites currently collect some WEEE and that there is significant scope for expanding this on the basis of site space available. It suggests that the baseline costs of such upgrades are in the region of &#163;6-&#163;12 million, depending on the approach taken; and that on-going staffing and training costs could be in the region of &#163;4&#150;&#163;9 million per annum.

 Consumer protection should take account of the requirement that those working in the financial services industry are capable of properly performing the work they undertake at all levels, and that consumers should thereby have confidence in the competence of financial advisers.
<P>

<a name="40113w02.html_para0">The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 charges the Financial Services Authority (FSA) with securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers. Vetting by the FSA aims to allow only those firms and individuals satisfying the necessary criteria (including competence) to engage in regulated activity.

<a name="40113w02.html_para2">The FSA works closely with both the industry and consumers, and keeps training and competence requirements under review. It carried out a significant review of the qualification regime for financial services in November 2002. In particular the FSA proposed in Consultation Paper 194 (CP194) that the training arrangements should be simplified and competence assessed by using examinations that are 'appropriate' rather than a published list of FSA 'approved' examinations. This proposal gives firms greater flexibility, because they will be able to choose an examination that is appropriate in their circumstances.

 There are a number of different routes into careers and relevant university courses in environmental engineering. Young people choosing this area will therefore benefit from the Government's commitment to increase opportunities to study or train in a variety of subjects in both colleges and Modern Apprenticeships. A range of academic and vocational subjects, together with Modern Apprenticeship frameworks, are available in the areas of engineering, science, construction and the environment. The relevant sector bodies for this area LANTRA covering land based industries and SEMTA covering engineering are working with employers in their sectors to promote these careers to young people and with the Learning and Skills Council expand the range of opportunities available.

 Information on the costs and benefits associated with the proposal in the Higher Education Bill to allow universities to set their own tuition fees is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment, published on 8 January 2004, alongside the Bill. The Regulatory Impact Assessment illustrates the income from additional fees in different scenarios. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the costs vary greatly according to the decisions that higher education institutions take, and they cannot be estimated precisely at this stage.

 We are investing nearly &#163;470 million over this and the next two years in measures to improve behaviour and attendance in schools. These include training for school staff in managing pupil behaviour and preventing violence. We have also made it clear that head teachers may permanently exclude pupils responsible for violence. New legislation in the Anti-Social Behaviour Act will enable local education authorities to apply for court-imposed Parenting Orders for parents whose children have been excluded from school for serious misbehaviour. And we have issued "A legal toolkit for schools", which identifies legal remedies available when school staff experience problems with violent parents. Some of these are also available when dealing with violent pupils.

 Government, in partnership with the wider tourism industry, has identified four key strategic priority areas for increasing productivity in the industry. During 2004, DCMS will continue the work that is already in progress on domestic and overseas marketing through direct funding to VisitBritain and development of the EnglandNet initiative, on raising skills through supporting the establishment of a Sector Skills Council, by driving up quality through the Fitness for Purpose initiative and a review of the current accommodation quality grading schemes, and by improving tourism data through a review of data quality and availability with a view to strengthening statistics. A fifth priority for DCMS is to strengthen the advocacy of tourism across government at all levels.

 The 14 December elections to the "Assembly" of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", although not officially recognised, were an important opportunity for the Turkish Cypriot people to express their views on the island's future. A small team of academics from the University of Oslo carried out an independent study of the elections and the pre-electoral period. They noted some serious concerns about the manner in which the campaign was conducted. Lack of impartiality in the media was one area highlighted. The final report from the University of Oslo team is expected within the next month.
<P>

<a name="40113w05.html_para0">We too have noted the widespread concerns expressed by many Turkish Cypriots about the way the campaign was conducted. There were numerous reports of intimidation and also of rigging of the electoral register. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer my hon.

<a name="40113w06.html_para1">The Decision effectively extends to countries with minimal or no domestic manufacturing capacity the existing flexibility within the TRIPS Agreement to issue compulsory licenses by allowing other countries to produce and export to them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 When the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was launched in 1999, the fixed three-year performance period of the original HIPC framework was replaced by a 'floating' Completion Point. This means that Completion Point is triggered by the successful implementation of a set of pre-defined reform measures, rather than a set period of time. The Decision Point documents for HIPC countries give a prediction of when a country is expected to meet the floating Completion Point triggers, but these time-scales are intended to be only rough estimates. Of the nine countries that have reached Completion Point, only two (Mauritania and Uganda) did so at the date that had been predicted. Two further countries (Tanzania and Mozambique) reached Completion Point within five months of the date predicted at Decision Point. The remaining five countries (Mali, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso and Guyana) missed their predicted Completion Point date by at least a year. Delay in reaching Completion Point is mostly due to poor policy performance. It should be noted, however, that there has been no delay to delivery of relief, as countries cease to make payments on their debt from Decision Point.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Even before the doctors and nurses went on strike three months ago, the coverage and quality of health services in Zimbabwe were being compromised by severe shortages of skilled doctors, nurses, and other professional staff. Declining numbers due to AIDS mortality and migration has led to vacancy rates of 40 per cent. for nurses, 55 per cent. for doctors, and 90 per cent. for pharmacists. Those who remained saw their standard of living drastically eroded by inflation, which now stands at 700 per cent. per annum.
<P>

<a name="40113w06.html_para7">During the doctors' and nurses' strike the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare attempted to limit damage by deploying military medical personnel and Cuban doctors.

<P>

<a name="40113w06.html_para8">The health impacts of the strike and the ongoing human resources crisis have not been quantified, but recent trends in health status in Zimbabwe are alarming.

 The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) recently released an update on the UN Consolidated Appeals Process in Southern Africa. DFID agrees with OCHA's assessment that while food shortages remain the most immediate humanitarian concern in Zimbabwe, other factors affecting and threatening the basic needs of the Zimbabwean people should not be underestimated or neglected. These include the crippling effect of HIV/AIDS on households and communities, the lack of agricultural inputs, and the rapid decline of basic social services such as health care and education.
<P>

<a name="40113w06.html_para9">DFID is committing approximately &#163;35 million to Zimbabwe this financial year in support of both food and non-food initiatives through UN agencies and other channels.

 Merseyside Police's Annual Policing Plan 2003&#150;04 sets out how the force will enhance the use of the National Intelligence Model to target criminals and their networks whose operations have a direct impact on volume crime (burglary, vehicle crime and violent crime, including robbery). Lessons from the street crime initiative have been applied to tackling burglary and vehicle crime. Increased use of police powers to stop and search and targeting known offenders have had a positive impact on both burglary and vehicle crime on Merseyside. In addition, the implementation of new burglary packs issued to officers attending reported burglaries and extra work undertaken by crime scene investigators have contributed to improved performance. Feedback from user satisfaction surveys has also enabled the force to tailor its response to communities' needs.

In the Robbery Reduction Team police and Crown Prosecution Service are co-located and the Premium Service provided.

 The National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) was launched in April 2003 to increase the professional capacity of the police service. Its functions include delivering training and advice on specialist law enforcement and technical and analytical support in major crime. It also has a major role in formulating national good practice in operational policing and issuing Codes of Practice and Guidance.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para0">In 2002&#150;03, it produced a knowledge map on street robbery which has been available to all forces on the Criminal Justice Extranet. A Code of Practice on the Police Use of Firearms and less lethal weapons was issued at the beginning of December 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w10.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Under section 96 of the Police Act 1996, police authorities have a statutory obligation to consult with their communities. However, recent research conducted by the Home Office Research and Statistics Directorate concluded that there was scope to enhance engagement with communities.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para1">Provision of a citizen focused policing service is a key priority within the National Policing Plan, published in November 2003, and is fundamental to the on-going process and direction of police reform. Building a police service that is responsive to the diverse needs of the communities it serves requires police forces to develop a clear understanding of those communities.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para2">We have invested &#163;1 million in a joint action research project between the Home Office and the Association of Police Authorities to help police authorities and forces engage more effectively with their local communities.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para3">A major consultation exercise on police reform was launched on 4 November 2003 with the publication of "Policing: Building Safer Communities Together". The broad vision behind the paper is to improve community engagement in policing. It is underpinned by the desire to see local communities play a greater role in policing/community safety decisions and solutions in their neighbourhoods.

<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para4">There is now a more clear focus on performance management within the Policing Performance Assessment Framework which is being developed, and the Police Standards Unit is working with forces to improve performance and identify good practice. The National Centre for Policing Excellence was established in April 2003.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para5">As well as record numbers of police officers and police staff, we now have more than 1,900 community support officers (CSO). We have provided the necessary powers for CSOs and police staff to facilitate greater flexibility for forces in the use of resources and to release officers for front line duties. A major pay and conditions package has been implemented to provide a fairer, more flexible and modernised system of pay and rewards.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para6">The second National Policing Plan was published on 4 November 2003 and sets out the Home Secretary's key policing priorities as well as a strategic framework for local policing plans. The first police science and technology strategy, published in January 2003 provides an overarching vision of how we will address not only our immediate policing needs, but also the future capability. We have invested in the use of new technology. DNA matching and Automatic Numberplate Recognition are important tools to achieve greater effectiveness. The National Intelligence Model is becoming embedded in forces, with the aim that all forces are compliant with the common minimum standards by April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para7">Work is under way to develop leadership and management capacity at all levels in the police service. We are working towards creating the new Police Leadership Centre, which will bring together all the strands of work on police leadership.

 The Home Office's Public Service Agreements commit it to improving the performance of all police forces, including significantly reducing the gap between the best and worst performing forces. The National Policing Plan 2004&#150;07 set out the performance gap target which has been agreed. It is a fixed target requiring each force's performance in reducing crime

<a name="40113w10.html_para12">As indicated in paragraph 2.6 of the National Policing Plan 2004&#150;07, a preliminary assessment of 35 forces outside London for 2002&#150;03 gave an average figure of 61 per cent. This is not a baseline for future years. A number of initiatives are in train including, work force modernisation and reducing bureaucracy that will impact on the amount of time spent on front line policing and the Government look to the police service to ensure the proportion rises.

 I receive regular reports on the work of the Steering Group, co-chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Home Office, which was set up to oversee the work on reducing bureaucracy in the police service. Among the achievements since the Group first met in October 2002, the national roll out of the fixed penalty notice scheme is scheduled to be completed by April 2004; there are currently 19 performance indicators compared with 51 in 1997; over 4,600 forms have been made obsolete in 21 forces; approximately 20 forces are using mobile telephones and handheld computers to cut down on the time officers spend returning to the station to fill in forms; and all 43 forces in England and Wales now have the capacity to undertake video identity parades to speed up the identification of suspects. I am looking to the steering group to make further substantial impact in four key areas in particular over the conning months. These are information technology; work force modernisation; efficiency; and frontline policing activity.

<P>
<a name="40113w10.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government are committed to achieving a culturally diverse work force in the police service that is representative of the local communities it serves. We are engaged with the leadership of the police service in addressing diversity and promoting race equality in the areas of recruitment, training and development and in the conduct of the officers and staff. We support fully the Commission for Racial Equality's investigation of these issues.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para13">The National Recruitment Standards programme includes assessment processes which test candidates' attitudes towards race and diversity vigorously through interviews, role play and written assessment. This should exclude anyone with racist tendencies or those who do not respect differences and diversity. Those who do not score sufficiently highly in respect for race and diversity are not offered a job, irrespective of how well they do in the rest of the selection process. These processes are already in place in a number of forces and will be implemented in the remainder of the service by summer 2004. We assess candidates for unacceptable attitudes in every exercise.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para14">I shall further support this with a new action plan "Breaking Through" which is being launched later this month and which contains a series of actions and examples of promising practice to help forces improve the recruitment, retention and progression of minority ethnic staff.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para15">A new round of the CouldYou Police recruitment campaign has just been launched aimed, in particular, at the recruitment of women and ethnic minorities. The campaign is supported by outreach work pilots in four forces aimed at increasing the interest of ethnic minority communities in the police service as a credible and rewarding career choice.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para16">Fundamental changes to the way in which probationer constables are trained are under way. The focus will be on delivery of practice-based training within the local community rather than in residential police training centres. This new approach is already being piloted in several areas of the country. Improvements are also being made to police training generally to improve awareness of race and diversity issues and increase opportunities for community involvement. There will be rigorous assessment of standards.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para17">There are procedures under the Police Act 1996 and the Police (Misconduct) Regulations 1999 to deal with conduct which falls below the required standard. These procedures can be invoked by way of a complaint from a member of the public or a report or allegation from any other person. This includes any complaint or allegation of racial discrimination or attitudes. The Police Reform Act 2002 introduces a new complaints system to come into force on 1 April 2004, under which serious racial discrimination is a category of a complaint that must be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will decide how such a complaint will be dealt with.

 The number of police officers has increased by 7 per cent. from 127,158 in March 1997 to 136,386 in August 2003. Evidence from the British Crime Survey over a similar period (between 1997 and 2002&#150;03) indicates that burglary has fallen by 39 per cent., vehicle crime by 31 per cent., violent crime by 24 per cent. while crime overall declined by 25 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40113w10.html_para19">The Government are committed to maximising the benefits of this increase. Working with the Service and others, a police reform agenda focused on community engagement, greater local accountability, operational effectiveness and workforce modernisation will produce further improvements.

 I refer the hon. Member to my answer of 12 January 2004. <i>Official Report</i>, columns 545&#150;46W, given to the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). This explains the basis on which international civil aviation is governed and the conditions on which UK permits are issued to foreign airlines. That answer also explains why we are not able to give detailed information on permit action taken elsewhere in Europe.

8 January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 429W. The decisions not to allow services under the safety supervision of Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia and Tajikistan to operate to the UK were taken on the basis of information received about the ability of the aeronautical authorities of those countries to oversee the safety of their airlines and/or aircraft on their register. Those concerns continue, but we would be prepared to reconsider our position in the light of any additional information.

<a name="40113w11.html_para13">In the case of Gambia, we have issued a permit to Gambian International Airlines but only on the basis that the airline contracts with an acceptable non-Gambian airline to provide the aircraft and crew and to operate the flights on its behalf (called wet-leasing). In this case it has wet-leased an aircraft from Futura of Spain, and the Spanish authorities retain responsibility for the safety and operation of the aircraft.

 The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) has a 5-step complaints procedure which directs the occupant through the organisation from local DHE office level to the Chief Executive. If still unsatisfied, the occupant can write to the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel), DHE's owner. This procedure is fully explained in the Occupants Handbook, a copy of which is provided to all occupants of Service family housing.
<P>

<a name="40113w13.html_para3">Serving personnel are also able to raise matters through their chain of command or make a formal complaint under the Service redress of grievance procedure.
<P>

<a name="40113w13.html_para4">The DHE Occupants Handbook also lists bodies that may be consulted for independent advice, such as Citizens' Advice Bureaux and Service welfare organisations. Leaflets containing information about complaints are on display in community facilities in DHE estates, and reminders are published from time to time in DHE's customer magazine 'Living in Families Quarters'.

<P>
<a name="40113w14.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Ministry of Defence has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation, we do so. The amount of compensation paid is calculated on the basis of the severity of the injury together with any financial loss. The amount payable for financial loss to an adult would likely exceed that payable to a juvenile.

 The information for my Department is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para1"><i>LOCCS (various court-based IT systems):</i>
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para2">The EDS (LOGCS) contract was awarded to EDS in September 1996, to provide IT systems to Crown and county courts. The lifetime cost of the contract is assessed at &#163;210 million.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para3">The initial rollout of equipment to courts was completed in August 2001. The contract was fully functional from award. The contract includes provisions to test software prior to release, and to fix software 'bugs' which are attributable to supplier software.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para4">The LOCCS rollout was completed to time, and subsequent major work programmes have been delivered to time.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para5">A major provision of new IT equipment to the Crown Court (and those county courts co-located with crown court buildings) under the LOCCS contract was agreed in 2003. This is part of the Government's commitment to modernising the Criminal Justice System. This programme of change had replaced the equipment and significantly enhanced the IT functionality available at 31 Crown and County Court centres by the end of 2003 and is on schedule to be completed in all of the 109 sites within scope by 2006. An extension to this rollout of a further 59 stand alone county courts is being planned. These additional sites will also be completed in 2006.

<i>ARAMIS (Resource Accounting and Management Information System):</i>
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para6">This is a PFI contract for the provision of accounting, financial, HR/payroll and management information services. It was awarded in December 1997 and runs until January 2007. Its current anticipated life-time cost is &#163;207.7 million, which includes enhancements to the service during 2003.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para7">Most services have IT elements and are delivered across an IT infrastructure provided through the contract. However, the IT system elements of the contract are not separated out from the main business functions. All the services are being provided within the lifetime of the contract, and major work programmes have been delivered to time. Debugging of the IT system elements is a process which continues through the lifetime of the contract.

<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para9">The original contract with Fujitsu Systems for Libra included provision for infrastructure and Office Automation, a bespoke case management software application and systems integration.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para10">This contract with Fujitsu Services for the delivery of Libra has been varied twice since it was awarded in December 1998. This has resulted in changes to the baseline making it inappropriate to compare spend to date across an original and two variants of the contract. The actual spend against the original contract can be summarised as follows:

Total contracted charges paid by year ending December 2003&#151;&#163;127 million
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40113w15.html_para11">Libra is now being sourced through three separate contracts, one to provide the underlying infrastructure and Office Automation Services, one to supply a new case management application and the third to deploy that application and integrate all systems. These include, where necessary, provisions to test the software and to fix any "bugs" which are attributable to supplier software prior to release.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para12">The contract signed with Fujitsu Services in July 2002 included the provision of Libra infrastructure and Office Automation only. The roll-out of these was successfully completed in September 2003.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para13">A further contract was signed with STL in January 2003 for &#163;37 million to provide a case management software application. The first release of this application is due in November 2004 with two further enhancements to be completed before November 2005. STL will continue to provide support and enhancement services through to 2008.
<P>

<a name="40113w15.html_para14">A contract was also signed with Accenture in October 2003 for &#163;38 million to deploy the new application to the Magistrates' courts (planned completion by the end of 2005) and to provide on-going systems integration services through to 2008.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to benefits;  [146633]
<P>
<UL><P>
(2) what assessment he has made of the suitability of Disability Living Allowance application forms for those suffering from variable conditions;  [146610]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w16.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 People with chronic fatigue syndrome are entitled to social security benefits if they meet the usual qualifying conditions for them. For Disability Living Allowance, entitlement depends on the effects that severe physical or mental disability have on a person's need for personal care and/or their ability to walk, and not on particular disabilities or diagnoses.
<P>

<a name="40113w16.html_para4">The Disability Living Allowance claim form is designed to enable all disabled people to give full details of the effects of their disabilities on their need for personal care and ability to walk, and specifically asks for as much detail as possible about variations in their condition. In view of the concern disabled people have expressed about the length and complexity of the form, we are developing and trialling a number of new style

claim packs which will give even better opportunities for people to detail how their disabilities affect them on a day to day basis.
<P>

<a name="40113w16.html_para5">Some 1,180 decision makers decide claims for Disability Living Allowance. All of them receive specific training on the causes, manifestations and management of chronic fatigue syndrome. Guidance about the effects of particular disabilities is available to decision makers in the Disability Handbook published by the Department's Corporate Medical Group. The section on chronic fatigue syndrome was written and compiled following consultation with experts in this area of medicine including the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Association. Decision makers can also seek advice from the Department's medical services doctors, all of whom are trained disability analysts with specialist knowledge of assessing the effects of disability and who receive specific guidance on assessing the effects of chronic fatigue syndrome as one of their training modules.
<P>

<a name="40113w16.html_para6">There have been no recent discussions with the Appeals Service on how to deal with Disability Living Allowance claims from people with variable conditions. The Appeals Service is an independent body and it would not be appropriate to seek to influence how they might deal generally with cases involving particular disabilities. On individual cases being considered by the Appeals Service, however, it is open to the Department to express its views about whether the conditions for entitlement to benefit are, or are not, met. In this connection, the recent judgment of the House of Lords in the case of "Moyna" ([2003] UKHL 44) confirmed that the correct approach to entitlement to Disability Living Allowance for people with variable conditions is to take a "broad view". This judgment is binding on both decision makers and the Appeals Service.

 The National Contact Point (NCP) for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises contacted some of the companies mentioned in Schedule 3 of the UN Panel report directly, the remaining companies made contact with the NCP. In all cases this resulted in face-to-face discussions with either the company or their legal representatives. In all cases the companies denied any wrongdoing and indicated their willingness to act in accordance with the OECD Guidelines. In the absence of evidence of specific instances of breaching the Guidelines, the companies have not&#151;been in a position to respond substantively to the allegations by the UN Panel. All communications with the Panel are undertaken within the confidentiality provisions of the Guidelines and consequently the Government will be unable to place a copy of any response in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the implications of the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive for <i>(a)</i> manufacturers and <i>(b)</i> retailers.  [146983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The implications of the EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) for local authorities, manufacturers, retailers and others are set out in a consultation paper which the Government published on 25 November 2003. This is available at or may be downloaded from the Department's website at http://www.dti.gov.uk/sustainability/weee/index.htm. Copies are available in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="40113w18.html_para0">This consultation paper invites views on the Government's preferred approach to implementing the directive. It includes proposals for implementation of the directive's provisions on producer responsibility and retailer take-back.
<P>

<a name="40113w18.html_para1">The WEEE directive places no obligations on local authorities. The Government have made clear that there will be no new unfinanced burdens on local authorities as a result of the directive. However, the Government aim to encourage increased separate collection of WEEE in line with the directive's objectives and, in this context, it makes sense to build on existing collection activity at civic amenity sites. The Government wish to encourage local authorities to consider upgrading and/or introducing WEEE collection facilities at their amenity sites. It is proposed that money will be made available, via a fund, into which local authorities may bid to finance improved or greater separate collection of WEEE at their civic amenity sites.
<P>

<a name="40113w18.html_para2">The consultation suggests that this fund would be provided through a retailer take-back compliance scheme. The Government propose that the retailer scheme should provide funding initially of at least &#163;5 million for civic amenity site upgrades in each of the five financial years between 2005&#150;10, with an interim review in 2008, when the directive is expected to be revised. It is expected that most of the early expenditure would relate to capital costs and any initial operating costs.
<P>

<a name="40113w18.html_para3">The Government have included in its consultation package a report by consultants Network Recycling on the scope for upgrading and expanding WEEE collection at civic amenity sites around the UK. In summary, this report indicates that over half of civic amenity sites currently collect some WEEE and that there is significant scope for expanding this on the basis of site space available. It suggests that the baseline costs of such upgrades are in the region of &#163;6&#150;12 million, depending on the approach taken; and that on-going staffing and training costs could be in the region of &#163;4&#150;9 million per annum.

1. Separate research programmes do not yet exist for hydrogen conversion technologies or combined-cycle gas.<P>

2. Of DTI's total spend on nuclear R&D given above, about &#163;15 million annually is on fusion research; there is. also some additional expenditure in support of Meteorological Office emergency response arrangements which currently accounts for approximately &#163;2.1 million. Fusion expenditure for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;15.6 million. The Research Councils expenditure on fission was ca 300k pa in 2001&#150;2 and 2002&#150;3. In addition, &#163;5 million has also been earmarked for fission research but has not yet been awarded.<P>

3. The table sets out identified Government spend and excludes, for example, spending by Research Councils. Spending by relevant publicly owned utilities could not be separated in the manner requested without disproportionate cost.<P>

4. DTI's sustainable energy R&D programme also includes support for activitieswhich are not technology specific, for example, export, commercialisation, marketing and international activities.<P>

5. For combined heat and power, Govewrnment expenditure is through DEFRA. <P>

 The Convention on the Future of Europe proposed that the Euratom Treaty should remain separate from a new Constitutional Treaty for the EU. The Government was content with this as a basis for discussions in the context of the negotiations at the IGC. During the negotiations, a draft Protocol was considered which would be annexed to the new Constitutional Treaty, incorporating some of its institutional and financial provisions into the Euratom Treaty. As the IGC did not reach final agreement at the December Council, the Irish Presidency are now looking at how to take negotiations forward and will be reporting back at the Spring Council.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The study of employers revealed that they largely reject the notion that flexible working can have an adverse impact on an employee's chances of promotion. Three-quarters (74 per cent.) of employers agreed that people who work flexibly are just as likely to be promoted as those that do not, while 15 per cent. neither agreed nor disagreed or did not know. The study of employees has only preliminary findings currently available, which can be found on the Internet (www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar/). We expect to publish the full report soon.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Through the DTI's Work-Life Balance Campaign we are encouraging employers to offer flexible working opportunities across the workforce. In April 2003 a new law giving parents the right to request flexible working was introduced, placing a statutory duty on employers to consider the request seriously. This was targeted legislation for parents of young and disabled children as they face particular challenges.

The Department has commissioned questions specifically relating to job security and progression which currently appear in the Office of National Statistics' Omnibus survey.

<a name="40113w19.html_para4">The information collected will contribute towards the review of the flexible working law that the Government have said will begin in 2006.

 <i>[holding answer 12 January 2004]:</i> Since its launch in September 2002, the Manufacturing Advisory Service's regional centre in the West Midlands has achieved considerable success as a source of advice and support for manufacturers. It has responded to 2,377 inquiries from firms seeking advice, visited 895 companies to carry out initial health checks and completed 395 in depth consultancies in the West Midlands. It has worked with 88 companies in Coventry and 200 in the Coventry and Warwickshire Business Link catchment area, accounting for 4.3 per cent. and 9.9 per cent. respectively of the total number of manufacturers it has engaged with.
<P>

<a name="40113w19.html_para8">All the regional centres of the service have active programmes for marketing their services to local manufacturing firms. This, combined with the excellent reputation that the service has achieved among manufacturers, has resulted in a sustained and substantial increase in demand for its services. So far the MAS has dealt with approximately 15,500 inquiries and carried out over 4,500 diagnostic and advisory visits. The actual total value added it has given UK manufacturers is now approaching &#163;30 million.

 No. The Government concluded in January 2003, in the light of the Report of the Coordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues, that standards on auditor independence, including on the provision of non-audit services to audit clients, should be set by the Auditing Practices Board (APB). The Government invited the APB to look in particular at the provision of a number of non-audit services including taxation services. Following this, the APB published a consultation paper, "Draft Ethical Standards for Auditors", in November 2003. Paragraphs 4.40 to 4.52 of the consultation paper and paragraphs 51 to 66 of draft Ethical Standard 5 address the provision of tax services by audit firms to their audit clients. In addition, the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance, published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003, places on the audit committee in a listed company responsibility for developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service gas is bought on a variety of contract options, contract start dates and differing indices. This limits exposure to severe increases across the portfolio, although individual sites may have experiences significantly above or below average, largely due to timing.
<P>

<a name="40113w22.html_para3">The total actual increases in gas costs for the NHS in 2003&#150;04 will be approximately &#163;7 million over and above the 2002&#150;03 figure. If all gas had been bought at the highest peak prices so far in 2003&#150;04, the increase would have been approximately &#163;15.1 million.
<P>

<a name="40113w22.html_para4">As far as I am aware there are no further planned increases in gas prices beyond usual market forces.

 The benefits of the new general medical services (GMS) contract are potentially available to all general practitioners. However, over 40 per cent. of GPs have opted, over a period of time, for locally agreed personal medical services (PMS) contracts. In order that these GPs can also benefit from the key provisions of the new QMS contract, it has already been agreed, and communicated to the profession, that similar benefits will also be available to PMS practices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w25.html_wqn1"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of the planned new communities development in the south-east is to be undertaken on brownfield sites; and if he will make a statement on criteria used in choosing between brownfield and greenfield sites.  [147025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w25.html_spnew1"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Through Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 Housing (PPG3) the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has introduced a series of tough new measures designed to meet the country's future housing needs in the most sustainable way possible. This includes a sequential approach which gives priority to re-using brownfield sites in urban areas in preference to developing greenfield sites. In addition, we have a national target that, by 2008, 60 per cent. of additional 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2004 : Column 721W</I><P>
housing should be provided on previously-developed land and through conversions of existing buildings. Performance against this target has risen from 58 per cent. in 1998 to 64 per cent. in 2002 for England as a whole. In the south-east, including London, the proportion is about 75 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40113w25.html_para1">The Sustainable Communities Plan sets out a strategy for carefully planned, sustainable growth which will protect communities from unplanned suburban sprawl. Much of the &#163;610 million the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is ploughing into the four growth areas through the Sustainable Communities Plan will go into reclaiming poor quality brownfield land, or into transport improvements which will enable high density developments. For instance, the development of new communities at Ebbsfleet, Eastern Quarry and Barking Reach within the Thames Gateway all involve the redevelopment of large redundant industrial sites. However, in some cases sustainable urban extensions involving some greenfield land will be necessary.
<P>

<a name="40113w25.html_para2">Detailed planning of individual sites within the housing growth areas is not yet complete and it is not therefore possible to provide a figure for the proportion of development which will occur on previously developed land. The sequential approach described above will, however, apply.

<P>
<a name="40113w25.html_spnew2"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 By January 2006, the energy performance of buildings directive requires the United Kingdom to oblige owners of larger buildings, occupied by certain types of public authorities and institutions, to openly display energy performance labels. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is considering how best to implement the directive, and, whilst the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not yet commissioned studies of other member states' intentions, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister seeks relevant information in due course.

 The statutory objectives and powers of the Thurrock Urban Development Corporation (UDC) are set out in section 136 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. The Thurrock UDC's overriding objective is to secure the regeneration of its area and to achieve this it has a general power to ". . . do anything necessary or expedient for this purpose, or for purposes incidental to those purposes".

<P>

<a name="40113w25.html_para4">As part of its work, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would expect the UDC to liaise with other Government bodies and agencies that, while not directly involved in regeneration activity, are responsible for the wider social infrastructure that will influence the UDCs ability to deliver sustainable, balanced communities in Thurrock. To this end the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would expect the UDC to assist and/or influence local, regional and national social/health care providers in the development of plans and strategies that directly relate to the growth, development and regeneration of Thurrock.

 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (PPG3) makes it clear that car parking policies should not be expressed as minimum standards. It advises that car parking standards that result, on average, in development with more than 1.5 off-street car parking spaces per dwelling are unlikely to reflect the Government's emphasis on securing sustainable residential environments.
<P>

<a name="40113w25.html_para8">The most recent advice for local authorities was set out in an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Parliamentary Statement of 17 July 2003. This clarified that the PPG3 car parking policy did not expect that 1.5 spaces per dwelling should be provided for every dwelling in all new developments. Parking needs vary and that's why it was announced in the Statement the intention to carry out research to consider how varying car parking levels can be achieved in ways consistent with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's policy on securing sustainable residential environments.

<a name="40113w26.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister by what process the composition of regional chambers is determined.  [147289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The composition of the voluntary regional chambers is a matter for each chamber. However they are designated under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 as representative regional bodies to scrutinise the plans and activities of the regional development agencies. To meet the criteria for designation and receipt of grant their membership needs to be representative of the range of views and interests within the region. The Government expect at least 30 per cent. of Assembly members to come from stakeholder groups, including representative of business, trades unions, environmental, consumer and other groups.
<P>

<a name="40113w26.html_para2">The remainder come from local government, and reflect the broad political balance across the region. The selection process for membership varies from region to region.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of members of regional chambers are local councillors.  [147290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The proportion will vary slightly between regional chambers but in order to be designated under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 as representative regional bodies must not exceed 70 per cent. of the total membership.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will list each member of each regional chamber; and what the <i>(a)</i> political and <i>(b)</i> trade union affiliation of each is.  [147291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not record such information. It is up to each regional chamber to decide its own membership within the guidelines that, for designation, at least 30 per cent. of members must come from stakeholder groups.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what <i>(a)</i> progress has been made and <i>(b)</i> resources have been allocated to the Supporting People programme in (i) Redbridge and (ii) Waltham Forest; and if he will make a statement.  [147378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Last October, the Government announced funding of &#163;1.8 billion for 2003&#150;04 financial year for the Supporting People programme in England of which Redbridge was awarded &#163;4,466,479 and Waltham Forest &#163;7,934,650.
<P>

The Government have now received a report from the independent review team and are carefully considering its content. A response will be published in due course, and in time for local authorities to plan their 2004&#150;05 budgets.

<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Purchase: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister further to HB/CTB circular S9/2003 paragraphs 46&#150;51, whether he is planning any consultation with local authorities on the ways in which the Transitional Protection Scheme will operate in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06; if he will provide exemplifications to local authorities before 1 January 2004 setting out the potential financial implications for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 at an individual authority level of the transitional protection scheme; and what guidance the Government will be providing to individual local authorities.  [145191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40113w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40113w26.html_para4">Local authority representatives have been consulted, as part of the wider review of subsidy, on the operation of transitional protection in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="40113w26.html_para5">Transitional protection will limit the impact of the change in the housing benefit/council tax benefit subsidy regime from April 2004. The financial implications will not be known until authorities have their subsidy claims audited, after the end of the year. It will then be possible to compare the difference in subsidy under the old and new subsidy regimes.
<P>

<a name="40113w26.html_para6">HB/CTB circular S9/2003, a copy of which is available in the Library, gave an outline of the new subsidy scheme. Further guidance for authorities on how the transitional protection scheme will operate will

<P><I>13 Jan 2004 : Column 726W</I><P>
be provided in the near future. This will provide further advice and information which will enable authorities to estimate possible gains/losses under the new subsidy system and consequently whether they may be affected by the transitional protection arrangements.
