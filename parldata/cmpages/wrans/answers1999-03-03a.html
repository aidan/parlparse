<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All applications for vocational (lorry and bus driver) licences are given high priority by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The current service standard target is to deliver 95 per cent. of licences to applicants within 9 working days of receipt which includes postage time. The Agency is currently bettering this target by one day. The remaining applications--which are subject to conduct investigations by the Traffic Commissioners or medical consideration by the Agency's doctors--are normally cleared within 20 working days.
<P>

<a name="90303w01.htm_para2">Applications can be submitted in multi-batches by training organisations and special provisions exist for licences to be collected from the Agency.

<a name="90303w02.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the amount of compensation awarded to British transport companies affected as a result of French transport strikes; what proportion of overall claims have been settled; and what representations to the French Government he has made.  [74437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Some 1,200 British claims were made in respect of the 1996 French lorry drivers' strike. We understand that some 25 per cent. have so far received a favourable response. Precise figures are not available because claims were not dealt with centrally in France but were dealt with by Prefectures in the Departments in which blockades occurred. For the same reason, information about the amount of compensation paid is not available. We continue to work with the French authorities to secure the timely and fair consideration of claims.

<a name="90303w03.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the current mileage of red routes in each London borough; what was the figure for each of the last five years; and what is the anticipated figure for 1999-2000.  [73764]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The red route network was designated by Statutory Instrument in 1992 (SI 1992/1372). The breakdown by borough is given in the table. Since 1992 the SI has been amended twice (SI 1995/1130 and SI 1997/1001) to make small changes to the network in Ealing, Haringey, Hackney, Hillingdon and Lewisham and to correct minor descriptive errors. The programme for the implementation of the red route measures is set out in the Traffic Director's Annual Report, a copy of which is in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the current mileage of cycle lanes in London broken down by borough; what were the figures for <i>(a)</i> 1989-90 and <i>(b)</i> 1993-94; and what are the expected figures for 1999-2000.  [73823]<P>

<a name="90303w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The information requested on the length of cycle lanes for the years 1989-90 and 1993-94 is not available. This is before the work on the London Cycle Network commenced and therefore no central body existed to gather and co-ordinate the data. Approximately 190 miles of cycle network were in place when work started on the London Cycle Network in 1995-96; however, it is not known what proportion consisted of cycle lanes. The following table shows the existing lengths of the London Cycle Network on a borough-by- borough basis as at April 1998. The expected borough- by-borough figures for 1999-2000 are not yet available but it is anticipated that in total there will be 1,000 miles of the network in place by the end of this period.

 The International Civil Aviation Organisation will hold a Diplomatic Conference in May for the purpose of adopting a new convention intended to replace all previous instruments of the Warsaw Convention for International Carriage by Air. Officials from my Department have been involved in the development of the new convention and have formally consulted representatives of UK airlines, airline users and principal practitioners in international air law. The views received will be taken into account by the Government at the Conference.

<a name="90303w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 We are determined to ensure that Railtrack has adequate incentives to perform effectively and efficiently, and to develop the network, meeting the needs of customers and funders. That could point to a proportion of Railtrack's access income being paid direct by the proposed Strategic Rail Authority, rather than via train operators. We have asked the Rail Regulator for a report on this matter.
<P>

<a name="90303w03.htm_para0">Within the overall context of our plans for the railway, financial responsibility for those passenger services that both start and end in Scotland will be transferred to Scottish Ministers.

 The Rail Summit was an important step towards our goal of creating within 10 years one of the best railway systems in the world. The passenger train operators and Railtrack share that aim and want to work together--and with government--to realise it.

 We are acting to ensure that the Department's policies meet the needs of disabled people and that we comply with our legal requirements. The Department already takes positive steps to make it easier to disabled people to participate in the arts, sport and leisure pursuits. We shall continue to do so, not only by complying fully with new duties in the Disability Discrimination Act but by aiming to exceed them where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90303w04.htm_para1">One of the Department's main objectives is to widen and improve access for disabled people and other groups by embedding consultation and consideration of their needs in mainstream policies, and by means of the funding agreements being negotiated with its sponsored bodies. This includes the need to ensure that our policies and their outcomes comply with the law. This complements the guidance "Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment" which the Cabinet Office issued to all Government Departments in November 1998, and which was signed jointly by my right hon. Friends the Minister for Women, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Home Secretary.

<P>

<a name="90303w04.htm_para6">The early work on the Creative Industries Task Force focused on mapping activity in the UK creative industries and assessing its economic value. The Task Force was responsible for the Creative Industries Mapping Document, which was published in November 1998. The Mapping Document has a practical application, besides providing a statistical analysis of the economic health of the creative industries.
<P>

<a name="90303w04.htm_para7">The Creative Industries Task Force has now embarked on an ambitious work programme for the next 12-15 months, building on the findings in the Mapping Document. There are three key strands to the programme:

 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> The independent review panel currently considering the future funding of the BBC has also been asked to examine the structure of the existing concessionary television licence scheme and whether a suitable alternative structure could be available. The panel has invited representations on a number of areas, including the concessionary arrangements, and will report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by the end of July this years. There will then be a period of public consultation on the panel's recommendations. It would not be right for the Government to preempt the outcome of the review.

 Provisional information at 1 October 1998, from Mandate, the Cabinet Office's personnel database, is set out in the table. It is not directly comparable to the information in the recently published <i>Equal Opportunities in the Civil Service Data Summary</i> which is based on staff in post at 1 April 1998. The table excludes staff in departments who do not provide data to Mandate. However, both the Data Summary and the table show that 5.7 per cent. of all staff were from ethnic minority groups.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will make a statement on the 1998 Next Steps report.  [75077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 The Government have today published the 1998 Next Steps Report, Cm 4273, which has been laid in both Houses. This Report brings together performance and trend data on 136 executive agencies and two departments operating on Next Steps lines.
<P>

<a name="90303w05.htm_para3">The Report shows that overall nearly 76 per cent. of targets were achieved and that, where comparisons can be made with previous years, performance against targets has improved in 52 per cent. of cases.
<P>

<a name="90303w05.htm_para4">With the introduction of Public Service Agreements (PSAs), Government have set out in precise and quantified form what improvements it is seeking to achieve over the next 3 years. Agencies will have a very important part to play in helping Ministers deliver those results. Agencies' objectives and targets are being 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 1999 : Column: 748</I><P>
redefined to ensure that they reflect the Government's new objectives and priorities. The degree of challenge which is built in to the PSA targets will help to ensure that agency targets are themselves set at a sufficiently stretching level, encouraging agencies to be innovative and enterprising in tackling improvement.
<P>

<a name="90303w05.htm_para5">The Government will be publishing before Easter a White Paper on "Modernising Government" which will set out a vision for the future of public services. One of its main themes will be the need to increase co-operation across traditional bureaucratic boundaries so that public services can be delivered more cost-effectively and be better tuned to the needs of the user. Agencies, as the main service delivery arm of the Civil Service, will have a vital role to play in fostering this growth in co-operative solutions.
<P>

<a name="90303w05.htm_para6">It is essential that continuous pressure be applied to improve individual agency performance but this must be seen increasingly within the context of contribution to broader goals.

 In February, I met the directors of the voluntary organisations which comprise the British Overseas Aid Group (BOAG)--ActionAid, Oxfam, the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development (CAFOD), Christian Aid and Save the Children Fund--to discuss debt. In December, I also met BOND, which represents the smaller NGOs. We agreed that poverty reduction remains our central concern, and that we need to develop and strengthen the link between debt relief and poverty reduction. The UK is pressing for this issue to be considered during the fundamental review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which is now underway. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are holding a consultation meeting, including NGOs, in London on 5 March.

 My Department has not carried out any research into the economic impact of growing genetically modified crops on small-scale farmers in developing countries. However we have commissioned relevant studies from University of Birmingham and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, to assess the environmental and social risks of introducing new or transgenic plant types into the traditional pigeon pea seed production systems of small- scale farmers in India and, from University of Swansea, to undertake social and economic assessments of the potential impact of genetically male tilapia and transgenic tilapia on fish farming in Philippines.

<P>

<a name="90303w06.htm_para2">In reaching a Common Position by the Council of Ministers in February 1998, the UK made a statement noting that there had been no consideration as to whether the provisions of the Directive would be appropriate for other countries outside the European Union, in particular developing countries.

Our priorities are to maintain and repair the existing network and to meet the costs of projects contractually committed or announced. Project costs exceed &#163;2 million on the A720, the M6, the A7 (Hawick Relief Road) and the A90 (Inchmichael Interchange). Further projects may be announced later.

 The increase in the planned expenditure by Scottish Enterprise between 2000-01 and 2001-02 primarily reflects the phased introduction of a number of new training initiatives announced by the Government last year as part of the New Deal and a re-instatement of provision for the delayed Hyundai project.

 There is no country or territory currently subject to a declaration of upheaval under the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996. Declarations were made in respect of Sierra Leone on 1 July 1997 and the Democratic Republic of Congo on 17 May 1998. These expired after three months.
<P>

<a name="90303w08.htm_para6">The purpose of such declarations is to ensure that people who find themselves in the United Kingdom at the point when there is a change of circumstances in their home country, of the kind envisaged in the Regulations,

are not disadvantaged in terms of access to income support and related benefits if they make an in-country asylum application with reasonable promptness. Three months is the period considered to be reasonable for this purpose. A declaration of upheaval does not, in itself, carry any implication for the determination of asylum applications from the country or territory concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No one is detained solely because they are an asylum seeker. Detention is authorised only in accordance with powers set out in the Immigration Act 1971 as they apply to inadmissible passengers, illegal entrants or stowaways, people subject to deportation action or on grounds of national security.
<P>

<a name="90303w08.htm_para7">The principle criterion for detention is whether a person will comply with conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release. So far as possible, people are detained in discrete accommodation in Immigration Service Detention Centres or designated prison accommodation at Haslar or Rochester.

 The effect of Article 22 of the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child is to confer on refugee and asylum seeking children all the rights set out in that Convention. The comprehensive provision in United Kingdom law for the care and protection of children applies in full to children who have been recognised as refugees in this country and to those who have sought asylum here, but whose claim has not been determined. Although the United Kingdom has entered a reservation which makes it clear that nothing in the Convention is interpreted as affecting the operation of our immigration and nationality legislation, our law is entirely consistent with the thrust of the Convention.

 The question of public interest immunity arises in litigation, where it operates in appropriate circumstances to override the normal obligations of disclosure between the parties to the litigation. It does not arise outside legal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90303w08.htm_para11">The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), as Attorney-General, informed the House of the new approach to public interest immunity of the Government then in office in a statement made on 18 December 1996. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) informed the House on 11 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column 616, that the present Government would follow the same approach to public interest immunity. Under that approach the question of public interest immunity is considered on an individual case basis. Public interest immunity is asserted by the Government only where Ministers believe that disclosure of the information in question would cause real damage to the public interest.

were chosen on the basis that they were subject to discussion in the body of the Report and that they had a wider general interest.

<a name="90303w08.htm_para13">The Inquiry received about 30,000 documents containing a total of over 80,000 pages for Part 1 of its work. Many of these documents were duplicates because copies were submitted by more than one part to the Inquiry. About one third of the total was distributed to the parties of the Inquiry, subject to any redactions which the Inquiry considered necessary. Any redactions were agreed between the party submitting the document, the Inquiry's legal team and the Metropolitan police where necessary.

Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, additional resources are being made available to bring an additional 30 schools into the School Support Programme each year, and to provide extra support to other schools in socially disadvantaged areas.

 The Treasury will continue its dialogue with key external bodies to determine what information the public and business would need at each stage of the changeover process. Any information campaign would cover key concerns that the public and business may have. Chapter eight of the Treasury's Outline National Changeover Plan provides further information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if mixed oxide fuel and the materials which will be returned to BNFL's customers abroad after reprocessing are capable of being modified more easily than spent fuel for use in nuclear weapons.  [73560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w10.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> Plutonium can be recovered from either spent fuel or from fresh Mixed Oxide fuel (MOX) only through a difficult chemical separation process requiring complex and highly specialised plant, equipment and skills. It is technically difficult to produce nuclear weapons using weapons grade material. It would be even more difficult to use reactor grade plutonium to produce a reliable weapon giving a predictable yield.
<P>

<a name="90303w10.htm_para0">The other materials recovered from reprocessing are Low Enriched Uranium and waste. Low Enriched Uranium cannot be used directly to construct nuclear weapons. While safeguards and physical protection measures continue to be applied to it, it is of limited sensitivity to proliferation. Waste contains only traces of plutonium and cannot be used to construct nuclear weapons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w11.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 1 March 1999]:</i> The safety of cosmetic products is controlled by the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996, and all cosmetic ingredients have to be given on the label. All cosmetics are required to be safe under normal use. No specific controls exist for ingredients which may be derived from a genetically modified plant source and there are no specific requirements for manufacturers to mention this on the product label.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w11.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> The introduction, by licence modification, of mobile number portability has provided an additional spur to the introduction of Short Messaging Services (SMS) interworking between domestic operators. I understand that arrangements are expected to be concluded shortly between all four network operators and that it is now only a case of working on the implementation, specifically technical protocols. The Government are confident that additional benefits, in terms of new inter-network services, will be conferred on consumers through the introduction of mobile number portability.
<P>

<a name="90303w11.htm_para0">With regard to international SMS interworking, it is dependent on the capability of the roamed network. UK subscribers already have access to short messaging services when in many overseas countries and discussions are ongoing within the GSM community to ensure that network interworking is secured more widely, particularly in Europe and Asia.

 The outline National Changeover Plan is a first step in planning how the United Kingdom would make the changeover to the single currency. A further plan will be published in around a year's time. British businesses must now focus on the impact of the euro on their business strategies and decide for themselves how they should handle it and what preparations to make.

The main elements are &#163;70.2 million in the local government revenue settlement, &#163;23.5 million for further education and &#163;15.5 million for higher education.

I am delighted to have been able to ensure that from April all unitary authorities in Wales will be in a position voluntarily to meet the proposed minimum, which is a maximum of &#163;5 for a bus pass, and a discount of at least 50 per cent. on fares. I am keen to go further, and in consultation with the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) and bus operators will be drawing up plans to move to free concessionary travel for pensioners

 The future for bus services in rural Wales is brighter now than for many years. In the current financial year &#163;2.25 million has been made available to local authorities in Wales under the Bus Subsidy Grant Scheme to boost rural bus services, increasing to at least &#163;3 million in 1999-2000. In addition, local authorities will be free to decide whether to spend a further &#163;2 million on either rural or urban bus services.
<P>

<a name="90303w13.htm_para3">This new money will secure 16 million bus kilometres next year, and allow authorities to increase by more than 60 per cent. the provision of socially necessary bus services compared with 1997-98. It will help to increase accessibility and mobility in the countryside, and to overcome problems of social exclusion.

The figures above may underestimate the actual position as some non-medical staff (1.5 per cent. in 1996, 0.3 per cent. and 0.2 per cent. in 1998) did not have a valid occupation code and have not, therefore, been assigned centrally to a staff group or grade.<P>

The figures represent only those patients admitted to hospital as inpatients or day-cases and will therefore not be an overall picture of all patients suffering from schizophrenia in Wales.

 We have set in place evaluation research which involves two telephone surveys of the general public in Wales, wave 1 took place in January 1999 and wave 2 is planned for May 1999. It has been designed to measure shifts in attitudes along key variables identified by the campaign messages (as identified by the agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury). The sample is 1,500 members of the general public constructed to be representative of the five EC regions and in terms of sex, age, social class and the proportion of the population who are Welsh speaking.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Local authorities and schools are responsible for ensuring that their respective duties for the provision of education to children with special educational needs (SEN), including children with learning difficulties associated with autistic spectrum disorders, are discharged in accordance with the legislation and the associated guidance issued by the Department, principally the 'Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of SEN' [ISBN 0 85522 444 4].
<P>

<a name="90303w15.htm_para1">Schools are subject to inspection by The Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in Wales (OHMCI) which is responsible for evaluating and reporting on standards in each school to the Secretary of State. Inspections include an assessment of the provision being made for pupils with SEN, having regard to guidance issued by the Department.
<P>

<a name="90303w15.htm_para2">In 1996, OHMCI published a report entitled 'The Implementation of the SEN Code of Practice in Primary Schools in Wales' following a survey in primary schools during the two years following the introduction of the Code in 1994. A copy of its report was placed in the

As part of the new arrangements for delegating funding to schools from 1 April, LEAs will publish notional funding figures for each school for the SEN provision they are expected to make within their delegated budgets; and publish details of the funding for SEN support services which the LEA will provide centrally. These arrangements will help to improve transparency and accountability. A copy of the 'Action Programme' can be obtained from the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will undertake the necessary preliminary work for the establishment by the National Assembly of a cross-cutting committee on sustainable development.  [73777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w15.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The promotion of sustainable development is a key priority for this Government and I am paving the way for the Welsh Assembly to play a leading and innovative role in this area of activity. Last month I hosted a National Conference on Sustainable Development. Its main purpose was to put together recommendations as to how the National Assembly for Wales should meet its duty under section 121 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 to make a scheme setting out how it proposes, in the exercise of its functions, to promote sustainable development. A report of the Conference is being produced which I hope will be of value to the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="90303w15.htm_para6">Section 121 provides that the Assembly may not delegate the function of making, remaking or revising the scheme. Thus this task cannot be delegated to a committee but must be agreed by the whole Assembly.
<P>

<a name="90303w15.htm_para7">When I addressed the National Conference on Sustainable Development and elsewhere I have made clear my view that the Assembly's sustainable development duty can best be achieved by each of the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 1999 : Column: 788</I><P>
subject committees having responsibility for integrating sustainable development into its area of responsibility. I would expect to task one Assembly Secretary with the role of "Champion" for sustainable development as a core part of his or her portfolio.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the average cost of meat inspection per animal in <i>(a)</i> large, <i>(b)</i> medium sized and <i>(c)</i> small abattoirs.  [68129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w16.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) charges for meat inspection and hygiene supervision are calculated on a "per hour" basis. As a consequence the MHS does not routinely calculate throughput based charges for individual abattoirs. The Agency did, however, carry out a one-off exercise to calculate unit costs for 1996-97. This exercise illustrated the difficulties in the calculation of unit costs. The MHS had reservations about whether the data accurately reflected the actual unit costs of any particular plant. This was due to a number of factors including the difficulty of gathering all relevant data for the exercise and the assumption made during the calculations.
<P>

<a name="90303w16.htm_para2">In addition, there are several reasons why unit costs may vary from plant to plant, notably differences in structure, differences in efficiency or operation and the application of the MHS charging policy at each premises, for example whether travel time is incurred. The data produced from the exercise are therefore open to wide interpretation and unsuitable for publication.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 21 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>573</i>, on fishing industry initiatives, which organisations within the British fishing industry put forward proposals for <i>(a)</i> the introduction of fixed quota allocation, <i>(b)</i> the limiting to registration and licensing of fishing vessels to the declaration of maximum continuous

<P>
<P>

 As I explained in the answer which I gave the hon. Member on 21 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>574</i>, changes in a number of areas were prompted by concerns put forward from within the fishing industry, in some instances from fishermen themselves and in others from their representatives, and arose in the wide range of contacts I have with the industry. The measures on fixed quota allocations, scallop dredging licensing and pelagic freezer trawlers were the subject of public consultations and details of the responses are available from the Ministry's Library. The measures to link the registration and licensing of fishing vessels to the declaration of maximum continuous or permanently derated engine power, which are necessary to comply with EU obligations, were foreshadowed in the statement I made to the House on 17 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column 228, and were discussed with industry as part of the review of fishing vessel licensing.

[72525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w16.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 My Department has not commissioned the specific research referred to. However, in assessing GM foods approved for sale in the UK, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes considers the safety of <i>all</i> consumers from the youngest to the oldest, including pregnant women. The Committee has concluded that GM foods already approved for sale in the UK are as safe as their conventional counterparts for all sectors of the population.

[72946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w16.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All the genetically modified foods which are currently on sale were rigorously assessed for safety by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes under a voluntary scheme which was in operation prior to the introduction of the Novel Food Regulations in May 1997. Details of the regime operating at that time are contained in the ACNFP Annual Report for 1994, which can be found in the Library of the House. These foods have also been assessed by equivalent bodies in all other Member States.
<P>

<a name="90303w16.htm_para3">Since May 1997, all novel food assessments have been carried out by the ACNFP in accordance with guidance produced by the European Commission Scientific for Food, which applies to all member states. A copy of this guidance, which does not differ in any significant way from the regime operated under the voluntary scheme, may also be found in the Library of the House.

compliance of British retailers with their undertaking to sell only pork and pigmeat products derived from pigs produced in the United Kingdom. [R] [73795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w17.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 British retailers have given no such undertaking to the Government. I assume the hon. Member is referring to the undertakings given by the major supermarkets in respect of sourcing own label fresh pork, bacon, and other products from stall and tether and MBM free systems, and not labelling as British products produced or packed in this country using imported fresh pork. The British Retail Consortium is to survey its members to see how far they have got in meeting these undertakings, and I look forward to seeing the results of that survey.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will invoke EU Treaty Article 36 to prevent the importation of pigmeat which does not meet the same standards of production as required in the United Kingdom. [R] [73793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w17.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No; it is not possible to use Article 36 of the Treaty to impose higher UK standards on imports where EU law has been harmonised as it has been in the case of welfare standards for pigs. Furthermore, the UK ban on the use of Meat and Bone Meal (MBM) is not in place because there is a known risk to the health or life of humans or animals (a stipulation of Article 36) in feeding MBM to pigs. The MBM ban is in place to address the specific risk that, if pig or poultry feed were to contain MBM, there would be a real risk of contamination (accidental or deliberate) of ruminant feed with pig or poultry feed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w17.htm_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gill: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of whether the volume of pigmeat imported into the United Kingdom is consistent with the number of pigs produced in other countries without sow stalls and tethers and without feed containing MMB. [R] [73796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w17.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have made no such assessment.

 A further Progress Report on BSE in Great Britain was placed in the Library of the House today.
<P>

<a name="90303w18.htm_para0">The Report outlines the measures which have been taken to protect public health since June 1998, including legislation on the slaughter of sheep and goats suspected of having transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, notifications to the British Cattle Movement Service, cattle identification and the compulsory cull of offspring of BSE cases supporting the Date-based Export Scheme for UK beef. It summarises the results of action to enforce existing public health measures, and reports the launch of the Cattle Tracing System. An update on the number of cases of nvCJD is included.
<P>

<a name="90303w18.htm_para1">There is also a section on the protection of animal health covering controls on animal feed.

<P><I>3 Mar 1999 : Column: 796</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90303w18.htm_para2">The epidemiology section shows that the epidemic of BSE in the UK continues to decline. The number of clinically suspect cases of BSE reported in Great Britain has continued to fall and for 1998 was 23.5 per cent. less than for 1997 and 60 per cent. less than for 1996. A continued improvement is expected for the future. The section shows that 63 per cent. of UK herds with adult breeding cattle have never had a case of BSE. Furthermore 84 per cent. of beef suckler herds have never had a case of BSE. Reported incidence also shows that herds with more than four cases of BSE account for almost three quarters of all BSE cases, but represent less than one eighth of all herds.
<P>

<a name="90303w18.htm_para3">The section on the European perspective reports the EU Commission's agreement to the Date-based Export Scheme for lifting the EU export ban for UK beef from cattle born after 1 August 1996. It also covers the resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland, permitted for meat from export certified herds.

Since then Morocco has signed the Status of Forces Agreement and has agreed to formalise the presence of UNHCR in the Western Sahara. The mandate for MINURSO has been extended until the end of March 1999 to allow for further discussions between the UN and the Moroccan authorities on the remaining outstanding issues.

1. <P>

<P>

(14) assumes no change between 2025 and 2050.<P>

<P>

2. Projections to the year 2050 are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, given the number of assumptions that need to be made in making these estimates. Some of those who will be pensioners in 2050 have yet to begin work, and most are in their 20s and 30s.<P>

3. Estimates have been made by extrapolating estimates from the PENSIM model but these can only give a very broad indication of the likely order of magnitude of figures so far into the future. The projections can be applied to estimates of the proportion of pensioners on Income Support, but not to other income-related benefits (such as Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit) as projections for these benefits would require many more assumptions to be made and would be surrounded by an unacceptable level of uncertainty.<P>

4. It is our policy that the Minimum Income Guarantee will be increased in line with average earnings over time and as resources permit. For illustration, the first line shows the estimated effect of increasing Income Support only in line with prices over time. <P>

<P>

<a name="90303w19.htm_para6">As at August 1998 (the latest date for which information is available) there were approximately 17,000 pensioners in receipt of Income Support in the Barnsley and Doncaster local authority district. There were 1.65 million pensioners in receipt of Income Support across the country as a whole at the same date. Whilst we do not know the precise effect in each Local Authority area, across the country as a whole, in addition to existing Income Support recipients, we expect around 65,000 pensions will be newly eligible for the Minimum Income Guarantee as a result of the above-inflation increase in the income support rates in April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> For the Single Gateway, the personal adviser role has been graded at Executive Officer or equivalent in the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency and in Local Authorities. A personal adviser's salary will reflect the pay rate for the job within their employing agency. Their position on that scale will depend on how long they have been in the grade, their levels of performance in previous years and their location. Their average salary (excluding ERNIC; superannuation and other costs) is estimated to range between just over &#163;16,000 and just under &#163;18,000. We do not yet know the total average costs, including ERNIC, training etc--one of the reasons for piloting the proposals is to determine the total cost of employing personal advisers.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para1">The average salary for personal advisers working on the New Deal for Lone Parents (including ERNIC and superannuation) is estimated at &#163;20,783. The average cost of training, including travel and subsistence, is &#163;4,337 per adviser. New Deal for Lone Parent advisers occupy existing space in Jobcentres and are considered part of the Employment Service's core business: no extra costs are incurred.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 2 March 1999, c. 708-09]:</i> Last year in the Social Security Act we laid the foundations for a new system for handling decisions and appeals in benefits, child support and vaccine damage claims. My right hon. Friends the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Social Security will be laying the main Regulations, which will provide the detailed legal framework for this new system, tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para3">The new system for handling decisions and appeals is a major step to modernise the delivery of Social Security and child support as part of the Government's programme for welfare reform. The current system needs to change. It is confusing for claimants and staff. Putting mistakes right is complicated and claimants often have to appeal, 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 1999 : Column: 805</I><P>
even when a mistake is obvious to all concerned. Appeals take far too long to be cleared--on average seven months--even where they have no prospect of success. These delays are unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para4">The changes we are making will enable the Benefits Agency, Child Support Agency and Employment Service to provide a more helpful and accessible service to the public.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para5">Under the new system, decisions will continue to be based on the facts and the law, with a right of appeal to an independent tribunal. There will be clearer, simpler decisions and a programme to develop simpler communications for the public. There will be new arrangements for handling disputes, so mistakes are put right more easily without having to go to appeal. There will be one type of appeal tribunal, rather than five, with one unified set of rules and three, two or one member tribunals according to the issues raised by the appeal. Appeals, which have no prospect of success, will be resolved more quickly.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para6">The new arrangements will come into operation during the second half of this year. They will apply to child support from the beginning of June. For benefits they will be introduced in stages between July and November, to help maintain service to the public while the new arrangements start to operate.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para7">The Independent Tribunal Service will be replaced by The Appeals Service, which will encompass both the administration of appeals and the appeal tribunals. The administration of appeals will be undertaken from April 2000 by a new executive agency of this Department. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will set targets for the Agency, which will be published and reported on annually. The President of appeal tribunals and the panel members who hear appeals will be appointed by my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor and remain independent of this Department.
<P>

<a name="90303w20.htm_para8">Benefit claimants and child support clients will receive full information about what the new system means for them as the changes come into effect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w21.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> We have incorporated many of the approaches and techniques of "spotlight" into a programme of anti-fraud drives involving the Benefits Agency, local authorities, the Police and other agencies which target specific areas of fraud and abuse. Since May 1997 there have been no anti-fraud campaigns under the specific banner of "spotlight on benefit cheats". However, we have put more resources into the fight against fraud with the result that &#163;1.9 billion has been detected in 1997-98 compared with &#163;1.5 billion in 1996-97. As well as detecting fraud, we have tightened the checking of new Income Support claims so as to prevent fraud from entering the system from the outset. This will save an estimated &#163;200 million in the current year.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the method of setting exchange rates on entry to the euro for those who joined in January; and how the rate will be decided for the pound in the event of sterling being replaced by the euro.  [74124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90303w21.htm_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The rate at which sterling would enter the single currency would need to be consistent with economic fundamentals in the UK and compatible with sustainable convergence between the UK and the euro-area. This was the basis for the decision on the conversion rates of currencies which joined the single currency in January 1999.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The latest subnational population projections for English local and health authorities are based on the mid-1996 population estimates.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The assumptions underlying these latest projections are slightly different to the 1993 set. The main differences are that the new subnational projections use more recent data on fertility, mortality and migration to produce the baseline assumptions for each local authority; and that they sum to the latest national population projections for England that are produced by the Government Actuary's Department. The main difference to these assumptions is that the level of net international migration is now significantly higher in the medium term.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These data were subject to consultation with the local and health authorities and the assumptions were refined following comments received during this consultation exercise. Changes were made to the migration assumptions for local authorities if information was provided that indicated that the long term trends were unlikely to continue into the future. Other changes were made to address concerns raised about the quality and use of the internal migration data. Changes made as a result of the consultation for any one authority will affect the assumptions for all other authorities as the projections must sum to the national population projections. The ONS publication, <i>1996-based Subnational Population Projections, England</i> (PP3 no 10), due out later this year, will explain this in more detail.</FONT></UL>

 Statistics showing the standards of attainment by pupils in each local authority area are published in annual performance tables. A summary of recent results in the named areas are set out in the following tables. A sample of schools in each authority is inspected annually by OFSTED and reports published which include judgments about standards of attainment and the quality of education. A programme of inspections of all local education authorities is now being carried out by OFSTED, but none of the named authorities has yet been inspected. All authorities have just submitted for approval an Education Development Plan which includes a three-year programme for securing school improvement, and targets including those for pupil performance at ages 11 and 16 which will be monitored in future years.

 Statistical Information on the numbers of people with cystic fibrosis is not collected centrally. However, according to the clinical guidelines for cystic fibrosis care published jointly by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the British Paediatric Association and the British Thoracic Society in 1996, there were an estimated 6,250 people with cystic fibrosis in the United Kingdom in 1994.

<a name="90303w24.htm_para6">Information for all prescriptions dispensed to people with cystic fibrosis is not available. Most drugs dispensed to people with cystic fibrosis are not specific to that condition. However, both pancreatin preparations and dornase alfa are specifically indicated for the management of cystic fibrosis. In 1997, the net ingredient cost of these drugs dispensed in the community in England was &#163;5.0 million and &#163;9.0 million respectively. The net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug and does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.

 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the methodology of choice in the investigation of spinal conditions. However, we have no plans to replace invasive procedures entirely. For some patients unsuitable for MRI, invasive procedures may remain necessary. It is for clinicians to use their skills, knowledge and experience to weigh carefully the likely benefits of any treatment or procedure against the anticipated risk for the patient and, following discussion with the patient, to exercise their clinical judgment accordingly.

 No deaths have occurred as a direct result of the use of control and restraint techniques by nursing staff at the Norvic Clinic in Norwich. A black Afro-Caribbean patient was pronounced dead on 31 October 1998 after an incident in which control and restraint techniques were being applied, but the Coroner's Inquest into that case has yet to be held.
<P>

<a name="90303w25.htm_para0">Between 2 November 1997 and 4 December 1998 there were 45 occasions when control and restraint techniques were applied by nursing staff. No injuries were sustained by patients as a result of those procedures. Four members of staff were injured during the incidents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research his Department has commissioned into allergic reactions in children.  [74292]<P>

<a name="90303w25.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department's policy research programme and the National Health Service research and development programmes are supporting a range of research on allergies in children and adults and will continue to do so. The Medical Research Council, the main agency through which the Government supports biomedical and clinical research, by means of a grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology in the Department of Trade and Industry, is also funding relevant research, including the study of infections, immunity and inflammations, which will underpin work on allergies.
