<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Aviation fuel is an expensive commodity and, other than in an emergency, there is no reason why pilots or airlines would want to jettison it. The Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, "Aviation and the Global Atmosphere" (1999 citing research from 1994) indicates that most of the small amount of fuel that is jettisoned at low altitude in the troposphere evaporates while it falls.

[96126]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many incidents have been recorded of people in charge of aeroplanes being apprehended for <i>(a)</i> alcohol and <i>(b)</i> drugs abuse in each of the last five years.  [96520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority's Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme requires the reporting of incidents resulting in flight crew incapacitation within the UK or on UK registered aircraft. Prior to the recently reported incident in Sweden, a search of the database has revealed only one confirmed incident in the past five years where the pilot of an aircraft has been arrested in connection with the consumption of alcohol. This occurred following a private aircraft accident in 1998. The pilot failed a voluntary police breath test&#151;at the road traffic limit&#151;shortly after the accident and was subsequently 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2003 : Column 459W</I><P>
prosecuted. The MOR database also records two fatal air crashes during this period, where the resulting post mortem examinations revealed the presence of alcohol and/or drugs in the bodies of the pilots.

<a name="30207w01.html_wqn9"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to open up to competition the connection of street lighting.  [95498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 At present connections of street lighting columns can only be undertaken by Distribution Network Operators. Ofgem is taking this matter forward. Ofgem's intention is to permit local authorities to hire contractors directly to undertake jointing of street lighting columns to distribution networks. The development of a "contractor competence registration scheme" should facilitate the introduction of true competition by independent contractors working on behalf of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30207w01.html_para1">I recently introduced a new regulation, (regulation 25) to The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002 which addresses issues around public safety and network integrity which facilitates competition in connections for street lighting and other applications.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many of the notices issued by police for untaxed cars in each of the last five years were the subject of prosecutions by the DVLA.  [95981]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 DVLA only holds information on enforcement results from 1999&#150;2000. Some cases are settled out of court by way of payment of a penalty. The number of reports received from police and traffic wardens of successful completions were as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 None. Naval vessels have not been developed to counter specific terrorist threats but provide capabilities of wide utility in potential counter-terrorism operations at home and overseas. Small armed craft are employed when necessary. The Strategic Defence Review: New Chapter, published in July 2002, 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2003 : Column 460W</I><P>
set out the Ministry of Defence's strategic thinking on how to counter international terrorism both at home and abroad. It looked again at Ministry of Defence's posture and plans to ensure that there are the right concepts, the right capabilities and the right forces to meet the additional challenges of international terrorism within the land, sea and air environments. It stated that "we will continue to keep under close review and, where appropriate, make adjustments to, our arrangements to counter ship-borne threats".

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what monitoring procedures have been put in place to assess depleted uranium in blood and urine.  [95918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Royal Society reports on "The Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions" consider three levels of exposure to DU:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Level I&#151;exposures to personnel in a vehicle that is struck by a DU penetrator, or to personnel entering a struck vehicle immediately, typically to assist injured comrades.
<P>
<BR>
Level II&#151;exposures following combat, typically to personnel working in or on contaminated vehicles to carry out repairs.
<P>
<BR>
Level III&#151;all other exposures, for example, being downwind of an impact or fire involving DU, or brief entry into contaminated vehicles.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30207w02.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence accepts these definitions, but in recognition of some veterans' concerns, has extended the definition of Level III personnel to include everyone in a military theatre of operations where DU is likely to have been used.




<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2003 : Column 461W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30207w02.html_para1">All those considered to have received a Level I or Level II exposure while in theatre (according to the Royal Society definitions) will be advised to accept testing for uranium exposure. All other troops in theatre will also have the opportunity to be tested for uranium exposure if they wish.
<P>

<a name="30207w02.html_para2">MOD's full policy for biological monitoring for depleted uranium (DU) on current and future operations is published on MOD's internet site at: http://www. mod.uk/issues/depleted(uranium/du(biomonitoring/htm.
<P>

<a name="30207w02.html_para3">As part of the public consultation process on provision of a screening programme for estimating DU exposure, it was agreed that a urine test would be more appropriate than a blood test. This is also in accordance with the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) guidance on personal monitoring. Their recommendations are for monitoring of urine of faeces or for monitoring the lungs by whole body counting. There is therefore no requirement for blood to be monitored.

<a name="30207w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Up to 192 rounds will be fired. The exact number will be determined as the firing programme progresses.

 These firings will be subject to the same environmental monitoring programmes that have been in place at Kirkcudbright ever since the beginning of the Depleted Uranium munitions trials announced in the House in 1979.

<a name="30207w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No recent discussions have taken place with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over the effects of test-firing depleted uranium (DU) shells. All firings are subject to regulation under the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999, which are enforced by the HSE. The HSE needs only to be notified if a new process is used; the processes used for firing DU have not changed since the firing programme began. HSE representatives last visited Kirkcudbright range in January 2001 and confirmed they were content with the health and safety arrangements for firing DU.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 This information is not held by the Ministry of Defence since the claiming of any benefits by eligible Service personnel is a private matter for the individuals concerned. However, in the case of Income Support, I understand that the website of the Department for Work and Pensions outlines the eligibility criteria for this benefit, including the condition that applicants must work, on average, less than 16 hours a week. It seems improbable therefore that any regular Service personnel would be eligible to claim Income Support.

<a name="30207w02.html_para6">When personnel are temporarily deployed away from their permanent LOA earning duty station, they no longer incur the full range of additional costs associated with that station. However, it is accepted that they still have ongoing financial commitments overseas and that many have families who remain at the permanent duty station. Consequently all Service personnel continue to receive the full LOA rate for the first 17 days of their deployment. Additionally married accompanied personnel continue to receive their full LOA rate unless their accompanying spouse also leaves the permanent duty station for more than 17 days at which point an abatement of approximately 35% is applied. Single and married unaccompanied personnel lose 20% of their fall LOA rate after the first 17 days.

<P>

<a name="30207w03.html_para1">The revised domestic violence policy and the guidance issued to prosecutors in November 2001 contain many references to the importance of consultation and seeking the views of the victim.

<P>

<a name="30207w03.html_para2">In addition, as in any non-domestic violence case, the Code for Crown Prosecutors requires prosecutors to take into account views expressed by the victim. Consultation may also take place: in accordance with the Attorney-General's guidelines when the prosecution is considering a plea to a lesser charge; or, as part of the Direct Communication with Victims initiative; or, by way of a Victim Personal Statement.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> The trial of Thomas Sugden was concluded at Burnley Crown Court on 13 January 2003 having been adjourned on three previous occasions.
<P>

<a name="30207w03.html_para5">On 14 February 2002, the first occasion, the prosecution applied for an adjournment of the trial due to the unavailability of three prosecution witnesses, two of whom were sick and one who was working abroad. The case was re-listed to be heard during the week commencing 8 April 2002. The second adjournment was generated by the Crown Court at Burnley, in common with other Crown Courts in the country closing as a mark of respect following the death of the Queen Mother. The matter was briefly mentioned at court on 17 April 2002, when a judicial direction was given that the matter be placed in the court list for 1 July 2002.
<P>

<a name="30207w03.html_para6">The third adjournment was due to a civilian prosecution witness failing to attend to give evidence on the scheduled start date for trial of 2 July 2002. The reason provided to the court was that she was unwell and anxious as she was, at this time, heavily pregnant. A sick note to cover her absence was produced. The prosecution had indicated that they would proceed without this witness but defence counsel indicated that he wished to cross examine this witness and her attendance was therefore essential. The other prosecution witnesses who were distressed by the need to adjourn again were given full explanations which were personally conveyed to them by representatives from the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="30207w03.html_para7">Following two pre-trial reviews at which the availability and willingness of witnesses to attend were resolved, the matter was adjourned to a further trial date of 13 January 2003. One of the reasons for so lengthy an adjournment was because of the expected date of confinement of the above mentioned prosecution witness.




<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2003 : Column 467W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30207w03.html_para8">The matter commenced on 13 January 2003 before His Honour Judge Cornwall at Burnley Crown Court. The principal prosecution witness gave her evidence. The trial Judge expressed his concern in relation to this evidence, and the Crown reviewed the case. In the light of these developments it became apparent that the proceedings would be unlikely to generate a realistic prospect of a conviction and the case was therefore terminated. Prosecuting Counsel held an immediate conference with the the prosecution witnesses explaining to them why such a step had had to be taken.

 We have issued no specific guidance to hospital trusts and primary care trusts for the provision of services to lymphoedema sufferers.

<P>

<a name="30207w04.html_para7">The guidance recommends that cancer networks should agree guidelines for identification and management of lymphoedema and that a lymphoedema service, staffed by nurses and physiotherapists who have experience in dealing with this problem, should be available for all patients who experience arm swelling or discomfort.

 The Department of Health does not routinely collect statistics on the prevalence of individual conditions like lymphoedema. We do have data on the number of finished consultant episodes (FCE) where the main diagnosis is lymphoedema. An FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within a year.

Any credible information is fully investigated. An investigation which yields evidence that an organisation or individuals are supporting terrorism will result in action being taken.

 The Government has made clear its commitment to effective monitoring of the end-use of defence exports, including to Iran. The most effective way to do this is through rigorous assessment at the export licensing stage. Both the synchros and the HMX pellets do have a possible military use. However HMG is as satisfied as we reasonably can be that both of these items are intended only for the legitimate end-use stated. We judged that the risk of these goods being diverted for use by the Iranian military was minimal.

 The Department has not received any estimates for the cost of disposing of horses via the food chain. Horse carcases that are not intended for human consumption are normally disposed of via knacker yards or hunt kennels. We understand that knacker yard charges are in the region of &#163;100 for animals that are shot and around &#163;140 for injected animals. The cost of disposing of animal carcases via hunt kennels varies from area to area. Many hunts subsidise their service and impose little or no cost.

 The timetable will depend on whether or not the Secretary of State calls a public inquiry into the designation order submitted by the Countryside Agency. This will be determined when all objections and representations received have been considered after the period for public consultation on the order ends on 28 February. If, as is anticipated, an inquiry is required, then it will probably be 2006 when the Secretary of State is able to decide whether or not to confirm the designation order. A full National Park authority, if it were decided to establish one, would probably come into being the following year. If there were no public inquiry, the decision on the designation order could be made this year.

[95943]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w08.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a power for landowners and tenants to close land for any reason for up to 28 days each year. The Act also makes provision for any person with an interest in land to apply to their relevant authority (the Countryside Agency, or, in national parks, the National Park Authority) to restrict or exclude access on the grounds of land management, public safety or to avoid the risk of fire. It would be open to landowners who before the Act charged a fee for entrance to their land to apply to their relevant authority for a restriction or exclusion of access to enable them to continue to charge for entry to that land but would have to show that one of the three criteria is met.
<P>

<a name="30207w08.html_para0">On our behalf, the Countryside Agency is developing guidance for relevant authorities on the operation of the restrictions and exclusions system. It is considering what guidance to give relevant authorities on applications for restrictions and exclusions of access for the purpose of charging a fee for entry to the land.

 The costs involved in transporting radioactive material, including the costs of ensuring that appropriate levels of physical protection are applied to the material during transport, are a commercial matter for the companies involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30207w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The number of fuel poor households in England is estimated to have fallen by one million between 1996 and 1998, from 4.3 million in 1996 to 3.3 million in 1998. Most of this reduction is thought to be due to changes in energy prices and incomes.
<P>

<a name="30207w08.html_para1">It is recognised that for those in severe fuel poverty improvements in energy efficiency will be needed to remove these households from fuel poverty. Improvements, and increased funding, for the key programmes to improve energy efficiency were put in place after 1998.

 The Government continue to be supportive of the aerospace industry in the UK. The Department's principle support to the civil aerospace sector is provided through the Aeronautics Research Programme (formerly known as CARAD) and through repayable launch investment. Expenditure on research and development to meet the UK's defence needs is a matter for the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="30207w08.html_para12">For civil aeronautics research, the value of grants paid from April 1995 through to March 2002 totalled over &#163;145 million, averaging over &#163;20 million per year. Forecast expenditure for the period April 2002 to March 2005 is also expected to exceed &#163;20 million annually. Since April 1995 we have also committed in the order of &#163;1 billion in launch investment for major new aircraft and engine projects.
