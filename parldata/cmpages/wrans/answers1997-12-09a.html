<a name="71209w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Our White Paper on the future of the NHS in Scotland, "Designed to Care", is published today. Copies have been laid before the House. Copies are available in the Library of the House and the Vote Office.




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1997 : Column: 492</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71209w01.html_para0">Our objective is a modernised patient-centred health service designed to ensure that wherever patients make use of the services of the NHS they receive the highest quality care. We will create a seamless service which gives patients continuity of care from GP through hospital to rehabilitation. And we will harness new technologies to improve reliability and effectiveness of patient care.
<P>

<a name="71209w01.html_para1">The White Paper sets out clearly the system which will replace the internal market in health care. The cost of the internal market has been fragmentation, bureaucracy and the beginning of a two-tier service. Our proposals will save &#163;100 million over the lifetime of this Parliament, money which will be reinvested in patient care. "Designed to Care" honours our commitment to retain the central role for primary care whilst removing the disadvantages of GP fundholding. We will do this by giving strong organisational support to primary care through the creation of Primary Care Trusts, which will allow professionals to take the lead in combining locally to organise health services for the benefit of all patients in their area. We have retained distinct roles for those responsible for strategy and those responsible for service delivery to promote devolved decision-making.
<P>

<a name="71209w01.html_para2">"Designed to Care" re-focuses NHS Trusts on improving services to patients and gives clinicians and those who use their services a bigger say in their management. We are committed to fewer NHS Trusts, and the White Paper sets out the criteria to guide this process to a speedy conclusion.
<P>

<a name="71209w01.html_para3">"Designed to Care" sets out our vision for the future of the NHS in Scotland, with solutions suited to Scottish needs. It lays the foundation for the work of the Scottish Parliament in continuing to improve the health of the people of Scotland.

<P>
<a name="71209w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We are unaware of any such discussions. However, the fourth report of the Standing Working Group on the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material of DG XVII has recently been submitted to the Commission and will be submitted to the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions. We have no plans to issue any further report on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71209w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Transporters of radioactive material within the United Kingdom are required, by statutory safety regulation, to have contingency plans in place to respond to accidents. The UK transporters of mixed oxide fuel have such plans in place for air and sea modes.

 The Franchising Director operates financial incentive regimes under franchise agreements which supplement the pressure of market forces where necessary; intercity train operating companies are not covered by such regimes. The regimes reward or penalise operators according to performance compared with historical benchmarks. Details of these appear in the Franchising Director's quarterly bulletins and in his Annual Report which are in the Library of the House.

<a name="71209w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The information is given below. There has been a number of changes in local authority responsibilities in the period covered. In particular;

in April 1993 responsibility for further education was transferred to the Further Education Funding Council;
<BR>
from 1994-95 onwards, Care in the Community responsibilities were transferred to local authorities;
<BR>
in 1997-98 budgeted expenditure decreased by some &#163;500 million as the result of the introduction of the nursery voucher scheme.

There are some minor textual changes to the claims handling procedures described in the new draft scheme to reflect practice in the Firearms Compensation Section, and three items have been added to the list of ancillary equipment qualifying for compensation at Annex B of the scheme: speedloaders, speedloader pouches and spare parts held by registered dealers. While these items were not included explicitly under the previous published scheme, compensation has been paid for them on an exceptional basis.

 A Home Office circular to chief police officers containing guidance about the use of handcuffs was withdrawn on 23 January 1997. This was replaced by guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) which reflects the provision in section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders. I am placing a copy of the ACPO guidance in the Library.

This sum is to ensure that police authorities have funds available which would allow them to increase spending on meeting the key objectives for the police in 1998-99. This could include the recruitment of additional police officers if the chief constable considers that this is the most beneficial way of delivering the objectives.

 In the year to 31 March 1997, &#163;80 million net VAT was received from veterinary practices. Figures are not separately available for VAT on veterinary surgeons' fees and medicines sold by veterinary surgeries, as veterinary practices are not required to show these amounts separately on their VAT returns. The Government have no plans to reduce the level of VAT on such supplies. However, there is already a VAT zero rate on veterinary medicines where they are supplied to animal welfare charities that provide treatment to sick animals.

 The policy on the VAT treatment of domiciliary care services depends upon their nature. Where those services constitute medical care or welfare they are exempt from VAT. Domestic services such as laundry, cleaning, etc. do not qualify for VAT relief under any exemption. However, many of these are provided by people below the threshold for VAT and are tax free.

<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as the Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), to your recent question on the sampling arrangements for various surveys and the disaggregation of survey analyses to a Scottish level.
<BR>
As regards the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) and the General Household Survey (GHS), samples include the mainland part of Scotland north of the Caledonian Canal (i.e. line from Fort William to Inverness) but do not include the islands.
<BR>
The samples are designed to be representative of Scotland, minus the islands, and some analyses from these surveys are produced for Scotland. However, the sample sizes are not large enough to produce reliably all the analyses available for Great Britain.
<BR>
The New Earnings Survey (NES) is a 1% sample of employees in Great Britain who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) income tax schemes. The sample includes employees north of the Caledonian Canal. Results from the NES can be disaggregated to unitary authority level in Scotland.
<BR>
The Family Resources Survey (FRS) is sponsored by the Department of Social Security. It does not include samples from the area north of the Caledonian Canal due to the disproportionate fieldwork costs in this area. Some analyses are (can be) produced for the population of Scotland south of the Caledonian Canal but 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1997 : Column: 510</I><P>
the sample sizes are not large enough for all the analyses that are available for Great Britain. The information on this survey was provided by a statistician from the Government Statistical Service within the Department of Social Security.
<BR>
ONS co-ordinates the user requirements for a number of nation-wide surveys--including the FES, GHS and NES--in consultation with other government departments including the Scottish Office. Departmental requests for increases in the sample sizes of these surveys in particular areas, and their source of funding, are considered along with all other requests for information from the surveys. There are no plans to increase the sample size of the FRS in Scotland.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what arrangements will be made for determining changes to the budgets of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales under devolution; and if he will make a statement. [20062]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71209w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Government set out their position on the funding of the budgets for the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales in the White Papers published in July (Cm 3658 and Cm 3718). The key to these arrangements is block budgets which the devolved Administrations, like the Secretaries of State now, will be free to deploy between the functions under their control in response to local priorities. Changes in these block budgets will be linked to changes in equivalent English spending plans by the Barnett formula which gives Scotland and Wales a population-based share of planned changes in comparable spending in England.
<P>

<a name="71209w06.html_para1">In order to help inform debate about these arrangements during the passage of the Scotland and Wales Bills, the Government published yesterday a statement of the principles which govern the existing block/formula arrangements and which will continue to do so under devolution. A copy of the statement is appended. Copies were placed yesterday in the Libraries of both Houses and referred to by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales when he opened the Second Reading debate on the Government of Wales Bill.
<P>

<a name="71209w06.html_para2">Although the block and formula arrangements have operated for nearly 20 years, this is the first time that these principles have been spelt out in public.


<BR>
Principles to govern determination of the block budgets for the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales
<BR>
1. The Government set out its position on the Block and formula arrangements in its White Papers on Scottish and Welsh devolution published in July (Cm 3658 and Cm 3718 respectively). The Scottish White Paper, <i>Scotland's Parliament,</i> said:
<BR>
"In practice these arrangements, based on the Block and formula, have produced fair settlements for Scotland in annual public expenditure rounds and have allowed the Secretary of State for Scotland to determine his spending decisions in accordance with Scottish needs and priorities. They have largely removed the need for annual negotiation between the Scottish Office and the Treasury. The Government have therefore concluded that the financial 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1997 : Column: 511</I><P>
framework for the Scottish Parliament should be based on these existing arrangements with, in future, the Scottish Parliament determining Scottish spending priorities."
<BR>
The Wales White Paper, <i>A Voice for Wales,</i> said:
<BR>
"The Government proposes that the financial arrangements for the Assembly will largely replicate the existing system.
<BR>
Annual changes to the Welsh Block will be calculated by the population-based formula used at the moment. These arrangements based on the Block and formula have worked in practice, producing fair settlements for Wales in annual public expenditure rounds."
<BR>
2. The Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales will therefore have block budgets, which they will be free to allocate in response to local priorities among the functions under their control and for which they will be accountable to local people. This note outlines the principles set out in the White Papers and describes how they will govern changes made to these block budgets under devolution.



<BR>
<i>Setting Scotland's and Wales' shares of UK public expenditure: the "Barnett" formula</i>
<BR>
<i>Existing position</i>
<BR>
3. All UK tax revenues are pooled. Decisions about the allocation of UK public expenditure are made in the light of the Government's judgement of relative priorities and relative needs. Changes to the shares of public expenditure available to the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales are determined by a formula linked to changes in provision for equivalent spending programmes in England.
<BR>
4. This formula, which has operated for almost 20 years, is known as the "Barnett" formula. It provides that, in settling new plans for public expenditure, Scotland and Wales should receive a share of the planned cash changes in provision for equivalent public services in England which is proportionate to their population. In other words, Scotland's and Wales' shares of changes in relevant planned spending in England are the same proportions as their populations represent of England's population. The formula applies only to changes in spending plans, not to the underlying baselines which remain unaffected. The formula also applies only to changes in the block budgets: expenditure in Scotland and Wales, and expenditure on nationalised industries in Scotland, is outside the block budgets at present and is settled separately.
<BR>
<i>After devolution</i>
<BR>
5. These arrangements will continue under devolution, with only minor adjustments. Changes to the block budgets for which the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales will become responsible will continue to be determined by a formula linked to changes in provision for the equivalent spending programmes in England. The formula will continue to be based on relative populations. The spending for which the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales will assume responsibility is set out in the annexes to this note.
<BR>
6. The Government intends that these population shares will be re-calculated annually on the basis of the latest population estimates for England, Scotland and Wales published each year by the Office of National Statistics. The population ratios will next be updated for the purpose of determining changes in the Scottish and Welsh block budgets for 1999-2000.



<BR>
7. The Government intends that this population-based formula will apply to changes in almost all the expenditure under the control of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales. It will not apply to changes in agriculture programmes 100 per cent. funded by the EU. The Government will also want to consider whether this approach or another formula is appropriate in relation to provision for Council Tax Benefit and Housing Benefit which will both come within the Scottish Block for the first time after devolution; Housing Benefit is already within the Welsh Block, but, as in Scotland, Council Tax Benefit will come within the Block for the first time.




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1997 : Column: 512</I><P>

<BR>
<i>Adjustments to the Scottish and Welsh block budgets not determined by the Barnett formula</i>
<BR>
8. There are a number of circumstances in which the block budgets under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland and Wales are open to adjustment other than on the basis of the Barnett formula. These exceptions will continue to apply under devolution. Adjustments may be made where:
<BR>
(a) the UK Government decides to make a uniform general adjustment to public expenditure programmes;
<BR>
(b) action taken by the Scottish or Welsh administrations in a devolved area has knock-on costs for the UK Government or vice versa. The block budgets may be adjusted downwards to compensate for costs incurred by the UK Government as a result of the action of the devolved administrations, or upwards to compensate the devolved administrations for costs which they incur as a result of actions by the UK Government and are not allowed for through the operation of the Barnett formula. The block budgets will not however be adjusted upwards by reason of additional costs incurred as a result of actions by the UK Government which the UK Government is expecting English departments with parallel responsibilities to absorb within existing spending plans;
<BR>
(c) the devolved administrations receive capital receipts as a result of a privatisation or major change in the role of the public sectors in Scotland or Wales. In these circumstances, the block budgets may be adjusted downwards in the year in which the receipts occur to reflect the continuing interest in these receipts of UK taxpayers as a whole who financed the underlying capital assets in the past. Proceeds from the sales of other capital assets under the control of the Scottish Parliament or National Assembly for Wales will be available to be re-cycled within Scotland or Wales;
<BR>
(d) the devolved administrations receive significant trading surpluses from the commercial exploitation of publicly funded assets: the Uk Government may take these surpluses into account in settling block budgets;
<BR>
(e) local authority self-financed expenditure grows more rapidly than equivalent expenditure in England over a period and in such a way as to threaten targets set for public expenditure as part of the management of the UK economy. In such circumstances it will be open to the UK Government to take the excess into account in considering the level of the block budgets.
<BR>
9. These principles concern the determination of changes to the block budgets under the control of the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, not the level of Westminster grant to support these budgets. The latter may also be affected by changes in the level of self-financed items of expenditure--local authority capital expenditure funded by borrowing, for example--which currently count towards the block Budgets.
<BR>
<i>In-year changes to the block budgets for Scotland and Wales</i>

10. The arrangements outlined above apply to changes in the plans for expenditure in future years in Scotland and Wales. These paragraphs deal with changes in-year to the budgets arrived at under the arrangements outlined above and in particular with access to the UK Reserve for the devolved Scottish and Welsh administrations.
<BR>
11. The general presumption, as at present, is that the Scottish and Welsh administrations will contain in-year pressures on their budgets by re-allocating priorities within their Blocks, not through access to the UK Reserve. Access to the Reserve may however be considered at the discretion of the UK Government in exceptional circumstances and specifically where:
<BR>
(a) the Government is making available additional provision in-year for equivalent services in England in order to cope with exceptional circumstances affecting the UK as a whole unforeseen at the time spending plans for the year concerned were settled; and




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1997 : Column: 513</I><P>

<BR>
(b) Scotland or Wales face exceptional and unforeseen domestic costs--arising, for example, from a natural disaster--which cannot be reasonably absorbed within the planned block budgets without major dislocation to existing services.
<BR>
<i>Revising these principles</i>
<BR>
12. As noted above, the formula will be updated annually to take account of population changes and from time to time to take account of other technical changes. Any more substantial revision would need to be preceded by an in-depth study of relative spending requirements and would be the subject of full consultation between the devolved administrations and the UK Government.

This information will be used by the Commission in conjunction with similar reports from the other member states to identify where there is a significant need for co-ordinated research at a European level. It is not yet possible to say which subjects, if any, the Commission will identify as suitable for this kind of treatment but no areas have been ruled out.

 Today I shall be making a public announcement about investing in Young People, a strategy designed to tackle the problem of under-achievement, widen the range and improve the quality of education and training available to young people aged 14-18 and prepare them for the world of work. The strategy is aimed at making sure as many as 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1997 : Column: 523</I><P>
possible of our young people stay on in education and training after the age of 16, and that everyone in this age group achieves their full potential. As a Government we are committed to ensuring that all education and training for these young people provide the essential foundation for lifelong employability.
<P>

<a name="71209w09.html_para3">The measures which make up the investing in Young People strategy include:


<BR>
I. All schools to set targets for raising attainment of qualifications at NVQ Level 2 at age 16.
<BR>
II. Widening the range of vocational options and the work relevance of the curriculum for 14-16 year olds.
<BR>
III. Introducing a single school leaving date at the end of June each year, so that no child should be able to leave school, in the year they become 16, until they have had a chance to sit for GCSE or other external examinations.
<BR>
IV. Measures to help young people plan and manage their own learning--including a new National Record of Achievement.
<BR>
V. The introduction of a Learning Card, promoting young people's entitlement to continue in learning post-16.
<BR>
VI. Refocusing the Careers Service to target support and guidance on those who need it most.
<BR>
VII. Developing a New Start strategy to re-engage disaffected young people from age 14 upwards in learning, where they have already dropped out or are in danger of doing so.
<BR>
VIII. Legislating to ensure that all young employees--with the support of their employer--can undertake education and training up to NVQ Level 2.
<BR>
IX. Introducing National Traineeships as a high-quality work-based route to NVQ level 2, building on the successful Modern Apprenticeships and including key skills.
<BR>
X. Raising Standards by improving the quality of all post-16 provision: setting targets, identifying success, spreading good practice, and eliminating failure.

<a name="71209w09.html_para4">Schools, colleges TECs, careers services and the Youth Service all have a part to play in achieving our goals. But the involvement of employers is also essential.

<P>
<a name="71209w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade (1) what export controls her Department operates in respect of the export of mixed oxide fuel; [18495]
<P>
<UL>(2) what non-proliferation measures her Department undertakes in respect of the export of mixed oxide fuel;[18492]
<P>
(3) what assessment she has made of the compliance of United Kingdom <i>(a)</i> manufacture and <i>(b)</i> export of mixed oxide fuel with the United Kingdom's international obligations in respect of (i) export control and (ii) non-proliferation. [18497]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71209w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The UK's export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related goods are derived from international nuclear non-proliferation commitments and membership of international nuclear export control regimes, in particular the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) whose members have agreed common guidelines for the transfer of nuclear and nuclear-related goods and technology.
<P>

<a name="71209w11.html_para0">These commitments are given effect in the relevant legislation, which in this case is Council Regulation (EC) No. 3381/94 on the export of dual use goods and the related Council Decision 94/942/CSFP as amended.
<P>

<a name="71209w11.html_para1">In accordance with the legislation, mixed oxide fuel (MOX) requires an export licence. Individual applications for licences for exports of MOX are considered on their merits, but before any licence is issued certain conditions have to be fulfilled. These include assurances from the recipient government:


<BR>
that the goods will not be used for any purpose that would result in any nuclear explosive device;
<BR>
that the goods will be placed under effective physical protection;
<BR>
that the transfer will only take place once the receiving State has brought into an agreement with the IAEA requiring the application of safeguards on all source and special fissionable materials in its current and future peaceful activities;
<BR>
that the goods would only be transferred to a third country if the recipient country had provided the same assurances as those required by the supplier for the original transfer.

<P>

<a name="71209w11.html_para2">Both the manufacture and export of MOX are entirely consistent with the UK's international obligations in the field of export control and non-proliferation. In addition to the controls on the export of MOX outlined above, all civil nuclear materials in the UK, including MOX, are subject to Euratom safeguards.

<P>
<a name="71209w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 All employees, whether temporary or not, have the same statutory rights, some of which depend on the length of service. Many employment rights apply as soon as an employee starts work, including protection against unlawful deductions from wages, against adverse treatment on grounds of sex, race, disability, trade union membership or non-membership or activities, or for taking specified types of action on health and safety grounds, and against dismissal for maternity-related reasons or for seeking to enforce statutory rights.

 The Government's broad energy policy is to ensure secure, diverse and sustainable energy.

 Stakeholder Pensions will be a new type of pension scheme which will provide simple, secure, flexible and value-for-money pension arrangements for many of those who do not have the opportunity to build a secure retirement income under the current system; they include many women, part-time workers, those on temporary contracts and many of the self-employed.
<P>

<a name="71209w12.html_para0">In developing and promoting Stakeholder Pensions, the Government sees a key role for new partnerships involving financial services organisations, employers, employees, trades unions and other affinity groups. The Stakeholder Pension consultation document seeks views on how a detailed framework may best be established which allows these partnerships to develop.

<P>
<a name="71209w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Independent research suggests that the average additional income for lone parents already in work and on Family Credit is over &#163;50 a week above the estimate of their out-of-work income. Research also shows that lone parents want to work but face a number of barriers that prevent them from doing so. In particular, they need practical help with job-search, training and with finding and paying for childcare. The Government has provided all of this with the New Deal for Lone Parents and the National Childcare Strategy. This will help make the transition to work seem much more attractive to those lone parents who currently feel trapped in benefit dependency.
<P>

<a name="71209w12.html_para2">The Government has taken steps to preserve work incentives for lone parents who are already receiving Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance. Those who are receiving either of these benefits with the lone parent rate of family premium at 5 April 1998 will be able to claim the lone parent rate of Child Benefit after 31 May 1998 if they move off benefit into work.

 Information is not collected centrally that would enable an estimate to be made of the costs of treating people aged 60-64. Treatment for people aged 65 and over, who make up about 16 per cent. of the population, accounts for about 40 per cent. of expenditure on hospital and community health services. Elderly people use a proportionately greater volume of services than those used by the rest of the adult population, primarily because their incidence of disease is higher, but also because their pace of recovery after illness may be somewhat slower. People aged 75 and over in particular show more complex patterns of health problems. They often have a combination of several conditions and these may be complicated by general frailty and social problems such as the recent death of a spouse or relatives living some distance away.

 One of the selection criteria for the General Practitioner Commissioning Group pilots was that they should have plans to work closely with carers and patients in planning and commissioning services. Each GP Commissioning Group will need to explore locally how best to achieve this. The pilots are to be

<a name="71209w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We have no plans to introduce national prescribing policies specific to Aricept or beta-interferon. EL(94)72, issued in 1994, asked health authorities to set up Area Prescribing Committees to ensure the appropriateness of hospital-led prescribing and to develop authority-wide policies for the managed entry of new drugs such as Aircept and beta-interferon into the NHS. Copies of EL(94)72 are available in the Library.

<a name="71209w14.html_para2">The White Paper, published today, sets out plans for a National Institute for Clinical Excellence which advises the NHS on the clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments. Individual health authorities will then be able to make more informed judgments on the relative benefits of treatments.

<a name="71209w14.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Department has not directly commissioned any research into the resistance of tuberculosis to drugs. The main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body which receives its grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology, which is part of the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC supports a number of studies into tuberculosis and these take the form of both grants to Universities and research funded in its own Units and Institutes. In 1995-96, the MRC's spend on tuberculosis research was &#163;1.5 million. However, little of this research addresses the issue of drug resistance <i>directly</i><i></i>; it is largely basic research which will underpin and inform future work in the area.
<P>

<a name="71209w14.html_para3">The Department and its expert advisers do keep under review the results of studies in this field.
<P>

<a name="71209w14.html_para4">The Public Health Laboratory Service, together with similar organisations throughout the United Kingdom, has heightened its surveillance of drug resistance in tuberculosis. An Expert Working Group has been set up under the Interdepartmental Working Group on Tuberculosis to make recommendations for the prevention and control of tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients and of drug resistant tuberculosis. Consultation on its draft guidance has been completed and the final report is expected to be issued shortly.

 The action the Government are taking to abolish the internal market and reduce bureaucracy, including the changes announced in the White Paper "The New NHS" (Cm 3807), which has been published today, will reduce the amount spent on management costs by &#163;1 billion over the lifetime of the Parliament.

 The White Paper "The New NHS" (Cm 3807), which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced to the House today, sets out the Government's plans for Primary Care Groups which will bring together general practitioners and community nurses to commission services.

<a name="71209w15.html_para0">The new arrangements will offer them the opportunity to shape services for their patients. They will have available their population's share of the local resources for hospital and community services, prescribing and the general practice infrastructure, and will have the opportunity to deploy resources and savings to strengthen local services and ensure that patterns of care best reflect their patients' needs. Further details are contained in the White Paper.
