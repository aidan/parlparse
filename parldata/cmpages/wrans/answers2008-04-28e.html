 The UN published its report on the Somali Region of Ethiopia in September 2007. The UN has not published a further report since. We welcomed the Ethiopian Government&#146;s acceptance of the UN assessment team&#146;s appraisal and we continue to urge the Ethiopian Government to adhere to its commitments in relation to the report&#151;opening-up of trade routes, lifting restrictions on movement, allowing food aid to reach all parts of the region and allowing non-governmental organisations greater access. However, we continue to be concerned at the risk of further human suffering and therefore look forward to full implementation of the report&#146;s findings. The UK continues to raise this with the Government of Ethiopia at regular intervals. My noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown raised this issue when he met Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in late January. Most recently, our ambassador in Addis Ababa discussed ways to improve the situation in the Somali region with the Ethiopian Foreign Minister in March.</p>

 The Government are aware that in some circumstances the use of biodiesel blends can be associated with bacterial contamination in fuel tanks. The problem tends to arise particularly where the biodiesel does not meet the relevant fuel quality standards. The issue is not a new one: biodiesel blends have been used for many years by bus operators in the UK and other countries. It can generally be addressed through good housekeeping practices, such as regular tank cleaning, and by the use of various fuel additives. These are matters for the transport fuel industry to resolve: commercial bus operators and others should ensure that fuel quality requirements are covered in any fuel supply contracts.</p>

 MOD pandemic influenza planning assumptions on overall clinical attack rates are based on modelling provided by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), which underpin the National Planning Framework. In 2006 this accorded with the national plan that 25 to 33 per cent. of the armed forces overall may be affected during the course of a pandemic. However, in line with the revised National Planning Framework issued in 2007, which raised the upper potential impact to 50 per cent., our planning is being adjusted to reflect this higher potential clinical attack rate.</p>

 Since the introduction of a grant cap in May 2007 for household installations monthly applications, including for solar PV and micro-wind, have decreased relative to before May 2007. However, we have seen a more even spread across the various technologies. There are potentially a number of factors contributing to this lower uptake of household grants. However, we believe that the extension to the household stream of LCBP, relaxation of planning requirements and wider promotion of the programme should help to boost take-up.</p>

The probability of an adventitious (chance) match between full SGM DNA profiles of unrelated individuals is of the order of one in 50 million.

However, the level of overlap between SGM Plus DNA profiles and those developed by other systems is that the discriminating power will typically be of the same order as the SGM (rather than the SGM Plus) level. It is thus extremely important that all possible opportunities are taken to improve the discriminating power associated with a match, for example by re-analysis of the sample to upgrade, the profile before any other information on the identity of a suspect nominated by a DNA match is disclosed to an overseas police authority.</p>

 In the building of Terminal 5 at Heathrow, the British Airports Authority (BAA) took the decision to introduce a common departure lounge (CDL). BAA were required to ensure that any immigration risks arising from the mixing of domestic and international passengers were mitigated and a working group, which includes BAA, British Airways (BA), the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) and other control agencies, has worked together since 2005 to consider appropriate mitigation measures. BAA presented a number of systems which they believed were capable of mitigating the risks to Border Security and following a number of trials, fingerprinting together with digital facial recognition comparison were identified as the most effective solution. However, to ensure that the proposed system is fully validated by the Information Commissioner, it has been agreed that the system will operate using only digital photography until such validation is given.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 21 April 2008]:</i> Since the phasing out of border controls in 1994, no Government have ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally and that includes illegal workers. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately and that remains the case.</p>

This will build on the successes of our early testing of the e-Borders programme (Project Semaphore) which already covers over 30 million passenger movements and has led to 18,000 alerts and more than 1,500 arrests.</p>

 Jodrell Bank Observatory is owned and run by the University of Manchester. It is involved in a variety of radio astronomy activities including the e-Merlin project. E-Merlin is the development of a network of seven UK radio telescopes run by the Jodrell Bank Observatory and funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in partnership with the North West Development Agency and the University of Manchester. The STFC has recently undertaken a review of all its existing programmes to make sure they are delivering, or will deliver, the anticipated science output, and that they continue to represent value for money. The initial results of this review have been subject to consultation with the relevant scientific communities, and STFC is currently considering the responses it has received. STFC has yet to take a decision on its future level of support for e-Merlin. However, STFC has made it clear that the e-Merlin project is part of its strategy for radio astronomy and that it is in discussion with its partners about the issues raised by the review.</p>

 No. We want to keep a close eye on how demand to study key subjects evolves over time, but this has to be evidence-based. As we have already informed Parliament, the first such review will take place starting in December 2008, in the light of entry data for the 2008-09 academic year. Since the review will look specifically at what happens as people enter higher education this autumn, we do not intend to bring the review forward from December.</p>

 There are around 200,000 part-time first degree undergraduates compared to around one million full-time. To estimate the cost to the public purse of giving part-time students the full-time package of support is complicated due to their diverse nature. We can give very broad estimates based on the assumptions we hold for full-time students and replicating the exact same package of support.

They are highly dependent on uncertain factors such as household incomes on which student support is assessed, eligibility for and take-up of support, level of fees charged and earnings following completion of the course, all of which have been assumed the same as for full-time students. The support has not been pro-rated, but if part-time students take twice as long to complete their course compared to a full-time student the costs would be around a half.</p>

This included increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and an above-inflation increase in the income threshold for receiving this support. The part-time package is different from the support available to full-time students because it has been designed to meet the particular needs of part-time students. Unlike full-time students, many part-time students are in full-time employment &#151;two thirds according to the Woodley report, published at the end of 2004.

In all cases, HEFCE will work with institutions to audit fundable student numbers and final HEFCE funding will be determined on the basis of audited returns and through a robust audit process.

The chief coroner will not have direct authority over police officer training or the practices of medical practitioners but he or she will work closely with local police authorities to promote best practice and will have authority to intervene if investigations are not conducted in accordance with agreed guidance.

The Prison Service incident reporting system processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The statistics provide a good indication of overall numbers, but should not be interpreted as absolute. Assault data are complex and may include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact incidents. Information on assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim. In a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80428w0028.htm_para4"><a name="0804291002080">Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories: Prisoner on Prisoner, Prisoner on Officer, Other (including miscellaneous assault information) and Prisoner on Other. Rises or falls in reported numbers from one year to the next are not a good indicator of underlying trend for a particular prison. There have also been improvements in reporting over the years, and this is reflected in the table.</p>

Through the End of Life Care Programme, we have invested &#163;12 million to support the rollout of end of life care tools such as the Gold Standards Framework, the Liverpool Care Pathway and the Preferred Place of Care. This summer, we will publish England&#146;s first End of Life Care Strategy. This comprehensive strategy will help deliver increased choice to all adult patients regardless of their condition about where they live and die.</p>

 Consolidation of processing and testing to six and five sites respectively will result in a reduction of around 140 posts. This is part of an anticipated overall reduction of up to 600 posts across the National Blood Service (NBS) by the end of 2010-11. The NBS intends to reduce these posts largely through non-compulsory means, including voluntary redundancy, staff turnover and vacancy control. Help will be provided for all staff affected by change to find other jobs, across NHS Blood and Transplant and the wider national health service.</p>

As the new ethos and behaviour policy are implemented in an academy&#146;s early days, the number of exclusions may rise, but it typically falls as behaviour improves.

Table LAG1 is taken from the Statistical First Release (SFR 27/2007) entitled &#145;Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending 31 March 2007&#146;. The SFR is located at http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000741/index.shtml and table LAG1 can be found within the second set of Excel tables on the website. The measures that we are taking through the Care Matters White Paper and the Children and Young Persons Bill, such as requiring local authorities to pay a &#163;2,000 bursary to care leavers who undertake a course in higher education and to provide a personal adviser for care leavers in education up to the age of 25, are designed to help them to achieve their full potential.</p>

However, we recently carried out an analysis of the 2008-09 admission arrangements adopted by schools in three local authority areas&#151;Barnet, Manchester and Nottinghamshire&#151;which showed that although a large majority complied with the school admissions code and admissions legislation, a significant minority of schools appeared to have adopted unlawful arrangements.</p>

 Level 3 (equivalent to two or more A-levels) is broadly similar, once young people's prior attainment at Level 2 (equivalent to five GCSEs A*-C) is taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="80428w0044.htm_para0"><a name="08042925002270">Internal analysis shows the average Level 3 attainment score per qualification entry for a sixth form college student is around 2 points higher than for a school sixth-form student, with a similar level of prior attainment. Across a three A-level package of qualifications, the average difference in attainment would be around 6 points which is the equivalent of around a third of a grade. While this difference is statistically significant it is small.</p>

We want to encourage more high quality provision of this type, often working in partnership, in order to overcome England's unacceptably low participation rate in education beyond GCSE. Collaboration between schools, and between schools and colleges, will be essential to ensuring that we have a high quality offer for all young people and to support the successful delivery of the 14-19 reform programme.</p>

 The existing suite of Public Service Agreements (PSAs) targets expires this year, and as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), a new set of PSAs and national targets is to be delivered by 2011. No formal GCSE targets are due for delivery in 2010.</p>

Further announcements will be made about Every Child a Writer in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="80428w0047.htm_para8"><a name="08042925003642">Evaluations of the Every Child a Reader pilot&#151;which provides Reading Recovery for children from among those having the most difficulties in learning to read &#151;were published in 2006 and 2007. These are available on www.everychildareader.org.uk. The evaluation of Every Child a Reader in London in 2005/06 showed that 87 per cent. of children who had received Reading Recovery were considered to have made average to exceptional progress in reading comprehension. However, these evaluations did not include looking at the efficacy of Reading Recovery for children with dyslexia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="80428w0047.htm_para9"><a name="08042925003643">The SEN Code of Practice says that "effective management, school ethos and the learning environment, curricular, pastoral and discipline arrangements can help prevent some special educational needs arising, and minimise others" (paragraph 5:18). Where whole school arrangements for teaching and learning are not addressing a child's learning difficulties, schools have a statutory duty to do their best to ensure that the necessary provision is made for any pupil who has special educational needs. It follows that if a child with dyslexia is not benefiting from their participation in any or all of the three initiatives, the school must make additional or different arrangements to address the child's special educational needs.</p>

 A new indicator on young people who run away from home or care has been included in the National Indicator Set, to be measured from April 2009.</p>

Immediate activities for the working group include consideration of data collection mechanisms which will best support the new indicator. I am expecting a progress  report from the working group on this in June, and full technical consultation on the indicator will take place in autumn 2008.</p>

 The Government are taking forward a number of steps to help to keep down the price of school meals. We are investing over &#163;650 million between 2005-11 to help raise nutritional standards and keep school lunch prices down. This funding is also being used to help build kitchens in areas with no kitchen facilities; to better support the development of training centres for the school food workforce; and to improve overall take-up.</p>

The Trust has produced guidance focusing on efficient and sustainable school food procurement. This guidance is being distributed to all schools in April 2008.</p>

 The Secretary of State has not made a comprehensive assessment of the effects of selection by ability in local authorities with grammar schools. We remain opposed to selection by ability and legislation prevents admission authorities from introducing new selection of this type. Grammar and partially selective schools already selecting in this way at the beginning of the 1997/98 academic year may continue to do so, with decisions on whether individual schools should continue to do so being made at a local level. Parents may object to the Adjudicator about continuing partial selection, and mechanisms are in place to allow parents to vote to remove selection at grammar schools.</p>

 The Secretary of State has asked the schools adjudicator to report to him on compliance with the statutory requirements on admissions, in respect of 2009 admission arrangements and annually thereafter. To inform his 2009 report, to be submitted to the Secretary of State on 1 September 2008, the adjudicator has written to all local authorities asking them to submit to him a full set of admission arrangements for all schools in their area, and their account of the legality, fairness and effectiveness of those arrangements. We will be tabling a government amendment to the Education and Skills Bill which would place a duty on local authorities to submit reports on school admissions to the schools adjudicator in future years which will assist him in producing future reports.</p>

 It is essential that Government departments have access to high quality and comprehensive legal advice. This allows for decisions to be taken in a fully informed context. It is vital that Ministers and officials are able to consult lawyers in confidence in order to obtain effective legal advice in a forum which is conducive to a candid exchange of views and consideration and assessment of potential risks without fear of disclosure. Disclosure of legal advice is very likely to prejudice the Government&#146;s ability to conduct its business effectively and to defend its legal interests, either by unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge or by reducing the reliance it can place on the advice it has received. For these reasons, disclosure of legal advice would not be in the public interest.</p>

 A school may select up to 10 per cent. of its intake by aptitude in prescribed subjects if the school considers it has a specialism, whether or not the school is a designated specialist school. It recognises the diversity of such schools, increases choices for parents and widens access to particular schools. We have published guidance in the school admissions code on aptitude selection which states that a child with aptitude is one who is identified as being able to benefit from teaching in a specific subject, or who demonstrates a particular capacity to succeed in that subject. Such selection is limited to subjects where there are recognised tests for aptitude which do not inadvertently identify high academic ability. Schools may also hold auditions or oral or practical tests to ascertain a child's aptitude. Prescribed subjects are modern foreign languages, performing or visual arts and physical education or sport. Schools may continue to select 10 per cent. by aptitude in design and technology and ICT if they already had such arrangements in place prior to the 2008 academic year.</p>

 Legislation provides admission forums with a power to produce annual reports on the effectiveness of admission arrangements in their area, to feed into the School Commissioner&#146;s biennial report to Parliament on fair access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="80428w0049.htm_para0"><a name="08042925004753">As part of our recent announcements to strengthen the school admissions framework and ensure more compliance with the School Admissions Code and admissions legislation, we published, on 2 April, draft amendments to the Education and Skills Bill for consideration at Commons Report to place a duty on local authorities to report annually to the Schools Adjudicator on the legality, fairness, and effectiveness of admission arrangements in their areas. This duty on local authorities is in line with their role to monitor compliance with the statutory admissions framework and their duty to ensure fair access to educational opportunity. Copies of these draft amendments are available in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="80428w0049.htm_para1"><a name="08042925004754">We also signalled that we will publish detailed proposals in the early summer to further strengthen the admission system, which will include improvements to admission forums.</p>

 The school's adjudicator considers objections to admission arrangements where the admission authority concerned fails to comply with the mandatory provisions of the school admissions code, or does not follow its guidelines. Local authorities have a duty to refer to the adjudicator the admission arrangements of any school if it appears to them that they do not comply with the law or the mandatory requirements of the code. The Secretary of State made a statement to Parliament on 2 April in which he outlined his proposals to extend the role of the schools adjudicator to ensure that all admission arrangements are legal, fair and effective.</p>

 We do not collect the information asked; however Sheffield Hallam University carried out research into secondary school admissions for 2006 (published in January 2008) which showed only a small minority of schools use banding. Three local authorities Greenwich, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets had authority-wide banding. Sheffield Hallam found that the following 10 authorities select the highest proportion of their secondary school children by ability.</p>

 The Department does not provide direct funding to supplementary schools. However, last year, in partnership with the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the Department contributed &#163;596,000 towards funding the establishment of a National Resource Centre for Supplementary Education. This funding was initially planned to end on 31 March this year but as announced to the House on 26 February the Department has extended it to ensure that the centre&#146;s valuable work continues. In 2008-09 the Department will make available a grant of &#163;350,000 and up to a similar amount in 2009-10 with arrangements to give the centre an incentive to become self-sufficient as early as possible. One key aim of the centre is to promote links between supplementary schools, local authorities and mainstream schools.</p>
