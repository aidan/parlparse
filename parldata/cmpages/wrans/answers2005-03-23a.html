<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50323w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 All of the main paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland are engaged in organised criminality to varying degrees. Of the top 25 organised criminal gangs who operate in Northern Ireland, two thirds have links to paramilitary gangs with both loyalist and republican gangs engaging in a range of illicit activity including drugs, smuggling, extortion, armed robbery and intellectual property crime.

During preparation of the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan (RSTN TP), the transport links to Belfast International Airport were examined. However, it was considered that the three roads radiating out from the Killead roundabout provided good links to the strategic road network, servicing the Province and beyond. No additional road infrastructure was considered necessary during the life of the Plan.</p>

Total additional government expenditure will be &#163;420 million, also including consequential payments to Wales and Scotland under the Barnett formula.

<p>
<a name="50323w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_11"><i>(a)</i> The policy of transferring non-core trunk roads (de-trunking) to local highway authorities was first set out in the White Paper A New Deal for Transport published in July 1998. De-trunking allows the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of the strategic (core) trunk road network, whilst enabling local authorities to consider their own priorities for the improvement of non-core routes. The aim has been to transfer some 3,200 kms (30 per cent.) of the trunk road network (as it was in April 1999) to local authorities in a phased programme. To date more than three-quarters (around 2,500 kms) of the programme has been completed since April 2001.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323w03.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_12"><i>(b)</i> Prior to the de-trunking of a road, the Highways Agency and local authority agree an appropriate level of funding for annual routine maintenance and in some cases&#039; outstanding capital maintenance projects. The methodology for calculating the funding has been approved by the Local Government Association to ensure a fair transfer of resources. In the years following de-trunking, the authority can also make supplementary bids for additional funds for capital maintenance projects (bridge replacement, resurfacing etc.) on de-trunked roads as part of the LTP process. In 2004&#150;05 around &#163;33.1 million of routine maintenance funds, and &#163;31.6 million of capital maintenance funds were transferred from the Highways Agency to local authorities for all de-trunked roads.

 The Government have encouraged local authorities to take over responsibility for parking enforcement from the police and police traffic wardens.

Over 150 local authorities are now responsible for decriminalised parking enforcement, with parking attendants carrying out the enforcement on the street. This policy of transferring responsibility to local authorities is reflected in Home Office figures for the number of traffic wardens in England and Wales for the years 1999&#150;2000 to 2003&#150;04 (the most recent year for which figures are available), which are as follows:

 In December 2004, the Government launched a consultation on proposals to establish regional funding allocations for transport, housing and economic development.

<sup>(3)</sup> A cohabiting couple family is a cohabiting couple on their own, or with their never-married children who have no children of their own. A small number of those cohabiting will actually be legally married but separated from their marriage partner.<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> NS-SEC is an occupationally based classification but has rules to provide coverage of the whole adult population. The family reference person has been used to assign the NS-SEC of the family. It does not follow that everyone in the family will be of the same NS-SEC as the family reference person.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> A family with children can contain dependent or non-dependent children. Dependent children are defined as children under 16 years of age, or those aged 16 to 18 who are never-married and in full-time education.<br>

 The Department&#039;s main measure for what the funding gap between school sixth-forms and further education colleges is the difference in funding rates for an AS/A2 qualification. In 2002/03 the difference was 10.5 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323w15.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_94">For the academic year 2003/04, base funding rates per qualification increased by 3 per cent. for school sixth-forms and by 4.5 per cent. for further education colleges on a broadly comparable basis. In 2004/05, funding rates for colleges meeting their targets increased by 5 per cent., while those for school sixth forms rose by 4 per cent. We expect to see this trend continue in the 2005/06 academic year.

<p>
<a name="50323w15.html_para1">

<p>
<a name="50323w15.html_para2">
However, we have brought up funding levels for further education (FE) as we said we would, without penalising schools. The Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC) funding rates per course in FE have been rising faster than school sixth forms and the gap has narrowed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323w15.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_96">Our policy has been to raise the level of funding for colleges, as and when we are able to secure the resources to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323w15.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_97">The current funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges is a direct consequence of the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act and the removal of the incorporated FE sector funding systems from local authority control. This resulted in a divergence from local authority systems which has resulted in funding level differences. These differences were made more apparent when all post-16 funding became the responsibility of the LSC in 2001.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="50323w15.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 It is our policy to ensure that those groups of people benefiting from fully funded further education provision will continue to do so. We will continue to provide fee concessions arrangements that help unemployed people, those on income based benefits, and retired people and working families on low incomes, to access further education. We will continue to make substantial levels of public funding available to all which covers the largest part of the cost of courses, but we also expect adult learners, who can afford to do so, to make a contribution to the costs of their learning. Those people already qualified at Level 2, or not in one of our priority groups, will on average pay a higher fee contribution in 2005&#150;06 unless they qualify for fee concessions.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="50323w15.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on 22 March, sets clear priorities for public funding to support the drive to ensure that employers have the skills they need to be successful, and individuals have the skills they need to be employable and personally fulfilled. These priorities include tackling the nation&#039;s legacy of low skills, with a drive to ensure that adults have the basic skills of literacy, numeracy and English language; and focussing the investment of public funds on helping individuals reach their first full Level 2 qualification. But the White Paper also recognises the importance of higher level skills, and sets out measures to strengthen support for provision at Level 3 and above. However, given that higher levels of qualifications have higher rates of return for employers and individuals, it is also important that this should be reflected in the relative contributions employers and individuals make to the costs of such training. The Learning and Skills Council has announced that its fee assumption will rise from 25 per cent. to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06 with public funds

 Details of the numbers of persons proceeded against and those found guilty of selling alcohol to persons aged under 18 in England and Wales for the years 2000 to 2003 are shown in the table.

<a name="stpa_127">The penalty notice for disorder scheme provides for persons who commit specified penalty offences to be issued with a fixed penalty notice instead of being prosecuted. The table therefore also contains details of the provisional number of penalty notices issued for this offence in 2004.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to bring dispensing opticians within the scope of NHS regulation; if he will change General Ophthalmic Services regulations to allow optometrists and ophthalmic opticians to refer patients directly to hospital eye services; what plans he has to amend section 24 of the Opticians Act 1989 to allow professionals other than ophthalmic opticians, optometrists and registered medical practitioners to conduct sight tests; for what reasons dispensing opticians are not paid for the general ophthalmic services they supply; and if he will make a statement on the progress of his review of the General Ophthalmic Service.

<p><a name="st_274"><a name="50323w31.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Dispensing opticians do not provide general ophthalmic services (GOS) and are therefore not paid by the national health service. We are planning to review the GOS arrangements shortly. This will include considering the relationship of dispensing opticians with the NHS, but we have no plans to amend section 24 of the Opticians Act 1989 to allow professionals other than ophthalmic opticians and registered medical practitioners to conduct sight tests.
