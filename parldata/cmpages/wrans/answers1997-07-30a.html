<a name="70730w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is the average sentence for an offender aged over 18 years on a first conviction for a domestic burglary offence according to the most recent figures available; [10860]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many offenders aged over 18 years on a third conviction, or on a conviction after three or more previous convictions, for an offence of domestic burglary received a non-custodial sentence according to the most recent figures available; [10862]
<P>
(3) what is the average sentence for an offender aged over 18 years on a third conviction, or on a conviction after three or more previous convictions, for an offence of domestic burglary according to the most recent figures available. [10863]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The most recent available information comes from a sample of nearly 700 domestic burglars, aged 18 years or over, sentenced in March 1996. Of those with no previous convictions for domestic burglary, 46 per cent. received a non-custodial sentence. The average custodial sentence length for offenders on a first conviction for domestic burglary was 13.9 months. Of those who had at least two previous convictions for domestic burglary, 23 per cent. received a non-custodial sentence; this represents about 1,000 offenders in a full year. The average custodial sentence length for offenders on a third or greater conviction for domestic burglary was 16.8 months.

<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is the average sentence for an offender aged over 18 years on a first conviction for a class A drug trafficking offence according to the most recent figures available; [10861]
<P>
<UL>(2) what is the average sentence for an offender aged over 18 years on a third conviction, or on a conviction after three or more previous convictions, for a class A drug trafficking offence according to the most recent figures available. [10864]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The information requested is not routinely available because class of drug was not recorded for central sentencing statistics before 1993. A special study was carried out on repeat drug offenders sentenced in October to December 1994. For the offenders aged 18 or over in the study, the average custodial sentence length for those convicted of a third or subsequent class A drug trafficking offence was just over four years. First-time class A drug traffickers were not covered by the study.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to review the licensing laws to bring opening hours for private clubs into line with those for public houses; and if he will make a statement. [11085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Opening hours for registered members' clubs are in line with the general permitted hours for licensed premises. I have received no proposals relating to this particular area of licensing, and have no present plans for change.

<a name="70730w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) to what factors the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate attributed the weight loss in the rabbits found being stored at the Charing Cross and Westminster medical school; [11200]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recommendations for changes in procedure at Charing Cross and Westminster medical school have been made by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate; and what action has been taken; [11202]
<P>
(3) what action has been taken by his Department to reappraise the project of cat operations at the Institute of Neurology. [11206]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Between March and June 1996, the inspectorate carried out a full investigation into the allegations concerning the Charing Cross and Westminster medical school and the Institute of Neurology which were made in the National Anti-Vivisection Society's report "Access Denied". We do not have any plans to reopen this matter.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para0">I understand that the inspectorate was satisfied that the weight loss in rabbits at the Charing Cross and Westminster medical school was a minor transient problem which can occur in any laboratory animal population. Although often considered to be stress related, no precipitating factor was found on this occasion. This was determined to have been an intercurrent problem not induced by any experimental protocol. The problem had been recognised and properly managed by the animal care staff.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para1">At Charing Cross and Westminster medical school, the inspectorate identified irregularities in the application of approved methods for the humane killing of animals and deficiencies in middle management. The certificate of designation was revoked. A new certificate was issued when the establishment satisfied the Home Office that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a list would be maintained of persons competent to kill by schedule 1 methods, and the people listed would be retrained and reminded of their responsibilities under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986;
<P>
<BR>
(b) suitable standard operating procedures were in place for schedule 1 killing;
<P>
<BR>
(c) internal controls were in place to prevent the unauthorised killing of animals by other methods;
<P>
<BR>
(d) changes were made to the day-to-day animal care arrangements to ensure greater communication and clearer lines of management and responsibility between the certificate holder, the director of the animal facility and all other staff involved in animal work.

<a name="70730w01.html_para2">The programme of work involving cats at the Institute of Neurology was reviewed by the Home Office: the science was found to be sound and the protocols were as refined as possible. The standard of performance of the procedures was reviewed and no breaches of licence authorities were found.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para3">Two post-operative cats had been humanely killed to prevent further suffering. All work was suspended until the cause of the problems could be identified. The named veterinary surgeon had been consulted by the project licence holder at the time and the animals had been appropriately cared for. The causes of the unexpected level of suffering related to technical problems with the procedure. Subsequent changes to the vaccination policy, suggested by the named veterinary surgeon, resulted in no recurrence.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will set up a royal commission on the use of animals in experiments; and if he will make a statement. [11052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 We do not consider that a royal commission on the use of animals in experiments is necessary at this time. In the Animal Procedures Committee, the Secretary of State already has an excellent source of independent expert advice on all aspects of the use of animals in scientific procedures. The committee is currently reviewing the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and I expect to receive shortly a report setting out the committee's deliberations made, interim findings and initial recommendations.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para4">Setting up a royal commission would divert resources from progressing the committee's review, from responding to its recommendations and from other planned Home Office initiatives.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para5">The Government will work to ensure that the highest possible standards of animal welfare are implemented and that animals are used in scientific procedures only where this is fully justified. We will promote alternatives which replace animal use, which reduce the number of animals used and which refine procedures to minimise suffering.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para6">We will pursue initiatives across Europe rather than risk exporting animal experiments to countries with less rigorous controls. The measures we take must also be sustainable and must not unnecessarily disadvantage United Kingdom research, medicine and industry or compromise public safety.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the alternatives available to the use of animals in experiments. [11053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 The Government will promote alternatives which replace animal use, which reduce the number of animals used and which refine procedures to minimise suffering.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para7">Section 5(5) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that applicants for project licence give adequate consideration to the possibility of achieving the objectives of the programme of work using methods which do not use animals. In addition, when assessing licence applications, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate ensures that protocols are refined to minimise the suffering to animals and the number of animals used.




<P>
<P><I>30 Jul 1997 : Column: 260</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para8">The Home Office, through the Animal Procedures Committee, sponsors research into alternatives and industry itself has spent millions of pounds each year in the search for alternatives.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para9">The types of replacement alternatives which are available include the use of human volunteers; computer simulation and mathematical modelling; improved storage, sharing and use of results from previous animal experiments to avoid unnecessary repetition; the use of non-protected animals, micro-organisms or plants; the use of non-living tissue; physical and chemical techniques; and in vitro studies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Roseanna Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the advice he has issued concerning the prosecution of private consensual homosexual acts involving males between the ages of 16 and 18 years. [11268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 My Department has issued no such advice. Prosecution policy is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, under the superintendence of the Attorney-General. The law provides restrictions on prosecutions for certain homosexual offences in England and Wales. Under section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, no proceedings can be instituted except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions against any man for the offence of buggery, or gross indecency with, another man or for aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or commanding its commission where either of the men were at the time of its commission under the age of 21.
<P>

<a name="70730w01.html_para10">The Crown Prosecution Service applies two tests before it institutes proceedings. First, it decides whether the evidence affords a realistic prospect of conviction; secondly, if that exists, it decides whether prosecution is in the public interest. Prosecution of those under 18 is not undertaken lightly and is more likely where there is an element of seduction or corruption, coercion or force. Each case would be carefully considered in the light of its own facts.

<P>
<a name="70730w02.html_wqn2"><B> Shona McIsaac: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he intends to publish the second report on the impact of the national lottery on the horserace betting levy. [12151]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 An update on the impact of the national lottery on the horserace betting levy has been published today. This fulfils an undertaking made during the passage of the National Lottery Bill.
<P>

<a name="70730w02.html_para1">The paper, which has been prepared by the economics unit of the Home Office, examines continuing trends in off-course betting expenditure, on which the levy is closely dependent.
<P>

<a name="70730w02.html_para2">The statistical analysis suggests that, in 1996, betting expenditure off-course was about 10 per cent. below the level it would have reached in the absence of the national lottery. Horserace betting accounts for an estimated 70 per cent. of such expenditure, and therefore the levy yield is likely to have been similarly affected. This can be only an approximate figure, and the effect of the lottery may vary over time.

<a name="70730w02.html_para6">The previous Administration said that implementation of what became section 4 of the Act would depend on the Prison Service's capacity and available resources. They said, as an "example", that these provisions could be implemented in October 1999. Because the relevant convictions do not count until the section comes into operation, very few people would be subject to the provisions of section 4 until 2001. Against this background, and given current pressures on prison capacity and available resources, it would not be practical to implement section 4 for the present. I shall, however, keep the matter under review.
<P>

<a name="70730w02.html_para7">I have also decided not to implement the new early release arrangements set out in sections 8, 10 to 26 and related paragraphs of schedules 4 and 5. The same effect can be achieved in a far more clear and straightforward way by ensuring that judges and magistrates spell out in open court what the sentence they have imposed really means in practice. Sections 20 to 21, which deal with extended post-release supervision of violent and sexual offenders, are integrally linked with the other early release provisions and will not be implemented, but I will bring forward in the Crime and Disorder Bill alternative provisions which will provide the additional protection of the public which they were designed to achieve.

<a name="70730w03.html_wqn1"><B> Valerie Davey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the implementation of the Dublin convention. [12156]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The convention determining the state responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the member states of the European Communities--the Dublin convention--will come into force on 1 September 1997. The convention, which was ratified by the United Kingdom in 1992, provides a mechanism for determining which member state should be responsible for deciding an asylum application made in the European Union.
<P>

<a name="70730w03.html_para0">Responsibility is determined according to a set of criteria. These include whether the applicant has a close family member recognised as a refugee in another member state; whether another member state has granted the person a residence permit or visa; the location of any illegal entry into the European Union; and the existence of a previous asylum application. The applicant can be transferred under the convention only if the receiving state agrees that it is responsible and if specific arrangements are made for the transfer. In many cases, the receiving state will not be the one from which the applicant embarked. There will be no change to the existing requirement that we must be satisfied that the applicant's life or liberty would not be threatened in the country concerned on account of his race, religion or any other factor; and that he would not be sent on to another state in breach of the 1951 United Nations convention on refugees.
<P>

<a name="70730w03.html_para1">The convention provides for the exchange of information on asylum applicants with other European Union states. This may include personal information such as fingerprints.

 The latest data available for unemployment rates of new full-time first degree graduates in the UK are for the academic year 1994-95 which show that 9 per cent. of graduates with known destination were unemployed six months after graduation. Data on the first destinations of graduates for the academic year 1995-96 will be published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency at the end of this month.
<P>

<a name="70730w05.html_para1">Unemployment among newly qualified graduates has declined annually since 1992 and this decline has occurred in spite of the increased output of graduates from universities and colleges of higher education. The unemployment rate for graduates in the economically active labour force is, however, much lower than this and stood at 4.1 per cent. in 1996. Those with degrees enjoy employment rates significantly higher than those without.

 I have today placed in the Library copies of the 1997-98 Employment Service annual performance agreement, which sets out the standards and targets I expect the Employment Service to achieve this year. The new agreement reflects our commitment to helping people, especially those who are at a disadvantage in the labour market, find employment, and stresses that the priority for Employment Service managers this year is to take the necessary steps to prepare for the introduction of the new deal in April next year.
<P>

<a name="70730w06.html_para4">The Employment Service will have a key role in implementing the new deal, and is at the heart of our efforts to help unemployed people, acting as a gateway to job vacancies and a wide range of initiatives tailored to address each individual's needs. The breadth of ES's current work is reflected in the targets I am announcing today--from placing 1.75 million unemployed people directly into jobs, to helping to ensure that JSA is paid quickly and accurately.
<P>

<a name="70730w06.html_para5">I am also announcing today a review of ES's targets, including a consultation exercise with those who work with the ES, to make sure that the targets fully reflect this government's commitment to creating a fair and efficient labour market, in which all have the chance to prosper.

 As foreshadowed in the White Paper "Excellence in Schools", the chief inspector has agreed to implement a programme of changes arising out of Ofsted's analysis of information collected about contracting, the process of inspection and reports, with a view to securing possible further improvements in consistency, quality and value for money. Ofsted plans to introduce in the year beginning September 1997:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a quality standard for contractors which each will have to satisfy in order to gain inspection contracts. This will place considerable requirements on contractors and, where these are not met, Ofsted may cease business with them or reduce their level of activity until satisfied that they have improved. This action will be central to Ofsted's drive to improve the overall quality of inspections;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>contracting arrangements which further reduce bureaucratic procedures and paperwork. These arrangements will also reduce the period of notice to schools of inspection and mean that all schools know the exact date between one and one-and-a-half terms in advance;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a requirement that team inspectors may inspect subjects or aspects only where they have the relevant expertise and training. Ofsted will organise approved training and accredit inspectors. They will have a register of team members and, with new legislation, the power to remove them from this register if they prove to be incompetent;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a requirement that the names of team members and the subjects and aspects inspected in a school are included in the published reports. This will increase their accountability and enable Ofsted to identify weak ones;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a requirement that inspectors should give oral feed-back to all teachers;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a limit on the proportion of any one day that a teacher can be observed by an inspector. The upper limit will be 75 per cent. of the day with 50 per cent. as the norm. This should reduce the pressure on teachers in small primary schools particularly;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a requirement that head teachers receive a profile for each teacher of the quality of teaching observed by inspectors. Each teacher will receive the data on their own teaching. This essential management of information should aid schools in identifying very good teachers, those needing further support and those whose competence is seriously in doubt;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a requirement that the second inspection comments on progress made by the school since the previous inspection. Much of the information will come from the school and its own review systems;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>further guidance on judging standards by providing benchmark descriptors of what is expected of work judged "excellent" through to "very poor", for all subjects;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>annual data summaries for each school, including aggregate inspection data from the previous inspection. Copies of all the summaries will be sent to LEAs along with a summary of data for all the LEA's schools;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an external person to review handling of complaints about inspection where the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome of the complaint.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="70730w07.html_para5">In addition, the chief inspector has agreed to review Ofsted's contracting procedures with the involvement of an external party.

We are looking for someone who can bring visible leadership and drive to the fight against drugs, working in partnership with all relevant agencies, communities and individuals. The post-holder will urgently review the overall direction of Government action, and submit proposals for a new strategy for England, while ensuring strategic coherence to the work in the rest of the UK and internationally. She or he will work directly to me as chair of the Cabinet sub-Committee on drugs misuse, and have access to the Prime Minister. We plan to make an appointment in the autumn, following an open selection process which ensures that the best possible candidates make themselves available for a vitally important job.

 We made a commitment in our business manifesto to improve the focus of our efforts to back British business selling abroad, to enhance the co-ordination of government trade and investment promotion, and to promote business secondments with this Department.

These people will provide valuable expertise to support and promote the activities of the commercial sections of our overseas posts. Each attachment will have a specific focus, such as privatisation projects, inward investment promotion, management of commercial promotions, marketing of UK financial services, or identifying market opportunities in specific sectors.
<P>

<a name="70730w09.html_para2">I welcome the whole-hearted support for this initiative of the Confederation of British Industry. It has encouraged a number of members to participate from the outset, including British Airways, BOC, ICL, Wimpey, British Aerospace, BT, British Steel, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., BUPA, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Glaxo Wellcome. Other companies have expressed a strong interest and I am confident that more attachments will be arranged in the coming months.

<a name="70730w09.html_para3">This is a commitment to a rolling programme of attachments to strengthen our partnership with business.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many learning support teachers expressed as a full-time equivalent have been provided by each education authority in the current year; and how many were provided over the previous four years by them or their predecessor authority. [9613]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally on a comparable basis for each education authority in Scotland at the present time. Information is collected annually as part of the school census about the provision of learning support. An analysis of this data shows that there has been a substantial variation recently from year to year and among education authorities. We strongly suspect that some of this variation is due to differences in the patterns of provision and interpretation of definitions of learning support, rather than differences in the total amount of learning support being provided in each authority. The methods used to collect this information are currently being improved. My Department will be considering with colleagues in education authorities, schools and HM inspectorate how to resolve this issue and collect and publish the information on a more comparable basis.

The most recent survey was conducted in 1996. As part of the survey several thousand adults were interviewed at home and asked about the destinations of leisure day trips. They were also asked if a wood or forest formed part of a trip and if so who was the perceived forest owner or manager. The responses were weighted to provide estimates of visits to Forestry Commission forests and woods. On this basis the 1996 S & PR survey estimated that 42 million day visits were made to Forestry Commission forests made up as follows:

<P>
<a name="70730w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 The Scottish Office is considering proposals to extend the access requirements of part T of the technical standards for compliance with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990 to cover new, converted or adapted dwellings, taking account of cost implications, and comments made during consultations on draft amendments in 1995.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what are the maximum and average yearly traffic flows on the A1 road at Pencraig Hill; and what proportion of that traffic consists of heavy goods vehicles.[11060]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 The average annual daily flow for 1996 was 11,500 vehicles with 20 per cent., 2,300, comprising heavy goods vehicles. This equates in 1996 to a total of 4,197,500 vehicles of which 839,500 were heavy goods vehicles. The peak traffic flow in August was approximately 14,720 vehicles per day. This equates to a total of 456,320 vehicles in August.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 The modification to the Lothian region structure plan reflects the very considerable progress already made and the work under way in dualling the A1. As my hon. Friend is aware, preparatory work to dual the stage between Haddington and Dunbar will continue within the Scottish Office during the review of the trunk road programme.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 As at 30 June 1997, the Scottish Office had incurred expenditure of &#163;1.24 million on preparation work on dualling the section of the A1 between Haddington and Dunbar. No expenditure has been incurred to date by the Scottish Office on the acquisition of land or preliminary work.

 Arrangements for the delivery of substitute prescribing programmes, including monitoring the use and effectiveness of services, are a matter for local consideration in the first instance. The use and effectiveness of substitute prescribing programmes are issues addressed in new national guidance on drug misuse services which has been prepared by my department, discussed with the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse, and is now the subject of wide consultation.

<P>
<a name="70730w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Substitute prescribing, including the use of methadone as a heroin substitute, is a method of harm reduction which has an important part to play in tackling drug misuse in Scotland. It needs to form part of a comprehensive package of care tailored to the individual needs of the drug misuser, which includes counselling and support and supervision of the taking of the drug, to prevent leakage onto the illicit market.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland which further provisions of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 he intends to implement; and if he will make a statement. [12072]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The key objective of our criminal justice policy is to protect the public effectively. It is against this background that we have reviewed the provisions of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997.
<P>

<a name="70730w13.html_para5">We have already made a commencement order bringing certain provisions of the 1997 Act into force on 1 August--SI 1997/1712 (C.72) (S.128). We intend to bring a further tranche of provisions into force in October, including mandatory minimum sentences for persistent drug traffickers--section 2 of the 1997 Act--and new arrangements for criminal legal aid--part V of the 1997 Act).
<P>

<a name="70730w13.html_para6">We remain committed to consistency and honesty in sentencing, and will be bringing forward proposals to further these aims. However, we have concluded that the new arrangements for early release contained in part III of the 1997 Act are unsatisfactory and impractical, and we do not therefore propose to implement them in their present form.
<P>

<a name="70730w13.html_para7">We are not satisfied that section 1 of the Act, which provides for the sentences to be imposed in certain circumstances on repeat violent and sex offenders, as enacted, provides proper protection for the public against these offenders. However, given the seriousness with which we view the issue of repeat offending, we shall be consulting on how best to provide for the appropriate sentencing and improved supervision of such offenders.
<P>

<a name="70730w13.html_para8">In addition, we shall be taking a range of other steps to deal effectively with offenders and improve public protection. We shall be commencing section 5 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to enable the Secretary of State to set up pilot schemes for the electronic tagging of offenders.
<P>

<a name="70730w13.html_para9">Community-based sentences have an important part to play in punishing and rehabilitating offenders. I am therefore looking closely at the full range of disposals, both custodial and non-custodial, against our objectives of improving public safety, dealing effectively and rigorously with offending behaviour and increasing public confidence in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="70730w13.html_para10">We will be consulting further on other options in developing a new strategy on criminal justice for Scotland which is tough, effective, workable and coherent.

 I attended a forum of older people on 8 July. The participants discussed their use of public services, identifying key issues of concern, and ways in which new technology could be used to deliver services to older people. They also commented on an early draft chapter of a booklet we are producing with the Citizenship Foundation, Age Concern and Saga, which will cover rights as they relate to older people.

 As we have already announced, we will be consulting widely on the future direction of the charter programme.

<a name="70730w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In response to the widespread and serious public disorder during these periods, the number of plastic baton rounds fired between 1 and 14 July 1996 was 8,098 and in the same period in 1997 was 2,510, although the figures for 1997 may be subject to adjustment.

<P>
<a name="70730w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Ms Donaghy's four-year period of appointment as non-executive director of the Southern health and social services board expired on 31 March 1997. In reviewing the vacancies in the Southern health and social services board, the Department of Health and Social Services decided to consider the merits of other candidates before making its recommendation to the then health Minister, the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, 



<P>

North-East (Mr. Moss). This procedure is consistent with the Commissioner for Public Appointments code of practice.
<P>

<a name="70730w16.html_para1">On becoming Minister with responsibility for the Department of Health and Social Services, my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) was presented with a number of candidates rated as suitable for appointment by a panel which included an independent member, constituted under guidelines issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The decision was based on the merits of these individual candidates and there was no reason to review this decision.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w16.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment she has made of the public appointments procedure in Northern Ireland in respect of nominations from the voluntary and community sector to health and social services boards. [11495]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There is no statutory requirement that the Department of Health and Social Services seek nominations from the voluntary and community sector for appointments to health and social services boards. Appointment opportunities within DHSS bodies are advertised openly and anyone is free to self-nominate and be considered for such appointments. This is in line with the DHSS procedures for public appointments, which follow the Commissioner for Public Appointments' code of practice.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what responses he has received to the consultation on Professor James's report on proposals for a food standards agency; and if he will make a statement.[11854]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and I, with the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for Wales, and for Northern Ireland, welcome the excellent response to the consultation on Professor James's report. The Government have received replies from more than 630 organisations and individuals. The responses show that there is widespread support for the proposal to establish a food standards agency which would be a non-departmental public body accountable to Parliament through health Ministers and operating on a basis of openness and transparency; create a clear separation between the responsibilities for regulating food safety and for promoting the interests of food-related industries; promote food safety from "plough to plate".
<P>

<a name="70730w17.html_para1">Many detailed points were raised in the consultation, which we are now studying further. Our aim is to publish a White Paper in the autumn setting out the Government's response to Professor James's recommendations in the light of the first round of public consultation. The White Paper will itself be the subject of a second consultation and a draft Bill will then be drafted and published. We shall bring the Bill before Parliament as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<P>

We are also taking a range of measures to improve food safety arrangements in the transitional period before establishment of a food standards agency. The Minister for Food Safety and the Minister for Public Health will take on a joint role in preparing the way for the food standards agency and ensuring maximum protection for the public. They will carry out this day-to-day role in close consultation with their ministerial counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The group will be headed by Mr. Geoffrey Podger, a Department of Health official currently seconded to MAFF. The new joint group will report to Ministers in both Departments. In Scotland, all food safety issues are handled by a single team which comes under the responsibility of the Scottish health Minister; in Wales all food safety issues come under the responsibility of the Welsh health Minister; and in Northern Ireland the Department of Health and Social Services has lead responsibility for food safety issues.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what progress has been made on the selective cull; and if he will make a statement. [12074]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Since 1 May, progress with the selective cull has substantially improved. In Northern Ireland, the cull is complete except for six animals and any which have been imported from Great Britain. In Great Britain, we have completed nearly half of the natal herd visits. In Scotland, we have completed all of them. In England and Wales, all but a few of the visits have been made to farms with animals in the compulsory years. We have now slaughtered 15,000 animals in the UK--10 times the number that had been slaughtered when we came to office. This is good progress, but we need to do better still.
<P>

<a name="70730w18.html_para0">We have looked at all our procedures to see what more can be done to speed up. We have recently reached agreement with the Commission that farmers can choose a valuer from a list of valuers drawn up by the Ministry where the valuation is for 10 or fewer animals. Up to now, many owners have opted to have two valuers, which has created problems in arranging valuations and thus slowed down progress with the cull. This new procedure is already being put into practice.
<P>

<a name="70730w18.html_para1">Now that owners can choose the valuer, I do not consider it necessary to have two valuers for 10 or fewer animals. I therefore propose to amend the BSE Compensation Order 1996 so that the option of having two valuers for 10 animals or fewer is no longer available. We regard this as necessary, particularly to ensure that we make maximum progress with animals that have moved away from their herd of birth and will mainly be dealt with as single animals. Farming and valuers organisations will be consulted on the draft amendments to the order, which in the interests of making speedy progress on the cull I propose to lay and bring into force during the recess.
<P>

<a name="70730w18.html_para2">It is in everyone's interests for the cull to be completed as soon as possible. That is the Government's aim and we will continue to look for ways to make faster progress. I hope that farmers will work with the state veterinary service to get through this difficult task as quickly as we can.

 The EU surplus food scheme, as laid down by EU regulation 3149/92, as amended, allows member states to remove certain intervention stocks of produce from store and supply it to the poor and needy via charitable organisations. This year, the UK is withdrawing 5,000 tonnes of UK intervention beef from stock and arranging for it to be processed into canned stewed steak and distributed to more than 850 charities, local authorities and other non-profit-making organisations.

 Government support for solar photovoltaic technology will certainly form part of the review of policy on new and renewable energy. In the meantime, we will continue with the research, design and development work under the Department's new and renewable energy programme, which is assessing PV technology, for example by monitoring a number of large-scale installations, such as the Ford factory roof at Bridgend and the Doxford offices at Sunderland. We are also supporting the deployment of PV in 100 schools and colleges across the country through the &#163;2.5 million foresight "SCOLAR" initiative.

 The business link national Internet site was launched on 25 October 1996. The cost of the development of the site to the DTI will total &#163;180,000 over a period of three years up until 13 October 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Agencies operating within England, Scotland and Wales are governed by the Employment Agencies Act 1973. The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 1976 in particular impose responsibilities on agencies that place workers aborad. Similar legislation applies in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="70730w20.html_para1">In the event of breach of contract by an overseas employer, including wrongful dismissal, remedies may be provided by local law. Contractual rights may also be enforceable in the UK courts, particularly if the contract was made under English law.

<P>
<a name="70730w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Employment protection legislation generally applies to employees who ordinarily work in the UK, although some provisions have wider application. Employees covered by this legislation are therefore able to pursue their statutory rights in British courts or industrial tribunals. Employees who ordinarily work outside the UK must generally look to the law and legal system of the country in which they work for protection.

 Initiatives specific to the Clwyd, South area will be a matter for North Wales health authority.
<P>

<a name="70730w21.html_para5">At the all-Wales level, there are many public health initiatives under way, and proposed, to prevent ill health. Primary prevention initiatives including the Welsh child health surveillance programmes, for example, play a vital role in monitoring the health and development of children. The childhood vaccination and immunisation programme represents one of the most effective public health interventions currently available. At very little cost, lifelong protection can be provided against infectious diseases--the health burdens of which can be enormous.
<P>

<a name="70730w21.html_para6">Public education campaigns are under way, including national campaigns dealing with a full range of public health issues such as smoking, diet, physical activity, substance misuse and healthy sexual behaviour. In particular, the "Back to sleep" campaign aimed at reducing the number of cot deaths has been very successful.
<P>

<a name="70730w21.html_para7">A wide range of legislation is in place to control the incidence of food-borne diseases and the Government are committed to protecting the public health through additional measures to ensure the safety of food, including the establishment of a food standards agency. Specific research initiatives under way including all-Wales projects aimed at reducing the number of cases of food poisoning and levels of infections acquired during hospital stays, are progressing well.
<P>

<a name="70730w21.html_para8">Secondary prevention measures including the early detection of breast and cervical cancers, for example, through screening programmes available in Wales, have significantly improved chances of survival from these diseases.
<P>

<a name="70730w21.html_para9">In my statement on 7 July, I made reference to the progress made with the 1989 strategic intent and direction for the NHS in Wales and the Welsh health survey in 1995. Subsequently, a streamlined set of health targets were announced by the Secretary of State for Wales on 10 June. These include prevention initiatives to reduce deaths from cancer of the lung, breast and cervix. Other target areas include coronary heart disease and stroke. We have also asked health authorities to draw up plans to reduce accident and suicide rates and to work to improve the quality of life of patients with a number of painful conditions.
<P>

<a name="70730w21.html_para10">All these initiatives, both existing and proposed, will continue to be afforded a high priority to provide the greatest possible health benefits for the people of Wales and ensure that health strategies address the adverse effects on health of social, economic and environmental factors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w22.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he plans to regulate the marketing of long-term care insurance. [12080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In December 1996, my predecessor issued a consultation document on proposals to regulate the marketing of long-term care insurance under the Financial Services Act 1986. These proposals were designed to complement proposals by the then Secretary of State for Health set out in his document "A new partnership for care in old age".
<P>

<a name="70730w22.html_para1">The Government do not intend to implement the previous Government's draft Bill on a partnership scheme. We feel that this was only a partial solution designed to help a relatively small number of people and that what is needed is a more fundamental and wide-ranging review of all the options.
<P>

<a name="70730w22.html_para2">In view of this, the Government intend, as set out in their manifesto, to examine provisions for long-term care for the elderly. The Government will make a further announcement on this once the form and content of that examination have been settled.
<P>

<a name="70730w22.html_para3">These policy developments have important implications for the balance of argument for and against early action to regulate the marketing of long-term care insurance. The broader policy debate is likely to have fundamental implications for the future of this market and for its regulation. It is my decision, therefore, that it would be premature to proceed now to amend the scope of the Financial Services Act 1986. Once the broader policy debate has been taken forward, I shall consider carefully the implications for the regulation of marketing of long-term care insurance.

 <i>[holding answer 29 July 1997]:</i> The external financing requirement of a nationalised industry has been used since its introduction in 1976 as the consistent measure of financial support an industry requires to supplement income from its trading activities. The EFR is a measure of the cash needed by the industry to fund investment and meet costs not covered by revenue. As such, it is only an indirect measure of subsidy. Information presented on this basis has been available since 1976-77. Table 3.11 of the "Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 1997-98", Cm 3601, lists EFRs from 1978-79 and 1982-83 onwards.

<P>
<a name="70730w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 July 1997]:</i> We have received a number of representations suggesting steps that the Government might take to deter further demutualisations of building societies. The Government are committed to the benefits of the mutual building society and the opportunities for choice for the consumer. However, a number of UK representatives raise difficult issues of principle because they could frustrate the will of the members, or significantly reduce the board's accountability to them. Nevertheless, we are keeping the situation under review.

 <i>[holding answer 29 July 1997]:</i> The figures are given in nominal terms in the table. The coverage of the reserve has varied with the definition of the control aggregate. For example, in 1990-91, the planning total was redefined to exclude self-financed expenditure by local authorities. In 1993-94, this was in turn replaced by the control total, which included all local authority expenditure but excluded cyclical social security spending and privatisation proceeds.

<a name="70730w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 July 1997]:</i> RPIX inflation is now a well-understood and accepted measure, RPIY has the property of excluding indirect taxes, which is useful for some purposes, but it does not measure prices actually paid in the shops and it does not measure what inflation would be in the absence of indirect tax changes. It is also less widely used and less well understood. On balance therefore, the Government decided that RPIX was the better target, but the Bank of England will continue to monitor RPIY in its "Inflation Report".

 The Government came into power with a commitment to allow a free parliamentary vote on hunting with hounds. Against this background, we wish to ascertain the extent to which Ministry of Defence land is used for hunting and what the consequences would be of ending such use. This investigation is not yet complete, but taking full and proper account of the legal issues involved and the fact that it would be wrong to anticipate the outcome of the parliamentary process, the current situation will be allowed to continue. Licences for fox hunting on Ministry of Defence land for the 1997-98 hunting season will be renewed on application. These will be limited to hunts which have traditionally held such

<a name="70730w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Every defence contractor needing access to information or material marked "confidential" or above requires the appropriate security clearance. A subsidiary of a foreign-owned company must ensure that no foreign national will have access to such information without the approval of my Department. At least 50 per cent. of its UK-resident directors must be UK nationals and the number of foreign nationals transferred from the parent company to work in the UK subsidiary must not be excessive, having regard to all the circumstances. My Department must be satisfied that the arrangements that are made meet UK national security requirements and is assisted in coming to a determination by the Security Service.

 The Army has a number of initiatives in place to ensure that personnel of the right quality are retained in the service in sufficient numbers. This includes retention bonuses to target specific groups of soldiers where retention problems have been identified, for example in the Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Artillery and the infantry. In addition, re-enlistment bounties are available to ex-regular soldiers in the above regiments and corps who agree to rejoin the active list. A recruiting bounty is also payable to serving soldiers in the arms with particular recruiting difficulties, who sponsor a recruit to join their regiment or corps.

<a name="70730w27.html_para0">Recruiting for the Army is a continuous process, but from time to time, campaigns are undertaken to target specific population groups. At the present moment, there is an enhanced summer advertising campaign in progress, which is aimed at 16 and 17-year-olds who have just left school. Other measures planned and approved are the Army Foundation college, due to open in September 1998, and the Scotland school leavers scheme, due to begin its first course in January 1998. This scheme is a short-term measure to address the acute manpower shortages in the Scottish infantry. Both these schemes are aimed at 16-year-old school leavers and will provide a good grounding in core skills in the NVQ/SCOTVEC schemes, as well as basic military training. In addition, I have approved the retention of 41 high street Army careers information offices until at least 2000. Further measures are being considered.

<P>
<a name="70730w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Field </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 1997]:</i> The Department of Social Security's press releases are made available to hon. Members and to the media via the Central Office of Information's news distribution service. NDS's delivery mechanisms include a newswire service which, among others, supplies press releases to the parliamentary online information service, which can be accessed by all Members of Parliament and peers, hand deliveries, fax and postal services, online databases and a widely accessed world wide web site.
<P>

<a name="70730w27.html_para1">These methods are used either singly or in combination to ensure the most cost-effective methods are used to reach the relevant target audiences and to suit the nature of the documents--for example, whether press releases are dispatched on their own, or accompanied by reports, consultation documents and so on. No separate costing is available for the hand delivery service alone.
<P>

<a name="70730w27.html_para2">The Department also runs its own mailing list for press releases for organisations such as welfare rights and charities. This is a postal service.
<P>

<a name="70730w27.html_para3">The number of press releases issued from 1 May to 1 July was 52 and from 1 January to 1 March was 66.

[10857]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government recognise the valuable contribution made by carers to providing community care. Benefit provision is aimed at helping to maintain the income of someone who gives up the opportunity of full-time work to provide care on a regular and substantial basis to a severely disabled person.
<P>

<a name="70730w27.html_para4">One of the qualifying conditions for invalid care allowance is, therefore, that a person has not attained pensionable age. Payments of ICA may continue beyond age 65, if entitlement was established before that age. There is no provision for people to postpone receipt of the benefit.
<P>

<a name="70730w27.html_para5">We are committed to a review with the objective of reducing poverty and welfare dependency and promoting work incentives. Provision for disabled people and their carers will form part of that review.

<P>
<a name="70730w28.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Fitzpatrick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans she has to extend the scope of national insurance contributions to employee relocation allowances. [12159]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 As part of looking for areas in which tax and national insurance could be brought closer together, it 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jul 1997 : Column: 360</I><P>
has become necessary to examine the national insurance liability of some relocation expenses. Subject to Parliament's approval of regulations, from 6 April 1998, national insurance contributions will be collected on those relocation allowances that do not qualify for tax relief.
<P>

<a name="70730w28.html_para0">In the large majority of cases, national insurance contributions are currently not collected on the relocation allowances paid by employers. By comparison, some allowances do not qualify for any tax exemption whatsoever, while some do. For example, the allowances on which tax is payable include those for additional housing costs incurred if the employee moves to a higher cost area. Other allowances such as legal and estate agents' fees, stamp duty and removal expenses are exempt from tax up to a maximum of &#163;8,000 for each relocation.
<P>

<a name="70730w28.html_para1">This change will bring the two systems closer together over these payments while recognising the important differences between them. The new rules will exclude from national insurance contributions only those allowances that could qualify for tax relief as listed in tax legislation.
<P>

<a name="70730w28.html_para2">This is a fairer way of dealing with the national insurance position on these allowances which are paid to the approximately 120,000 employees who receive help from their employers in work-related moves every year.
<P>

<a name="70730w28.html_para3">The extra revenue to the national insurance fund will amount to about &#163;50 million a year once the charge is fully in place. The fund pays for all contributory benefits. These benefits are extremely important to the people who receive them, including some of the nation's poorest pensioners, and we must ensure that employers and employees pay their fair share.
<P>

<a name="70730w28.html_para4">To assist employers with relocations already planned, these changes will not affect employees who start a job in a new location before 6 April 1998 or their employers. The current treatment will continue to apply for all their relocation payments.

(19) Calculations are based on the 1997 Budget economic assumptions.<P>

(20) Figures have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 per cent.<P>

1. It has been assumed that the cost for all benefits whose rate is the same as the basic state pension, i.e. widow's benefit and the long-term rate of incapacity benefit would rise accordingly.<P>

2. The split of rates between employee and employer contributions was achieved by considering that for an employee on average earnings for a full-time adult, the increase in contributions paid by an employee would be the same as the increase paid by the employer.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what would be the cost of allowing pensioners to draw their state pensions from the age of 60 years. [7547]

<P>
<a name="70730w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is estimated that the cost of allowing all pensioners to draw their full retirement pension from age 60 would be around &#163;9 billion a year. When changes in incapacity benefit and income-related benefits are taken into account, the net cost would be around &#163;7 billion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment she has made of the effects of the reduction in income support levels for lone parents to be introduced in April 1998 on the diet and living standards of the children of lone parents remaining on income support. [10768]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Existing recipients of the lone parent rate of the family premium in income support will not be affected as the benefit changes will affect only lone parents making new claims. It is not possible to assess accurately the effect of the reduction in income support levels on the diet and living standards of the children of those lone parents who will make a new claim for income support: individual lone parents will chose to spend their income support in different ways. The best way we can help lone parents to improve significantly their living standards is to help them move into work. That is why we have set up the new deal to help them to do this. Lone parents in work are, on average, &#163;50 a week better off than they are out of work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what representations she has received from organisations representing lone parents about <i>(a)</i> the level of income support for lone parents and <i>(b)</i> the level of child benefit for lone parents; and if she will place copies of such representations in the Library. [10770]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 Representations about the proposed changes to lone parent benefits were made by a wide variety of organisations, including those representing lone parents, to the Social Security Advisory Committee; the same points have been raised in regular discussions between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and lone parent organisations. These representations were reflected in the Social Security Advisory Committee's report, which was published on 30 July together with the Government's response as Command Paper 3713. However, lone parent organisations recognise that work offers lone parents the best way to improve their standard of living, and have welcomed the new deal for lone parents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will list each of the functions relating to the payroll for which her Department is responsible, indicating the management systems purchased, all sub-contractors involved in the work, co-operative arrangements with other Departments and the costs of the systems and processes in the last year for which figures are available. [10744]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Department of Social Security's payroll function is carried out in-house using an integrated pay and personnel computer system. The networked system is available across the Department for the operation of payroll and personnel management through local personnel units. A database, holding details of employee accounts, shares a mainframe computer with the Department's main benefit processing systems. All DSS staff salaries are paid by the system either monthly or weekly directly into bank accounts via automated credit transfer.




<P>
<P><I>30 Jul 1997 : Column: 365</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70730w29.html_para0">Management of personnel unit operations rests separately with each individual executive agency and department headquarters. An external supplier, Harvest Ltd. has responsibility for Contributions Agency personnel operations. It was the successful bidder in a market test exercise. All other personnel operations are in-house.
<P>

<a name="70730w29.html_para1">Payroll support services, for all agencies, are operated by the Benefits Agency under a joint venture agreement. The central administration, technical support units and IT operations are run from the Department's Newcastle offices. The BA contracts the Information Technology Services Agency for system running, maintenance and support. ITSA in turn manages a series of contracts with external providers of IT services that cover the whole range of administration and benefits systems which the DSS operates. Payroll IT operations form a small part of these total contracts. The external service providers for the Department's IT services, including payroll, are EDS, Sema Group and Bull Systems.
<P>

<a name="70730w29.html_para2">The pay and personnel system is part of the Department's financial and management information system--FAMIS--which also includes its administrative accounting systems. The payroll and personnel element of FAMIS was developed entirely in house, by the BA and ITSA, over a three-year period and has been operating successfully for four years. It now supports six separate pay, grading and reward structures, one for each agency and department headquarters. The system is also responsible for tax and national insurance administration for all DSS staff.
<P>

<a name="70730w29.html_para3">There are no direct, on-going, co-operation arrangements in place for payroll with other Departments apart from standing arrangements for employee transfers between Departments.
<P>

<a name="70730w29.html_para4">Because FAMIS has been designed to support both pay and personnel functions within the Department by the use of a common data base and IT processes, it is not possible to provide costs that solely relate to payroll processing. The information in the following table relates to central business and IT process costs to support both payroll and personnel activity in the Department.

 In 1995-96, there were on average about 600,000 persons who were unemployed and not receiving any social security benefit excluding child benefit. This represents about one in four of the total number of persons unemployed. Approximately 70 per cent. of these had working partners or shared a household containing at least one working person.

 Records of recruitment exercises are available only as far back as 1994. The Department has not used aged restrictions in employment advertisements at any time sine 1994 but in practice does not recruit staff over age 60. This is because the normal retirement age for most grades in DSS is age 60.

<a name="70730w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Participation in a local exchange trading system scheme is regarded as work for the purposes of jobseeker's allowance and income support. The credits received are taken into account as actual earnings. Family credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit treat LETS credits in same way.
<P>

<a name="70730w30.html_para2">Neither jobseeker's allowance nor income support are payable to people who work for, on average, 16 hours or more a week--24 hours for partners of people receiving income-based jobseeker's allowance or income support.
<P>

<a name="70730w30.html_para3">Where a person spends less than 16 hours a week on LETS activities, the credits are taken into account as earnings subject to the appropriate disregard--normally &#163;5 a week. Any expenses wholly and exclusively defrayed for the purposes of the LETS activity, together with an amount in respect of tax and national insurance contributions, can also be deducted from the earnings.
<P>

<a name="70730w30.html_para4">People claiming unemployment-related benefits must also continue to satisfy the labour market requirements of being available for and actively seeking work. Under jobseeker's allowance, people must normally be available for a minimum of 40 hours a week, but can stipulate their own pattern of availability with the employment officer--within reasonable limits. For jobseekers participating in LETS, this means that they must either be prepared to give up the LETS work to take up a full-time job, or be able to move the LETS activities to avoid any conflict; or be available in accordance with a pattern of work which gives them reasonable prospects of securing employment, while avoiding conflict with their LETS activities.

 A number of studies have been carried out, both by the Department of Social Security and by research organisations, which have looked at possible disincentives to work, for example, studies into the effects of the unemployment and poverty traps. We have studied the findings carefully. The circumstances of lone parents seeking work, for example, were explored in the Department's research "Moving off Income Support:Barriers and Bridges", published last year and this helped develop our proposals for a new deal for lone parents. The report established that a significant obstacle for lone parents moving in to work was the cost of child care and we are addressing this with our national child care strategy and with the recently announced enhancements to the child care disregard, which are the first steps in our 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jul 1997 : Column: 372</I><P>
programme of helping parents to have access to affordable, good-quality child care if they are to balance work and family life successfully. The new deal for lone parents will be important in our continuing evaluation of barriers to work. We want to make it worth while for people to make the transition into work and ensure a fair return on extra earnings once they are in work. We believe work is the best form of welfare for people of working age.

We are looking for substantial and sustained operational improvements from the agency, in particular on getting more maintenance paid, reducing the backlog and improving customer service.

<a name="70730w31.html_para3"><i>Letter from Faith Boardman to Mr. Nick Gibb, dated 29 July 1997</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency budget for telephone operations during 1997-98.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the present time access to the Agency can be made by means of the National Enquiry Line, Client Helplines, or by direct dial to Child Support Officers in the Child Support Agency Centres and associated Field Offices.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Enquiry Line occupies a central location and is available to anyone who has a general enquiry about the Agency. The Agency has a target for answering general enquiries under its Charter Standards: we aim to answer enquiries within 20 seconds during normal working hours. Performance against this standard was 64 per cent. during 1996-97.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Client Helpline is available in each of the six Centres to deal with clients' case specific enquiries. The Agency has had no target which covers this area, but it is clear that this is an area where the service offered by the Agency has not fully met its customers needs and we are currently looking at the definition of the targets.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am committed to improving this and plans are in place to improve the service. In 1996-97 the Agency spent &#163;2.2 million on running costs for its telephone system; it is anticipated that &#163;2.7 million will be spent in 1997-98. Overall, the Agency focus is on providing a more efficient and accessible telephone service for clients making best use of its existing resources.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency plans to employ staff to work a wider more flexible range of working patterns over six days a week. This will provide more opportunities for customers to contact the Agency and vice versa, and will enable the Agency to deliver a better standard of customer service through greater use of the telephone. The Agency has also recently initiated an Early Positive Customer Contact project which will increase the use of the telephone by Agency staff at an early stage in our dealings with customers. The aim is that much more of our business will be conducted over the telephone rather than by correspondence, giving customers more opportunity to raise any issues or concerns earlier than at present.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am very conscious that there are still far too many justified complaints about the standards of basic customer contact and the service we provide. Over the next few years, I am committed to bringing high quality levels of performance to every part of our operation as a matter of routine, thereby reducing the number of complaints received and enhancing the public perception of the Agency.

The Pensions and Overseas Benefits Directorate handles claims from customers living in over 230 countries around the world. These claims can take longer to clear than their Great Britain counterparts because confirming life event details, such as births, marriages and deaths, is often not straightforward and documentation which is readily available in the UK can take longer to obtain from other countries.<P>

 A number of representations have been received regarding the incapacity benefit all-work test from groups representing disabled people, other interested organisations and individuals affected. I have also seen the recent report by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Some important issues have been raised which will be considered in the context of the general review of social security. Our aim is to provide a system that helps those who can to become financially independent, and focus support on those who cannot.

<a name="70730w32.html_para2">It is important that the test for incapacity benefit commands confidence as a fair system that appropriately assesses whether an individual is capable of work for benefit purposes.

<P>

<P>
<a name="70730w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Milburn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 1997]:</i> If a general practitioner prescribes, as part of general medical services, a diabetic needle that is listed for the purposes of section 41 of the National Health Service Act 1977, it will be dispensed as part of pharmaceutical services and will attract a prescription charge. The same is true for needles issued to hospital out-patients on prescription by hospital doctors. Under the National Health Services (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Regulations 1989, as amended, people with diabetes mellitus--except where treatment is by diet alone--are exempt from all prescription charges, including any which would relate to the prescribing of needles.
<P>

<a name="70730w32.html_para3">If a general practitioner himself provides diabetic needles to a patient as part of general medical services, he can make no charge. Likewise, under section 1 of the 1977 Act, health authorities and trusts must not charge for services and equipment, except where the legislation expressly indicates that a charge should be made. In all other cases, including diabetic needles, where a health authority or trust--taking account of resources, needs and clinical priorities locally--decides that a piece of equipment should be provided as part of national health

 In March 1986, health circular HC(86)1 was issued to health authorities giving guidance on the provision of contraceptive advice and treatment to young people under 16, and to the circumstances in which such advice and treatment can be given without parental knowledge or consent. The circular sets out the criteria upon which a doctor or health professional must be satisfied before prescribing contraception. Copies of the guidance are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70730w33.html_para1">The Department of Health's guidance, and professional advice produced by organisations such as the BMA, make it clear that doctors must try to persuade a young person who is unwilling to allow parents or general practitioners to be informed of the importance of doing so. The General Medical Council has also issued guidelines for GPs on this issue. We will be discussing with the health professions and voluntary sector the development of standards to build upon good practice in contraceptive advice and treatment for young people.

 At the time of the November 1996 Budget, the gross domestic product deflator was forecast at 2 per cent. for 1998-99, and the previous Government planned a 0.25 per cent. real terms increase in expenditure on the national health service in England for that year. At the time of the July 1997 Budget, the Chancellor revised the gross domestic product deflator forecast to 2.75 per cent. for 1998-99.

<a name="70730w35.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The independent advisory panel has been asked to report by the end of October. We expect it to inform us at that stage of the methods that it has used to assess services. The panel is independent. We do not expect to make any statement on its work until we have had an opportunity to consider its findings.

 The task force will not produce a formal report, but its initial findings are expected to be available in the autumn. The task force met on 12 June. Individual task force members will work with Ministers and officials to take forward specific areas of work. The effectiveness of the task force will be measured by the short-term savings it is able to make in the national health service without detriment to patient care.

 The Department of Health does not maintain lists of clinical procedure which have been judged to be "effective" or "ineffective".
<P>

Some interventions will be appropriate for certain conditions, but inappropriate for others. The Department, in partnership with the health professions, sponsors a wide range of programmes which aim to bring forward the best possible research-based professional advice and make it available to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="70730w35.html_para1">The Government intend that the NHS should concentrate on the quality and success of treatment, so that effectiveness of services, and outcomes for patients, will become the standards by which we measure the performance of health services.

 The Government are committed to increasing the UK's combined heat and power capacity beyond the previous Administration's target of 5,000 MW by 2000. A detailed review of the potential for CHP, carried out for my Department by the environment technology support unit, has now been published, and I will be placing a copy in the Library. The ETSU review indicates the cost-effective potential for CHP in industry, commerce and the public sector as being between 10,000 and 17,000 MW, depending on the assumptions made on future energy prices, users' required rate of return on investment, and other factors. The review does not cover additional CHP in the housing and community heating sectors, or the growth in renewable fuelled CHP, both of which are being separately reviewed.

 The amended environmental impact assessment directive must be implemented by 14 March 1999. The new directive clarifies and amplifies the existing provisions for environmental assessment. It provides a useful tool for the proper assessment of any significant environmental effects of development. It also gives the public greater access to environmental information about such significant projects, enhancing local democracy and ensuring that the decision-making process is open and understood.

Our aim in implementing the directive is to ensure that the process is beneficial in both environmental and economic terms. We are making a number of specific proposals for implementation which will further this aim while still maintaining the flexibility of the current system.

In the light of responses to this consultation, the Government will decide what changes to policy guidance could and should be implemented in interim planning guidance, which would better be accommodated in a full review, planned for 1998, of minerals planning guidance note No. 3--coal mining and colliery spoil disposal--and whether any legislative changes are necessary.

All Government Departments with an interest are therefore being consulted. We are also taking into account such views as have been expressed by other organisations.

 The disposal of radioactive waste is regulated in England and Wales by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.

 It will be for individual local authorities to determine their local needs and priorities when they apply resources released under the capital receipts initiative. When an authority decides to use resources to support new provision by registered social landlords, that development must meet the Housing Corporation's scheme development standards. These set out minimum requirements for new developments: all passenger lifts must be accessible to those in wheelchairs; new developments for the elderly must take account of their increasing accessibility needs; and properties built for wheelchair users must conform to standards agreed with the National Wheelchair Housing Association Group.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much has been invested in the water and sewerage systems by each water and sewerage company in each year since 1987. [11195]
<P>

<P>
<a name="70730w40.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 July 1997]:</i> Information on water and sewerage companies' investment since privatisation in 1989 is available in the report on the financial performance and capital investment of the water companies in England and Wales published annually by the Office of Water Services. The annual "Waterfacts", published by the Water Services Association, has shown figures for capital expenditure by water and sewerage companies and, before privatisation, by water authorities. Copies of both these publications are in the Library. Expenditure by water authorities included sums spent on some functions, including pollution control, flood protection and land drainage, which in 1989 were transferred to the National Rivers Authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what conditions his Department places upon the breeding and keeping of hybrid wolf dogs; [11095]
<P>
<UL>(2) what regulations are in place to monitor the selling of hybrid wolf dogs; [11099]

<P>
(4) what studies his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into the breeding of hybrid wolf dogs.[11101]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w40.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The keeping of wolf hybrids is controlled under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. Under the Act, a licence is required to keep such animals. The issuing of licences and the day-to-day administration of the Act are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.
<P>

<a name="70730w40.html_para0">A licence can be issued only if a local authority is satisfied that it would not be against the public interest on grounds of safety or nuisance; that the applicant is a suitable person to hold a licence; that the proposed accommodation ensures that the animal will not escape, and is suitable from an animal welfare point of view. In issuing licences, local authorities may require restrictions 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jul 1997 : Column: 408</I><P>
on the movement of the animal from the premises specified in the licence, and impose any other condition which they consider appropriate.
<P>

<a name="70730w40.html_para1">The 1976 Act contains no provisions relating to the breeding or sale of wolf hybrids, and the Department has not undertaken any studies into their breeding. However, in replying to a question from my hon.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w40.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Article 20 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 already specifies the time periods within which planning decisions should be taken and we have no plans to amend this aspect of the legislation. The responses to my Department's recent consultation paper on development plans confirmed the difficulty of setting a statutory timetable for the development plan process which would be appropriate to all authorities. However, certain parts of the process are already subject to time limits and we are considering the scope for extending this. We are also looking at the possibility of requiring authorities publicly to set target timetables for the adoption of their plans, for which they would be accountable locally.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w40.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Under section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, changes of use within individual use classes are not development, do not require planning permission and are therefore not recorded.

 We have no plans to extend the right of appeal to third parties in planning cases. It is for elected local authorities to act in the general public interest when determining planning applications. Planning legislation already provides extensive opportunities for members of the public and interested organisations to comment on both draft development plans and individual planning applications.

 <i>[holding answer 28 July 1997]:</i> EC regulation 3093/94 places a freeze on the production and consumption of methyl bromide at 1991 levels from 1995, and requires a further 25 per cent. cut from 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the cost of changing waterway speed limits and speed limit signs to metric measurements to <i>(a)</i> public funds, <i>(b)</i> the owners of motor boats and cruisers on the Broads and <i>(c)</i> the Broads Authority.

 No nationwide assessment has been made. The Broads Authority estimates the total costs of changing its speed limits and signs to metric would be some &#163;54,000. Since the cost of operating the Broads Authority's navigations is financed by users, these costs would be recovered from boaters via their licence fees.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on progress on the reform of leasehold valuation tribunals. [10241]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70730w42.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Service charge disputes are renowned for causing distress and misery to many leaseholders who have, in the past, had to go to court to challenge unreasonable charges, risking unknown and potentially high costs.
<P>

<a name="70730w42.html_para0">From 1 September, leaseholders will be able to apply to the 11 leasehold valuation tribunals, which will use their specialist professional expertise towards settling these disputes. Leaseholders' risks of incurring large legal bills will also be limited, because the tribunals do not award costs. Applicants will, however, have to pay a fee of up to &#163;500 for each application, although the tribunals will have a discretion to require the other party to the dispute to reimburse this fee.
<P>

<a name="70730w42.html_para1">As well as challenging service charge bills for costs already incurred by the landlord, leaseholders will now be able to challenge works which are proposed. Landlords too will be able to seek a determination that the costs or scope of the proposed works are reasonable before they start spending money.
<P>

<a name="70730w42.html_para2">Bad management is a continuing problem for tenants of flats, who will now also be able to apply to the tribunal instead of the county court for the appointment of a new manager, if the tribunal is satisfied that the landlord has determined, or is likely to demand excessive service charges, or that he has failed to comply with a relevant provision of one of the three approved codes of management practice available.
