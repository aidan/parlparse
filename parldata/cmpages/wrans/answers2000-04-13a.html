<a name="00413w01.html_wqn1"><B> Rev. Martin Smyth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what estimate he has made of the additional number of pensioners in Northern Ireland entitled to the winter fuel allowance following the European Court of Justice judgment of 15 December 1999.  [118120]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is estimated that there will be 39,000 additional people in Northern Ireland entitled to Winter Fuel Payments as a result of the European Court of Justice judgment. I should point out that these people will not all be pensioners, as men aged between 60-64 are not receiving retirement pension.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the average time taken <i>(a)</i> to process an application for a wheelchair and <i>(b)</i> for an applicant to receive a wheelchair.  [118581]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The average time taken to process an application for a wheelchair depends on the type of equipment required. For level 1 wheelchairs, applications are processed within one working day of receipt at the Regional Wheelchair Centre and chairs are delivered to clients within five working days. For level 2 modified equipment, an application takes 10 working days to process and the equipment is delivered within 20 working days. For level 3 specialised equipment, processing of an order takes 10 working days and delivery of the equipment can take in the region of 3-6 months.

<a name="00413w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Up to the end of January 2000, 31,838 young people (23,926 men and 7,912 women) and 17,753 long-term unemployed adults (15,620 men and 2,133 women) have benefited from the New Deals in the North-East. It is a measure of the success of the Government's Welfare to Work policies that 16,652 people in the North-East have found work through the New Deals. The remainder are benefiting from the help that the Personal Adviser can offer. This includes help with barriers to employment, access to specialist help and training, education and work experience opportunities. New Deals for the long-term unemployed are only part of the package of Welfare to Work measures introduced by this Government. Many other people in the North-East will benefit from the New Deals for Lone Parents, 50 plus, partners of the unemployed and the disabled.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w01.html_wqn8"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office when she will publish the report of the review of the Organisation of Public Sector Ombudsmen in England.  [119218]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the report of the review of the organisation of public sector ombudsmen in England is published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are also available from the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="00413w01.html_para3">The start of the review was announced by the then Minister for the Cabinet Office on 30 March 1999 and forms part of the Modernising Government agenda. The review, which was carried out by a team in the Cabinet Office, was wide-ranging: it covered the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Service Ombudsman for England and the Local Government Ombudsmen for England, and looked at the potential interaction between those ombudsmen and other independent complaints authorities such as the independent Housing Ombudsman and the Data Protection Commissioner. The review team consulted widely with those who have an interest in the ombudsmen system, including all Members, the ombudsmen themselves, central and local Government, representative bodies (such as the Local Government Association and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives) and external interest groups.
<P>

<a name="00413w01.html_para4">The main recommendations in the report are that the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Service Ombudsman in England and the Local Government Ombudsmen in England should be merged into a collegiate structure (a new Commission); and that the present requirement for complainants to put their complaints via a Member to the Parliamentary Ombudsman (the "MP filter") should be removed; and that their procedures be simplified and made more flexible.
<P>

<a name="00413w01.html_para5">The Government welcome the review's focus on providing a more customer-oriented Ombudsman service. It recognises that the recommendations raise a number of significant issues about the status and constitution of the Ombudsmen. Accordingly, we shall now be consulting widely before reaching our final conclusions on implementing the review's recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 International co-operation is a crucial part of this Government's policy in biotechnology, which gives priority to the protection of human health and the environment. The UK is active in a number of international bodies, including the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the Codex Alimentarius group. It has pressed at European level on issues such as GM food labelling and releases of GMOs to the environment; and in January negotiated the United Nations Programme Biosafety Protocol. Most recently, it successfully hosted an OECD conference on GM food safety in Edinburgh. We will be discussing the results of that conference, including the recommendation for an international scientific advisory panel on GM food and environmental safety, with G8 partners and developing countries in advance of the next G8 summit.

<P>
<a name="00413w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is assumed that the report referred to is an internal study on the workload of operational managers in the Field Operations Directorate. The study was commissioned by the Director of Field Operations and reported to him in June 1998. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library. Action on the specific recommendations in the report has been taken forward by the Directorate in consultation with the managers concerned, and is nearing completion.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will ensure that all HSE field offices of the Field Operations Division have staffed reception areas for members of the public in easily-accessible ground floor locations.  [118387]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 requires the Health and Safety Commission to provide an "information and advisory service" to help the public. While the Health and Safety Executive ensure that members of the public have access to the information and advice they require, it cannot be guaranteed that staffed reception areas in ground floor locations will be available. In light of the relatively small number of personal callers to offices, a judgment has to be made as to whether a permanently staffed reception area is the most efficient use of resources.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 HSE has not issued any guidance on hospital-acquired infections to patients, and has no plans to do so. The primary responsibility for issuing such guidance rests with the Department of Health (DoH) although HSE is consulted where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00413w02.html_para1">HSE has, however, produced guidance which is relevant to certain aspects of the control of infection in health services, notably the Health Services Advisory Committee's guidance "The safe disposal of clinical waste" and "The safe working and prevention of infection in clinical laboratories, mortuaries and post mortem rooms".
<P>

<a name="00413w02.html_para2">HSE's guidance and the code of practice under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999 cover general precautions against infection risks, although they do not specifically address hospital- acquired infection.
<P>

<a name="00413w02.html_para3">HSE is also planning to produce a leaflet on the risks from blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis and HIV, which will be applicable to a number of occupational groups including the healthcare sector.

These include meetings of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the European Civil Aviation Conference, the International Air Transport Association and the Flight Safety Foundation. I understand in the EU only the UK has published comprehensive data on the incidence of air rage, therefore it is not possible to make comparisons with other member states' carriers.

<P>
<a name="00413w03.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if it is Government policy that the Housing Act 1996 should be amended so that local authorities must provide a written explanation of the reasons for <i>(a)</i> excluding and <i>(b)</i> suspending an individual from the Housing Register;  [118309]
<P>
<UL>(2) the Housing Act 1996 should be amended to prevent the exclusion of people in housing need, except in exceptional circumstances.  [118308]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Housing Act 1996 gives local authorities considerable discretion to decide what classes of person qualify, or not, to appear on the housing register. In making any decision to reject a person's application to be put on its housing register, the authority must notify the applicant in writing.
<P>

<a name="00413w03.html_para0">On 4 April 2000, the Government published their plans for a comprehensive review of housing policy in England in the Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All". This sets out the Government's proposals for providing choice in social housing. The Government do not believe that anyone should be permanently excluded from social housing and therefore propose to remove the power local authorities have to impose 'blanket' exclusions. Instead the Government propose to allow authorities temporarily to reduce the priority or suspend the applications of households on an individual basis where this is justified. In applying any such sanction, authorities would be required to explain the reason in writing and to give applicants a clear indication of any action necessary to have the restriction removed. They would have a right of appeal in cases of dispute.
<P>

<a name="00413w03.html_para1">Any decisions to suspend an application would need to consider carefully the circumstances of the household in order to safeguard vulnerable people. Suspensions would be used in exceptional circumstances where other means of managing a problem had been exhausted.

 The Government fully support the published commitment of the Health and Safety Commission to reducing gas-related carbon monoxide poisoning fatalities by at least 10 per cent. over a 10 year average. To further this aim, the Commission published a discussion document on 4 November 1999, entitled "Gas safety review: options for change" to invite views on a wide range of issues which impact on domestic gas safety. This reflects preliminary representations made to the Health and Safety Executive by key consumer and industry stakeholders, analysis of accident data, and work commissioned under the auspices of the Government's People's Panel initiative on the attitudes, knowledge and behaviour of Panel members in relation to gas safety.

<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para1">Demonstrating the Government's commitment to openness and transparency on GM issues, my Department has arranged a series of public meetings across England, about the research programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress is being made with the revision of planning guidance on flooding.  [119334]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A consultation paper on a new Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 "Development and flood risk" is published today and has been placed on the Department's website.
<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para2">The Government recognise the importance of flooding and the effects it can have on people's lives. While there is no quick and easy solution, in the longer term a more precautionary and risk-based approach will ensure that new development is not exposed to risk unnecessarily or itself add to flood risk in other areas. Taken together with MAFF and Environment Agency initiatives on flood warning and flood defence, this new guidance will assist in reducing the potential impact of flooding.
<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para3">The draft guidance published today takes account of the developing knowledge of the likely impacts of climate change, but recognises the inherent uncertainties. Planning decisions should apply the precautionary principle to avoid inappropriate development in flood-risk areas. Where other material considerations outweigh flood risk in favour of proceeding with development, the draft guidance emphasises the need to design and defend such development to an adequate level to ensure the safety of 



<P>
<P><I>13 Apr 2000 : Column: 250W</I><P>
people and minimise property damage. It also emphasises the need for developers to contribute towards the cost of flood defences that may be required as a result of implementing their project.
<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para4">The draft guidance advises that it is necessary to look at development and flood management on a wider scale and to ensure that run-off from new development is controlled as near the source as possible through the use of sustainable drainage systems. This mitigates the problems caused when additional run-off from extensions to built-up areas increases flood risk downstream.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00413w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am today publishing, on my Department's website, the review undertaken by Professor Leslie Clark of the conclusions of the report of the Expert Group on Thaumasite which he chaired and which reported in January 1999. When I announced the publication of the report last year I said that I had asked Professor Clark to review its conclusions in a year's time in the light of the findings of further research and monitoring which was then being commissioned.
<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para5">The review found that the recommendations of the Thaumasite Expert Group's report were robust and continue to minimise the risk of the thaumasite form of sulphate attack in new construction. The report has been generally well received by the construction industry and is viewed as sound and well balanced.
<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para6">There have been 20 new cases of the thaumasite form of sulphate attack identified in the last year. All of these have taken place in conditions that were anticipated in the report. None have posed any threat to public safety.
<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para7">The new data available do not permit relaxation at present of the report's recommendations with one exception. There is a majority view within the Expert Group that the report's very conservative procedure for assessing the sulphate class of sulphide bearing ground can now, with safety, be relaxed somewhat in respect of pyritic clays. The review has also suggested the need for clarification of some aspects of the guidance given in the relevant BRE Digests and British Standards.

<P>

<a name="00413w04.html_para9">The Government believe that the properly managed development of effective competition in the water industry in England and Wales is desirable. It should benefit consumers by promoting greater efficiency, lower prices, innovation and better services--as it has in other utilities. This consultation paper seeks views on how increased competition can be arranged in ways that safeguard, in particular, public health, the environment and wider social objectives. We are keen to receive a wide range of responses to inform policy decisions. We expect that some of these will be taken forward in a future water Bill.

We are re-seeding the area behind the Canada Gate in Green Park following remedial work to problems associated with flooding in the past. The seeding is due to be completed by the end of the month and the grass should begin to appear during May. The area will remain fenced because it is usually heavily used and the new grass needs to be protected until it is well established.

The Canadian memorial water feature is usually operational. When it fails, as it occasionally does, it is repaired and brought back into service as soon as possible.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2000]:</i> UK Athletics is to be congratulated on securing both the 2003 World Indoor Championships in Birmingham and 2005 World Athletics Championships in London at Picketts Lock. UK Athletics is now continuing the process of drawing up detailed proposals for developing the site, including proposals for road and rail links.

At that meeting, the Park Authority indicated that funds were already earmarked in its business plan for developing the Picketts Lock site and both capital and revenue contributions might be forthcoming to a world- class athletics facility on that site.

<P>

<a name="00413w05.html_para6">

<BR>
<i>Spoliation Advisory Panel</i>
<BR>
<i>Constitution and Terms of Reference</i>
<BR>
<i>Members of the Panel</i>
<BR>
1. The members of the Spoliation Advisory Panel (the Panel) will be appointed by the Secretary of State on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit. The Secretary of State shall appoint one member as Chairman of the Panel.
<BR>
<i>Resources for the Panel</i>
<BR>
2. The Secretary of State will make available such resources as he considers necessary to enable the Panel to carry out its functions, including administrative support provided by a Secretariat (the Secretariat).
<BR>
<i>Functions of the Panel</i>
<BR>
3. The task of the Panel is to consider claims from anyone (or from any one or more of their heirs), who lost possession of a cultural object (the object) during the Nazi era (1933-45), where such object is now in the possession of a UK national collection or in the possession of another UK museum or gallery established for the public benefit (the institution). The Panel shall advise the claimant and the institution on what would be appropriate action to take in response to such a claim. The Panel shall also be available to advise about any claim for an item in a private collection at the joint request of the claimant and the owner.
<BR>
4. In any case where the Panel considers it appropriate, it may also advise the Secretary of State
<BR>
(a) on what action should be taken in relation to general issues raised by the claim, and/or
<BR>
(b) where it considers that the circumstances of the particular claim warrant it, on what action should be taken in relation to that claim.
<BR>
5.(a) In exercising its functions, while the Panel will consider legal issues relating to title to the object (see paragraph 7(d) and (f)), it will not be the function of the Panel to determine legal rights, for example as to title;
<BR>
(b) The Panel's proceedings are an alternative to litigation, not a process of litigation. The Panel will therefore take into account non-legal obligations, such as the moral strength of the claimant's case (paragraph 7(e)) and whether any moral obligation rests on the institution (paragraph 7(g));
<BR>




<P>
<P><I>13 Apr 2000 : Column: 256W</I><P>
(c) Any recommendation made by the Panel is not intended to be legally binding on the claimant, the institution or the Secretary of State;
<BR>
(d) If the claimant accepts the recommendation of the Panel and that recommendation is implemented, the claimant is expected to accept the implementation in full and final settlement of his claim.
<BR>
<i>Performance of the Panel's functions</i>
<BR>
6. In performing the functions set out in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Panel's paramount purpose shall be to achieve a solution which is fair and just both to the claimant and to the institution.
<BR>
7. For this purpose the Panel shall:
<BR>
(a) make such factual and legal inquiries, (including the seeking of advice about legal matters, about cultural objects and about valuation of such objects) as the Panel consider appropriate to assess each claim as comprehensively as possible;
<BR>
(b) assess all information and material submitted by or on behalf of the claimant and the institution or any other person, or otherwise provided or known to the Panel;
<BR>
(c) examine and determine the circumstances in which the claimant was deprived of the object, whether by theft, forced sale, sale at an undervalue, or otherwise;
<BR>
(d) evaluate, on the balance of probability, the validity of the claimant's original title to the object, recognising the difficulties of proving such title after the destruction of the Second World War and the Holocaust and the duration of the period which has elapsed since the claimant lost possession of the object;
<BR>
(e) give due weight to the moral strength of the claimant's case;
<BR>
(f) evaluate, on the balance of probability, the validity of the institution's title to the object;
<BR>
(g) consider whether any moral obligation rests on the institution taking into account in particular the circumstances of its acquisition of the object, and its knowledge at that juncture of the object's provenance;
<BR>
(h) take account of any relevant statutory provisions, including stipulations as to the institution's objectives, and any restrictions on its power of disposal;
<BR>
(i) take account of the terms of any trust instrument regulating the powers and duties of the trustees of the institution, and give appropriate weight to their fiduciary duties;
<BR>
(j) where appropriate assess the current market value of the object;
<BR>
(k) formulate and submit to the claimant and to the institution its advice in a written report, giving reasons, and supply a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, and
<BR>
(l) formulate and submit to the Secretary of State any advice pursuant to paragraph 4 in a written report, giving reasons, and supply a copy of the report to the claimant and the institution.
<BR>
<i>Scope of Advice</i>
<BR>
8. If the Panel upholds the claim in principle, it may recommend either:
<BR>
(a) the return of the object to the claimant, or
<BR>
(b) the payment of compensation to the claimant, the amount being in the discretion of the Panel having regard to all relevant circumstances including the current market value, but not tied to that current market value, or
<BR>
(c) an ex gratia payment to the claimant, or
<BR>
(d) the display alongside the object of an account of its history and provenance during and since the Nazi era, with special reference to the claimant's interest therein; and
<BR>
(e) that negotiations should be conducted with the successful claimant in order to implement such a recommendation as expeditiously as possible.
<BR>




<P>
<P><I>13 Apr 2000 : Column: 257W</I><P>
9. When advising the Secretary of State under paragraph 4(a) and/or (b), the Panel shall be free to recommend any action which they consider appropriate, and in particular may, under paragraph 4(a), direct the attention of the Secretary of State to the need for legislation to alter the powers and duties of any institution.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary receives many representations about the investigation of complaints against the police and the need for greater independence in the process. Although the Police Complaints Authority, which oversees the complaints process, is fully independent of the police, the present arrangements rely on police officers to carry out investigations.

 The most recent change in young offender institutions has been the introduction of Prison Service Order 1702 which was issued in July 1999, a copy of which is in the Library.

 As at 29 February 2000, the Defence Housing Executive held a stock of 61,936 married quarters in England, Scotland and Wales, of which 47,385 were occupied and 3,719 were in the course of disposal. Of the balance of 10,832 empty properties, 3,507 were under offer to service families, most of which are likely to be occupied within the next two months. 1,145 were vacant awaiting further unit deployments or use as decant accommodation during refurbishment programmes. 1,652 properties were empty awaiting modernisation and 4,528 were routine voids, that is a working management margin for some 22,000 family moves each year.

Most of the MOD housing stock in England and Wales is owned by Annington Homes and is underleased by the MOD. Properties identified as having no long-term requirement to the Department are released to that company under the terms of the contract agreed in November 1996 by the previous Administration.

 The situation in Ethiopia is serious. Ethiopia is a very poor country with a GDP of $110 per capita. Many Ethiopians are partially dependent on food aid in most years. This is the third year in succession when the early rains have either failed or been poor. Ethiopia has also been engaged in a war with Eritrea since May 1998. The war has disrupted Ethiopia's economic and social progress. It has also affected food security by diverting trucking capacity and increasing costs; denying access to the ports of Massawa and Assab; and denying rural households supplementary income sources in Eritrea and Tigray. As a result, eight million people now face serious food shortages. According to the information we have available, Ethiopia's initial appeal for 758,000MT of cereals is almost fully met. Britain has provided &#163;4.5 million of food and non-food bilateral assistance this year. We have provided more bilateral food aid this year than any European donor and we will contribute 17 per cent. of the 432,000 metric tonnes which will be provided through the EC this year.

<a name="00413w07.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Cyclone Hudah has not affected the previously flooded areas in southern and central Mozambique. The cyclone made landfall in Pembane in northern Mozambique late on Friday 7 April. Preliminary assessments indicate very limited damage to property and while there has been some localised flooding this has not been exceptional. Full assessments will be completed over the coming days, but it appears there are no outstanding needs at this time.

<a name="00413w07.html_para4">The cyclone had previously caused considerable damage while tracking across the North East of Madagascar. As a result, there are an estimated 100,000 people requiring immediate assistance. My Department has already provided some &#163;600,000 for immediate relief to those affected by Cyclones Eline and Gloria.

This support has been channelled through United Nations Children's Fund, for water sanitation and health activities; and the World Food Programme for food and delivery of relief items to isolated communities. However, due to the increase in the number of people requiring assistance these resources may run out quicker than planned. We stand ready to respond further, pending completion of detailed assessments.

 I have been keeping the development programme for Zimbabwe under very close review since 1997, taking full account of other Departments views. It is the Government's view that it would not help the poor in Zimbabwe to suspend our aid programme. We are disbursing less than half the aid that our published Country Strategy Paper makes clear would be available if the Zimbabwe Government showed a commitment to better governance and economic policies that would benefit the country and improve the life of the poor of Zimbabwe.

 We understand that a lending syndicate would be led by UBS of Switzerland. As no decision has been taken on the availability of export credit support, discussions have not yet commenced on the financing. If and when a decision is taken to provide support, ECGD will discuss the project with the lending syndicate as part of its normal procedures.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave him on 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 611W. It is well established that material obtained through the use of compulsory powers is subject to duties of confidentiality. Disclosure can be made only in certain circumstances and for certain specified purposes. While I am unable to make such material available to the Library of the House, the inspectors' concluded views were set out in their report published in June 1993.

 I met the Chairmen of the Trustees of the coal pension schemes (the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme and the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme) recently and discussed how the Government and Trustees could build on the arrangements put in place at privatisation to the mutual benefit of both Scheme members and the Government. These discussions are continuing.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2000]:</i> The information to produce estimates of costs on this basis for the last ten years is not readily available. Estimates of these costs for the years for which this information is available (1998 and 1999) are given in Table 1 as are equivalent bills for customers on standard credit terms. The majority of customers are still on standard credit terms. The available information on bills for earlier years is presented in Table 2. This is based on different levels of consumption to those stated in the question.

 TrustUK's criteria require e-commerce code owners to carry out effective monitoring to ensure that traders comply with the codes to which they subscribe. The criteria require monitoring to be carried out independently and with integrity and objectivity. Monitoring work must be capable of being externally verified. TrustUK will be developing statistically robust monitoring techniques.
<P>

<a name="00413w12.html_para0">TrustUK's criteria allow a degree of flexibility as to how monitoring is performed. The Government believe this approach, combined with effective enforcement and sanctions, should provide adequate consumer protection. At the same time it gives code owners some choice about the kind of monitoring procedures they adopt. The Government believe that codes should be flexible instruments, capable of evolving in response to market developments. TrustUK is developing a transparent procedure for keeping its criteria under review.

 EC Regulation 723/2000 amending EC Regulation 1294/1999 concerning a freeze on funds and a ban on investment in relation to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was adopted by the Council of the EU on 6 April. The Regulation, which enhances the implementation of the existing financial sanctions against the FRY, came into force on 8 April. Among other changes, it clarifies the scope of the freeze of funds by tightening the definition of "the Government of the FRY" and "the Government of the Republic of Serbia".

 Preliminary evidence from the United States of America indicates that intensity-modulated radiotherapy may have a role in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, this treatment is not common practice in the United Kingdom and its effectiveness has not been evaluated.

 The Department is currently establishing an advisory group, which will oversee the commissioning and running of the pilot sites for HPV testing and provide expert advice and support on all aspects of the scope of the project. A limited competition exercise will be held in the summer to select the pilot sites, and it is anticipated they will be chosen by the autumn. Testing will begin when preparatory work at each site is complete.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the progress made in identifying an additional supplier for the BCG vaccine.  [118603]

 The Department has identified other manufacturers of BCG vaccines worldwide and is investigating these possibilities together with experts from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control, the Medicines Control Agency and National Health Service Supplies. This work is still ongoing due to the complex nature of ensuring the safety and efficacy of any alternative source. Products from different manufacturers vary in their composition. We will need to be assured of the safety and efficacy of these products, that they can satisfy current United Kingdom licensing requirements and also that supply is such that further interruptions to the programme, once reinstated, will not occur. We are not yet in a position to be able to confirm when or if an alternative source will be available.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that a proposed European Commission Regulation covering novel feed is expected to be presented to Council in the summer. We have been pressing for this as it should contain fair and consistent labelling rules for genetically modified material. In the meantime, the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs is considering questions of terminology and thresholds.
