 Several external consultants have advised CDC on Higaturu Oil Palms since 1999. All have made recommendations for further improvement of Higaturu&#039;s environmental management, which have been incorporated into Higaturu&#039;s environmental management plan. None of them identified areas of concern that had not already been recognised or were not part of ongoing management.

 I received a letter from Friends of the Earth in June 2004, which enclosed letters from organisations in Papua New Guinea. In my reply to Friends of the Earth, I assured them that DFID takes these matters very seriously but that they should be taken up in the first instance with the company concerned. I understand that Actis, which manages the CDC investment in Pacific Rim Palm Oil Pte Ltd., the owners of Higaturu Oil Palms, held a meeting in late June 2004 with Friends of the Earth about these issues and has also replied to them by letter. In that reply, they invited Friends of the Earth to visit the plantation.

 The estimated cost of fraud to DFID each year since 1997, including the number of cases, is illustrated in the following table. While many of the cases are relatively small in financial terms (the total loss due to fraud in recent years is 0.006 percent of DFID&#039;s total spending) the Department remain committed to minimising such losses. This year DFID has reviewed and updated its policy and response to fraud, with advice from anti-fraud specialists.

 In the UK, in the last 12 months, the Department for International Development has recycled at least 90 per cent. of our redundant documentation, waste paper and card, and has now implemented an Environment Management System to monitor all our environmental impacts including waste streams. DFID also has a clear policy to reduce our production of waste by actively encouraging re-use, recycling and composting of paper and card and recycling of other materials such as glass, metal and wood. DFID also use refurbished and recycled products and materials wherever possible, and all our copying paper is 100 per cent. recycled with at least 75 per cent. post-consumer waste.

The UK share of this European Community humanitarian assistance is about &#163;710,000. The European Union is also planning to mobilise &#163;2.64 million from the allocation to Grenada under the European Development Fund, originally set aside for unforeseen circumstances.

Efforts are also being made through civil society to secure greater representation and accountability of the state to its citizens by enhanced awareness of their entitlements and the participation, particularly of women, in decision-making at all levels of devolved government. In the 2001&#150;02 Local government elections, for example, 32,222 women were elected into union councils and 3,827 women to tehsil/town and district councils. In addition, through contesting open elections, 16 women were elected as union council, tehsil or district nazims (mayors).

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the impact on the islanders of Tristan da Cunha of the changes in sailing schedules of the Royal Mail Ship St Helena; and if he will make a statement. [189541]</p>









<p><a name="41004w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 In January this year, the St. Helena Government (SHG) decided to end the annual call by the RMS St. Helena at Tristan da Cunha. In reaching its decision, SHG considered the alternative access arrangements available to Tristan da Cunha and the take-up of passenger and freight traffic on the ship during recent voyages. Taking account of alternative shipping links with Tristan, which can offer more competitively priced freight and passenger capacity, the conclusion reached was that the annual call had become of limited economic or practical value.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w02.html_para7">
Essential physical access arrangements for Tristan will be maintained by other vessels that call there on other business. These include two South African fishing vessels and a South African research ship which, between them, are expected to make 14 visits to Tristan this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w02.html_para8">
The new arrangements for the XRMS St. Helena&#039; will remain under review and further adjustments will be considered in the light of experience. SHG has not ruled out the possibility in future of occasional voyages to Tristan (or the UK) if there were sufficient demand for them.

 Claims received from those in the private rented sector will generally be referred to the local Rent Officer for a rental valuation to determine the housing benefit claim. The market evidence that is used to compare properties for the purpose of making these valuations is updated on an ongoing basis by the Rent Service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w07.html_para2">
In nine pathfinder areas, we are testing a reform of housing benefit for tenants in the private rented sector, called the Local Housing Allowance (LHA). This is a flat-rate allowance based on broadly average market rents in the area for each size of property, and the rates are set by the Rent Officer. Once an LHA rate has been calculated, it will apply to all properties within that particular area and so will not have to be calculated separately for each property. LHA rates are updated monthly in line with any changes to market rents in the area, and are supplied to the relevant local authority. The local authority is then required to publish these figures.

 It is a regulatory requirement that a qualified teacher must be involved in early years&#039; education in each maintained setting. It is also set out in Sure Start Unit guidance to local authorities that they should work towards and beyond having one qualified teacher to every ten non-maintained settings. The Sure Start Unit is, therefore, providing the Teacher Training Agency with additional funding to expand the number of primary training places with an early years&#039; specialism. We are also funding local authorities to ensure that all Foundation Stage practitioners, including early years&#039; teachers, receive an average of four days training and development a year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) whether it is his policy that a minimum funding guarantee overrides existing fair funding formulae; and if he will make a statement on the Audit Commission&#039;s observation to that effect on page 11 of its publication Education Funding;  [189270]

</p>



<p>(3) if he will make a statement on the finding of the Audit Commission study that showed that councils have suspended changes to their formula because they are unclear about the Government&#039;s intentions with regard to the minimum funding guarantee.  [189314]</p>








<p><a name="41004w10.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The minimum funding guarantee that was introduced in 2004&#150;05 has brought stability and certainty to schools budgets. It was considered appropriate to put in place such stability given the funding difficulties experienced by some schools in 2003&#150;04. As a result of the introduction of the minimum funding guarantee two thirds of schools nationally received an increase above the level of the minimum guarantee while the remaining third of schools received a per pupil increase in funding in line with the guarantee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w10.html_para0">
The proposals for the minimum funding guarantee (including specifically provisions for exclusions, special cases and small schools) were developed in close consultation with our national partners, including representatives of local authorities and Chief Education Officers. Provision was made in the regulations to enable local education authorities to apply to the Secretary of State to amend the operation of the minimum funding guarantee where there was a clear anomaly in the outcome for individual schools or groups of schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w10.html_para1">
Changes to a local education authority&#039;s funding formulae are matters for local discretion provided that they operate within the framework of the regulations. While the Audit Commission reports that some councils have suspended proposed changes to their funding formula, the survey was based on a sample of LEAs and was carried out before the start of the financial year 2004&#150;05. Evidence from other authorities shows that there is no inherent need to suspend changes to formulae as a result of the minimum funding guarantee. Some authorities, in fact, have used the guarantee to provide transitional protection to ensure that such changes are phased in appropriately to ensure stability in school budgets.

<p><a name="41004w12.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Baron: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what representations he has received in favour of commissioning research into the possible relationship between back pain and school furniture as the part of its plan to refurbish every secondary school in the next 15 years; and what plans he has to commission such research.  [188669]</p>








<p><a name="41004w12.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 There has been no formal representation made to the Department since the announcement of the Building Schools for the Future programme regarding a possible relationship between back pain and school furniture. However, informal discussions have been held with the National Back Pain Association in the recent past and we are aware of that organisation&#039;s concerns in this regard. The Department has no plans to commission research on this issue but is developing an ergonomic website which will allow teachers and building professionals to determine the correct size of furniture for a particular pupil, supported by child size data gathered recently by a survey jointly funded by the Department.

<p><a name="41004w12.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice gives guidance to local education authorities on carrying out their statutory duties for identifying, assessing and making provision for children with special educational needs, including those who have behaviour, social and emotional needs. The Code of Practice makes clear that local education authorities must make decisions about the placement of children with statements of SEN on an individual basis, taking account of parental preference.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps the Government are taking to promote stable families.  [186975]</p>

 We believe that all children deserve the chance to grow up in a stable loving family, and we 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1813W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
are increasing the support available to families who want it. We know that poverty places great stress on families and can be a major contributing factor to family breakdown. There are around 500,000 fewer children living in relative poverty than there were in 1997, and there have been significant increases in child benefit, and more generous support through new tax credits. We have also introduced the biggest ever package of legal changes to help working parents balance work and family, including the right to request flexible working&#151;for fathers, as well as mothers and over one million people are now taking this up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w12.html_para0">
The Every Child Matters Green Paper put supporting parents and carers at the heart of our approach to ensure that every child reaches their full potential in life. Through the development of Sure Start, Children&#039;s Centres and Extended Schools we are now bringing together support for all children and families in a more integrated way. We are expanding the Children&#039;s Centre programme to create 2500 centres by 2008.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w12.html_para1">
Every Child Matters also highlighted the role of relationship counselling and family mediation services. Current arrangements are being amalgamated to form a new Strengthening Families Grant programme to fund voluntary and community sector organisations providing relationship support. A family focused, single grant programme will help to promote stable families. However, the Government recognises that some relationships will inevitably break down and the recently published Parental Separation: &quot;Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities&quot; Green Paper details a range of measures to provide more effective support to families in relation to contact and residence after divorce and separation.
</p>

Although Governments cannot create stable families, we believe that these&#151;and other&#151;measures are playing a valuable role in supporting families.

There are no statistics held centrally as to how much has been given in grants to redevelop town centres. This could be provided only at disproportionate cost. While it is not clear as to the exact proportion that is spent on town centres specifically, in the current financial year (2004&#150;05) nearly &#163;3.27 billion of Government funding has been allocated to regeneration programmes of all kinds. This is due to increase to &#163;3.55 billion in 2005&#150;06.

Funding for town and city centre regeneration can be secured from a wide range of different sources, and is being carried out through partnership working across central and local government, regeneration agencies and local stakeholders. The nature of local economic growth and the development of town and city centres requires local authorities to determine local policies which meet the specific needs of their area. To do so they need to develop their own strategies and prioritise resources, which will vary in each case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w13.html_para3">
Funding for the regeneration of town and city centres can be secured from sources including the Single Regeneration Budget, European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund, the lottery, New Deal for Communities, Regional Development Agencies, English Partnerships, Urban Regeneration Companies, local government, Business Improvement Districts, section 106 agreements, and private sector funding.

 Government plans for Havering include an investment of &#163;6 million to improve the public transport interchange at Rainham station through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Thames Gateway Programme. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also supporting the opening up of Rainham Marshes, providing &#163;2 million to enable the public to have improved access to the Marshes.

<p>
<a name="41004w13.html_para4">
Future plans include proposals for Havering Riverside, which is identified as a major location for growth in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s &quot;Creating Sustainable Communities&quot; (published July 2003) and is an Opportunity Area in the London Plan. The regeneration strategy will be taken forward by the Mayor, the London Borough of Havering and the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation through the East London sub-regional development framework.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w13.html_para5">
The London Plan sets the framework for the scale of growth of Romford within London and the east London sub-region. The Mayor of London&#039;s sub regional development framework, currently in preparation, will also address the issue of regeneration in Romford.

However, there is considerable evidence of urban renaissance in towns and cities across the country, and much of this recent investment has included residential development.

Major mixed use developments like the new Bull Ring in Birmingham, and investment in new or improved civic squares, high quality architecture like the Lowry Centre in Salford, the Urbis Building in Manchester, the Winter Gardens in Sheffield and the Newcastle-Gateshead Millennium Bridge, have played a key role in encouraging population growth in town and city centres.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w13.html_para8">
For example, Manchester&#039;s city centre population rose from under 1,000 in 1991 to over 15,000 today. Liverpool&#039;s has increased from 2,300 to more than 9,000 over the same period. Birmingham, Leeds and Bristol have experienced similar growth.

 &quot;Sustainable Communities: building for the future&quot; is a policy document, which identifies growth areas, including Thames Gateway, but also refers to growth across London.

The impact of the proposals, including any impact on nearby town centres, would be considered through these processes.

<p>
<a name="41004w13.html_para10">
Within London, policy on the regeneration of town centres is principally a matter for the Mayor of London and the London boroughs. The London Plan sets out the general policy of promoting the strategic importance of London&#039;s town centres in accommodating economic growth, meeting the needs of Londoners and improving the sustainability of London&#039;s development. It also seeks to ensure that there is a robust strategy for each town centre taking account of the relationship with nearby centres. The local development frameworks to be prepared by the London boroughs will ensure that there is full community involvement in the development of regeneration proposals and are intended to promote a positive approach to managing development.

The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires Regional Planning Bodies to prepare statutory Regional Spatial Strategies, replacing existing Regional Planning Guidance. These strategies will be required to identify the amount and distribution of housing in each region having regard to the Government&#039;s latest published household projections and national planning policy for housing as set out in PPG3. They will also need to consider other factors including the needs of the regional economy, environmental implications and the capacity of urban areas and existing or planned infrastructure to accommodate new housing.

Where the amount and location of previously-developed land varies across regions, Regional Planning Bodies and Local Planning Authorities are expected to work together to focus new housing in areas where previously-developed land is available in preference to developing greenfield sites.

We made it clear at the outset that in our view, given the circumstances, a civil investigation, rather than a military one, should be undertaken into these deaths. As I told President Uribe, we were therefore pleased that the Colombian Government did decide to pursue this course of action, and that NGOs and trades unionists locally were kept informed of the process. The Colombian Government made it clear that if a human rights abuse had been committed, they too would find it unacceptable and would take strong measures against the perpetrators. We note that, following the investigation, the Prosecutor General has ordered the arrest of the military personnel involved in the deaths.

<p>
<a name="41004w16.html_para0">
We continue to urge the Colombian Government to implement all outstanding UN human rights recommendations. We have made it plain that we are very willing to assist in this process, and with other partners are in close touch with the Colombian Government, the UNHCHR Representative, NGOs and trades unions to help carry matters forward.

 The Department for Transport&#039;s consideration of Manchester Metrolink and the Phase III extensions was based on an assessment undertaken by the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE). This took account of the impact on: the regional and local economy; shift from car use to public transport; cost and capacity of alternative public transport and road options; the effect on the local and regional road network; and changes in air quality. The Department&#039;s judgement of the benefit cost ratio for the Phase III extensions (Oldham/Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne and East Didsbury) is 1.6:1.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w20.html_para2">
The Secretary of State took the decision not to approve Metrolink Phase III&#151;along with the proposed schemes in Leeds and South Hampshire&#151;because of a further substantial increase in costs. As the Secretary of State announced on 20 July, no government could accept the schemes as they are on the basis of their escalating costs and he could therefore not approve Phase III of Metrolink in its current form. In Manchester, costs had doubled and the project was reduced to less than the three lines originally proposed. The Department is working closely with GMPTE on developing alternative proposals.

The Government&#039;s policy as set out in &quot;A New Deal for transport: Better for Everyone&quot; (1998 Cm 3950) is that there are a number of trunk roads which mainly serve local and regional traffic and are more appropriately managed at local level. Therefore the Highways Agency has been transferring responsibility (together with an appropriate level of resources) over to local highway authorities to enable decisions to be better integrated with local transport and land use planning issues. The result will be to reduce the trunk road network by 30 per cent. or around 3,000 km in total. So far about two thirds of these roads have been detrunked. The data have not been adjusted to take this into account.

Access for nuclear safeguards inspections is provided according to the terms of Chapter 7 of the Euratom Treaty and the UK&#039;s safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The European Commission&#039;s published reports on its implementation of Euratom safeguards show that there is very considerable inspection effort in the UK (some 2400 days in 2002)&#151;about half of which effort is at the Sellafield site. Safeguards inspectors have not been denied access for their verification and inspection activities at the Sellafield site, or elsewhere in the UK. Safeguards inspectors, as much as anyone else, have of course to be protected by UK regulations relating to radiological dose/safety&#151;this is a factor in their access to the B30 plant.

The Department has responded to this customer feedback in a number of ways. For example, following DTI&#039;s recent work on its business support portfolio, the range of support available has been rationalised to nine easy to use and easy to access products. Information on the website and in brochures is written in plain English, explaining what the products are and how to access them. Application processes have also been reviewed to make them easier for the customer to comply with. The changes mean that it is no longer necessary for businesses to make use of external professional advice or intervention to apply for and use the business support products.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assistance the UK has provided to the US authorities in the detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects; and if he will make a statement. [185050]</p>









<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Three United Kingdom forces personnel were involved in interrogation and debriefing of individuals held by United States Authorities at Abu Ghraib prison in early 2004, some of whom had suspected links to terrorism. In addition, UK armed forces personnel who are part of the Iraq Survey Group have been involved in interrogation and questioning of US detainees. In no other current operation have UK military personnel interrogated US detainees.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> total budget and <i>(b)</i> budget timetable for the Future Rapid Effect System programme.  [188783]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1872W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The full Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme cost has yet to be established, but the provision for acquisition could be in the region of &#163;6 billion. Whole life costs are estimated at &#163;49 billion. FRES is in the early stages of its Assessment Phase, during which a range of options to meet the requirement will be considered. Once we are clearer as to the options available we can better determine the funding profile.

<p><a name="41004w28.html_wqn5"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which other countries will be part of the Future Rapid Effect System programme; and whether it will be compatible with the equivalent US system.  [188784]</p>








<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Rapid Effect System is expected to support joint operations with NATO allies. Co-operation during the Assessment Phase is likely to focus on harmonising requirements for interoperability in support of coalition operations and mitigating common areas of technology risk. However, opportunities for collaborating on sub-systems and sharing information on technologies and requirements will be explored during the Assessment Phase, and the scope for future collaboration assessed prior to the Main Gate investment decision.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which present and future vehicles will carry the Future Rapid Effects System.  [188785]</p>








<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) will not be carried on present and future vehicles. FRES is the generic name for the capability being sought to enhance the deployability of Land Forces. It is anticipated that the capability will be provided by a family of medium-weight, networked armoured vehicles. Concurrently, FRES will replace the CVR(T) series, Saxon and elements of the existing FV430 series.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the Future Rapid Effect System will be operational without other countries providing spares or holding necessary hardware.  [188786]</p>








<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 As laid down in our Defence Industrial Policy, we are firmly committed to promoting a strong and competitive UK defence manufacturing industry. Our policy enables us to evaluate industrial capabilities and take decisions on whether there is a need to retain these in the UK against defined criteria. This will be one factor taken into account as part of the main investment decision.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the Future Rapid Effect System will be operational by 2010.  [188787]</p>








<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) has recently achieved Initial Gate approval, and is now in its Assessment Phase. Part of this Assessment Phase work will be to identify and reduce risk in the programme to enable us to define an appropriate In-Service Date (ISD) in both capability and programme terms for endorsement at Main Gate. The ISD will not be formally endorsed until then, but our initial planning assumption is to introduce the early variants of FRES around the end of the decade, with a phased approach to achieving full operational capability.

<p><a name="41004w28.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) will be the central pillar of a capable, coherent and highly deployable medium force with broad utility across the spectrum of operations.

 The Future Rapid Effect System Project is in the early stages of its Assessment Phase; it is therefore too early to determine the unit cost. Part of the Assessment work will focus on developing a series of affordable options for meeting the requirement.

<p><a name="41004w29.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 I receive representations from members of both Houses and from interested individuals and organisations about a range of issues, including pensions and other forms of support to Gurkha Service personnel. These have included comparisons between British and Gurkha soldiers&#039; pay and pensions; confusion about the benefits Gurkhas are entitled to; and comments about their treatment by successive British Governments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w29.html_para0">
Gurkha pay, allowances and pensions are regularly reviewed. In terms of welfare provision to Gurkhas following discharge from the Army, MOD makes a substantial annual grant to cover the administrative costs of the Gurkha Welfare Trust in support of the charity&#039;s work in Nepal.

[189384]</p>








<p><a name="41004w29.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 HMS Vanguard was originally due to return to the fleet in the third quarter of 2004. Her return to fleet is currently forecast for the second quarter of 2005. The main procedures still to be completed are working up of the nuclear reactor, preparations for and undertaking sea trials.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w29.html_para1">
The underpinning reasons for the delay stem from the fact that this is the first time a Vanguard Class submarine has undergone a Long Overhaul Period or been refuelled. It is also the first fit of a new design reactor core and the first use of DML&#039;s new nuclear 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1874W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
refitting and refuelling facility for Vanguard Class submarines. As is usual with major refits and Long Overhaul periods, there has also been an element of work that cannot be pre-planned in the regeneration of the equipment that has been dormant during the Long Overhaul Period (Refuelling).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w29.html_para2">
The direct cost of the Long Overhaul Period (Refuelling) remains within the originally approved total of approximately &#163;210 million (at outturn prices). However, the Department is currently negotiating with Devonport Management Ltd. on consequential costs as a result of the delay to HMS Vanguard leaving the dockyard. It is too early to say what the outcome of these negotiations will be.

 My right hon.

As part of this transformation the Army will restructure its infantry, taking into account the decision to cease arms plotting and the planned reduction in the number of infantry battalions as a result of the improving situation in Northern Ireland. The manpower freed up from the reductions in infantry battalions will be reinvested across the Army in a rebalancing exercise, to strengthen key enabling capabilities such as signals, logistics, engineers and intelligence and to fill gaps elsewhere in the infantry.

<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The ministerial statement of 1 July made clear that the Government are pressing ahead with plans to publish anonymised information about projects licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 as part of the Home Office publication scheme under the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w34.html_para4">
All new project license applicants will be required to provide the information for publication as part of the licence application process&#151;so it will be mandatory but not retrospective.

<p>
<a name="41004w34.html_para5">
Final decisions have yet to be taken on the precise details to be provided, as field trial work is still in progress. However, it should be noted as regards alternatives to animal use, that under the 1986 Act the Home Office can only license projects when satisfied that no such alternatives exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w34.html_para6">
Action taken on contraventions of the 1986 Act is determined by the particular circumstances of each case. Revocation of a license can be among the options to be considered.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, during his Department&#039;s monitoring of the Imutran xenotransplantation programme under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, primates were found dead in procedures of moderate severity.  [187047]</p>








<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Yes. 17 animals died between observation periods in procedures of moderate severity out of over 500 non-human primates used in the Imutran studies between July 1994 and March 2000. The evidence available at the time suggested that death occurred quickly with little suffering being experienced by the individual animals. None of the deaths raised issues of non-compliance with the relevant license authorities.


</p>







<p><a name="41004w34.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement outlining his Department&#039;s definitions of <i>(a)</i> moderate severity and <i>(b)</i> substantial severity in animal experiments. [187048]</p>









<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The categorisation of severity limits of protocols is explained in paragraph 5.42 of the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (HG321). Protocols regarded as moderate include toxicity tests which do not involve lethal endpoints and many surgical procedures, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1894W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provided that suffering is controlled and minimised by effective post-operative analgesia and care. Protocols that have the potential to cause greater suffering but include controls which minimise severity, or terminate the protocol before the animal shows more than moderate adverse effects, may also be classed within the moderate severity limit. Protocols regarded as substantial are those that may result in a major departure from the animal&#039;s usual state of health or well-being. These include acute toxicity procedures where significant morbidity or death is an endpoint; some efficacy tests of anti-microbial agents and vaccines; major surgery; and some models of disease, where welfare may be seriously compromised. If it is expected that even one animal would suffer substantial effects, the procedure would merit a &#039;substantial&#039; severity limit.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the results were of his Department&#039;s most recent monitoring of the progress made by Imutran in achieving each of the objectives in its project licence for xenotransplantation research. [187049]</p>









<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Imutran xenotransplantation research licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 began in 1994 and ended in 2000. At different points in time, and on different projects, Imutran tackled a number of different, but related, scientific objectives. With one exception, all of the predicted benefits relevant to the licensed studies taken into account in the cost benefit assessment of their project licence applications were delivered. However, by the middle of 1999 it became clear that they were not making progress in identifying a clinically potentially safe and effective means of preventing or controlling delayed forms of xenograft organ rejection and that the incidence of surgical technical failures was rising. We concluded that no new studies should be undertaken unless and until the cause of the technical problems was identified and remedied and an acceptable revised strategy for making scientific progress was devised. As a result, and after discussions with Imutran, its main programme of work was suspended by administrative agreement rather than formal suspension of the licence authorities. Some more basic work was allowed to continue in pursuit of secondary objectives. The Imutran project licences were eventually surrendered to the Home Office for revocation in July 2000.


</p>







<p><a name="41004w34.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes his Department has accepted and agreed to the original objectives in the project licence to Imutran for xenotransplantation research.  [187050]</p>








<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Imutran research licensed by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 involving pig to non-human primate xenotransplantation studies began in 1994 and was carried out under three separate project licences. These licences set out related objectives aimed at furthering Imutran&#039;s overall strategy ultimately to produce a means of making xenotransplantation clinically feasible. The specific objectives of the licensed work included the production of healthy, genetically altered pigs whose organs would not produce hyperacute rejection when transplanted into other species; demonstration of proof of concept; characterisation of other forms of xenograft rejection; and, having 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1895W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
developed an immunosuppression strategy appropriate for human clinical use, the study of the biocompatibility and performance of solid organ and tissue xenografts. More detailed scientific objectives were also set within this general framework. These detailed objectives were reviewed and refined at intervals while the work was in progress. Where authorised, amendments were largely made to those parts of the programmes characterising later forms of xenograft rejection and its management. The precise technical content of the amendments is commercially confidential.


</p>







<p><a name="41004w34.html_wqn10"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will order an independent public inquiry into the Imutran xenotransplantation research programme; and if he will make a statement. [187057]</p>









<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew10"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 No. We have considered the matter very carefully, but concluded that the issues, including those regarding compliance with the authorities granted to Imutran Limited under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 for its xenotransplantation research programme, do not merit such an inquiry. In November 2000, my right hon. Friend the then Home Secretary (Mr. Straw) asked the Chief Inspector of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate to carry out a routine assessment of compliance with the relevant authorities issued to Imutran Limited under the 1986 Act. The Chief Inspector&#039;s report, which covered five years work, was published on 13 July 2001 and copies placed in the Library. It confirmed that the general level of compliance was good. No new evidence justifying any form of further inquiry into these matters was found by the Chief Inspector nor has any subsequently been presented by any other source.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what systems are in place to ensure that the relationships between his inspectors involved in monitoring licences for animal experiments and the companies concerned are clear and objective.  [187085]</p>








<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew11"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Members of the Inspectorate are highly professional and dedicated and have the complete confidence of Government Ministers. The general civil service codes apply, and in addition inspectors are accountable for their professional conduct to the relevant professional bodies (the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and the General Medical Council). As Government employees, they have no conflicts of interest with respect to places, or persons, regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. They are not part of the management structure of the designated establishments, nor do they have any proprietary interest in the outcome of any licensed research programme. In addition, there is an active joint inspection programme, with more than one inspector visiting most places during the course of the year as part of the national inspection programme. Regulated places are also re-assigned between inspectors at regular intervals.

 I am unable to provide the information requested. Although specific instances may be reported to the Home Office as and when they occur, we do not routinely record the deaths in transit of animals destined for use under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, or the surrounding circumstances.

<p><a name="41004w34.html_spnew14"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 In fact, immediate action was taken. The three animals destined for use in research licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were found dead on arrival at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris from the Philippines on 5 August 1998. When the Home Office was notified of the deaths we immediately suspended authority to acquire animals from the source establishment until the causes had been properly investigated and any necessary action taken to prevent a recurrence. The problem was also promptly notified to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the Department then responsible for enforcement of the regulations relating to the transportation of animals. While it was not possible to identify the causes of death, it was considered likely that a combination of the large size of the animals in relation to the transport containers and inadequate ventilation were a contributory factor. The source establishment co-operated fully and ensured that the size of the transport containers was increased and ventilation improved. No problems were detected with a further batch of animals imported in December 1998.

The Council held an orientation debate on the new JHA multi-annual work programme. I said that the programme should focus on visible action with the aim of bringing practical improvements to EU citizens. Member States agreed on this and most Member States agreed the programme should focus on action that may be taken forward under the existing treaties. Most Member States agreed that mutual recognition should remain the cornerstone of judicial co-operation and that more effective use should be made of Europol. On Immigration and Asylum there was broad support for the emphasis the Presidency had placed on practical co-operation, implementation and the evaluation of existing measures, but differing views on the need for further harmonisation of legislation. One delegation noted that adequate funding would need to be made available to support the new work programme. The

The Commission presented its Communication Towards Enhancing Access to Information by Law Enforcement Agencies&#039; (10745/04) which emphasised the importance of wider access to national databases for law enforcement authorities, a common approach to the analysis of criminal and intelligence matters and the need to promote the idea of intelligence-led policing.

The Counter-terrorism co-ordinator also indicated work was being taken forward to look at ways for closer constructive engagement with moderate Islamic civil society. The Counter-terrorism co-ordinator also noted the Council would in due course examine how Eurojust may be better able to contribute to counter-terrorism efforts.

In light of growing pressure for the creation of a European register of criminal convictions, the Commission said it was preparing a draft Council Decision for October, which would promote the exchange of information on criminal convictions for serious offences, in particular murder, sexual crimes and terrorism. It was also planning to publish a Framework Decision on the mutual recognition of convictions by December. In approaching this work, the Commission took the view that it was unnecessary to create a single, central European database. Instead they favoured granting national authorities wider access to Member States existing registers. I supported the Commission, stressing that any initiative should include terrorist offences, and noting that attention should also be paid to the supervision of offender&#039;s post-conviction.

The annual report on Migration and Integration (COM (2004) 508 final) was presented by the Commission. The Commission said that the report underlined the fact that the EU needed further immigration for economic and political reasons. The Commissions view was that while it was appropriate for the rules, particularly on economic migration, to be left to the Member States, there was also a need to move forward at a Community level. The Commission proposed speedy agreement in the Council on common principles on integration and that issues should be mainstreamed within wider policy frameworks.

Our Anti Social Behaviour strategy is aiming to reduce people&#039;s perception of anti social behaviour, as measured by the British Crime Survey (using a measure combining seven strands of anti social behaviour) by 2005&#150;06 against the 2001&#150;02 baseline. Latest figures show that the overall level of perceived ASB has fallen.

Home Office guidance states that the decision to suspend should be taken only when the presence of an officer on duty may be detrimental to criminal or disciplinary investigations or proceedings, or when it is in the public interest to do so.

<p><a name="41004w41.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 All wild birds, including the cormorant are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which implements the EC Wild Birds Directive in Great Britain. Licences can be issued under Section 16 of the 1981 Act to kill or take certain birds for specific reasons, either on an individual or general basis. Licences can be granted to kill or take cormorants where it can be shown that such action will prevent serous damage to fisheries or inland waters. These licences are issued on an individual basis.

<p>
<a name="41004w41.html_para5">
The general licences allow authorised persons, such as landowners or occupiers, to kill or take these pest birds, such as pigeon, and corvids, as well as to destroy nests and oil or prick eggs of these birds all year round, subject to specified conditions. Bird species considered for placing on a general licence are those which are considered a pest and numbers are plentiful such as pigeons. Although number of cormorants have increased, the estimated GB population size of 23,000 with an England population of just over 11,000 is not sufficient to warrant a general cull without leading to local extinctions and impacts on biodiversity.

<p><a name="41004w41.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 1954/2003 establishes an effort management regime for EU vessels over 15 metres overall length fishing for demersal species, scallops and edible and spider crabs in ICES divisions V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and certain parts of the waters managed by the Fisheries Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF) and for vessels over 10 metres overall length fishing for these species in the biologically sensitive area in that part of area VII off the south and west coast of Ireland. The Regulation prohibits directed fishing for these species in Western Waters without a permit and provides for the setting of annual fishing effort allocations for each member state for each area and fishery described above. Those effort allocations are contained in Annex I of Council Regulation 1415/2004 and include effort allocations for UK vessels fishing for crabs in ICES areas V, VI, VII and VIII. These are based on the historic fishing activity of the UK crabbing fleet and so I would not expect UK shell fishermen to be prevented from fishing from the end of 2004. In the unlikely event that any of the UK crab effort allocations were in danger of being exhausted, Article 12 of Regulation 1954/2004 would allow the UK to submit a request to the Commission for an adjustment to its effort allocation either by an increase in the permitted fishing effort in a particular area or by a shift in fishing effort between areas.

 United Kingdom Fisheries Departments maintain aerial and sea surveillance within UK waters to ensure compliance with fisheries legislation by all fishing vessels including those from foreign fleets. These arrangements are regularly reviewed. An essential element of effective enforcement at sea is co-operation between member states. This is something that the Government fully support. The UK is a signatory to the declaration by the recently-formed Scheveningen Group whose aim is to improve co-operation between North Sea coastal member states. We also intend to play a constructive part in discussions

British sea fishery officers are not empowered to deal with criminal behaviour by animal rights activists. The Government announced on 30 July in the paper &quot;Animal Welfare&#151;Human Rights: tackling animal rights extremism&quot; a number of changes to strengthen the law on protests outside homes and harassment. These new proposals will strengthen on going action by the Government, police and Crown Prosecution Service and the courts to enforce existing legislation robustly and to ensure effective co-ordination to combat the criminal activities of extremists.

The theft of clams from Poole harbour is a matter for the Southern Sea Fisheries Committee to consider. Under the Poole Fishery Order 1985 (SI 1985 No. 847) the Committee is responsible for imposing and enforcing licensing and other restrictions on the fishing or taking of clams in a large area of Poole harbour. The Committee is also responsible for regulating fisheries elsewhere in the harbour under other legislation.

Defra undertakes a regular programme of disease surveillance of fish stocks in the North Sea, although sample sites may not necessarily be in areas of commercial fishing activity.

Dab are unusually susceptible to diseases and in localised areas the prevalence may be up to 10&#151;20 per cent. with lower levels in the northern North Sea. Up to 40 per cent. of dab in some areas such as West Dogger Bank exhibit abnormal pigmentation but it is not known whether this is indicative of disease as no causative agent has been found. Studies are also being carried out on liver nodules (tumours) in dab and these indicate that the condition is present in fish in most areas but with a higher incidence of up to 14 per cent. at Flamborough and West Dogger. Insufficient number of skate and huss are caught during the monitoring programme to allow meaningful disease assessment to be made.

I assume my hon. Friend&#039;s question relates to the recent addition of 17 GM maize varieties to the European Common Catalogue. The maize varieties in question all contain the same GM transformation event, which was given EU wide approval for commercial cultivation in 1998. The approvals process addresses plant and human health and environmental safety issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w44.html_para2">
These varieties have not undergone any official UK growing trials, as referred to in <i>(b)</i> above. Therefore at present there is no basis for the Government to seek a prohibition on the marketing of these varieties in the UK. However, they are not suited to UK conditions and it is not anticipated that any UK farmer would attempt to grow these varieties.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make monthly statements over the following 12 months on the number of hazardous waste producers contacting her Department and the agencies for which she is responsible who have been unable to find a waste contractor able to take the hazardous waste they produce, giving details of the <i>(a)</i> type of waste and <i>(b)</i> amount of waste concerned.  [187172]</p>








<p><a name="41004w44.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department, the Environment Agency and Envirowise each have arrangements in place to deal with inquiries from business and industry on hazardous waste, and in particular on the changes brought in by the Landfill Directive. The agency has set up a national call centre, and Envirowise has established a dedicated helpline. Inquiries to the respective organisations are on a range of issues. I have asked my officials to collate information on the inquiries received, and place this data on the Department&#039;s website. Waste producers who cannot find a waste contractor able to take their waste are encouraged to follow a number of options including contacting the agency or Envirowise. Other options are to contact a member of the Environment Services Association, their own trade association, or check the options available to them to reduce or eliminate the hazardousness of the waste.

There are no specific consents required to use this product but any user must follow all of the conditions of use and directions for use on the product label. This product is for professional use only as an agricultural/horticultural/industrial herbicide. Conditions relating to its sale, supply, storage and use are covered under Schedules 2 and 3 to the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986.

 Bolton Fell and Solway Moss are being considered for designation as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC).

 There is no comprehensive list of all peat bogs in the UK. A list of Protected bogs according to country and their designation status has been placed in the Library of the House. National designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) in Northern Ireland underpins international designation as a candidate Special Area of Conservation. This underpinning means that there are overlaps between Sites of Special Scientific Interest and candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs). Where the information is available this is shown on the list that has been placed in the Library of the House. Some cSACs may cover peat bog, but may be designated because of another natural feature of importance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government&#039;s strategy for protecting peat bogs.  [188442]</p>








<p><a name="41004w45.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Both blanket bog and lowland raised bog are priority habitats under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The Action Plans are published and are posted on the UKBAP website: www.ukbap.org.uk. Statutory site designation plays an important part in the conservation of both these types of bog. Notification as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) or Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs) in Northern Ireland, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1937W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provides protection for over 400 peat bogs, with many of the most important areas managed by statutory conservation agencies through agreements with site owners. Where appropriate, the designation process can include compulsory purchase of the land. The UK has proposed 106 active and degraded raised bogs as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs) under the Habitats Directive, and 107 blanket bog sites as cSACs. In addition to this site designation, the UK is also encouraging the development of non-peat alternatives as growing media and promoting the use of alternatives. Our aim is for a minimum of 40 per cent. of total market requirements to be peat free by 2005 and 90 per cent. by 2010.

 Peat extraction is measured in cubic metres. The following figures shows peat extraction every year since 1997 and are derived from the British Geological Survey&#039;s Minerals Yearbook and the Office of National Statistics:

There is currently planning consent for extraction from 3,990.6 ha of raised peat bog in England, of which 72 ha is lapsed. The existence of planning consent does not mean that all or part of the area is necessarily cut. For example, a recent agreement with Scotts Company (UK) Ltd. in 2001 has meant that 1,886 ha of peatland has come out of peat extraction, although planning consent still remains on part of it.

 For water quality, the General Quality Assessment scheme (GQA) is the Environment Agency&#039;s (EA&#039;s) national method for classifying rivers and canals. The scheme provides a way of comparing water quality from one river to another and for looking at changes through time. The EA assesses water quality in four separate ways; chemistry (based on water samples), biology, nutrients and aesthetics. Water samples are collected from about 8,000 monitoring sites monthly. These represent over 40,000 kilometres of rivers and canals. To each sampling site, the Agency assigns a stretch of river that the site characterises. In the Castle Point constituency there are 2 km of monitored river; the Prittle Brook watercourse.

<i>(a)</i> The UK partial Regulatory Impact Assessment primarily reflects the direct costs to industry of REACH which are estimated at &#163;515 million over the 11 year phase in period.

This is clearly an important issue and one we will continue to develop as the proposal develops through the negotiation process.

<i>[holding answer 13 September 2004]:</i> The RSPCA&#039;s written agreement with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, which allows them to perform the functions of an &#039;approved prosecutor&#039;, under Section 1 (3) <i>(e)</i> of the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 2000, took effect from 1 September 2004 and applies in England only. The Amendment Act supplements the Protection of Animals Act 1911, by allowing a magistrates court to make an order relating to the temporary care or for the disposal, sale or slaughter of animals kept for commercial purposes, that are the subject of a prosecution brought under the 1911 Act by a &#039;prosecutor&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w46.html_para7">
The RSPCA is the first body to enter into a written agreement with Defra. The agreement only allows the RSPCA to intervene in cases in which they are already prosecuting under the Protection of Animals Act 1911. The court will only be able to grant an order if it appears necessary for the welfare of the animals, taking account of the evidence of a veterinary surgeon. Once the RSPCA has obtained a court order, they then have the power to enter premises to mark the animals concerned and to carry out the order.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w46.html_para8">
The written agreement requires the RSPCA to issue guidance and provide proper training to ensure that the appropriate level of expertise is achieved and maintained by the staff operating under the agreement. The State Veterinary Service and local authorities will perform a full &#039;audit&#039; function for every case in which the RSPCA makes an application to the courts for an order under the 2000 Act.

 Defra and its catering service providers are working together to increase the consumption of food that has been produced in ways that help sustain productivity and reduce adverse impacts on the environment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w47.html_para0">
Defra supports the sourcing of sea bass from responsibly managed fisheries. Handlining is a relatively low impact method of fishing and so can help fisheries to remain sustainable. Advice from the international Council for the Exploration of the Seas on sea bass has been that the level of exploitation of the stock appeared to be sustainable. New advice is due shortly which we will be considering carefully with a view to ensuring that the stock remains sustainably exploited. There are also currently no restrictions at a UK or Community level on the method of fishing that can be used to target bass.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w47.html_para1">
In these circumstances I consider it would be inappropriate to encourage Defra&#039;s caterers to restrict the source of bass they purchase to hand line fisheries only.

 This information is not available. The vast majority of indoor pig units&#151;which represent about 73 per cent. of the breeding herd in England&#151;use farrowing crates. While the Government would prefer to avoid the close-confinement of all sows, there are currently no free-farrowing systems suitable for widespread commercial adoption. Farrowing crates protect piglets from being crushed by the sow&#151;the largest cause of piglet mortality.

Building on the Waste Implementation Programme, which has been set up to ensure much improved support is provided to local authorities in implementing waste strategy on the ground, the main features of Defra&#039;s approach are to: provide best practice procurement advice, standard contracting approaches and targeted support to help local waste managers achieve effective contracts; support the use of new waste technologies, improve data for investment planning and further develop end-markets to encourage industry in providing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1944W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
an appropriate range of waste handling facilities without involving excessive costs; encourage tiers of local authorities and adjacent authorities to work together to increase efficiency and realise economies of scale; improve the planning process for waste facilities, which can be a cause of delay and extra cost; and, promote better awareness of waste amongst householders, since participation rates can be a determinant of local authority costs.

 The base contract for local commissioning becomes operational on 1 October 2005 and I am advised that detailed planning is being undertaken in Oxfordshire, to ensure a smooth transition. The new contracting arrangements will improve the quality of patient care, improve access to national health service services and improve working conditions for dentists and their teams. This builds on the recognition that Oxfordshire has used all current flexibilities to improve services and is working proactively to increase access by supporting dentists who wish to move to local commissioning early under the personal dental services (PDS).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w50.html_para4">
The measures in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 represent the most radical reform of NHS dentistry since 1948. The proposals for NHS dentistry will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service provided through contracts between primary care trusts (PCTs) and dental practices. The service will be properly integrated with the rest of the NHS, providing better access to services and an improved patient experience.

The new arrangements are modelled on five years successful experience of PDS pilots. The PDS continues to provide an opportunity for those dentists and their PCTs who wish to move further and faster towards local commissioning to do so. There are already more than 1,500 dentists in more than 750 practices working under PDS arrangements, out of a total of around 9,000 practices.

<p><a name="41004w52.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Keith Bradley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the projected cost is of providing free personal care for all elderly people for <i>(a)</i> 2004&#150;05 and <i>(b)</i> each of the following 10 years.  [189461]</p>








<p><a name="41004w52.html_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Government have estimated that the cost of introducing free personal care for everyone in England would be some &#163;1.5 billion at 2003&#150;04 prices. None of this extra expenditure would increase choice or services available to older people. The Government have not made estimates for the next 10 years. On 8 September, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1967W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
published projections to 2051 of the future costs of long-term care for older people in the United Kingdom in the report: &quot;Future demand for long-term care in the UK: A summary of projections of long term care finance for older people&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w52.html_para1">
The report concluded that long-term care spending in the United Kingdom would need to increase by about 315 per cent., in real terms between 2000 and 2051, to meet demographic pressures and allow for real rises in care costs, if dependency rates, patterns of care and funding arrangements remained unchanged. In terms of personal care, the researchers estimated that if free personal care had been introduced across the whole of the UK in 2000, public spending on long-term care would have risen immediately from &#163;8.8 billion to &#163;10.3 billion, and projected public spending would reach &#163;42.6 billion or more by 2051, compared with &#163;35.4 billion if current funding arrangements were maintained.

<p><a name="41004w54.html_wqn0"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health to ask which <i>(a)</i> hospital orthopaedic directorates, <i>(b)</i> hospital infection control teams, <i>(c)</i> hospital chief executives and <i>(d)</i> hospital vascular directorates did not reply to the National Audit Office survey on infection control between July and September 2003; what the explanation was in each case for the failure to respond; what action he proposes to take in each case; and if he will publish the returns requested by the National Audit Office survey.  [185651]</p>








<p><a name="41004w54.html_spnew0"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Information on non-responders is shown in the table. The overall response rate for the survey was good and we understand the main reason for not completing the questionnaire was pressure of business. Non-responders will not be followed up as the aim of the survey was to produce a snapshot of the situation in 2003. The survey results were used in the National Audit Office report and there are no plans for a separate publication.

<p><a name="41004w54.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Government welcomed the publication in February 2004 by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems. The guideline is aimed at the national health service and it is for the NHS locally to take it into account when determining how best to meet the needs of the local population, in discussion with patients and the public and within the resources allocated to the health service overall. Those resources are to rise at record levels, from &#163;69 billion in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;92 billion in 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w54.html_para0">
We expect the NHS to make progress towards full implementation of the guideline. As with other NICE guidelines, we have not set a timetable for this. However, we and NICE recognise that the NHS cannot reasonably be expected to implement the full guideline immediately and we have therefore advised all primary care trusts (PCTs) to begin implementation by offering a minimum of one cycle of in vitro fertilisation by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria set out in the guideline and to give priority to couples who have no children living with them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w54.html_para1">
We have agreed a broad programme of action to support the NHS in implementing NICE guidance, disseminated to the NHS on 14 June, which makes it clear that local health economies need to work together on implementation. We look to strategic health authorities (SHAs) to work with PCTs to ensure that they have effective arrangements in place for the provision of services, to investigate the barriers to implementation of NICE guidelines and to help ensure that the barriers can be overcome. The programme of action also includes, for example, the provision of advice from NICE on the development of resource templates to enable local health economies to estimate the resources needed. NICE provided the first such template for the fertility guideline, taking account of total PCT population, proportion of women aged 23 to 39 and the different local costs of providing services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w54.html_para2">
SHAs are responsible for overseeing PCTs&#039; performance. They will expect PCTs to be able to demonstrate that they are working to implement NICE clinical guidelines. Where a PCT is failing to implement 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Oct 2004 : Column 1977W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
a guideline, the SHA will explore with the trust the reasons for this, with the aim of overcoming barriers to implementation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w54.html_para3">
The national standards for the NHS, published as &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot; on 12 July 2004, include a standard (Standard D2) for patients to receive effective treatment and care that conforms to nationally agreed best practice, particularly as defined in NICE guidance. This encompasses NICE&#039;s clinical guidelines, such as the one on infertility. The independent Healthcare Commission, which we established in April 2004 and which reports directly to Parliament on the state of healthcare in England and Wales, is developing criteria to review the provision of health care and in doing so is taking into account the requirements of &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot;. There are no plans for NICE to have a role in examining NHS capacity to implement NICE guidance as part of its new implementation programme.

 The proposal to reform the coroner and death certificate service is likely to improve information about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection at or shortly before death in a number of ways. The emphasis on improved training for doctors in how to complete death certificates and the scrutiny of all certificates by specially trained medical examiners will improve the quality and completeness of information collected. The ability to link fact and cause of death to laboratory or patient records of infection will make it possible to determine how many people die following a diagnosis on invasive MRSA infection.

 Good progress has been made since the national health service prostate cancer programme was launched on 6 September 2000, setting out the Government&#039;s approach to improving prostate cancer services in England and Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w59.html_para2">
As part of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP), evidence-based primary care resource packs were sent to all general practitioners in England on 23 September 2002 to aid them in understanding prostate cancer and counselling men (who are worried about prostate cancer, ensuring the men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.

<p class="tabletext">a population survey of 900 men aged 40&#150;75 designed to look at the impact of the PCRMP patient information sheet on men&#039;s knowledge and attitudes regarding prostate cancer and the PSA test, their future intentions regarding having a PSA test, and what factors influence these intentions.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">a series of focus groups and interviews are being conducted with a sample of men from the population survey to gather more in-depth information on their views on PSA testing, and to explore how best to assist informed decision-making on this topic.</p>

<p>

The evaluation is being jointly funded by the Department via national health service cancer screening programmes and Cancer Research UK and results are expected over the next year. The results of the evaluation will inform future revisions of the pack.

<p>
<a name="41004w59.html_para5">
Other elements of the PCRMP include ensuring that a systematic and standardised follow-up pathway is available for individuals whose test result is above the PSA threshold and action to improve the quality of laboratory testing of PSA samples. Recommendations from the scientific reference group, which supports the PCRMP, were sent to all pathologists and urologists, along with a copy of the resource pack, in September 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41004w59.html_para6">
Other good progress has been made on prostate cancer. In 2003&#150;04, the Department met its target of directly funding 4.2 million of research a year on prostate cancer. This is a twenty-fold increase compared with 1999&#150;2000.

 It is for primary care trusts, in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community, including the provision of silicone cosmesis.

 Second-hand smoke in the home and in public places is causally linked to lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cot death, childhood respiratory diseases, middle ear disease and asthma attacks in children. A reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke will lead to a reduced burden on the national health service from the diseases linked to second-hand smoke; as well as a reduced direct health burden from lower smoking rates, which would follow. The exact level of this benefit has not been estimated.

We have just conducted a public health consultation, which covers a wide range of issues including smoking in public places. We are currently considering all the many responses we have received. These will inform the public health White Paper which will be published in the autumn.
