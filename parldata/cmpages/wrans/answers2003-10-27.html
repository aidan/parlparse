<a name="31027w01.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much was paid by his Department in respect of landing fees for British military aircraft using commercial airfields <i>(a)</i> in each of the last three years and <i>(b)</i> so far in 2003, broken down by airfield.  [133624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Information on landing fees is not held by airfield, and cannot be provided in this format. Figures are available for the United Kingdom and overseas, by budget area, but these figures include handling charges and associated costs (e.g. parking, training, transport and navigation). In some cases the figures are not available from current records and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w01.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The vial contained viable "Clostridium botulinum" type B organisms. This would have allowed the Iraqis to grow from this seed stock increasing quantities of "Clostridium botulinum" from which its toxin could be derived. The toxin could then have been weaponised.
<P>

<a name="31027w01.html_para9">The vial was labelled as "Clostridium botulinum" strain Okra B. This micro-organism can produce botulinum toxin type B. "Clostridium botulinum" toxin type B is many times more toxic than VX nerve agent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how long an army reservist would need to serve in hostile or war conditions before life insurance under the Army PAX scheme would cover war risks.  [133835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 PAX provides Personal Accident and Life cover for regulars and RPAX for reservists. Cover under these schemes is the same for all three Services. Membership of these schemes is voluntary and thus the decision to purchase this cover rests with the individual.
<P>

<a name="31027w02.html_para0">A reservist's eligibility for war risks cover under PAX and RPAX is governed not by how long they have served in hostile or war conditions but by the length of time their cover has been in force. Under new arrangements which came into effect on 1 July 2003, PAX and RPAX exclude war risks for the first six months of a new cover purchased at any time other than during initial training.
<P>

<a name="31027w02.html_para1">This qualifying period was introduced as a result of the trend which Service personnel deployed to war zones have recently shown to buy short-term cover at the last minute. This increases insurers' exposure to risk, making them unable to accrue long-term premium income from which claims can be paid, and causing them to increase premiums or to close their schemes altogether to new applicants. The six-month qualifying period helps to avoid such closures and to protect the interests of prudent long-term scheme members by keeping premiums affordable.
<P>

<a name="31027w02.html_para2">The Ministry of Defence encourages Service personnel to recognise the long-term nature of life insurance throughout their service and not just at times of more active duty.

 As stated in NATO's Strategic Concept (paragraph 63), 'nuclear forces based in Europe and committed to NATO provide an essential political and military link between the European and the North American members of the alliance. The alliance will therefore maintain adequate nuclear forces in Europe.'
<P>

<a name="31027w02.html_para3">Numbers of US nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom can and do vary, and the capability for deployments of such weapons to and from the UK remains extant regardless of the particular number of weapons in the UK at any given time.

<P>
<a name="31027w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Open and fair competition remains the bedrock of the Ministry of Defence's procurement policy. However, we are also prepared to use other approaches for our acquisition requirements where they offer better long term value for money. The MOD's non-warlike acquisition requirements are subject to the EC Public Procurement Regulations that require such opportunities be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union.




<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 2003 : Column 8W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31027w02.html_para5">The Government's Defence Industrial Policy Paper (published in October 2002) recognises that, although acquisition decisions will be driven principally by key factors such as cost and operational effectiveness, they also need to take into account wider factors, such as industrial capabilities, which are desirable to retain in the United Kingdom. The Government are committed to a strong and healthy UK defence industry owing to the economic value that the industry brings to the UK by creating employment, technology and intellectual property in this country. Globalisation of the defence business means that the UK defence industry embraces suppliers that bring benefit and create value within the UK, regardless of the nationality of their shareholders.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the terms of the contract for the procurement of Meteor missiles are, with particular reference to the total agreed to purchase cost; and if he will make a statement.  [133645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Meteor contract with MBDA UK Ltd covers development, the delivery of development hardware to support aircraft integration programmes (on each of Typhoon Eurofighter, Rafale and Gripen), production of the missiles and Contractor Logistics Support. The total current contract cost is some &#163;1.2 billion, to which the UK has committed some &#163;700 million.
<P>

<a name="31027w02.html_para6">At this time, only the UK has committed to the delivery of production missiles and to the associated Contractor Logistic Support (for a period of 10 years). Production options in the contract include a number of pricing break points, with the overall unit production prices reducing as those break point quantities are exceeded. Under the terms of the Meteor Memorandum of Understanding, all Partner Nations will pay the same unit production price for Meteor missiles ordered during the option period. If current estimates of Partner Nations' production quantities are fulfilled, the unit production cost for the UK's missiles will reduce from that currently budgeted.

<a name="31027w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department has made no specific assessment of the contribution of refilling inkjet cartridges towards environmental objectives. However, the potential environmental benefits of printer cartridge refilling, as well as the contribution of the independent refill sector towards customer choice, are recognised and welcomed by Government.
<P>

<a name="31027w03.html_para11">The Department has recently received a large number of letters from independent printer cartridge refillers, including many from franchisees of Cartridge World. The independent cartridge refillers have raised concerns that recent innovations by equipment manufacturers in printer cartridge technology may hinder or prevent refilling by independent operators. They have pressed for the Government specifically to include printer cartridges as electrical and electronic products in the implementation of the EU Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (the WEEE Directive) and to implement the Directive's "eco-design" provisions to restrict these developments in cartridge technology.

<a name="31027w03.html_para14">The Department sees a harmonised approach to the scope of the Directive as desirable. Officials from this Department with responsibility for implementation planning for the WEEE Directive regularly meet their opposite numbers from other EU member states and the European Commission and have discussed the status of printer cartridges under the Directive. A majority of member states and the Commission have said they share the UK's interpretation. DTI Ministers have not discussed this issue directly with EU counterparts.

<a name="31027w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The UK is required as a member state of the European Union to hold emergency oil stocks equal to 67.5 days' consumption, and as a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to take part in any collective response to a major international supply disruption.
<P>

<a name="31027w04.html_para4">Under the legislation governing the EU stock-holding obligations, if difficulties arise with regard to EU oil supplies the European Commission will arrange a consultation between member states. However, any response to disruption, including sharing arrangements, is a matter for member states, acting as members of the IEA. The European Commission made a proposal last year to increase its own role. This proposal was opposed by member states at the Energy Council in May 2003, and by the European Parliament at a plenary session in September 2003.

The Post Office card account is primarily for those who do not have, or choose not to use their current account, for whatever reason.

<a name="31027w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Postal Services Act 2000 establishes the framework under which the Postal Services Commission may impose financial penalties. It is for the Commission to decide on its policy within this framework, which was adopted in February 2002 following a public consultation. I consequently have no plans to commission research in this area. The Commission frequently liases with other industry regulators in the UK, as well as postal regulators in the rest of Europe on a range of postal regulation matters. The recent decision to impose a financial penalty on Royal Mail is a matter for the Commission and is still under a 28 day period for comment. Such financial penalties are payable to Postcomm in the first instance, and then transferred to the Treasury Consolidated Fund.

<a name="31027w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Postal Services Act 2000 ("the Act") sets out the purpose and duties of the Postal Services Commission ("the Commission"). The Act makes provision for the Secretary of State in certain circumstances to give directions and guidance to the Commission. On 14 March 2001, in exercise of her powers under section 41(1) of the Act, the Secretary of State gave directions to the Commission with regard to the provision of free postal services to blind and partially sighted persons. In accordance with section 43(2) of the Act the Secretary of State provided social and environmental guidance to the Commission on 22 March 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take steps to reduce nitrate concentrations in English rivers.  [132114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government has taken, and is taking, a range of action to address nitrate pollution of English rivers.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para4">The EC's Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive contains provisions designed to reduce the adverse impact of sewage discharges on the water environment. The Directive, and Government policy building on the Directive's requirements, establishes that all discharges from sewage treatment plants serving populations greater than 2,000 have secondary treatment by the end of 2005.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para5">Secondary treatment reduces the total nitrogen present in sewage. The amount of this reduction is dependant upon the type of secondary treatment process applied, but reduction of total nitrogen achieved through secondary treatment is of the order of 20 per cent. on average.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para6">The Directive also contains provisions that require further treatment of nitrates from sewage discharges to reduce the impact on freshwaters intended for abstraction for use as drinking water. These provisions require that where nitrate concentration levels in these waters exceed or could exceed 50mg/l, if no protective action is taken, then nitrate reduction is to be achieved through further treatment processes.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para7">Between February 1997 and June 2002 eight water bodies in need of protection from excessive nitrates levels were identified as Sensitive Areas (Nitrate) in England. Relevant sewage works have been, or are being, built to provide the treatment needed to reduce nitrate levels in their discharges.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para8">Action has also been taken to reduce nitrates in sewage discharges to estuaries in a number of Sensitive Areas (Eutrophic) where it is considered that these discharges contribute, or are likely to contribute, to the eutrophication of coastal waters.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para9">Additionally the EU Nitrates Directive, an environmental measure designed to reduce current and prevent future water pollution by nitrate from agricultural sources, requires all known areas of land draining into nitrate-polluted waters to be designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. The Nitrates Directive requires the identification of polluted waters using the following criteria: <i>(a)</i> surface and groundwaters which contain or could contain, if preventative action is not taken, nitrate concentrations greater than 50 mg/l; <i>(b)</i> surface waters which are eutrophic or could become eutrophic if preventative action is not taken. Around 55 per cent. of England has been designated as NVZs on the basis that it drains into these waters.

 The process of establishing AONB Conservation Boards is laid down in section 86 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The Chilterns and Cotswolds AONBs are well advanced in the process. I intend to write to the Countryside Agency and the constituent local authorities of each AONB seeking their formal consent for the Establishment Orders to create the two Boards. In addition, we have just begun the same process for the High Weald AONB.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para10">Secretary of State appointees will represent the national perspective on Conservation Boards. When the vacancies are advertised, I hope a variety of people will apply. To encourage this, Defra asked the Countryside Agency to organise a 'test day' to research the best ways of reaching a diverse range of people with the necessary skills. The results are now being considered. Appointments will follow the process of fair and open competition as described in Cabinet Office Guidance on public appointments.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para11">The process for appointing parish members will be included in the Establishment Order for each Conservation Board. It will provide a democratic process for parishes to elect their appointees.

<a name="31027w06.html_para12">Each constituent local authority will be able to appoint a member to the two proposed Boards. How these appointees are selected will be a matter for each authority to decide but the appointee must be an elected member of the appointing authority.
<P>

<a name="31027w06.html_para13">Secretary of State appointees will be selected with a range of skills and experience in mind, including in land management, conservation, business and the community. Although it is for local authorities and parishes to chose who they want to represent them, I would expect them to appreciate the need for spread of skills and experience.

 The UK ranks 91st in the 2002 Environmental Sustainability Index. The full list of rankings is shown in the following table. However, the UK and other countries believe this index is profoundly flawed, and therefore potentially misleading, for the following reasons. It is an aggregated indicator which aims to weight together many components into a single overall measure of 'environmental sustainability', an approach which as yet is not scientifically robust. The choice of components, and the way in which they are weighted together, is largely subjective. A different choice of components or weights would give different results, amply illustrated by the fact that the previous edition of this index, based on a different selection of components, placed the UK 16th. Furthermore, there are still many areas where data are not sufficiently comparable between countries, or are simply not available. The values of many of the variables used to compile this index are imputed. It should also be noted that the variables used in this index tend to measure circumstances at a single point in time rather than trends or changes, therefore to the extent the index measures anything at all, it measures the environmental situation which a country faces rather than its progress or performance in improving environmental sustainability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the Prime Minister's statement of 22 September, on the EU chemical policy, what impact the outcome of the e-mail consultation will have on the Government's stance.  [134241]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w07.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government strongly supports the development and delivery of an effective EU chemical policy. We have three overarching objectives for the proposals:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>creating a fast, efficient and workable process of testing, screening and assessing substances of concern, starting with the most harmful, because of their impact on human health or the environment;
<P>
<BR>
keeping animal testing to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment; and
<P>
<BR>
maintaining or enhancing the competitiveness of the chemical industry and downstream users.

<P>

<a name="31027w07.html_para5">Following the Commission's consultations in May&#150;July this year, the Commission has indicated its intention of making a number of changes to the proposals. The Government welcomes any changes intended to make the proposals more effective and workable, and will consider the revised proposals as soon as they have been adopted by the Commission. The Government will then carry out a separate UK consultation accompanied by a regulatory impact assessment.

<a name="31027w08.html_wqn0"><B> David Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with parish councils on their ability to pay for flood prevention schemes.  [132482]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B>

 Under the Animal Health Act 1981, the compensation payable for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes is taken to mean their market value immediately before they were slaughtered or affected. A valuer appointed by Defra makes an assessment to determine a figure that represents the market value, and in the normal course, this is the amount of compensation Defra would pay. In a few cases during 2001, where it was apparent that the valuation and/or the figure was incorrect or flawed in some material way, Defra made an adjustment to ensure that the compensation paid to the owner properly represented the value of the slaughtered animals within the meaning of the legislation. Information on the number of cases where this occurred can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since the late 1980s, the UK has played a full and active role in the development of EU policy on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), including GM crops. This has resulted in a strong, transparent and accountable regulatory framework, including the adoption in 2001 of an enhanced generic Directive (2001/18/EC) on the safety assessment of GMOs and in 2003 of specific measures on the traceability and labelling of GMOs, on genetically modified food and feed, and on exports of GMOs from the Community. Throughout, we have argued for an approach which is precautionary, evidence-based and proportionate, and which takes due account of international obligations under agreements such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Government has also paid particular attention to the practical aspects of implementation, with the UK, for example, being one of only four member states so far to have completed implementation of Directive 2001/18/EC.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have set targets to increase recycling and composting of household waste in England to 17 per cent. by 2003&#150;04 and 25 per cent. by 2005&#150;06. To underpin these national targets, we have required all local authorities to double their recycling, compared with 1999&#150;2000, by 2003&#150;04, and to treble their recycling by 2005&#150;06. The Government have provided significant funding to enable local authorities to meet these targets.
<P>

<a name="31027w09.html_para0">In addition, Local Public Service Agreements provide a focus for local and central Government to encourage commitment to specific improvements over and above that which would normally be expected. To date, 83 waste related targets have been signed, including 41 targets which aim specifically to increase recycling performance above the statutory performance standard. As part of a Local PSA, the Government offer at the outset, a pump-priming grant, unsupported credit approvals and potential relaxations in statutory and administrative requirements. Typically, financial support has been used to improve enforcement and publicity; to develop civic amenity sites; and to initiate or expand kerb-side collection schemes.

<a name="31027w09.html_para1">The Household Waste Recycling Bill awaits Royal Assent and will become law next month. The Act will provide that where English waste collection authorities have a duty to collect waste they shall ensure, except in some circumstances, that by the end of 2010, they collect at least two recyclates separate from the remainder of the waste. The circumstances in which they would not have to comply would be where the cost of doing so was unreasonably high or where comparable alternative arrangements are available.
<P>

<a name="31027w09.html_para2">The Bill also now provides that the Secretary of State must report to Parliament on progress towards meeting this requirement, and local authority performance on meeting their recycling and composting standards, by the end of October 2004.

To reaffirm the target, the Government confirmed in the 2003 Budget that landfill tax will increase by &#163;3 per tonne in 2005&#150;06 and by at least &#163;3 per year thereafter on the way to a medium to long-term rate of &#163;35 per tonne.

<a name="31027w09.html_para13">There has been a reduction in packaging waste since 1998. The Regulations include a cost incentive for businesses to reduce the amount of packaging they handle and to reuse packaging where they can. This is because the Regulations place tonnage recovery and recycling obligations on obligated businesses. The less packaging a business handles, the lower its obligation and thus its costs. Equally, where a business is reusing a tonnage of packaging, that tonnage does not have to be included in the calculation of the recovery and recycling obligations. In 2002, 4.9 million tonnes of packaging waste was sent to landfill compared with 6.9 million tonnes in 1998.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>MRSA can already be recorded on death certificates. Doctors are required to certify all deaths to the best of their knowledge and belief. They should start with the immediate cause of death, and then go back through the diseases or injuries which caused it, to the condition which began the sequence leading to death. The death certificate is designed to obtain this first 'underlying cause of death'. It is up to the doctor how many conditions in the sequence, other than the underlying cause, he thinks should be recorded. MRSA may contribute to death, but it is unlikely to be the first event in the sequence.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is difficult to produce statistics on MRSA because there are no codes for antibiotic resistance in the International Classification of Diseases.

A special study was conducted by ONS and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre to do this, using data from 1993&#150;1998. The results were published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in December 2002. The table below gives figures from this study for 1993 to 1998.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w11.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The gold sales between July 1999 and March 2002 reflect a prudent decision to reduce over-exposure to a single asset in the net reserves portfolio. The total proceeds from the sale of 395 tonnes of gold during this period were US$3,496 million. At current market prices, the total value of this gold would be US$4,961 million. The difference between these two figures does not represent the real financial impact of the sales, as the proceeds from the gold sales were invested in euro, dollar and yen interest baring assets that have also increased in value over this period. The gold sales reduced risk by around 30 per cent. (as measured by value-at-risk) and are not expected to deliver a loss in return when measured over the medium to long-term; the appropriate time horizon for such a decision.

As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent request for estimates of the .percentage of national income accrued to the <i>(a)</i> top and <i>(b)</i> bottom (i) one per cent., (ii) five per cent., (iii) 10 per cent. and (iv) 20 per cent. of the income distribution in each year since 1979. (134101)
<BR>
Estimates for national income are not available but estimates for gross household income are shown in the following table. These are produced from the Office for National Statistics' analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income" and the latest analysis for 2001&#150;02 was published on 21st October 2003 on the National Statistics website. Results for earlier years are also published in Economic Trends, which can be can be obtained from the House of Commons library. The analyses for each year since 1997&#150;98 can also be obtained from the National Statistics website at: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/SearchRes2. asp?IPS=5&CT=6&Term=taxes%20and%20benefits
<BR>
The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS), formerly the Family Expenditure Survey (FES). Results for each quintile (including the top and bottom 20 per cent) are published in table 26 of the analysis. The Family Resources Survey would have been an alternative source with a larger sample size, however it would only have provided a time series from 1994/5.
<BR>
The table shows the proportion of total gross income received by groups of households in different parts of the income distribution, where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Gross income includes income from earnings, occupational pensions and investments and cash benefits such as state retirement pensions and income support. It does not take account of deductions for taxes.
<BR>
For the data that you have requested, sample sizes are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by deciles and quintiles of income distribution and not for the top or bottom one per cent. or 5 per cent. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources.

<a name="31027w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Latest figures for investment by sector and GDP at current market prices were released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of the 2003 Blue Book dataset on 30 September. The ONS no longer publishes data at constant 1995 prices, having now replaced them with chained volume measures as indicators of growth in real magnitudes in the national accounts.

<P>
<a name="31027w11.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government offers lower duty rates for less environmentally-damaging fuels by offering duty differentials relative to the main road fuels. These differentials are intended primarily to reflect the relative environmental benefits individual. In determining the size of the duty incentive for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the Government took into account principally the environmental benefits of the fuel, such as local air quality improvements. It also took account of the significant market barriers faced by LPG: it requires a dedicated and separate re-fuelling infrastructure and vehicles have to be converted or specifically designed to use gaseous fuels.
<P>

<a name="31027w11.html_para1">In his 2003 Budget statement, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor announced that the Government would consult on support for road fuel gases beyond 2004. The Department for Transport, HM Treasury and Customs and Excise published a consultation document in June inviting key stakeholders and users to express their views on how to ensure that both the duty payable and the purchase grants available for road fuel gases continue to reflect environmental and other policy objectives.

As Registrar General for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what progress has been made in establishing a ceremony for the registration of births of children which records the mutual rights and responsibilities of the parents and the state. (134584)
<BR>
There is no specific proposal to establish such a ceremony. However, in January 2001 the Government published a White Paper "Civil Registration: Vital Change" (CM 5355) containing proposals for the reform of the civil registration service in England and Wales. These proposals include the potential for the civil registration service to both provide celebratory services and to signpost other service and information sources. It is intended that the White Paper proposals are taken forward by means of an order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The first phase of this process involves a mandatory public consultation. This was completed on 24 October.

 The Government have no plans for further reform of defamation procedure. The Defamation Act 1996 introduced procedures to enable quicker and less costly resolution of claims. The 'summary procedure' allows straightforward cases to be dealt with without a jury; damages are limited to &#163;10,000.

 We have no plans to do so. Decisions on the granting of public funding (formerly legal aid) in civil cases are a matter for the Legal Services Commission (LSC), which is an independent body, free from political and Government influence in handling individual cases. Individuals denied funding by the LSC are entitled to have the decision reviewed by a funding review committee, an independent legal panel whose decisions on legal issues are binding on the LSC. Further, if a LSC funding decision is erroneous it may be challenged in court through judicial review.

 The fee for enforcing a judgment is dependent on the method of enforcement chosen by the litigant.

The current issue fee for a warrant not exceeding &#163;125 is &#163;30, for a warrant exceeding this amount it is &#163;50.

 Court staff are not legally trained. They are, however, encouraged to be as helpful as possible to customers. They should not give legal advice or advise on procedures that are outside their normal jurisdiction. The distinction between legal and procedural advice can sometimes be very fine.

 As my hon.

The term applies whether the weapons are delivered through battlefield or longer-range systems. As has been noted by the Intelligence and Security Committee in their report of 9 September 2003, the intelligence on the 45 minute point was issued by the Secret Intelligence Service on 30 August 2002. The Secret Intelligence Service report did not specify the particular delivery systems to which the time of 45 minutes applied.

Assuming global economic growth remains on track the headline target of halving absolute poverty between 1990 and 2015 will be met. However progress across regions is uneven. Good progress in Asia has been accompanied by little change in the proportion in absolute poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

 Estimates vary, but World Bank and IMF research shows that welfare gains from liberalising all trade range from US$250 billion to US$550 billion; one-third to two-fifths of these gains would accrue to developing countries.

<a name="31027w15.html_para0">Low-income countries (a group that includes the least developed countries) gain most from industrial country liberalisation of agriculture, because of the greater relative importance of agriculture in their economies.

 DFID provides support to Health services in Uganda primarily through general budget support. The Ministry of Health allocates its budget resources to districts based on relative poverty, burden of disease, and other exceptional factors. This approach has led to significant improvements in health service provision throughout Uganda. Recent insecurity in the Teso region resulted in an increased demand for health services and in response the Ministry sent additional health workers and medical supplies. In addition DFID has also channelled extra resources through its wider programmes with UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP), and the Uganda Red Cross Society to support those displaced by the conflict.

The UK agreed to allocate &#163;400,000 (US$650,000) towards the OHCHR's request, to fund 60 per cent. of the immediate start-up costs of deploying Human Rights Officers and supporting their work. Following the terrorist attack on the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August 2003, the UN's efforts in Iraq have inevitably been scaled back, and the five human rights monitors were withdrawn with other international staff. The majority are now deployed in the region or in Geneva and New York and working on Iraq-related human rights issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport following the publication of the White Paper on the future of airport expansion in the UK, whether the chosen site for expansion in the South East will have to undergo a planning inquiry.  [133335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 No decisions have yet been taken on future airport capacity in the South East. The White Paper will not convey statutory authorisation for any development. That would need to be sought subsequently. Where an airport operator brings forward a planning application, under the major infrastructure projects provision in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill currently before the House, the Government will have powers to call in planning applications which it considers to be of national or regional importance. A Planning Inspector will then be appointed to consider the application and make recommendations to Ministers.

 The air transport White Paper will set out the Government's policies on any preferred locations for future airport capacity.

For the purposes of the SERAS study, it was assumed that following the White Paper any new runway might require two years for detailed design and project definition and a further two years for authorisation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The European Union's Biofuels Directive requires member states to set their own indicative targets for sales of biofuels for road transport to be met in 2005 and 2010. The Government will be consulting early next year on the level of possible targets for the UK and on the steps it might take to meet them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w17.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 14 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 165W, on biofuels, what assessment he has made of the costs if the UK were to set targets for sales of biofuels at <i>(a)</i> 2 per cent. by 2005 and <i>(b)</i> 5.75 per cent. by 2010.  [134141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We have not carried out any detailed assessment of what the costs to the UK might be if we chose to set indicative biofuels sales targets at those levels. This sort of analysis will form part of the consultation paper on our plans for implementing the Directive which we plan to issue early next year, and will help inform the level of targets that we choose to set.




<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 2003 : Column 64W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31027w17.html_para4">The costs to the UK will depend on a number of factors, including the level of Government support for biofuels. The Government currently provide a 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive for biodiesel, with a similar duty incentive for bioethanol due to come into effect in January 2005. At these levels of duty incentive, if sales of biofuels were to reach 2 per cent. of total annual fuel sales (i.e. almost 1 billion litres), the fuel duty revenue forgone would be in the region of &#163;200 million per annum. If they were to reach 5.75 per cent. of total fuel sales (or total sales of a little under 3 billion litres), the revenue forgone would be close to &#163;600 million per annum. There may be other public costs too, including any grants that help support the production of biofuels, or any subsidies provided under the Common Agricultural Policy.

<P>
<a name="31027w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In drawing up Regulatory Impact Assessments on the proposed Traffic Management Bill and secondary legislation flowing from it we will be taking into account, amongst other things, the possible impact on the rollout of broadband as well as on the work programmes of other utility sectors including gas, water and electricity.

 We have consulted a wide range of different bodies on the measures under consideration for inclusion in the proposed Traffic Management Bill. In particular, in February this year we set up a working group, on which various Government Departments were represented, together with the utility regulators&#151;OFWAT, OFGEM and OFTEL&#151;and representatives of utility companies and local authorities. In drafting a Regulatory Impact Assessment for the proposed Bill, we are taking account of the different views put forward in the working group together with written contributions which we have received from utilities, highway authorities and others. We would also propose to consult widely on the secondary legislation which we envisage would be needed following the Bill to set out the detailed changes to the existing legislative regime.

 Customers are being provided with detailed information on the account options available to them.

<a name="31027w18.html_para2">Officials have had a number of discussions with the British Bankers' Association about the move to Direct Payment of benefits and pensions. The features of individual accounts (including charges and overdraft facilities) are a matter for the account provider. There is a wide range of accounts available which are free to operate and do not offer overdraft facilities. Some account providers do charge their customers if there is not enough money in their account to cover direct debits. Account providers make their customers aware of these charges and leaflets provided to benefits customers and pensioners also set out the possibility of charges in these circumstances.

 The order book system is outdated, inefficient, open to fraud and abuse, and costly to administer.

 We have no plans to recognise fibromyalgia syndrome as a prescribed industrial disease. A disease may only be prescribed if there is a recognised risk to workers in an occupation, and the link between disease and occupation can be established or reasonably presumed in individual cases.

<P>
<a name="31027w21.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 A range of therapeutic services for abused children is provided by statutory agencies as well as by the private and voluntary sectors. If a child is assessed by social services as being a child in need (as defined in the Children Act 1989), social services, together with other relevant agencies, would provide help as part of that child's plan.

<P>
<a name="31027w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My Department has no records of having provided capital funding with the requirement that a school be reduced in size. Most capital funding is now allocated by formula to local education authorities (LEAs) or schools for them to invest in their school buildings. Decisions on building priorities are made locally, in the context of asset management plans and reflecting Government priorities. It is, therefore, up to LEAs to decide on their priorities in consultation with local schools, including where surplus places can be reduced where it is economical to do so. Overall capital investment is set to rise from &#163;3.8 billion this year to over &#163;5 billion in 2005&#150;06, compared to under &#163;700 million in 1996&#150;97.

 All partnerships will be inspected by Ofsted on a four-yearly cycle and are required to conduct an annual self-assessment of performance based on the Ofsted inspection framework. One question in the Ofsted inspection framework focuses on the responsiveness of the Partnership to the range and diversity of young people in the area. It addresses whether the partnership has effective strategies to enable all young people to gain access to support and provision responsive to their needs. Government Offices also assess this aspect by monitoring partnerships' self-assessment. Of the 12 inspection reports so far published, eight partnerships have been rated overall as good or very good.
<P>

<a name="31027w21.html_para1">An independent survey of 16,000 young people comprising those with all types of need who had been in contact with Connexion services showed minimal differences in awareness of or ability to access the service. Only 12 per cent. of those requiring least intensive support disagreed with the statement, "It is easy to get hold of people at Connexions when you need to", compared with 11 per cent. of those requiring more intensive support and 13 per cent. of those requiring most intensive support. 87 per cent. of those requiring least intensive support agreed that: "Connexions helps me to see all the options available to me".

 Participation rates are not produced by the Department for 13 to 15-year-olds. As at January 2002, there were 1,892,259 pupils aged 13 to 15 across all schools in England. The number of 11 to 15-year-olds being educated within local education authority areas otherwise than at school was 15,390.

<a name="31027w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Citizenship curriculum includes teaching pupils about issues that impact on the society and the environment. Pupils are taught about the rights and responsibilities of consumers, to recognise the difference between the economic choices they can make, and how they impact on society and the environment. Many schools explore this with pupils through activities which examine the impact of consumer behaviour on other people, locally, nationally and globally.
<P>

<a name="31027w21.html_para4">QCA has sent detailed guidance to schools to help them to explore these issues, including a unit&#151;'Choices' for use with 5 to 11-year-olds.

The guidance is designed to help teachers and others, working alongside mental health professionals, to promote mental health and to intervene effectively with children experiencing problems. The guidance offers advice on specific mental health problems and useful approaches that schools can take. This includes emotional disorders such as depression.

 Changes to the Key Stage 2 target setting arrangements were announced in "Excellence and Enjoyment: A strategy for primary schools", published in May 2003. For 2005 onwards, primary schools will set their own targets for the achievement of their 11-year-old pupils in English and mathematics, with local education authorities (LEAs) setting their targets for Key Stage 2 performance afterwards.
<P>

<a name="31027w22.html_para6">The Secretary of State has already approved Key Stage 2 targets for all LEAs for 2004, which form part of their Educational Development Plans. The Department has issued guidance indicating that LEAs may feel it appropriate to review their 2004 Key Stage 2 targets in the light of the changes to the primary school target setting arrangements. We expect this to apply to only a small number of LEAs.

 Aggregated data on funding to increase standards in rural schools is not collected in the form requested. Funding is focused on improving standards in all schools, irrespective of whether they are based in rural or urban areas.
<P>

<a name="31027w23.html_para3">Specific contributions to rural schools have included some &#163;56 million of funding for rural Excellence Clusters and rural Education Action Zones. Many rural schools are small schools and benefited from the small schools fund which was set up in 2001. The Education Formula Spending system includes a sparsity element to reflect the fact that rural and other sparsely populated areas face extra costs in providing a common standard of service.

 There are currently four SSCs that have been awarded full five year licences to operate. Together they cover approximately 20 per cent. of the UK workforce. It is expected that the full network of around 25 Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) will be in place by Summer 2004 as outlined in the recently published White Paper, '21st Century Skills. Realising Our Potential'. This will provide a total coverage of up to 75 per cent. of the workforce.

 It is within the remit of each individual Sector Skills Council (SSC) to provide specific careers information for jobs in their sector. The former Employment National Training Organisation (ENTO) currently has stewardship of occupational standards for advice and guidance. No formal decisions have yet been taken on which SSC will represent careers advice and guidance employer interests in the Skills for Business Network.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 25 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 783W, on specialist schools, if he will assess, with reference to sports specialist colleges, the finding in the report by Professor David Jesson that small differences of up to plus or minus 2.5 percentage points between predicted and actual levels of performance are not statistically significant.  [133415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In his report, Professor David Jesson found that 'small differences of up to plus or minus 2.5 percentage points between predicted and actual levels of performance are not statistically significant for schools of average size'. This means that differences of less than 2.5 percentage points are within the uncertainty of the predicted level and therefore should not be heeded at a single school level. Uncertainty in statistical estimates generally decreases with the square of the sample size. For example, increasing a sample 100-fold will generally decrease the uncertainty of estimates from that sample by a factor of 10. Given this, when comparing the difference in performance between groups of schools such as Specialist Sports Colleges with non-selective other schools (95 and 2,342 schools respectively), a difference of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points is statistically significant due to the large number of schools involved.

<P>
<a name="31027w25.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 There are a variety of reasons for the overall reduction in the number of care home places since 1998.
<P>

<a name="31027w25.html_para5">The decline since 1998 is a continuation of a trend that began in the mid 90s with the implementation of the NHS and Community Care Act 1990. Since then the care home market has been contracting. This trend has been reinforced by increased support for alternative models of care, such as intensive home care packages, introduced since 1997. Local councils are responsible for the commissioning of a range of care options that are made available for older and disabled people, and the availability of care home places, therefore, is a matter for local councils to determine.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the comments of the Royal Commission on long-term care of 29 September 2003, with special reference to the Government's policy on means testing personal care; and what plans he has to meet the members of the Royal Commission to discuss the issues which they have raised.  [132640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w27.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Government have accepted each of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on long-term care except the recommendation to provide free personal care. We stand by that decision.
<P>

<a name="31027w27.html_para0">Our decision has allowed us to invest an additional &#163;1 billion by 2006 towards the care of older people in a variety of ways, including measures to support more older people to continue to live in their homes. If we had implemented the recommendation of the Royal Commission, we would not have been able to provide increased domiciliary care for older people, nor would we have been able to provide additional care home places and alternatives such as extra care housing or additional support for carers.
<P>

<a name="31027w27.html_para1">I have no plans to meet the members of the Royal Commission to discuss the issues they have raised.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list for each primary care trust the number of mental health patients.  [132220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w27.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department does not centralise information about the diagnoses given to patients; exact information about the number of people with a mental health problem in each primary care trust is therefore not available.
<P>

<a name="31027w27.html_para2">However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is responsible for compiling, analysing and disseminating information relating to United Kingdom economic, social and demographic statistics, reports that about one in six adults were assessed as having a neurotic disorder in the week before interview. The ONS report, "Psychiatric morbidity among adults living in private households, 2000" is available at www.statistics.gov.uk. It gives an indication of the factors with which variations in the prevalence of mental health problems are associated.

<a name="31027w27.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The NHS Litigation Authority administers the clinical negligence scheme for trusts. Advice to the national health service in "Health Service Guideline (96)48: NHS Indemnity, Arrangements for Clinical Negligence Claims in the NHS", states that independent midwives are responsible for making their own indemnity arrangements, as are other self-employed health care professionals. A review of NHS indemnity is about to commence and the status of all health care professionals under NHS indemnity will be examined. No decision has been made concerning independent midwives.

 The statutory labelling particulars are set out in Title V of Council Directive 2001/83/EEC. These apply across all member states of the European Union. The unilateral imposition of additional labelling requirements by the United Kingdom would constitute a breach of EU and international law. To include a statement of the type proposed would therefore require amendment to all EU Directives that regulate labelling and packaging, plus amendments to any international agreements on labelling and packaging.

<a name="31027w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 15 September 2003]:</i> The research study reported that a comparison between two cohorts of patients undergoing major surgery between August 1996 and May 1998 showed 'risk-adjusted' death rates for major surgery in Portsmouth Hospitals that were approximately four times higher than Mount Sinai Hospital in the United States.
<P>

<a name="31027w28.html_para1">Considerable caution should be exercised over these findings. There is insufficient information in the research paper to be sure that the two hospitals (in Portsmouth and New York) are truly comparable in terms of their patient mix. As the researchers acknowledge, conclusions about national differences cannot be properly based on a comparison between just one hospital in each country. Also, the number of critical care beds in the national health service has significantly increased since these patients were studied during 1996&#150;98 and this is likely to mean that the mortality rates for Portsmouth found in the study would not be applicable today. For example, the Commission for Health Improvement 2002 performance ratings for Portsmouth had a 28 day post surgical death rate of 4.5 per cent., for patients admitted as emergencies. However, we recognise that there may be some lessons to be learned from this research, despite its limitations.

 The cost of cyclotron equipment was approximately &#163;5 million and originally installed by the Medical Research Council. The facilities to provide proton therapy for eye tumours were funded by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund at a cost of approximately &#163;1 million.
<P>

<a name="31027w28.html_para2">The cyclotron and the proton therapy facility were donated as a charitable gift to the Clatterbridge hospital, part of the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology National Health Service Trust. The equipment is not subject to capital charges arrangements, with its running costs met through income generated from the treatment of NHS and overseas patients. Income is also generated from the supply of radioactive isotopes to Christie hospital. The cyclotron equipment has also attracted charitable funding, which is used in part to re-develop parts of the equipment and to fund some of the research activities.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Large Scale Voluntary Transfer (LSVT) Staff Impacts and Implications Research Report suggests there is no evidence of job losses, rather that some local authorities need to recruit new staff to undertake their strategic housing role post transfer. However, where a local authority transfers all or part of its housing and the local authority considers the sale amounts to a transfer of undertaking, the authority and the new landlord would have to have regard to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protections of Employment) Regulations 1981 (as amended).

<a name="31027w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It is important that all service providers have a clear understanding of the views of their users. Local authorities have for many years sought the views of residents on the quality and delivery of local services using a variety of different methods.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para1">Since 2000&#150;01, authorities have been required to conduct a survey following a common methodology and containing a fixed set of questions. However, there is scope for authorities to include some questions on specific local issues. The surveys are run at three yearly intervals, the second full round is being run during 2003&#150;04.The surveys provide authorities with a ready means to obtain the views of local people. By adopting a common methodology and common questions a national picture can be obtained on the issues of most concern to local people.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para2">The surveys measure the level of satisfaction with the general services provided by an authority and provide the opportunity for feedback about local community issues. In addition, specific questions are asked about residents' views on the benefits, planning, libraries and housing services.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para3">In order to ensure that the results of the surveys are statistically valid, authorities are required to ensure that a minimum sample level is achieved.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para4">As the surveys are conducted by local authorities, either in-house or through an external commission, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have figures for the cost of the 2000&#150;01 survey. However, as part of the information that is being collected on the operation of the 2003&#150;04 survey, authorities have been asked to provide details of the cost of carrying out their survey. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have also taken steps to reduce local authority costs by setting up a dedicated website which, amongst other things, avoids the need for authorities to produce their own population sample database. It also provides guidance and templates for running the survey and carries a list of frequently asked questions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will make a statement on the development of UK border controls in Northern France.  [134179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31027w30.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The introduction of UK Border Controls in northern France should be viewed in the context of a wider package of measures, developed in close co-operation with the French government, aimed at reducing illegal immigration. The closure of Sangatte, for example, which 67,000 people passed through in the last three years, has also had a major impact, reducing illegal immigration into the UK and ensuring that fewer potential illegal immigrants are drawn to Northern France.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para5">In this context we are pleased with the further steps we are taking, in co-operation with the French, in extending UK Border Controls in France. Such controls have proved effective in the past in relation to rail routes, stopping many illegal immigrants before they reach the UK. Since August 2002 we have had UK immigration officers in Calais acting in an advisory capacity to the Police Aux Frontieres, and in February we agreed a treaty which will enable these officers to exercise their full powers at Calais and Dunkerque. This treaty will be implemented shortly. Boulogne will follow when services to the UK begin in spring next year.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para6">In addition to juxtaposed border controls we are also loaning UK personnel-detection technology to Calais port. As a result the port now has the capacity to screen 



<P>

100 per cent. of freight traffic embarking to the UK. We intend to roll out similar technology to other UK-serving ports in northern France in the New Year.

<a name="31027w30.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Local communities have a critical role. The Anti-Social Behaviour Plan places communities at the heart of its agenda. It seeks to shift the culture from one where people accept anti-social behaviour to one where communities are helped and supported to seek and uphold standards. Part of our work to support communities includes tackling those barriers which prevent victims and witnesses from coming forward.
<P>

<a name="31027w30.html_para7">Communities should also hold local agencies to account for the way they address anti-social behaviour and how they use the wide range of interventions available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much has been spent by his Department and its agencies on <i>(a)</i> asbestos surveys and <i>(b)</i> the management and removal of asbestos since 1 January 2001; and what budget is available to (i) commission asbestos surveys and (ii) manage and remove asbestos from buildings in (A) 2003 and (B) 2004.

 No central records are kept on the costs and budgets for asbestos surveys or the management and removal of asbestos. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate costs. However, we can more readily provide information on the costs that the Prison Service have incurred in undertaking asbestos surveys and the necessary remedial work.
<P>

<a name="31027w31.html_para0">Since July 2001, the Prison Service has spent &#163;1.85 million to manage their asbestos strategy, which has included undertaking surveys to identify the location and condition of asbestos on the prison estate and establish the risks. Since May 2002, the Prison Service has spent a further &#163;1.7 million on remedial work on managing and removing asbestos where this was identified as being necessary by the surveys. In addition, asbestos will have been removed as part of various works projects to refurbish, demolish or upgrade existing accommodation. These costs would have been recorded in the relevant individual capital schemes and could be extracted only at a disproportionate cost. The Prison Service has a further &#163;300,000 allocated for additional remedial work for the remainder of this financial year.

Consequently, the provision of adult learning in Northern Ireland will be reviewed in line with the recommendations contained in both documents. Despite the much-publicised difficulties with individual learning accounts, the approach proved popular and successful with learners and, for this reason, I anticipate that the model will be considered alongside other funding support mechanisms in the review of adult learning.

Great Britain has embarked upon a major review of adult learning that includes Career Development Loans.
