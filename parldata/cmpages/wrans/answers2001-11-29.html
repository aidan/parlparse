<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Improving UK competitiveness involves business, employees and consumers as well as Government. The Government have created a stable economic environment in which business can prosper, a climate for enterprise and the right framework for investment. We delivered low inflation, the lowest long-term interest rates for 35 years and consistent policies on tax and regulation. Last week I announced a series of changes to give my own Department a clear emphasis on enterprise, innovation and competition so that it is better focused on the need to close the UK's productivity gap with its competitors.

<P>
<a name="11129w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The main aim of Smart is to stimulate technological innovation to increase the competitiveness of small and medium sized businesses, rather than to increase productivity. The independent evaluation of Smart this year found that as a result of their awards 77 per cent. of participants improved the quality of their products, services and processes, 26 per cent. reduced costs and 71 per cent. improved their market position.

 Broadband services by one or more of ADSL, cable or wireless technologies are available to 60&#150;60 per cent. of households in the UK. Satellite services, which potentially can offer coverage of the entire country, are beginning to become available. We have established a &#163;30 million fund to help extend affordable broadband services to areas where they are not currently available.

 Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry work continuously with regional and national partners to assess the prospects for all sectors of industry. In addition, the North West Development Agency is preparing a report assessing the impact of the events of 11 September and its aftermath on the economy of the region and identifying possible remedial measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w01.html_spnew10"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The information required could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. However, the Government are working to ensure that the compliance cost of regulation is kept to a minimum for both small and large businesses.

We have established the Partnership Fund which provides support for organisations wishing to develop policies to tackle bullying in the workplace.

The first step is to undertake research to establish the real extent of the problem and how it manifests itself in the workplace.

As set out in the dummy orders relating to the Bill, which were made available to Parliament in October, the Government propose to introduce controls on trafficking and brokering by United Kingdom persons overseas of equipment whose export has been banned because of evidence of its use in torture and long-range missiles, and trafficking and brokering by such persons to any destination subject to a UN, EU, OSCE or UK arms embargo.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the properties at RAF Halton which his Department <i>(a)</i> has disposed of in the last five years, <i>(b)</i> classifies as surplus to requirements and <i>(c)</i> plans to classify as surplus to requirements.  [17644]<P>

<a name="11129w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 November 2001]:</i> Three minor disposals of garden or amenity land of minimal value have been made over the past five years. In addition, 12 properties were transferred permanently to Annington Homes Ltd. (AHL) as part of the sale of the Married Quarters Estate in November 1996 with a further 82 properties following on 1 June 2001.
<P>

<a name="11129w05.html_para0">Halton Hospital plus an area adjoining the south-west corner known as The Old Pumping Station at Warneford Avenue (0.4ha) has been classified as surplus to requirements. A further 57 properties are likely to be handed back to AHL in March 2002.
<P>

<a name="11129w05.html_para1">Halton House officers' mess may become surplus in due course. However, the ongoing Defence Training Review includes RAF Halton and it is too early to say what the outcome will be. There are no plans to declare any further family quarters at Halton surplus to requirements in the foreseeable future.

<a name="11129w05.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 November 2001]:</i> We anticipate that the site will be sold in March 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 28 November 2001]:</i> The situation in Afghanistan continues to be fluid and our forces remain well balanced to respond to events as they unfold. A core force package, including a detachment from the Civil Affairs Group, is maintained at very high readiness to deploy if required. Personnel from the Civil Affairs Group are already involved in planning and liaison tasks outside Afghanistan.

 Our policy is that drug misuse is incompatible with service in the armed forces. The use of random compulsory drug testing of staff sends a clear message to service personnel about this policy. In addition, it provides a means of measuring the level of drug misuse in the services, and whether the misuse of a particular drug, or class of drugs, is on the increase or is in decline. It is also an important means with which to assess and audit the effectiveness of the education programmes run by each of the services.

<a name="11129w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 None. The Ministry of Defence regularly reviews its forward programme and re-evaluates all commitments in the defence plan to ensure that they represent good value for money. Given its scale and importance, Exercise Saif Sareea 2 was kept under particularly careful review to ensure that it met this criteria and the armed forces training requirements. In the early part of 2000 a number of options for the exercise were investigated as part of this process. The review confirmed the importance of carrying out an exercise on this scale and at this distance from the UK. Recent events have proved this to be the case.

 The secretary of the Cabinet signed the pledge as head of the home civil service because he thought it particularly important at this time to reassure Muslims and those of different faiths within the civil service through a positive statement of this kind. Diversity is an important part of the agenda for the reform of the civil service. He believed it to be a non- controversial statement put forward by a well-established organisation affiliated to the Muslim Council of Britain and he understood that it had the support of all the main political parties. He did not act under instruction.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The top 10 RSLs/HAs by size, for each of the three periods, was determined by totalling, for each RSL, the following figures:<P>

their total stock of self-contained units;<P>

the number of hostel/shared housing bedspaces;<P>

the number of units where the RSL had an interest in a shared ownership scheme or a leasehold for the elderly scheme;<P>

the stock managed for non-RSLs (stock managed for other RSLs was excluded).<P>

2. It is important to note that grants allocated to an RSL may not necessarily be reflected in the number of units built within that same year.<P>

3. The total grant allocation is the sum of the ADP grant allocated by the Housing Corporation and the LASHG grant allocated by the local authority.<P>

4. The number of units built annually comprises new-build self-contained units only.<P>

 The information is not available. In particular, rate of increase of actual council and RSL rents over the next 10 years will depend, among other things, on the outcome of future spending reviews (for council rents) and periodic reviews by the Housing Corporation (for RSL rents).

 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2001]:</i> Central Government have not required local authorities to do any additional emergency planning work since 11 September, but immediately reminded them that they should ensure that their emergency arrangements, including contact details, are up to date. No information is held centrally on 'other operations' which may have been undertaken by local authorities following 11 September attacks.

 All regulatory proposals likely to have a significant cost to business require a Regulatory Impact Assessment.

<P>
<a name="11129w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 During 2000, 3,487 pieces of primary and secondary legislation were introduced. Over 98 per cent. of the total relates to Statutory Instruments (SIs), the vast majority of which had only a local or temporary effect, such as routine air traffic and road closure orders. A better measure of the regulatory burden is the number of regulatory impact assessments produced by Departments for proposals imposing significant costs on business, charities or voluntary organisations. Last year, less than 5 per cent. of the total imposed significant costs.
<P>

<a name="11129w10.html_para5">An estimate of the total number of regulatory measures abolished in the last year could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="11129w10.html_para6">The Government are determined to minimise the burden of regulation on business and others. The Regulatory Reform Act 2001 now provides a powerful tool for reforming over-burdensome, over-complex and outdated primary legislation.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) urged the Serbian and Montenegrin authorities to agree quickly on constitutional arrangements, by means of a democratic and construction dialogue, which would provide for a democratic Montenegro in a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The GAC asked The High Representative (HR) to visit Belgrade and Podgorica to reaffirm the EU's position, promote further dialogue and report back to the next GAC on 10 December. The Council affirmed that any referendum that resulted from the current process should be conducted democratically and in accordance with the Montenegrin Constitution;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) welcomed the peaceful and orderly legislative elections in Kosovo, which were an important step towards fully implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. The newly elected Kosovars should be encouraged to carry out their functions in strict compliance with the constitutional framework for provisional self-government. The GAC also called on them to co-operate fully with UNMIK and with the Belgrade authorities, in accordance with the joint document signed on 5 November 2001;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) welcomed the adoption of the constitutional provisions of the Macedonia Framework Agreement of 13 August and the announcement of the new constitution by the Macedonian Parliament on 15 November. It also urged all parties to apply the Framework Agreement in its entirety without delay and to observe the cease-fire. The EU was willing to play its full part in the context of the donors' meeting, once the conditions were met.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) agreed that EU would continue to play a leading role in the Stability Pact. The Pact's activities ought to be based on the principles of concentration/refocusing and regional appropriation. The GAC stressed the importance of enhancing the complementarity between the Pact and the Stabilisation and Association Process.

<P>

<a name="11129w11.html_para26">The GAC discussed the Ministerial troika mission to the Great Lakes Region to take place on 20&#150;25 November. The GAC confirmed its support for the Lusaka process (concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)) and for the holding of the Congolese dialogue under the Lusaka Agreement. It also welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1376 and endorsed the requests made to States which had still begun to withdraw their forces from the DRC in accordance with Resolution 1304.

<P>

<a name="11129w11.html_para27">The GAC also welcomed the donor information conference for the DRC to be held in Brussels on 20 December on the initiative of the World bank, further to the donor information conference held in Paris in July. It welcomed the meeting to be held in Brussels on 21 December, which would give impetus to the establishment of a regional trust fund for DDRRR (Disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, resettlement and relocation).
<P>

<a name="11129w11.html_para28">The GAC welcomed the swearing in of a transitional government in Burundi on 1 November (in line with the Arusha process). The Council expressed its deep concern about the recent upsurge of violence and strongly condemned the attacks on the health centres and the kidnapping of schoolchildren by armed groups. The GAC recalled that it had adopted a Joint Action and released EUR 9.5 million to support the deployment of a special protection unit, provisionally composed of a South African battalion, and called again on the international community to contribute to that unit's funding. The GAC welcomed the Commission's signing of the National Indicative Programme on EU aid for Burundi.
<P>

<a name="11129w11.html_para29">The GAC welcomed the agreement between Presidents Museveni and Kagame of Rwanda and Uganda brokered by the United Kingdom, which aimed to reduce the sources of tension between the two countries and thus contribute to the region's stability. The Council also adopted an updated common position on Rwanda, further to that of September 2000. The Ministerial troika visit the region on 20&#150;25 November would provide an opportunity to assess support in the States concerned for organising a Great Lakes Conference, under the aegis of the United Nations and African Union, once the Lusaka and Arusha peace processes had progressed sufficiently.
<P>

<a name="11129w11.html_para30">The GAC expressed deep concern at the situation in Eritrea, in particular persistent infringements of opposition rights, curbs on press freedom and the lack of information on the prominent figures who had been detained. It regretted that no solution had yet been found to the problem of the expulsion of the Italian Ambassador to Asmara, who was the representative of the European Union. It also regretted that the Eritrean Head of State, Mr. Isayas Afewerki, had not received the European Union Heads of Mission. The GAC said that talks should take place rapidly, in line with the Cotonou Agreement. These should address the EU's concerns, and set a timetable for the organisation of free and fair elections. The GAC noted that the relevant Council Bodies were examining the possible practical implications for EU aid if the current situation were to continue.

 Twelve British and two Dutch nationals were arrested on 8 November in Kalamata airbase after allegedly taking photographs at the base. Such photography is illegal in Greece. The group were charged with espionage on 12 November. They appeared before an Investigating Magistrate on 27 November when further espionage charges were laid.

<a name="11129w12.html_para0">Following the hearing on 27 November, the group was remanded in custody. They will now appear in front of a three strong panel of judges in Kalamata. We hope this will take place as quickly as possible. This hearing will not be a trial as such but is a review mechanism within the Greek justice system.

 Government aid to the Scottish Tourist Board, the Wales Tourist Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board per head of the population has always been much higher than that to the English Tourism Council (ETC) over the last decade.

<a name="11129w13.html_para0">Direct comparisons of Government grant do not, of course, provide the whole answer. In England, the local authorities also spend over &#163;90 million each year promoting tourism. DCMS's &#163;1 billion expenditure on arts, museums, galleries, sport etc. also directly benefits tourism. In addition, Government funding to English tourism is set to increase from &#163;10 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;12 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;12.5 million in 2003&#150;04.

The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) was created to lead a wide-ranging programme to modernise procurement in central civil Government. DEFRA is supportive of and committed fully to working with the OGC in delivering this wide-ranging programme. One of the areas in which OGC is encouraging a joined-up approach is in the aggregation of requirements and wider use of existing agreements.

 All consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK from other EU member states must have been produced in accordance with the harmonised Community rules laid down in Council directive 64/433/EEC. Imports from third countries must have been produced to standards at least equivalent to those in the directive. Among other things, this directive sets out the licensing, structural and veterinary supervision requirements to be applied in abattoirs, cutting plants and cold stores.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para5">All meat imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK border inspection posts (BIPs) where it is subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks. These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition during transport. In line with Community rules, random spot checks at destination may be carried out on consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK from other EU member states.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para6">New arrangements have been introduced across all enforcement agencies involved to improve the sharing and analysis of information about known or suspected illegal imports. We are building up a database of details which is enabling us to target enforcement action and to make best use of available resources. Our national regulations have also been amended to assist local authorities in seizing suspected illegal imports when they are found at point of sale. The Food Standards Agency is also encouraging local authorities to ensure that checking for illegal imports is part of their routine inspection of food premises.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para7">Alongside this we have introduced improved publicity to ensure that travellers are aware of the restrictions on what may be imported. Posters have been placed at main airports and we have asked UK travel agents and airlines using UK airports to make information about import controls available to travellers. Recognising that it is most effective to inform travellers before they leave for their journey to the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been active via British embassies abroad, providing information directly to travellers and via travel agents and local media.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para8">We are keeping these measures under review and will make improvements as necessary. In addition, we are looking at a wide range of other options to ensure the rules on imports are enforced effectively and efficiently. These include, for example, the possible use of sniffer dogs and x-ray machines at ports and airports and changes to administrative structures.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para9">Apart from a small number of ports that import only animal products not intended for human consumption where import controls are operated by the state veterinary service, local authorities are responsible for controls at ports in their areas and the financial information requested is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para10">We are taking every opportunity to drive home the importance of observing high standards of bio-security on and around farms. We have used interviews in the national and local media and placed advertisements in the local and farming press. We have produced a video demonstrating a practical approach to bio-security. This has been made available to all livestock farmers and

others in the industry, accompanied by a leaflet and letter from Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary officer. Special bio-security arrangements have been applied within restricted infected areas and subject to stringent enforcement.
<P>

<a name="11129w13.html_para11">In the Animal Health Bill currently before Parliament, we are emphasising the importance of bio-security by linking the payment of compensation on infected premises to compliance with disease control measures. In addition, recommendations on future national bio-security measures may emerge from the independent inquiries into foot and mouth established by the Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason and how much EU compensation is being paid in this financial year to Spanish fishermen for loss of fishing opportunities in Morocco; what the UK contribution is to this compensation; and what EU compensation is to be paid to British fishermen for loss of fishing opportunities under Cod Preservation plans.  [17306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The European Council, at its meeting in Nice in December 2000, asked the Commission if it did not prove possible to conclude a future fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco to propose, keeping within the financial perspective, a specific action programme for restructuring the Community fleet which had fished within the framework of the old agreement.
<P>

<a name="11129w14.html_para0">Now that negotiations between the EU and Morocco on a new agreement have failed, the proposal before the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 27 November would provide 197 million euros of new Community money, over two years, towards the restructuring of the fleets concerned, which are Spanish and Portuguese. We have made sure in negotiating that the terms of the measures are aimed at achieving real restructuring which avoids diversion of effort to Community waters.
<P>

<a name="11129w14.html_para1">This measure will not increase the UK's contribution to the EU budget.

<a name="11129w14.html_para2">No EU compensation has been paid to British fishermen as a result of recovery measures to protect cod stocks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the level of testing of sheep brains for BSE and scrapie; and when she expects to publish the results of the next round of testing.  [18209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Between November 2000 and the end of September 2001, 465 sheep scrapie suspects have been tested at the VLA. 284 were found to be positive for scrapie; none have given results indicative of BSE. The Department is also strain-typing, using mouse bioassay, brains from scrapie-infected sheep collected since 1996. In about 180 cases, experiments have reached the first point at which, if BSE was clearly present, it might have become apparent. It has not done so, although the work is still on-going and experiments cannot therefore be interpreted as excluding the presence of BSE. It is likely to require several more years before the strains can be definitively identified. The outcome of all investigations, whether research or surveillance, are kept under continual review, and guidance sought from SEAC where necessary. We will continue to put all our research into the public domain at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="11129w14.html_para4">In the new year, the Department will be launching an abattoir survey and a fallen stock survey to test for TSEs, including scrapie, some 23,000 sheep aged over 18 months. This is part of an EU-wide programme designed to give information on the incidence of scrapie and other TSEs in the European Union. Quantitative data in terms of numbers of animals tested, and number positive, will be reported regularly to the European Commission in accordance with our statutory obligations. This information will also be put in the public domain. Qualitative analysis, whether in terms of the prevalence of scrapie infection in the population sampled, or the nature of any scrapie identified, will under normal circumstances require completion of the survey, and possible further investigations.

fishing opportunities in Mauritanian waters over five years at a cost of 86 million euros per year. Along with a number of other member states the UK, in supporting the proposal, made clear that we consider there is substantial room for improvement in the way that such agreements are negotiated and monitored: I stressed in particular the need to make sure that they provide value for money, promote environmentally sustainable fishing and are coherent with Community development policy. I made it clear that we are looking for a thorough debate, within the framework of the forthcoming review of the common fisheries policy, on the handling of such agreements.

He intends to start by launching a "road map" of the Commission's plans in the new year, once the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on the Commission's Green Paper on the CFP review. The Commission then envisages that there might be an orientation debate at the Council in April, with subsequent Councils considering different elements of the legislative proposals.

<P>

<a name="11129w17.html_para0">The increase in the use of recycled aggregates as a consequence of the introduction of the aggregates levy cannot be predicted with certainty. The size of any change will depend on how the producers and consumers of aggregate respond to the levy and to consequent changes in prices, in both the short and longer term. The regulatory impact assessment prepared in 2000 to accompany the proposal for the levy noted that, using the short run elasticities produced by ECOTEC for the Quarry Products Association in 1998, a best estimate of the impact of a &#163;1.60 levy on the demand for primary aggregates would be a reduction of around 10 per cent. of production or, currently, about 24 million tonnes per year. Alternative materials, including recycled aggregate, would replace some of this reduced production, and less aggregate would be required as a result of increased efficiency and a reduction in waste of all aggregates in construction and manufacturing processes. At any level of production, the levy should encourage a shift away from virgin aggregate towards alternative materials such as recycled aggregate.

 Patients continue to be assessed on the basis of clinical need, and it has been repeatedly made clear that those patients in clearest need will be treated as a matter of priority, regardless of any other factors. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the Committee for Health Improvement have been set up to ensure a faster more uniform uptake of treatments which work for the patient. In addition to this the NHS Plan sets out a commitment that by 2003, following a review of the existing weighted capitation formula used to distribute national health service funding, reducing inequalities will be a key criterion for allocating NHS resources to different parts of the country.

<a name="11129w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We currently allocate funding to health authorities, and they allocate funding to primary care trusts, on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each health authority and primary care trust's fair share of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of services for populations in equal need.
<P>

<a name="11129w18.html_para3">In future the intention is that allocations will be made direct to primary care trusts. This is subject to the passage of legislation through Parliament. Allocations will continue to be based on the principle of weighted capitation.

 The number of inpatients waiting less than six months; between six and 12 months; between 12 and 18 months; and over 18 months in each quarter of 2000 and 2001 are given in the table.
<P>

<a name="11129w18.html_para4">More than half of the patients waiting over 18 months at end September 2001 are awaiting single use instruments for tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. This is because the National Health Service has been advised only to carry out these procedures (when routine) using single-use supply instruments due to the theoretical risk of contracting vCJD. A sufficient supply of these instruments is now available, therefore we expect that the number of patients waiting for tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy procedures on the list will start to reduce and we will be able to ensure treatment of actual and potential over 18 month waiters in the coming months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what activities he includes under the heading of Adoption Support Services.  [19227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w19.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Adoption and Children Bill provides that adoption support services means counselling, advice and information in connection with adoption, and other such services as are specified in regulations. Our intention is that the adoption support services included in the regulations will include financial support.
<P>

<a name="11129w19.html_para0">The White Paper "Adoption: a new approach" published in December 2000, a copy of which is available in the Library, includes examples of the types of services that could be provided in a comprehensive adoption support services. These include the provision of support groups for those affected by adoption, facilitating contact between adopted children and birth parents, providing practical help (such as respite care) to adoptive families, and child therapeutic services. The aim is to ensure that all those affected by adoption, particularly adoptive

families, can be helped to effectively access mainstream services and also be provided with support to meet needs specific to the adoptive placement.
<P>

<a name="11129w19.html_para1">The development of the national framework for adoption support is being informed by a stakeholder group and the work of the adoption and permanence task force. We intend to publish the framework for consultation in the spring and to finalise this in the light of the consultation responses prior to publishing draft regulations for consultation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his assessment is of the likely impact of the Adoption and Children Bill within five years of enactment on <i>(a)</i> the number of children adopted, <i>(b)</i> the proportion of babies adopted as a percentage of the total and <i>(c)</i> the proportion of looked after children adopted as a percentage of the total compared with current figures.  [19232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w19.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide figures for the position five years after the enactment of the Adoption and Children Bill. However, a number of the provisions in the Bill will encourage more prospective adopters to come forward. In particular, the independent review mechanism should build confidence in the assessment process for prospective adopters and the adoption support frameworks should ensure that those adopting can be confident that they will receive the assistance they need to make any placement work. The Adoption Register for England and Wales will also facilitate the matching of children waiting for new families with approved adopters and help to increase the numbers of children being adopted.

<P>
<P>

 We expect to see an increase in the numbers of children placed across local authority boundaries, particularly of older children and sibling groups, as a result of increased consortia working and the impact of the Adoption Register for England and Wales.

 The White Paper "Adoption&#151;a new approach", a copy of which is available in the Library, makes clear that the Department will carry out a fundamental review of the assessment process for adopters and the operation of adoption panels. Work has begun to determine the scope of this project and it is our intention to establish a stakeholder group to input to the process early in the New Year. We will bring forward proposals for consultation during 2002 and implement the resulting changes as part of the wider Adoption and Children Bill implementation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is regarding fees which may be charged by adoption agencies in respect of the provision of services to persons providing facilities as part of the adoption service resulting from the Adoption and Children Bill.  [19211]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w19.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Clause 11 of the Adoption and Children Bill enables the appropriate Minister (the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly in Wales) to make regulations prescribing the fees which may be paid and charged by adoption agencies to organisations such as other adoption agencies and adoption support agencies in respect of the provision of services as part of the Adoption Service. We believe that the existing inter- agency fee system operated by adoption agencies should continue to operate as it does at the moment. However, we have promised to keep the inter-agency fee under review and this power will enable us to make any changes we may consider necessary at a future date.
<P>

<a name="11129w19.html_para2">It is not our intention to enable local authorities to charge adopters or prospective adopters in respect of domestic adoption services, and nothing in Clause 11 permits them to do so.

However, we are committed to securing long-term success and stability for adoptions.

We will use this information to inform future policy developments and to help us to develop and set targets that focus on the success and stability of all permanent placements, both before and after the making of relevant Court Orders.

<P>
<a name="11129w19.html_spnew16"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Clause 1(2) of the Adoption and Children Bill makes the child's welfare the paramount consideration of the court or adoption agency in any decision about the adoption of a child. It brings the welfare test into line with that in the Children Act 1989, with the important addition that the court or agency must consider the child's welfare throughout his life, in recognition of the lifelong implications of adoption. Under Clause 1(3) the court or agency must also bear in mind that in general any delay is likely to prejudice the child's welfare.
<P>

<a name="11129w19.html_para7">The "child's welfare" is not defined in the Bill, as is the position under both the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption Act 1976. Case law under the 1989 and 1976 Acts shows that the courts have given a wide interpretation to the term "welfare". Clause 1(4) sets out some of the issues that will be relevant in a "welfare checklist" that must be applied by the court or agency in determining the best interests of the child in any decision relating to adoption. It includes a requirement to have regard to the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings about the decision and to his particular needs. It also obliges the court or agency to have regard to the relationship the child has with his relatives, the prospects of and benefits to the child of this relationship continuing, the ability of his relatives to provide the child with a secure home and to meet his needs, and their views concerning the decision relating to the adoption of the child.

 Chapter 6 of the Adoption and Children Bill covers all adoptions with a foreign element. This includes children habitually resident outside the British Islands brought into the United Kingdom by individuals habitually resident in the United Kingdom, whether they were adopted outside the United Kingdom or it is planned to adopt them in the United Kingdom. It also includes the taking out of the United Kingdom for adoption children who are Commonwealth citizens or habitually resident in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="11129w19.html_spnew20"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Adoption and Children Bill provides a power to make regulations setting out where the responsibility lies for assessment and provision of adoption support services in cases where a child is placed with an adoptive family living in a different local authority area. We will use this power to make regulations which put in place a clear system for the provision of adoption support services in these circumstances. We will also make regulations to ensure the appropriate flow of funding between local authorities in such cases. These regulations will form part of the new framework for adoption support which we are currently developing. We intend to consult fully on the framework and the draft regulations, to ensure that we get the detail right.

<a name="11129w19.html_spnew21"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 It is impossible to estimate accurately the proportion of children who are likely to be the subject to a special guardianship order as compared with adoption. However, we believe the order will be of particular benefit to older children who do not wish to be adopted, but who do want the greater security offered by special guardianship. We have made it clear that special guardianship orders will be accompanied by access to a full range of support services including, where appropriate, financial support, to help the placement succeed. The responses to the consultation on the report of the performance and innovation unit's on adoption <sup>1</sup>  were overwhelmingly in favour of creating such an order. We will continue to consult fully on how best to introduce the special guardianship order to optimise its use, where appropriate.

 The UK believes that the enhanced HIPC initiative is working and already 24 countries have qualified for debt relief. According to World bank and IMF estimates these countries will, on average, have their debts reduced by two-thirds, this will bring their debt service ratios to below the developing country average. The World bank and IMF also estimate that HIPC is delivering US$2.4 billion annually to those countries that have reached Decision Point, and that these countries are allocating about 75 per cent. of their debt relief to social services, such as education and health. Of these, four countries have exited the process and have benefited from irrevocable debt cancellation. The UK continues to work hard to ensure that the HIPC initiative is a success, and to ensure it delivers a sustainable exit from debt for the poorest countries. The UK continues to push for other countries to adopt its policies of offering 100 per cent. interim relief, and holding payment in trust for those countries that have to yet benefit from interim relief.

 Latest estimates from the Government Actuary's Department Survey of Occupational Schemes (1995) suggested that there were 8.8 million active members in 38,000 defined benefit occupational schemes; 1.1 million members in 109,000 defined contribution occupational schemes; and around 0.3 million members in 4,000 mixed defined benefit/defined contribution schemes.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the Inland Revenue make inquiries into family backgrounds in advance of looking at the financial affairs of the individual into whom they are inquiring.  [18889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w21.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue does not routinely look into family backgrounds before commencing a tax inquiry. But there are circumstances in which it would be relevant to do so. For example, the main reason for considering whether to inquire might be that an individual's reported income seemed much lower than his probable expenditure.
<P>

<a name="11129w21.html_para0">In such a case the Revenue might look at the financial position of others in the household to see whether their incomes and, therefore, possible contribution to family finances might account for any perceived shortfall. Preliminary research of this kind helps to focus inquiries on those cases presenting the biggest risks.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 20 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 270W, on capital assets, what guidelines the <i>(a)</i> National Audit Office and <i>(b)</i> Treasury issue on how to classify who bears the risks and rewards associated with an asset.  [19189]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Generally accepted accounting practices are used to determine who bears the risks and rewards associated with an asset, and hence its accounting treatment. These are applied by accountants working for departments, and subsequently audited by the National Audit Office (NAO). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) follows the same treatment for national accounts.
<P>

<a name="11129w21.html_para1">The Treasury's "Resource Accounting Manual" makes clear that all complex transactions should be accounted for under the overriding principles of the Accounting Standards Board's (ASB) Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 5 "Reporting the Substance of Transactions". Such transactions include those where ownership of capital assets reverts to the public sector, for leasing transactions, the more specific principles of the ASB's Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP) 21 "Accounting for Leases and Hire Contract Contracts". For Private Finance Initiative transactions, more specific guidance is given in the Treasury document "Technical Note no. 1 (revised)&#151;How to Account for PFI Transactions", which sets out additional practical guidance on how to apply the ASB's Application Note "Amendment to FRS5&#151;Private Finance Initiative and Similar Contracts".

<P>
<P><I>29 Nov 2001 : Column: 1122W</I><P>

<P>

 Financial rewards can be made to an informer following the conclusion of an inquiry where tax is recovered as a result of the information provided. In deciding the amount of any reward, the Commissioners have regard to the amount of tax recovered. Calculation details are not disclosed since this would enable an informer to estimate the amount of tax recovered, which would breach the Revenue's duty of confidentiality to the taxpayer.

<a name="11129w21.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to Inland Revenue leaflet CA 13 "National Insurance contributions for women with reduced elections". The leaflet, which was updated in May 2001 and can also be found on the Inland Revenue website, explains what contributions married women pay and the implications for future contributory benefit entitlement resulting from keeping their reduced liability.
<P>

<a name="11129w21.html_para4">The Inland Revenue undertook a major publicity exercise in October 2000 writing to around 250,000 married women who had previously elected to pay reduced rate National Insurance contributions. The letter advised them to consider their elections following recent structural changes to National Insurance contributions. A dedicated helpline was set up to provide further information and assistance and some 63,000 telephone inquiries were received.
<P>

<a name="11129w21.html_para5">The September 2001 edition of the Employers Bulletin, which again can be found on the Inland Revenue's website, included an article about married women's reduced rate contributions recommending action that employers should take on a regular basis to remind their employees, who pay a reduced rate, what information they need to report which could affect their National Insurance liability.

<a name="11129w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Government Departments are required to demonstrate that all their expenditure on services provides value for money. The Public Service Agreement between the Treasury and the Department of Health requires NHS trusts to converge over time on a benchmark defined by the cost of care commissioned from NHS trusts which perform well against indicators of fair access, quality and responsiveness. The Treasury monitors progress against the benchmark regularly.

 The basic training that all new recruits receive includes an element that raises awareness of mental illness and highlights the importance of communicating effectively and sensitively with people suffering from a mental disorder.

<P>

<a name="11129w22.html_para0">The Association of Chief Police Officers Manual of Guidance on police use of firearms recognises that people suffering from mental illness may not realise the seriousness of the situation they are in or respond 'normally' to conventional negotiating strategies. The guidance stresses the importance of police negotiators, armed officers and Firearms Incident Commanders having an understanding of people who suffer from mental illness and suggests some actions which may reduce the risk of firearms use. It also stresses that a person's impairment does not reduce the potential harm they may inflict if the incident is not resolved, and that it is the role of the police to deal with the threat irrespective of motive.
<P>

<a name="11129w22.html_para1">It is important that the Government should continue to explore with the police all possible options for ensuring that officers are able to deal with such incidents effectively and in a way that protects the public and police officers.

<P>
<a name="11129w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The training of a fingerprint expert requires that before that person is registered as an expert, he/she must be competent to deal with the process for retrieval of fingerprints from a scene of crime, together with accurate recording of that process. That process includes a requirement to take a Polaroid photograph indicating precisely where the fingerprint has been lifted from and sign across edge of the tape once the fingerprint has been lifted. The essential steps to ensure the probity and continuity of the exhibited fingerprint have been tried and tested within the Criminal Justice System on countless occasions. They meet the high standards of integrity required by our courts.
<P>

<a name="11129w22.html_para4">15 Forces have the ISO9002 Quality Standard for its procedures and have attained that quality standard. The remainder have met an agreed national Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) standard which is audited at least once a year by an independent audit process.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will ask chief constables in England and Wales for a report on the effectiveness of Regulation 12 of the Motorway Traffic (England and Wales) Regulations 1982, as amended, in their county areas.  [17410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The enforcement of motorway regulations is an operational matter for chief officers of police. I understand from the Association of Chief Police Officers that they consider that the prohibition of Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGV) and coaches from the outside lane of motorways enhances traffic flow and affords other drivers some degree of protection from large vehicles. Most HGV drivers observe the prohibition, although a small minority exercise poor lane discipline which can cause annoyance to other motorists. There is, however, little evidence to suggest that this is a significant problem, and we do not consider that a review of the regulation is necessary at this time.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures will be available to public authorities to protect the academic confidentiality of information contained in project licences held under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 after the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is implemented.  [18297]<P>

<P>
<a name="11129w23.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Freedom of Information Act 2000 covers a wide range of public authorities including public sector academic institutions. The right of access will apply to information held by such institutions subject to the conditions and exemptions set out in the Act.
<P>

<a name="11129w23.html_para1">Section 41 of the Act exempts as a class information obtained from any other person if its disclosure would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that or any other person. Other exemptions in the Act which may be relevant to applications to academic institutions for information relating to project licences granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 relate to personal information the disclosure of which would contravene the data protection principles set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 (section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act); and commercial interests (section 43).
<P>

<a name="11129w23.html_para2">It is impossible to judge hypothetically what would or would not be disclosed, as all requests under Freedom of Information will be assessed on a case by case basis. But the Government believe that the Act achieves a proper balance between the right to know, the right to privacy and the preservation of confidentiality where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.
<P>

<a name="11129w23.html_para3">The timetable for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act was recently announced. Implementation will be in stages with the duties on public authorities to apply Publication Schemes&#151;details of the information they will provide pro-actively&#151;being introduced first. This will be staggered for different parts of the public sector. The individual right of access will follow in January 2005.

 I had a useful visit to the region in August where I met with Presidents Kagame and Museveni, President Kabila and Mr. Bemba, Mr. Onusumba and representatives of MONUC among others to discuss the importance of moving the Lusaka Peace Process forward. These have been some promising signs in recent months with no major ceasefire violations, the start of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue (due to reconvene in the new year), and more frank discussions about disarmament, demobilisation, and re-integration.

 Where there have been improvements in the security situation, some international staff of humanitarian agencies have returned to Afghanistan, and access to these parts of the country has increased. However, while the changing situation has resulted in some people in the north of the country being able to return to their homes, continued fighting in the south has caused further displacement. Because of ongoing security concerns, access to vulnerable groups in this regions is extremely limited.

The UN has received assurances from the leadership that they will help to ensure the safety and security of UN national and international staff. Improved security is key to enhancing the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver assistance to those in need. We, and the rest of the international community, will continue to urge the authorities in Afghanistan to assist with the relief effort, and to help stabilise the environment in which the humanitarian community are trying to operate.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what measures he is taking to improve disability access to courts in England and Wales; and what financial resources are being made available for this purpose.  [19289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 At the end of 1997 the Court Service commissioned the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR) to devise a methodology to enable it to conduct disability access audits of all its courts and offices. It involved Court Service personnel who had been trained in the process visiting every building on the estate to identify where they failed to meet the standards required and what remedial work would be required.
<P>

<a name="11129w24.html_para6">On this basis, a three year programme of works was devised (starting in 2001&#150;02) to enable works to be completed well in advance on the 1 October 2004 Disability Discrimination Act 1995 deadline for physical improvements. &#163;5 million has been set aside for this year and targeted on the principal court centres across the estate.
<P>

<a name="11129w24.html_para7">Under the Justices of the Peace Act 1997, the provision and improvement of magistrates courthouse accommodation is a matter for each Magistrates Courts Committee (MCC) to determine, in consultation with the local paying authority or authorities. Since 2000, the Department has provided &#163;2.5 million to enable MCCs to improve facilities for the disabled in magistrates courts across England and Wales. Officials will shortly be assessing the 2002&#150;03 bids received from MCCs for further improvement works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Every public office has a Customer Service Officer whose training includes considering the needs of disabled customers. To support that service, in October 1999 every member of Court Service staff was given a booklet containing guidance on assisting disabled customers. The booklet suggests ways of helping people with a range of disabilities. It also outlines arrangements for provision of assistance such as large print leaflets and communication support for deaf people. All relevant Court Service training events cover disability issues. A liaison officer is available at Court Service Headquarters to assist with disability issues.

 I am advised that there is no definition within the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 of 'disability-friendliness' against which to make such as assessment.
<P>

<a name="11129w24.html_para8">However, in so far as Part M of the Building Regulations 1991 require the design of new and refurbished buildings to enable disabled people to gain independent access into and within the building, all new court builds and major court refurbishments completed since 1992 could be said to be 'disabled-friendly'. It is not possible, in the time available, to provide specific details.

 Sanctions are not applied under the new deal for lone parents as it is a voluntary programme. However, since April 2001, lone parents with a youngest child of school age (at least five years and three months old) have been asked to take part in a meeting with a personal adviser to discuss the range of help available to move into work when they make a claim for income support.

Where training needs are identified, the LAF provides information on the various learning tools available through ONE Training Team, Benefits Agency and Employment Service Regional Training Centres. To meet their training needs attendance on a course or open learning may be appropriate, or they may arrange to meet with local voluntary organisations to widen their knowledge and understanding of clients with special needs. Regular reviews of the progress made towards meeting identified learning needs is an integral part of the staff performance and appraisal system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions further to his answer of 6 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 195W, on industrial injuries disablement benefit, for what reason information is not available on claims for industrial injuries disablement benefit which have been refused as a result of the applicant's condition being caused through work processes and not as a result of accident or prescribed disease.  [18928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 In general we do not keep records of the reasons for disallowing claims for benefit where to do so would serve no purpose. If, in the course of reviewing scientific and medical developments, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council recommends changes to the way conditions caused by work processes are dealt with under the industrial injuries scheme, we will consider those recommendations and monitor the number of cases affected.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]:</i> We have received representations from a number of Individual Learning Account (ILA) registered providers expressing disappointment about the withdrawal of the programme. Many have also offered their help in the development of our future plans. We welcome their offers and will take advantage of their experience. I hope to announce more details on the process for developing a further scheme in due course.

<a name="11129w28.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Before 30 October 2001 29 cases had been taken up for investigation by the Department's Special Investigations Unit. As at 27 November 2001 this had increased to 60 cases. The police are currently involved in five cases.

 Because of the need to take immediate action it was not possible to consult training providers. The Department for Education and Skills called in police to investigate new allegations of fraud and theft involving Individual Learning Accounts. Officers from the Department's Special Investigations Unit had confirmed the allegations on Thursday 22 November. With the

 The Department for Education and Skills called in police to investigate new allegations of fraud and theft involving individual learning accounts. Officers from the Department's Special Investigations Unit were alerted to those allegations on Wednesday 21 November and confirmed them on Thursday 22 November. With the advice of the police and to prevent a serious risk to public funds, the ILA programme was shut down on Friday 23 November.

<P>
<a name="11129w28.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Up to 31 October 2001 there had been 8,448 (0.33 per cent.) complaints received concerning the operation of individual learning accounts. As at 19 November 2001 the number of complaints had increased to 10,276 (0.41 per cent.). Just over a quarter of complaints have raised questions about non-compliance of learning providers with the rules of the ILA scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate she has made of the public expenditure consequences of the operations of the individual learning account scheme between 30 October and 23 November.  [19327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11129w28.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 We cannot give a figure for expenditure between 30 October and 23 November.
<P>

<a name="11129w28.html_para0">There are still significant numbers of payments due in respect of claims already made by learning providers and committed expenditure in respect of learning already booked by providers on the ILA Centre system before it was shut down on 23 November. Because of the police investigation into allegations of fraud and abuse we do not, currently, have access to Capita's ILA Centre system on which the data are stored. We also need to validate both the claims and the bookings held on the ILA Centre system and take action to recoup moneys which have been improperly claimed. As a result it is not possible to estimate the extent of the additional financial commitment at present.

<a name="11129w28.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The department does not publish the average cost per student of a two-year Curriculum 2000 programme. However, the latest estimate of the average delegated funding per sixth form student in schools per year for 2001&#150;02 is &#163;3,330. The total funding per full time equivalent student in FE sector colleges per year in 



<P>
<P><I>29 Nov 2001 : Column: 1147W</I><P>
2001&#150;02 is &#163;3,660. Separate figures for sixth form colleges and tertiary colleges are not available. It should be noted that the two unit funding figures quoted are not directly comparable, as the FE unit funding includes total public funding allocated for further education, while the schools' figure is based only on delegated funds and excludes other funding which the school receives centrally from LEAs which impact on post-16 students.
