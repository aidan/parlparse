               <a name="11071123000159"> The long-term trend in dairy production is towards fewer, larger and more productive herds. The following table shows how the decline in the number of dairy cows has been offset by an increase in average herd size and milk yields. So while the number of dairy cows in England has fallen by 22% between 2001 and 2010, the level of milk production (at the UK level) has fallen only by 5%.</p>

 The Government have no plans to put on hold the spending review allocation to the Forestry Commission. In deciding the budget allocations for DEFRA and its arm’s length bodies, Ministers took account of spending priorities and the contribution of individual arm’s length bodies to achieving key outcomes for the Department. The Forestry Commission continues to recognise that it may need to adapt its spending review plans following the Government's response to the recommendations of the Independent Panel on Forestry, and has structured its plans in such a way that this flexibility can be achieved.</p>

 In 2009-10, English Heritage gave £2.4 million in grant aid to Greater London. This included the final payments for the major restoration and conservation of the grade I listed Crossness Pumping Station at Belvedere. English Heritage also works closely with Bexley council and the Bexley Heritage Trust to ensure the continued success of Danson House and Hall Place.</p>

Developed in consultation with a wide range of partners, it shows where the threats are the greatest and will help English Heritage to prioritise its work. It will also help other heritage professionals and volunteers to contribute to the business of managing England's heritage. This Department and English Heritage are also considering various measures to tackle the problem of buildings which have been on the Heritage at risk register for an extended period of time. In this respect, Danson House and Crossness are prime examples of what can be achieved.</p>

 On 9 February 2011 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), announced a new commitment by the UK's biggest high street banks on lending expectations and capacity. As part of this commitment, the banks intend to lend £190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from £179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more. £76 billion of this lending will be to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is a 15% increase on 2010 lending of £66 billion.</p>

The Government are encouraged that the banks are broadly on target to meet their overall commitment. However, it is disappointing that the banks are behind schedule on lending to SMEs. As the Chancellor made clear in his Mansion House speech on 15 June, the Government will use all tools available to them to ensure that the banks live up to their promises.</p>

 The benefit cap will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>

 Jobcentre Plus advisers are the gateway to the information and support available for customers. The range of leaflets provided by the Department aims to provide broad information on the main benefits and services available. The leaflets are kept as concise as possible and written in plain English so that most people can quickly find what they want and understand the information. The leaflets cannot attempt to provide information on all circumstances. As the help provided to jobseekers is tailored to meet individual needs and depends upon a number of factors, it is impossible to provide concise and accurate information on all the help available. For a jobseeker this information would be provided by a member of staff in Jobcentre Plus. Information on travel to interview support is available in the leaflet ‘Help with job interviews’, DWP 1016, and this is available on request in Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>

 The coalition agreement commits the Government to maintaining green belt protection. The green belt has a valuable role in stopping urban sprawl and providing a green lung around towns and cities. National policy on green belt protection—currently explained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, ‘Green Belts’—will be updated as part of the National Planning Policy Framework. We will consult on the Framework shortly. However, through the Localism Bill we will be abolishing regional strategies. This will remove 'top down' pressure to weaken green belt protection. Our revision to planning guidance on travellers, currently out to consultation, also looks to strengthen protection of the green belt.</p>

This compares with 32% in the social rented sector and 27% of owner occupiers. These percentages suggest that the private rented sector already performs an important role in housing families.

While the response time for a police helicopter to attend HMP Whitemoor would increase if the helicopter were responding from its base, the re-organisation of the current fleet will increase aircraft availability by 8% and ensure that Cambridgeshire will have access to a helicopter 24 hours a day as opposed to 19 hours a day under the existing arrangement.</p>

 The table shows, for the years 2001 to 2010, the number of defendants recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC) in England and Wales as having received at least one conviction, caution, reprimand or warning during the year, and the number of these who were recorded as having committed at least one offence while on bail during the year.</p>

               <a name="11071148000077"> These figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the PNC, which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. In particular the recording of information on whether or not the offence was committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete. This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of recording the bail status of an offender of which the ‘offence committed on bail’ field on the PNC is one. For operational purposes forces make differing use of these various sources and as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a complete picture of these offences; changes over time in these data may not represent real changes in offending while on bail.</p>

This identified a number of challenges to undertaking robust research in this area. The study was therefore limited and adds little to the evidence base. In particular, the findings cannot be regarded as a representative assessment of the operation of sharia councils.

 The table shows, for the years 2008 to 2010, the number of offences recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC) in England and Wales that resulted in a conviction, caution, reprimand or warning and the number of these that were recorded as being committed while the offender was on bail.

               <a name="11071148000289"> These figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the PNC, which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. In particular the recording of information on whether or not the offence was committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete. This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of recording the bail status of an offender of which the ‘offence committed on bail’ field on the PNC is one. For operational purposes forces make differing use of these various sources and as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a complete picture of these offences; changes over time in these data may not represent real changes in offending while on bail.</p>

 Youth services should help young people to aspire and achieve. They should be driven by young people’s views, be rooted in local communities and supported by businesses. Local authorities should ensure disadvantaged young people get early help. They should open up services to a wider range of providers, including the voluntary sector. Building on our Youth Summit in March the Government will publish a policy statement on youth services in the autumn, following further consultation with young people and others.</p>

 The Department for Education estimates the number of teacher training places (including those on Post Graduate Certificates in Education courses) needed for each subject. This includes consideration of the effects of changes such as the introduction of the English Baccalaureate qualification. The Training and Development Agency for schools (TDA) allocates these places to academic institutions and other providers of initial teacher training. The TDA formally notifies the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), a non-departmental public body (NDPB) of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, of the allocation of places to institutions, but this is not broken down by subject.</p>

 Deaths from air pollution are not recorded as a specific cause. However, the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants estimated<sup>(1)</sup> on the basis of 2008 data, that fine particulate air pollution (measured as PM2.5) had an effect on the mortality of the United Kingdom population equivalent to 29,000 deaths in 2008. However, the Committee considered it very unlikely that this represents the number of individuals affected. Instead it speculated that air pollution, acting together with other factors, may have made some smaller contribution to the earlier deaths of up to 200,000 people.</p>

 ‘Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer’, published on 12 January, sets out how the Government will introduce human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as triage for women with mild or borderline cervical screening test results and HPV as a test of cure for treated women. The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12 states that commissioners should work with their local services and NHS Cancer Screening Programmes (NHS CSP) to implement HPV testing as triage for women with mild or borderline results, leading to a more patient-centred service and major cost savings.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_284"> 
               <a name="110711w0004.htm_para40"> 
               <a name="1107125000067"> The current intention is that, subject to meeting certain criteria, local cervical screening programmes will implement HPV triage in 2011-12 and HPV test of cure in 2012-13. Implementing both improvements in the same year would risk the quality and safety of the current programme and put an unnecessary burden on colposcopy services.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_285"> 
               <a name="110711w0004.htm_para41"> 
               <a name="1107125000068"> The Department is currently preparing advice to the national health service that will be issued shortly, alongside implementation guidance from NHS CSP. In autumn 2011, NHS Supply Chain will publish a framework agreement on the purchasing of the five HPV testing kits that are currently available. While services will not be able to implement HPV testing as triage until the framework agreement is published, they will be able to put all necessary plans in place so that, as soon as the agreement becomes available, they will be able to make decisions and place orders without delay.</p>

               <a name="1107125000069"> It is not possible to state the exact number of tests that will take place in 2011-12 and 2012-13. As a guide, around 200,000 women a year have mild or borderline screening test results. There are currently around 500,000 women on annual 10-year follow-up following previous treatment, but this is expected to reduce to around 100,000 a year once these women have been subject to a test of cure in 2012-13.</p>

               <a name="1107125000583"> The spending review recognised the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional £2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>

               <a name="1107125000584"> As part of this funding, this year funding of £150 million has been made available for re-ablement and £648 million for social care spend that benefits the NHS which could help to reduce the level of delayed discharges. The re-ablement money will help people to leave hospital more quickly, get settled back at home with the support they need, and to prevent unnecessary admissions to hospital.</p>

 Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, general practitioners (GPs) will be given real responsibility to ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local healthcare needs. GPs, in partnership with other local healthcare professionals such as therapists and community nurses, are best placed to understand the speech, language and communication health needs of local populations and how to work with their local populations to design services that meet those needs.</p>

Health and wellbeing boards will promote joined up commissioning that will support integrated provision of services across health and social care. This should mean that groups such as users of speech, language and communication services experience health and care services that are better joined up and better meet their needs as individuals.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Finished admission episodes
A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.
<sup>(2)</sup> Primary diagnosis
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.
<sup>(3)</sup> Stroke
It should be noted that the ICD-10 codes for Stroke are:
I60 Subarachnoid haemorrhage
I61 Intracerebral haemorrhage
I62 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage
I63 Cerebral infarction
I64 Stroke not specified as haemorrhage or infarction
<sup>(4)</sup> Emergency admission via A&amp;E
The method of admission code identifies how the patient was admitted to hospital. The following admission methods were used to classify an admission as being an emergency via A&amp;E:
21 = Emergency: via A&amp;E services, including the casualty department of the provider
28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another healthcare provider). Data to be based on in-patients rather than A&amp;E universe
<sup>(5)</sup> Provisional data
The data is provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than those generated for the same period in the final dataset. This shortfall will be most pronounced in the final month of the latest period, ie November from the (month 9) April to November extract. It is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been investigated and corrected.
<sup>(6)</sup> Assessing growth through time
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
<i>Note:</i>
Data quality
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

 The transition of security responsibilities from International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to Afghan forces and the corresponding gradual drawdown of ISAF troops during this process is an issue on which ISAF and the Afghan Government routinely keep other countries in the region updated. In addition, the UK regularly engages with Russia, China and Pakistan on Afghan-related issues. Troop drawdown was discussed with these countries most recently at a meeting of the International Contact Group in Kabul on 26-27 June.</p>

 As of March 2011 we were aware of 2,076 British nationals in detention overseas, a figure which includes individuals detained at all stages of the legal process. We are unable to estimate how many of those have been detained without charge in individual foreign countries. Estimating this figure, and how long they have been detained in each case, would prove difficult and incur disproportionate cost. We aim to contact British nationals, depending on local circumstances, within 24 hours of being told of their arrest or detention. We will consider approaching the local authorities if a British national is not treated in line with internationally-accepted standards, including if their trial is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

 The FCO treats any allegation of mistreatment of domestic workers in diplomatic households very seriously. The police investigate allegations that the law has been broken by persons entitled to immunity and report the results to the FCO. When an allegation is brought to our attention by the police, we liaise as necessary with the relevant diplomatic mission and the UK Border Agency to work for an appropriate response. In the case of an allegation of mistreatment requiring further investigation by the police, the FCO will request a waiver of the diplomat's immunity from the diplomatic mission concerned on behalf of the police. Failure to provide a waiver may result in a request to the mission for withdrawal of the diplomat. In 2010 there were two cases involving allegations of mistreatment of a domestic worker in a diplomatic household.</p>

 There are no changes envisaged to the number of staff employed in our high commission in the Gambia as a result of the closure of bilateral aid programmes from the UK. DFID had contracted a locally engaged officer to help oversee the winding down of DFID's Gambia bilateral programme. Their contract ended in March 2011 and DFID has no plans to renew the contract. As with all our posts, we keep staffing levels under regular review. The UK continues to invest substantially in the Gambia through a variety of programmes delivered through our high commission, totalling over £120,000. Development support to the Gambia also continues through our contributions to multilateral organisations such as the European Union. For 2008-09 the figure for attributed UK aid to the Gambia through multilateral organisations was £923,000.</p>

The Israeli police said the blast was likely to have been caused by negligence and confirmed the attack was not an act of terrorism. One person has been arrested.</p>

The gas deal and the pipeline have long been unpopular as it is seen as a symbol of Egypt's unpopular peace treaty with Israel.</p>

 I spoke to the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister on 14 June. I made it clear that the Sri Lankan Government needs to address the allegations contained in the material recently shown in that television documentary and arising from the UN Panel of Experts Report. The UK has consistently called for an independent, thorough and credible enquiry into allegations of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by both sides during the military conflict in Sri Lanka. In common with our partners in the international community, we expect to see progress on this by the end of the year.</p>

 South Sudan will become as an independent state on 9 July. There is much more work both north and south have to do in the coming days, not least on resolving the outstanding issues of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; a continuing UN presence; and the worrying humanitarian situation. We urge both north and south to work together up to and beyond 9 July and maintain peace and stability as new neighbours.</p>

 National Citizen Service pilot providers are required to ensure that young people from a range of different backgrounds take part in their schemes. While the Government have not set a target for National Citizen Service participants who have been through the youth justice system, many of our pilot providers are highly experienced in working with this group and we expect that many participants will be drawn from this background.

<i>Guide to Quality:</i>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.
<i>Key:</i>
* 0 ≤ CV&lt;5%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 ≤ CV &lt;10%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 ≤ CV &lt;20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ≥ 20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV ≥ Coefficient of Variation

 The Department published an updated impact assessments for the Smart Meter Programme in March 2011. These estimate that over the next 20 years, the rollout of smart meters will deliver £7.3 billion net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks. The benefits include enabling consumer behaviour change, revolutionising industry processes, improving customer service and facilitating smart grids. By 2020, we expect the average domestic consumer, with both electricity and gas, to save an average £23 per year on their energy bill.</p>

 As part of the preparation of the energy National Policy Statements (NPS), an Appraisal of Sustainability (AoS), incorporating Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as required by Directive 2001/42/EC, was done to assess the potential strategically significant effects of new infrastructure on all the indicators highlighted in the questions, including cumulative effects such as those arising from clustering. As the Nuclear NPS (unlike the other energy NPSs) is site specific, it was possible to also carry out more detailed assessments for the proposed nuclear sites.

 Decisions on the allocation of the £20 million recently announced to support demonstration of marine energy technologies were taken in the context of the Department's entire energy innovation budget. We anticipate that the funding allocated to marine energy should, subject to value for money review, be able to support the pre-commercial array demonstration of two technologies. This funding will sit alongside additional innovation support from other funding bodies and the prospect of further demonstration of arrays of marine energy devices being supported through the EU New Entrants' Reserve 300 programme.</p>

The Department for International Development supports programmes to help developing countries integrate climate change into their national strategies—including in the agricultural sector.

 As referred to in my answer of 23 June 2011, we do not have planned allocations for UK support to The Gambia through multilateral organisations in future years. Almost 40% of the UK’s aid programme is channelled through multilateral organisations. As part of the Multilateral Aid Review (MAR), the Government are determined to ensure that UK aid is directed to where it can make the greatest difference.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 6 July 2011]:</i> The number of apprenticeships supported through public sector contracts will vary widely depending on the size and nature of contract. It is not possible to provide a robust estimate of potential apprenticeships places as there is no centrally-held data set on projected public sector spend on procurement, which would be necessary to provide estimates in the format requested. In addition, it would not be possible to estimate the proportion of apprenticeship places that would be genuinely additional, over and above apprentices already employed by public sector suppliers.</p>

While there is no set minimum duration for an apprenticeship, as it depends on the apprentice's individual abilities and prior experience, we would generally expect an intermediate level apprenticeship to take about one year to complete. This will allow the apprentice not only to achieve the relevant qualifications, but also to demonstrate their competence in the job role.</p>

 EU structural and cohesion funds (SCF) provide funding to help narrow the gap in economic growth rates between different EU regions and member states. In the UK, they provide a source of programme funding which has to be matched by domestic funding (either public or private) which aim to improve the business environment, rather than a direct subsidy to business.

The analysis did not explicitly cover either Skills for Life (SfL) or ESOL learners, as it was done to assess the impact of changes to age and qualification-related entitlements which were announced in the November 2010 Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth. We are currently conducting a new survey of incomes of FE sector learners which will include SfL and ESOL learners. Results from this survey should be available by the end of this year.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the right hon.

The Higher Education White Paper sets out our proposals to improve the provision of degree courses in further education colleges. This includes allowing further education colleges and other providers who combine good quality with value for money to bid for a flexible margin of 20,000 student places in 2012/13 and changes to degree-awarding powers that are likely to increase the range of validating institutions, giving greater choice for further education colleges.</p>

 Ministers at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills wrote to the Director of Fair Access on 10 February 2011 setting out the Government's expectations about how he should approach the approval and monitoring of new Access Agreements. The guidance set out significantly increased expectations for the priority that institutions should give to fair access and widening participation.

We will want to work with the director on the size and structure of OFFA but will make significantly more resources available, increasing capacity up to around four times its original level.</p>

 As set out in the Higher Education White Paper “Students at the heart of the system”, published in June 2011, there will be changes to student finance funding flows as the balance of public investment shifts from grants to loans. This has implications for how the Student Loans Company and the Higher Education Funding Council for England work together and they have already begun joint planning for closer co-operation in the future and to consider any structural changes that might be required. Any changes arising from the White Paper will take into account the service which applicants for student finance have a right to expect.</p>

 Decisions about what expenditure will be incurred in 2011-12 by the Department and the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be proportionate and any additional expenditure timed to coincide with those periods when students and their parents/carers need information. Account will also be taken of the evaluation of the first phase of campaign activity and, in the case of the SLC, application numbers. It is not therefore possible to say how any additional expenditure will be allocated in 2011-12.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 5 July 2011]:</i> HS2 would enable the redevelopment of Euston station, which would likely be necessary regardless of whether HS2 proceeds. The redevelopment and expansion of the station, including 10 HS2 platforms, a new ground-level concourse serving the whole station, the reconfiguration and expansion of the existing inadequate London Underground ticket hall and a new bus interchange would cost £1.01 billion to construct. This figure excludes HS2 costs (e.g. design and project management), compensation costs, and risk and optimism bias. However, the Government anticipate that a considerable proportion of this cost could be recouped from at-station commercial and residential development. Information on the property and other impacts of the station redevelopment are set out in the Appraisal of Sustainability, available at:</p>

               <a name="11071212000518"> Rail Package 2 would require the provision of three additional platforms at Euston, which has been costed at £62 million, excluding on-costs, compensation, and any improvements to London Underground interfaces. This work would be conducted within the existing station footprint. It would be likely to cause significant disruption to passengers as there would be no scope to commission new platforms ahead of closing existing platforms for redevelopment. In addition, as the Euston works necessary for Rail Package 2 have not been developed to the same level of detail as the HS2 proposals, further technical work would be necessary to consider whether the proposals would not also require the widening and remodelling of the station throat and the London Underground interfaces.</p>
