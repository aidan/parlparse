<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Winter Fuel Payments (WFP) were introduced in the winter of 1997/98. For the winters of 1997/98 and 98/99 eligible people receiving Income Support (IS) or income based Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA (IB)) which included a pensioner premium, who were not living in residential care or a nursing home received payments of &#163;50. All other eligible pensioners received &#163;20 or &#163;10 depending on their household circumstances. Where only one eligible pensioner lived in the household they would receive &#163;20, otherwise they would receive &#163;10 each.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many, and what percentage of, children were in households with below half average income in each year from 1990 to 1999, calculated on the basis of the <i>(a)</i> Family Expenditure Survey and <i>(b)</i> Family Resources Survey, for Great Britain only, and on the basis of (i) equivalising and (ii) not equivalising net disposable household income.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many <i>(a)</i> former service personnel and <i>(b)</i> members of their families have made appeals to the Pensions Appeals Tribunal since 1970 for compensation arising out of their participation in experiments at the chemical defence establishment Porton Down; how many have been awarded compensation; and how many are awaiting adjudication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hopkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) how many Jobseeker's Allowance cases, resulting from refusals to claims based on regulations 51(2)(c) and 51(2)(b)(i) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996, are being stayed; and how many of the claimants involved are <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women;  [132711]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate the number of <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women affected by (i) regulation 51(2)(c) and (ii) regulation 51(2)(b)(i) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 for each of the last four years;  [132712]
<P>
(3) what representations he has received in relation to the payment of Jobseeker's Allowance to term-time only workers; and if he will make a statement;  [132714]
<P>
(4) if he will estimate the cost of restoring the entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance for term-time only workers.  [132715]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have received representations about entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) or Income Support (IS) from ancillary workers and their representatives. The current legal position is that ancillary workers with an ongoing contract of employment, who are not entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) or Income Support (IS) during term-time because of the hours they work, are also not entitled to JSA or IS during the school holidays.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para4">This position, which reflects the original JSA provisions introduced in 1996, was confirmed by the decision of the Court of Appeal on 14 October 1999. The retrospective effect of the Court of Appeal decision means that there was never any entitlement to JSA during the school holidays for this group of ancillary workers. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the Court of Appeal decision was granted on 11 April.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para5">Claims to JSA or IS by term-time workers are decided on an individual basis. We understand that no claims are being stayed under the formal staying provisions. However, the Appeals Service advise that as at 30 June there were 3,532 appeals involving term-time workers where decisions have been deferred pending the decision of the House of Lords. In addition, on the directions of Commissioners, 114 appeal cases are awaiting the outcome of the House of Lords cases. The gender breakdown is unknown and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para6">Information to estimate the number of men and women affected by regulation 51(2)(c) and regulation 51(2)(b)(i) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 for each of the last four years is not available.




<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 2000 : Column: 604W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para7">When JSA was introduced in 1996 the original intention of the legislation was that ancillary workers who were not entitled to benefit during term-time were also not entitled during school holidays. We have no accurate data on which to base a reliable estimate of the cost of extending entitlement to ancillary workers who are not entitled to JSA or IS during the school holidays because of the hours they work during term-time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what the cost of social security fraud in the Ribble Valley was in each of the years between 1994 and 2000, broken down by type of benefit.  [132725]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Since 1998, Area Benefit Reviews (ABRs) have provided a continuous measurement of fraud and error in Income Support (IS) and Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). It is currently not possible to provide a breakdown for other benefits.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para8">Prior to 1998 no attempt was made to measure fraud in the Social Security system on the basis of areas and type of benefit.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para9">Fraud figures are now available for each of the Benefits Agency's 13 Area Directorates (ADs). It is not possible to provide estimates of levels of fraud for specific towns, cities, counties or constituencies. Ribble Valley is part of AD8, which stretches from Liverpool and Chester in the south up to Workington in the north.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para10">The ABR results estimate that the level of fraud in AD8 for the year ending September 1998 was &#163;66 million, &#163;47 million for IS and &#163;19 million for JSA.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para11">For the year ending September 1999, the figure reduced to &#163;53 million, &#163;37 million for IS and &#163;16 million for JSA.

<P>
<a name="00726w01.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Kelly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the report of the second inspection by the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate of the London borough of Croydon.  [133413]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The report by the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate of the second inspection of the London borough of Croydon has been published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para12">The BFI previously reported on the London borough of Croydon in March 1999. Since then the authority has responded positively to their recommendations, introducing the verification framework, providing more training for benefit staff and investigating items of post returned under the 'Do Not Redirect' mail scheme.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para13">Inspectors also found that Croydon had improved working practices, verification procedures and how greater assurance that claims it pays are valid. This has contributed to Croydon administering 15 per cent. fewer claims and a fall in benefit expenditure of over &#163;6 million in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para14">Although Croydon has made progress the report states it can do more to improve the security of benefit administration. This involves more rigorously applying sanctions, such as prosecutions and administrative penalties to make fraudsters pay for their actions and using all counter fraud measures available under new statutory powers, such as appointing inspectors.




<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 2000 : Column: 605W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para15">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address existing weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="00726w01.html_para16">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for their proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

<a name="00726w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In negotiations on the European Parliament's proposed amendments to the waste incineration Directive proposal, the UK has made clear that it would like the text to exclude animal carcase incinerators provided that they are subject to alternative appropriate environmental regulation. We are now confident that the directive when it is adopted will include text intended specifically to exclude animal carcase incinerators with the proviso that the Commission intends to propose a revision to the animal waste directive providing for high environmental standards for incineration and co-incineration of animal waste.

<P>
<a name="00726w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Public funding is made available for contaminated land research on a variety of topics, including its remediation.

 Croydon Tramlink was designed, built and is being operated by Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. (TCL), a private sector consortium, under a concession agreement with London Regional Transport made in 1996. Under the concession agreement TCL bear the risks associated with the construction and operation of the project. The Government made a fixed contribution of &#163;125 million towards the projected capital cost of &#163;200 million, in recognition of the wider benefits of Tramlink to the local area. TCL raised the remainder of the cost and run the system without public subsidy.

<a name="00726w02.html_para6">The UK Plan prohibits most waste imports for disposal, including imports of municipal waste for final disposal, in line with longstanding UK policies of encouraging developed countries to become as self-sufficient as possible in waste disposal. Consistent with the EC Waste Shipments Regulation (EEC) No. 259-93, though, the UK Plan cannot prohibit imports of wastes for recovery, which could include incineration with energy recovery. However, individual shipments of municipal wastes for recovery require the prior consent of the UK enforcement authorities. There may be grounds for objecting to proposed shipments if the primary purpose of the importing facility is to treat local wastes and those wastes will be displaced by the proposed imports.
<P>

<a name="00726w02.html_para7">Available data show that no imports of municipal waste have taken place since the UK Plan took effect.

 In the interests of minimising public expenditure, Public Inquiries conducted by Traffic Commissioners are transcribed only when necessary, such as in the case of an appeal. There is currently no reason to incur the cost of transcribing the Inquiry in question.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how his Ten Year Transport Plan relates to the work of the West Midlands to North West multi-modal study;  [132847]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Ten Year Transport Plan provides the resources to implement the outcomes from multi-modal studies. These studies exemplify our integrated approach to transport policy which we are applying to a series of transport problems around the country.
<P>

<a name="00726w03.html_para0">The West Midlands to North West multi-modal study is a good example. The aim of this study is to ensure that the M6 motorway retains its vital strategic role supporting the national economy. M6 Junction 11a-16 Widening and M6 Junction 16-19 Widening schemes were remitted for consideration in this study following the 1998 Roads Review. The study is also looking at the role that rail and public transport could play in easing the problems on the M6, and the scope for using new technologies, demand management techniques and giving priority to certain types of traffic to make better use of the existing infrastructure. The study will report in autumn 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Over the next three years, the Highways Agency will be introducing Calmed Motorways measures on M6 Junctions 10-8 to regulate speed and reduce congestion and delays. The West Midlands Area Multi-Modal Study is looking at further measures to make best use of the M6 between Junctions 6-10 using speed and access control. The Birmingham Northern Relief Road will also provide a less congested alternative to the M6.

 I am pleased to report to the House that the transfer of responsibility has been achieved effectively. Currently, however, Transport for London are developing expertise in key operational areas and the Highways Agency will be providing them with advice and support for a short handover period. This arrangement is the subject of a Service Agreement between the two bodies. Tfl are committed to achieving self-sufficiency as quickly as possible and it is envisaged that the assistance will generally be required until the autumn. The Treasury has agreed that the Agency may score this expenditure as extra-statutory and record it as special payments in their Appropriation Account.

 Information about the private finance agreement between Tower Hamlets Housing Action Trust (the HAT), Circle Thirty Three Housing Trust and its subsidiary Old Ford Housing Association (OFHA) is available on the DETR website at www.detr.gov.uk/ppp/ 2.htm#towerhamlets. The HAT's partners have agreed to invest &#163;23 million, alongside the HAT's own investment of &#163;55 million, to enable the HAT's programme for rehousing its tenants to proceed faster and at less cost to the taxpayer than would be possible with public funds alone. The risks transferred include the financial uncertainty arising from HAT tenants' right to choose between the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and OFHA as their future landlord.

[133120]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The expenditure on rail announced in the Spending Review 2000 relates to Great Britain. It is not possible to provide a geographical breakdown at this stage. The distribution of expenditure will depend on progress with franchise replacement and on priorities for investment identified in the shadow Strategic Rail Authority's first strategic plan to be published in November.

<a name="00726w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 After very careful consideration of all the responses received and bearing in mind the weight of all the arguments, I have decided that the only people who should be entitled to drive a licensed private hire vehicle in England and Wales, outside London, without themselves having the appropriate licence, should be people conducting legally necessary tests, either of the vehicle or the driver. I am advised that it is already legal for people without a private hire vehicle driver's licence to conduct such tests. Accordingly, no order is necessary under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made on making car fronts safer and controlling bull bars.  [133245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 "Tomorrow's Roads--Safer for Everyone", our road safety strategy, commits the UK to backing proposals for the European Commission to bring forward a Directive to make car fronts safer. The Government believe that a pedestrian protection Directive could ultimately secure a reduction in deaths and serious injuries to pedestrians of up to 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00726w04.html_para2">The Government also said in the road safety strategy that such a Directive would be the best way of preventing particularly dangerous bull bars being fitted to vehicles. As a part of our consideration of how best to tackle bull bars, we asked the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to do some test work comparing a range of typical bull bars and base vehicles. TRL's report on this is being published today and copies have been put in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="00726w04.html_para3">In summary, TRL recommend that an approval procedure for bull bars should be considered, with a test speed of 40km/h (25mph). They warn against a low speed test, which is the best we could demand in any national approval scheme. We believe this confirms our view that controls on bull bars should be introduced on a Europe-wide basis. TRL's research is a thorough piece of work, and their initial findings have enabled us to submit a technical proposal to the European Commission setting out how bull bars could be dealt with in the anticipated pedestrian protection Directive.
<P>

<a name="00726w04.html_para4">The Government do, however, recognise that there is a desire for action to be taken as quickly as possible. We have therefore also submitted a comparable technical proposal for amending the 'existing' external projections Directive to include a test for bull bars, as a quick interim measure. This second proposal was well received by other member states when it was initially tabled in early June, and we hope it will make swift progress.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will assess the benefits of joint health and social care <i>(a)</i> planning and <i>(b)</i> provision in rural areas; and if he will make a statement.  [127301]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are persuaded of the benefits of joint health and social care planning and, where appropriate, provision. We have taken a number of significant steps to promote joint working.
<P>

<a name="00726w05.html_para0">Joint planning is especially important in rural areas where services are more dispersed and some people face problems of access. The provision of joint services across the spectrum of health and social care has been encouraged through use of the Partnership Grant, and by the flexibilities provided for in the Health Act 1999, and increasingly means that rural areas can be better served.
<P>

<a name="00726w05.html_para1">The partnership arrangements in the Health Act 1999 came into force in April 2000. The new flexibilities include pooling of funds, delegation of functions and money transfers. To date there have been 22 notifications of partnership arrangements, amounting to over &#163;200 million of resources, of which nine are from local authority areas which would be described as largely rural. These include Devon, Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Cumbria and North Yorkshire.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will <i>(a)</i> make a statement on the Government's proposals to encourage healthy eating among children and <i>(b)</i> ensure that the Government's efforts are co-ordinated across the United Kingdom with the devolved administrations.  [129928]<P>

<a name="00726w05.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 As part of the strategy to tackle the issues raised in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of 4-18 year olds, which we published in June, we have set up a cross-Government working group on improving children's diet and physical activity in England. It involves Health and Education Ministers, the chair of the Food Standards Agency and the chair of the Health Development Agency. Already, through the Healthy Schools Programme, we are encouraging schools to present consistent, informed messages about healthy eating and food on offer from canteens, vending machines and tuck shops. Additionally we have recently announced that we will be spending &#163;2 million this year to promote fruit and vegetable consumption among school aged children. Any further proposals to improve children's diet will be included in the National Plan for the National Health Service which is due to be announced later this month.
<P>

<a name="00726w05.html_para4">As public health is a devolved topic, any proposals in this area for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the devolved administrations who may develop dietary policy and initiatives which best meet their own particular needs. However, I intend to keep in close contact with my ministerial counterparts in the other UK countries and fully explore the opportunities for co-ordination in this area.

Disodium hexafluorosilicate (a silicofluoride) and hexafluorosilicic acid (also called hydrofluorosilicic acid) are approved for use in artificial fluoridation schemes under the Water Industry Act 1991, subject to compliance with a Code of Practice on the Technical Aspects of the Fluoridation of Water Supplies published by the Department of the Environment. This code covers the design, construction, operation and maintenance of fluoridation plant to ensure that the correct level of fluoride is added and there are fail-safe precautions against over dosing. The code includes a detailed specification for the two chemicals together with advice to water companies on how to check the purity of the chemicals against the specification.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that at recent European Commission Working Group meetings on veterinary legislation, all European Union member states have expressed support for the Commission's initiative to fundamentally review ante- and post-mortem inspection procedures in slaughterhouses. All member states were of the view that the current meat inspection system should be re-assessed on the basis of risk. However, there were varying degrees of support for the extent to which it would be possible to move away from the present levels of official supervision and for plant operators to take responsibility for post-mortem inspection. Subsequent bilateral meetings between Food Standards Agency officials and representatives from the veterinary

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w06.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a food safety management system which places responsibility for the production of safe food on food business operators. HACCP is widely regarded as the most effective approach to preventing food safety problems but is not currently a mandatory requirement in the meat slaughtering sector. The European Commission's proposals for new food safety hygiene rules, presented by Commissioner Byrne at the Agriculture Council on 17 July, would extend HACCP-based controls to all food production, including meat slaughtering. We welcome these proposals and the opportunity they give to modernise official controls and meat inspection procedures. The new legislation is expected to take at least two years to negotiate, with a further interim phase needed for full implementation. I am advised that the Food Standards Agency will be consulting widely on the Commission's proposals in developing the United Kingdom's negotiating position.
<P>

<a name="00726w06.html_para4">In the meantime, the meat industry is being encouraged to adopt HACCP on a voluntary basis. In a survey in 1999 about 54 per cent. of red meat (full throughput) slaughterhouses and 71 per cent. of white meat (full throughput) slaughterhouses in Great Britain claimed to have a full HACCP system in place.

Action is being taken specifically on both reducing waiting times for patients needing orthopaedic procedures and on improving services to them. We are also improving access to cataract services. In doing so, we will improve the volume of surgery and reduce waiting lists. A capital modernisation fund of &#163;20 million over two years from 2000-01 will allow local services to modernise.

 The Department has alerted all independent sector places carrying out termination of pregnancy to this new guideline. One of the conditions for approval is that practice should be guided by authoritative guidelines such as those from the Royal Colleges and we will monitor implementation during inspection visits. We expect the guideline to be used as the basis of local protocols that will promote the development of high quality services and take account of local needs and service provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of the impact on recruiting requirements for speech and language therapists of their increased responsibilities, with particular reference to dysphagic patients and children with special educational needs.  [131735]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Following the Dearing Review of higher education in 1998, funding for training of speech and language therapists, chiropodists, dietitians, orthotists and prosthetics was transferred from the Department for Education and Employment to the Department of Health. This Department has commissioned consultants to carry out a labour market analysis of speech and language therapists. This will include any recruitment implications resulting from increased workload due to treating dysphagia patients and children with special educational needs.

<a name="00726w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. The number of speech and language therapists (whole time equivalent) employed in the National Health Service increased by 17 per cent. between 1995 and 1999 (from 3,270 to 3,830).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of research by Deborah Rossiter, of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, into the recruitment and retention of speech and language therapists.  [131737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The research is being fed into the Department's current labour market analysis of the speech and language therapy profession.

<a name="00726w08.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans and targets his Department has for the recruitment of <i>(a)</i> speech and language therapists and <i>(b)</i> physiotherapists.  [131743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The national recruitment, retention and vacancy survey published in September 1999 gave us the latest authoritative data on staff vacancies from 98 per cent. of National Health Service trusts. It shows that only 3.3 per cent. of physiotherapist and 1.2 per cent. of speech and language therapist posts have been vacant for 3 months or more (in England). We are ensuring that effective recruitment and retention policies are in place to make the best use of trained staff and that training levels are sufficient to get a better match between supply and demand.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para3">We are taking a number of steps which will help to address the issue of recruitment and retention of physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 2000 : Column: 629W</I><P>
These include the publication of the framework for the management of human resources for the whole of the NHS, "Working Together: securing a quality workforce for the NHS", which sets targets for local employers to improve recruitment and retention year on year. We have issued guidance to the service on improving working lives and we will shortly be issuing guidance on Lifelong Learning and Continuing Professional Development.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para4">We are also modernising services and modernising employment practice in the NHS: developing more supportive, flexible and family friendly working practices; extending and improving investment in lifelong learning and professional development; tackling violence and racism in the workplace; involving staff in the way services are delivered and in the changes and developments that affect their working lives.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para5">We have accepted in full the pay increases recommended by the Pay Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (including physiotherapists) for 2000-01. The Review Body have recommended an across the board increase of 3.4 per cent. for 2000-01 and for the second year running these increases will be paid in full without staging. Taken together with last year's award, this means that physiotherapists will have received real terms increases of over 5 per cent., the best settlement for over 10 years.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para6">Earlier this month, speech and language therapists accepted the pay offer for the years 2000-01 (3.25 per cent. or &#163;300 whichever is the higher) and 2001-02 (a formula on which negotiations will be based) and the agreement will be promulgated to the NHS on 27 July 2000. Manufacturing Science and Finance Union, the main union representing speech and language therapists, balloted their speech and language therapist membership on the offer and the vote in favour of accepting the offer was 98 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para7">Career prospects for speech and language therapists have been improved with the introduction on 19 May of a revised grading structure for speech and language therapists which extends the existing pay spine to match that of clinical psychologists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w08.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that specified risk material (SRM) controls are designed to ensure that all SRM is completely separated from the parts of the carcases of cattle and sheep which might be used for food before any further processing, such as the production of mechanically recovered meat (MRM), can take place. These controls are rigorously supervised by the Meat Hygiene Service, which inspects each carcase individually to ensure that all traces of SRM have been removed before the health mark is applied. As an additional safeguard, the SRM rules also prohibit the use of vertebral column of cattle or sheep, which will have been in contact with SRM in the form of the spinal cord, in MRM production.

 The Health and Safety Executive has commissioned research into the relationship between certain substances and occupational asthma. It has also commissioned research to develop monitoring methods and improve workplace controls.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para8">The Health and Safety Commission sets occupational exposure limits for some 500 substances. Virtually all hazardous substances that can cause ill health in the workplace are subject to control under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para9">The Department also provides information for the public on air pollution and health in the form of an information pack. This pack contains a wide range of information, including leaflets and factsheets from organisations such as the National Asthma Campaign and the Lung and Asthma Information Agency that contains specific health advice for people with asthma. The pack also provides information on how to obtain Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions leaflets on such issues as dust mites in the home, carbon monoxide poisoning in the home and damp and mould control for the home.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para10">The Department's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants has recently published advice on the health effects of air pollutants and this includes advice on precautions to take with pollutants indoors, including maintaining domestic appliances and ventilation. The importance of ventilation to improve air quality in the home is well understood and is enforced through the building regulations.
<P>

<a name="00726w08.html_para11">In 1997, the Department, together with the DETR jointly commissioned a research programme "The Effects On Health Of Exposure To Air Pollutants And Damp In The Home". This &#163;1.3 million programme focused on air pollution in the home and its effects on health. Specific projects concentrated on exposure to indoor air pollutants in children and their mothers with asthma and exposure to particulate air pollution and respiratory illness. The projects are due for completion later this year when the results and conclusions will be assessed.

<a name="00726w09.html_para3">In view of the Committee's advice, funding Departments (which include the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions), commissioned the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College to undertake a case-control epidemiological study to examine whether there are adverse reproductive outcomes associated with chlorination by-products in drinking-water. The study is part of core funding of SAHSU, and is not costed separately. The first part of the study, which is investigating the hypothesis of an association between chlorination byproducts and stillbirths, low birth weight, birth weight distribution and sex ratio, is expected to report in the autumn of 2000. A proposed second phase will investigate the hypothesis of an association with certain congenital anomalies (cleft lip/palate, and major defects of the heart and of the abdominal wall), and is expected to take about 16 months to complete.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> Chemical disinfection of drinking-water is an important part of the treatment of water to protect human health. There are, however, concerns that traces of the chemical by-products of disinfection processes may be harmful. Standing expert advisory committees, whose members are appointed by the Chief Medical Officer, have advised the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the evidence linking the consumption of chlorinated tap-water with cancers and with adverse reproductive outcomes. The Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that:
<P>

<a name="00726w09.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Overall, the further epidemiological studies fail to provide persuasive evidence of a consistent relationship between chlorinated drinking-water and cancer. It remains possible that there may be an association between chlorinated drinking water and cancer which is obscured by problems such as the difficulty of obtaining an adequate estimate of exposure to chlorination by-products, misclassification of source of drinking water (including the use of bottled water), failure to take adequate account of confounding factors (such as smoking status), and errors arising from non-participation of subjects.

We are considering the most appropriate way forward in the light of devolution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w11.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 In England prescription pre-payment certificates (PPCs) are not available by instalments. To introduce payment on a sliding scale, by instalments or by direct debit, would inevitably increase administrative costs. This would in turn lead to higher season ticket fees, and so reduce the potential savings and make them less attractive for those who continue to use them. However, we recognise that some people may have difficulty in finding the fee for an annual PPC in one payment, which is why we have also made PPCs available for four- monthly periods at a cost of &#163;31.40.

These figures include absences at the FCO's only Executive Agency, Wilton Park, which employs around 40 staff, and the FCO's non-departmental public bodies, all of which employ fewer than seven staff. The cost of this level of absenteeism in the previous four years would have been &#163;5.3 million in 1998-99, &#163;5.3 million in 1997-98, &#163;5.4 million in 1996-97 and &#163;5.4 million in 1995-96.

In April this year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to all diplomatic missions and international organisations in the United Kingdom giving them the opportunity to either pay their outstanding fines or appeal against them if they considered that they had been issued incorrectly. As a result payments totalling &#163;36,120.00 were received leaving a total of 4,124 unpaid fines for 1999.

 It is not the place of the Government to tell industry how to organise its own representative bodies. However, in the Best Practice Guide for the Model Trade Association the Government have identified the key characteristics that we feel trade associations should have as representatives of their industry.
<P>

<a name="00726w13.html_para0">They should represent the whole of a commercial or industrial sector and seek to cover all products, services and processes.
<P>

<a name="00726w13.html_para1">They should also ensure that their members represent a substantial proportion of the sector (both in terms of output and members).

<P>

<a name="00726w13.html_para4">SAR is the Specific Energy Absorption Rate. It is the rate at which energy is absorbed by unit mass of tissue in an electromagnetic field.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will provide a breakdown of the basis on which Sport England forecasts the Lottery draw-down for 2000-01.  [130520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w14.html_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The drawdown for 2000-01 was based on the estimated payment profile of individual awards. This included budgeted drawdown for payment on major schemes such as the English Institute of Sport and the Commonwealth Games Stadium. The budget for 1999-2000 included some provision for drawdown on these two major schemes, but progress payments were delayed, which has led to the increase in the amount to be paid out this financial year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w14.html_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The method used by Sport England for estimating the drawdown year on year is based on the estimated payment profile of individual awards, and not on a percentage increase of the previous years drawdown.

<P>
<a name="00726w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 The Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit has been leading on the commitment in the Modernising Government White Paper to produce an integrated system of impact and appraisal tools in support of sustainable development. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have been closely involved in this, for example running a pilot exercise to test the Policy Makers Checklist and contribute to proposals for an integrated approach to appraisal. DRTR will also be working with the Centre for Management and Policy Studies which has a remit to identify and promote best practice in policymaking.

No Permanent Secretary is from an ethnic minority background.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will make a statement on the performance of the main Departments and Agencies against the six service standards for central Government over the financial year 1999-2000.  [133344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 I have arranged for a report on the performance of the main Departments and Agencies to be placed in the Libraries of the House. This is the first report on performance against the revised service standards announced in the Modernising Government White Paper, and reflects the Government's commitment to openness and to reporting transparently on our performance.
<P>

<a name="00726w16.html_para3">In most cases, Departments' performance in responding to correspondence from the public has improved over the past year, although performance varies widely and there is still room for improvement overall. Ministers are determined that performance should continue to improve through the introduction of new technology and the overhaul of outdated procedures. The performance of the main Departments and Agencies is summarised in the table.
<P>

<a name="00726w16.html_para4">Against the other standards, the report shows that visitors to public offices are usually seen within 10 minutes of their appointment, and that most visitors without an appointment are seen within the designated target. All Departments have at least one telephone inquiry point, and calls to designated numbers are usually answered promptly. Use of the internet is increasing rapidly and all the main Departments dealing with the public have websites, publicise their complaints procedure on-line, and, in most cases, are able to accept e-mailed inquiries. The report also shows some of the innovative ways in which Departments and Agencies are consulting their users and making their services more accessible.

 The Department is not a signatory to any school PFI contracts and therefore does not have full information about the commercial details of these deals. However, our monitoring of deals signed recently suggests that contractors are likely to receive a return on capital of some 8-9 per cent. from PFI schemes in schools.

 In England, primary and secondary headteachers were invited to attend a one day threshold assessment training event in March or April.

<P>
<a name="00726w17.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's original intention was that a headteacher could request input from their teamleaders or other senior members of staff who had a more direct overview of a teachers' work to assist in assessing threshold applications. This applied in both primary and secondary schools. Following the outcome of the judicial review brought by the NUT the threshold assessments have been put on hold and there is now no contractual duty for such staff to assist the headteacher in assessments.

 The Secretary of State's original intention was that a headteacher could request input from their teamleaders or other senior members of staff to assist in assessing threshold applications.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the effect of the decision of Mr. Justice Jackson on 14 July on the formula for payments from his Department to local authorities in respect of threshold payments as set out in paragraphs 3 to 15 of Annex A of Special Grant report 61; what modifications he plans to make to the timescale for payments set out in those paragraphs; and whether he intends to proceed on the basis of Special Grant report 66 for making payments.

<P>
<a name="00726w17.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to the introduction of a threshold for teachers, providing an additional &#163;2,001, backdated to September 2000, for all teachers who demonstrate the characteristics of effective teaching.
<P>

<a name="00726w17.html_para3">The need to refer the standards for assessing teachers against the threshold to the School Teachers Review Body, following Mr. Justice Jacksons' judgment will have the effect of delaying teachers assessments and so payments to successful teachers. As a consequence, we will not seek parliamentary approval for Special Grant Report 66 which will be replaced with a revised report in autumn setting out a new timetable for payments to local authorities.

 The Government have undertaken to fund each full-time equivalent teacher passing the threshold at an annual rate of &#163;2,357. This comprises the threshold uplift of &#163;2,001 increased by 17.8 per cent. for pension and national insurance contributions. The total cost of the threshold will depend on the number of teachers who pass the assessment, as will the proportion this represents of the &#163;1 billion available until March 2002.

 In October 1999 Norfolk LEA served Notice on the Secretary of State of its proposal to relocate the existing Edinburgh Road Special School to a new site in Sheringham. The statutory process involves local consultation, the serving of the Notice by the LEA, a period for objections followed by consideration by the Secretary of State during which he will consider, among other information, advice from HMI.

<a name="00726w18.html_para0">Today I have informed the hon. Member and Norfolk LEA that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is minded to approve the proposals, subject to the necessary planning permission being granted.

<a name="00726w18.html_para2">The number of trainees recruited onto mathematics postgraduate initial teacher training courses declined between 1994-95 and 1998-99, and there was a similar decline in the number of trainees recruited onto science postgraduate initial teacher training courses between 1996-97 and 1998-99. In October 1998 'golden hello' incentives were announced for teacher trainees taking a postgraduate certificate of education in mathematics or science.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The proposals to close the sixth form at Beanfield Community College were decided under the new arrangements for local decision making. Since September 1999, most decisions on statutory proposals have been taken by local School Organisation Committees. Statutory guidance requires those bringing forward proposals to consult all interested parties, and also requires School Organisation Committees to satisfy themselves before deciding proposals with a significant post-16 dimension that all interested parties have been fully consulted and their views explicitly addressed.

<P>
<a name="00726w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Universities are responsible for their own admissions policies. Initial indications are that they will consider the new AS level qualifications as early predictors of A level performance and make conditional offers that include, alongside A levels, AS qualifications as evidence of breadth. The position will be clearer once the HE prospectuses are published early in 2001. A guidance note for HEIs on changes to the post-16 curriculum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was published by UCAS in June 2000 in conjunction with the Department and the regulatory authorities. Copies will be placed in the Libraries.

 Schools and, for centrally employed staff, LEAs will be free to appoint assistant headteachers as needed within their management structures, and within the resources they have available. Given the widely differing circumstances of individual schools, we have not attempted to estimate the total number likely to be appointed, although it is unlikely that any school will need a leadership group (including headteacher, deputy headteachers and assistant headteachers) of more than seven.

 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment last week announced an extra &#163;100 million for higher education in 2001-02 on top of the increase announced in November 1999. Compared to 2000-01 the projected real-terms increase in unit cost per full-time equivalent student in 2001-02 if student numbers remained at 2000-01 levels, would be 2.2 per cent. If the number of students increases in line with plans for 2001-02, which are compatible with meeting the Government's target that 50 per cent. of 18 to 30-year-olds should have the opportunity to benefit from higher education by the end of the decade, then the real-terms unit cost will be about 0.5 per cent. above that in 2000-01.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he will respond to the report made by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield following his review of criminal injuries compensation in Northern Ireland, published in July 1999.  [133348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 After careful consideration of Sir Kenneth Bloomfield's detailed report on the fitness for purpose of criminal injuries compensation arrangements in Northern Ireland, I am today able to announce the Government's broad proposals for the future of the scheme. The detail will be published next year for consultation in the form of a draft Order in Council.
<P>

<a name="00726w21.html_para0">I must first place on record my gratitude and thanks to Sir Kenneth Bloomfield and his colleagues on the review for a most diligent and thorough investigation into the legislation and workings of the current criminal injuries compensation scheme. Their terms of reference asked them to advise the Government on:
<P>

<a name="00726w21.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the fitness for purpose of criminal injuries compensation arrangements in Northern Ireland in the light of the experiences of victims of terrorist violence . . .




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>26 Jul 2000 : Column: 673W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
and their research led them to consider many harrowing accounts of death and injury from victims of criminal violence, and to judge the extent to which the compensation scheme met their needs. The review team submitted their report last July when Sir Kenneth said that it would be difficult to argue that the statutory scheme in Northern Ireland is ungenerous, taken as a whole. As a result, the main thrust of their recommendations is designed to re-prioritise the scheme.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00726w21.html_para2">Before addressing the report I must stress this Government's commitment to the provision of fair and equitable compensation for innocent and deserving victims of violent crime, and their particular desire to ensure proper arrangements to recognise the additional suffering of victims of terrorist violence and civil unrest in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="00726w21.html_para3">The major structural change proposed by the review team is the introduction of a tariff-based scheme with the tariff calculated on the average value of awards in Northern Ireland. This will provide a more transparent and straightforward system, and will allow claims to be settled more quickly. I have decided to accept this recommendation and extend it to apply to all claims and not just to those arising from less serious injuries, as recommended by the review. This will provide for consistency in the value of awards. The review also recommended that a tariff approach would largely make legal assistance in the making of claims unnecessary, and I have accepted this conclusion. Legal costs will therefore no longer be met by the scheme. Instead, Victim Support (NI) will be funded to provide assistance along the same lines as they currently do in GB. I have also decided that the right of appeal to the court should, in the future, no longer be necessary as part of a tariff-based scheme. The review recommended retention of court involvement for reasons which were persuasive at the time, but which should prove less so as progress is made across a range of issues on the wider political front. I therefore propose to replace it with an independent appeals tribunal, along the lines of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. This will allow appeals to be processed more quickly, with less formality, and with less potential for retraumatising victims.
<P>

<a name="00726w21.html_para4">I have also agreed changes as recommended by the review in eligibility for awards, and in exclusion from or reduction in awards. More flexible arrangements will apply under the new scheme to those claiming as a result of psychiatric illness, there will be more generous bereavement support payments to a wider group of relatives, and the current statutory time limits for lodging a claim will be replaced by a flexible approach which will allow claims to be made, in certain circumstances, long after the incident. Future cases will also be capable of being reopened for a limited period on strict medical grounds. It is also proposed to introduce a penalty points system to regulate the effect of previous criminal convictions on awards. The same provisions will also apply to convictions for terrorist offences.
<P>

<a name="00726w21.html_para5">Finally, to address the concerns raised by Sir Kenneth in his report over inadequate financial assistance to past victims of the Troubles, I am also promising a further commitment of funds from next April to take forward the implementation of his report into victims of the Troubles "We Will Remember Them". In total this will represent a substantial package aimed at alleviating the financial 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 2000 : Column: 674W</I><P>
hardships and other suffering inflicted on many by violence during the Troubles. Details of how this money will be dispersed will be announced in due course.
<P>

<a name="00726w21.html_para6">In conclusion, I have accepted some two thirds of the 64 recommendations made by Sir Kenneth and his team. I believe these decisions, which were arrived at only after lengthy consideration, represent the best way to ensure for the future a fair and equitable system of criminal injuries compensation which will recognise the suffering of innocent victims of violent crime.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pathfinder was launched by the then Defence Research Agency in 1992 in order to strengthen the industry participation in the research programme that MOD contracted from DRA. A concept study of the AVPRO EXINT pod was carried out as a Priority Pathfinder, which DERA funded from its own resources, in 1996. About &#163;39K was contributed to the study by DERA to look at the aeromedical aspects of the pod. A report was issued on the completion of the study and AVPRO subsequently put forward proposals for further work to the Ministry of Defence (MOD).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the existing procedures by which the names of new Royal Navy vessels are determined.  [131565]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w21.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The procedure for determining the names of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels is well established. Proposals are initiated by the Ships' Names and Badges Committee (SNBC), comprising representatives from the principal naval command areas. Names, reflecting an appropriate theme across all vessels of a class, are addressed early in the procurement cycle. The Committee consider a number of criteria such as promoting links with communities, the geographical spread of names and opportunities to revive names with an honourable history of service. Selected names are then submitted through Controller of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Staff to the Under Secretary of State for Defence for approval. In the case of major vessels, final approval is sought from Her Majesty the Queen.

 The term CR refers to the chemical agent Dibenzoxazepine.

CR may be deployed and authorised for use by the Armed Forces in certain special circumstances, particularly where it might enable the use of firearms to be avoided.

<P>
<a name="00726w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In common with the rest of the Defence Logistics Organisation, Defence Munitions has been set challenging savings and efficiency targets. A number of significant savings initiatives have already been delivered from the constituent parts.
<P>

<a name="00726w23.html_para0">Previous efficiency studies such as Options for Change and Front Line First have, by and large, resulted in DM Gosport in Hampshire being a net inheritor of tasks and resources. Consequently the Depot has escaped the hard root and branch reviews which other parts of Defence Munitions have been subject to. To address the efficiency issue at DM Gosport a review of work practices and Depot management structure was initiated late 1999. The Study Team identified, as a first step, business efficiencies which, if implemented, would result in reductions of up to 30 per cent. of the total number of posts of 650.
<P>

<a name="00726w23.html_para1">I was advised in February that further work was necessary. This was undertaken by a team comprising Depot staff and Trades Union representatives, which was supported by consultants to build upon the team's work, and charged with identifying the precise future optimum business processes and management structure of the Depot. This further work has now completed and indicates that post reductions in the order of 46 per cent. are possible without detriment to the output of the Depot.
<P>

<a name="00726w23.html_para2">A "without commitment" Preference Exercise carried out at the Depot has identified that the majority of redundancies would be achieved voluntarily. While the probability of job losses is always unwelcome, it is crucial that we take advantage of new business processes (such as multi-skilling, operator self inspection, exploitation of new technology, and outsourcing of a number of support functions) if we are to ensure that we are able to maximise investment on front line defence capability and continue to give best value for money to the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="00726w23.html_para3">I also hope that these changes will better place DM Gosport to win future commercial contracts for weapon processing and associated work, therefore securing job opportunities for the future.

 <i>[pursuant to the reply, 8 February 2000, c. 109-10W]:</i> A correction is required to the information given for secondments from the private sector to the Ministry of Defence for the period May 1998 to April 1999. During this period there were 20 inward secondments, not 19 as stated, as there were two secondees from Rolls-Royce for this period, not one. The corrected information is in the table.

 The list of countries eligible for debt relief under HIPC is not fixed, nor does the UK Government regard it as fixed. Any country which is eligible for concessional lending from the IMF and World Bank, which has established a track record of reform and sound programmes and which faces an unsustainable debt burden, beyond available debt relief mechanisms, can qualify for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. It is then, of course, a matter for the country itself to chose to opt for HIPC debt relief.

Definitive estimates on the number of people that have been affected by the national minimum wage are not yet available. Currently available estimates for assessing the effect draw on data from both the New Earnings Survey and the Labour Force Survey, and recognise the particular value that each survey adds to the quality and analytical details that can be provided. However, the latest adjusted estimates are mainly based on data for the Spring (March-May) 1999 Labour Force Survey. The reference period spans the implementation date for the National Minimum Wage Act on 1 April 1999. This means adjusted estimates are unlikely accurately to measure the effect of this legislation since there are employees who could have been earning below the minimum wage rates in March 1999, before the law took effect.
<BR>
The currently available estimates for March-May 1999 were published in an Office for National Statistics (ONS) First Release on 14 October 1999 and show that the number of people earning below the minimum wage rates set in April 1999 had fallen significantly between 1998 and 1999.

 All of the revenues raised from the levy will be recycled back to business through a cut in employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) and a new 'Sustainability Fund' aimed at delivering local environmental benefits. It is not possible to say precisely what the effect of the levy, the cut in employer NICs and the Sustainability Fund will be on the aggregates and construction industries, since this will depend, among other things, on future employment trends and the degree to which firms switch to recycled materials.

<P>

 The main objective of the aggregates levy is to bring about environmental benefits by making the price of aggregates better reflect their true environmental costs, and encouraging the use of recycled aggregates.
<P>

<a name="00726w27.html_para2">In addition, some of the revenues from the levy will be used for the new 'Sustainability Fund' aimed at delivering local environmental benefits to areas subject to the environmental costs of aggregates extraction. The Government will be consulting shortly on how this fund can best be used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w27.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 ENTRUST does not determine where funds generated through the landfill tax credit scheme are spent. The Government are keen to promote more spending of contributions on recycling and re-use, particularly the recycling of household waste. The Government set out in the Waste Strategy 2000 ways in which they hope to achieve this and intend to consult interested parties on these proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w27.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Funds are donated by landfill site operators to environmental bodies. ENTRUST has no part in deciding which projects receive funding. The landfill tax legislation sets out the broad categories of environmental projects that can qualify for funding.
<P>

<a name="00726w27.html_para3">As the regulator of the landfill tax credit scheme, it is ENTRUST's job to ensure that the money is properly spent by qualifying environmental bodies in ways governed by the landfill tax regulations, and that no direct benefit passes to the contributors.

<a name="00726w28.html_para0">There has been some concern that guidance on dealing with trespass by travellers needs clarifying in some respects. My right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> I can confirm that the "Setting the Boundaries: reforming the law on sex offences", report of the review of sex offences, is being published today.
<P>

<a name="00726w28.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set out the terms of reference for the review in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) on 25 January 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 80-81W. The review was asked to look at the law in England and Wales and to make recommendations that will provide clear and coherent sex offences that protect the individual, particularly children and more vulnerable people from abuse and exploitation; enable abusers to be appropriately punished; and were fair and non-discriminatory in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="00726w28.html_para7">This review was open and inclusive--it involved many stakeholders directly in its Steering Group and advisory External Reference Group, and consulted with many more at a series of conferences and seminars. It has looked at the evidence from research and the experience of law reform in other countries. The review has now completed its report to Government. It has made far-reaching recommendations to strengthen the effectiveness and protection of the law for children, raised important questions about the nature of the protection that should be offered to vulnerable people, proposed codifying and clarifying the law on consent in rape and setting the law on a fair and non-discriminatory basis for men and women whether as victim or offender. It also recommends new laws for dealing with the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation and the use of children in sexual exploitation, as well as looking at penalties and treatment.
<P>

<a name="00726w28.html_para8">The issues involved are sensitive and complex ones, on which there will be differing views. It is a long time since we have had such a thorough and comprehensive set of proposals on the law of sex offences, based on careful thought and consultation. But these proposals are just that--recommendations made to Government by a broadly based review, set up to provide the framework for further debate. The review involved many people from outside the civil service from many different groups and backgrounds, as well as civil servants from a wide range 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 2000 : Column: 699W</I><P>
of departments. Before the Government can come to a conclusion on any of them, we need further input and views on what is recommended. This is the start of a real debate on what we think the law should be and how it should be framed.
<P>

<a name="00726w28.html_para9">We would like views on all of the proposals in the report. The review has posed some specific questions, but we want reactions to all the recommendations. We would like to know how well they would work, whether they would add to the protection of the vulnerable, whether they would apply fairly, equitably and with justice and whether there would be any effects or consequences that have not yet been identified.
<P>

<a name="00726w28.html_para10">The Government particularly welcome the proposals to strengthen the law for children and vulnerable people--we have made great strides in tackling the issues of evidence for children and vulnerable people and it is time that the offences in the criminal law were revised to ensure robust and comprehensive protection for the weakest in our society. It is important to get the law right while ensuring that vulnerable people are not deterred from seeking advice from statutory authorities. We would welcome views on the proposals that relate to the protection of children and vulnerable people--what the impact and consequences of those would be. We welcome the review's clarity on the importance of the age of consent and the need to maintain it at 16.
<P>

<a name="00726w28.html_para11">The Government do not think it would be right to take a view on the proposals in the report until they have been scrutinised and tested in consultation. This report and its proposals are not an end but a beginning--the report provides a carefully argued framework for consideration by all those who are affected, personally or professionally, by these proposals. The report is being made widely available in summary and full form, both in hard copy and on the Home Office website. It is free and available on request, as is a supporting volume of evidence. The period for consultation is long--until March 2001--to give time for the full implications of the proposals to be considered. I look forward to an important social debate that will help the Government frame proposals for a safe just and tolerant society.

<a name="00726w29.html_para1">The analysis indicates, that in 1999, off-course betting expenditure was about 14.7 per cent. below the level it would have reached in the absence of the National Lottery and that, by implication, the horserace betting levy raised &#163;9-10 million less than it may otherwise have done.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> Meetings were held between the Home Office, Kent County Constabulary and the Trading Standards Authority to investigate the principle of the Kent County Council Bill and the Medway Council Bill before they were deposited. Additional meetings and telephone calls have been held between the Home Office and the solicitors representing the Kent County Constabulary. The Home Office submitted a report on the Bills and Kent Country Constabulary met any concerns.

He is confident that the Bills will enhance Kent's existing intelligence led policing and lead to increased efficiency for individual officers investigating individual crimes.

 The information requested is not available. The police do not routinely provide information on the perpetrators of the offences that they record, and for many offences the perpetrator will not be known.
<P>

<a name="00726w30.html_para6">Estimates of the proportion of offences in which alcohol is involved have come from various ad-hoc studies. The figures they give vary somewhat according to the samples of offences taken, and the methodology of the studies. Moreover, it is difficult to say whether the misuse of alcohol was the cause of an offence, or merely a contributory factor.
<P>

<a name="00726w30.html_para7">One recent study looked at arrestees in five police force areas in 1996-97. This showed that 25 per cent. tested positive for alcohol, ranging from 42 per cent. in Sunderland to eight per cent. in Manchester. The proportion of offenders arrested for violent crime, burglary, non-vehicle related thefts and criminal damage that tested positive for alcohol is shown in Table 1.

 It is currently an offence under section 169(1) of the Licensing Act 1964 for the holder of a liquor licence knowingly to allow any person to sell intoxicating liquor to a person under 18. Under the Private Member's Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), the Licensing (Young Persons) Bill, this offence will be amended to include any person who works in licensed premises in a capacity, whether paid or unpaid, which gives him authority to prevent the sale. The Bill has so far enjoyed wide support and was successful at Second Reading in the House of Lords on 14 July. We therefore hope that the extended offence will become law this year.

A good example was the launch of the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association's Partnership Initiative on 29 March this year. The Initiative is part of an ongoing industry-wide strategy to promote retailer responsibility across the licensed trade. It opens the way to direct industry involvement in crime and disorder partnerships, and will enable them to make a positive contribution to

 The Government's clearly stated aims for the Prison Service are to reduce re-offending and to protect the public. To achieve the objective of reducing re-offending the Prison Service seeks to provide constructive regimes which address offending behaviour, improve education and work skills and promote law abiding behaviour in custody and on release.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para0">The Prison Service offers three general offending behaviour programmes, Enhanced Thinking Skills, Reasoning and Rehabilitation and Problem Solving, suited to prisoners convicted of offences related to sex, drugs and violence. There is also a family of specialist programmes for sex offenders. These programmes have been accredited by an independent panel of experts as being effective in reducing re-offending. Government funding has allowed the Prison Service to double the number of accredited programmes delivered over the period 1999-2002 and to develop new programmes to address a wider range of offending behaviour, including drug related crime.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para1">Education in prison focuses on a core curriculum of basic educational skills, life and social skills and Information Technology skills. Together with opportunities to gain National Vocational Qualifications, these training opportunities enhance the prospects of a prisoner's employability.

<P>
<P>

 The purpose of education and training in prisons is to address the offending behaviour of prisoners by improving their employability and so reduce the likelihood of their re-offending on release. All prisoners, including those removed from association, in segregation units or in hospital units, should have the opportunity to participate in educational activities.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para3">Prisoners under 18 years of age must spend on average at least 30 hours per week engaged in purposeful activity, including education, training, work, physical education and offending behaviour programmes.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para4">All prisoners allocated to work undertake an induction programme which covers health and safety issues, first aid, and workshop practice.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para5">Offending Behaviour Programmes seek to address the cognitive deficits (poor thinking skills) which cause prisoners to offend in order to prevent recidivism. To be successful, they must be targeted on those prisoners who have been assessed as having the kinds of cognitive deficits which the existing programmes are seeking to address. This inevitably means that some prisoners are excluded from participation.

[133354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00726w31.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Agreement has been reached to set up a pay review body to make independent recommendations to the Government on the pay of prison governors, prison officers and related grades for the Prison Service in England and Wales. This review body would operate on the lines of the five existing review bodies which deal with 1.3 million public sector employees. Like the existing review bodies, it would have a secretariat from the independent Office of Manpower Economics.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para10">This establishment of an independent pay determination mechanism would be under the provisions of Section 128 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 as part of a comprehensive programme of improvement in prison service management.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para11">It is also my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's intention, when Parliamentary time allows, to replace Section 127 with a reserve statutory power and a voluntary industrial relations agreement. Section 127, as it stands, makes it unlawful for officers of a prison to take industrial action. The voluntary agreement which has been accepted by the Prison Governors' Association (PGA), the Prison Officers' Association (POA) and the National Executive Committee (NEC) will be put to a special POA delegates conference in August. This will mean that they have agreed not to induce, support or authorise industrial action. In recognition of this we will provide them with a new disputes procedure which will include independent arbitration. The voluntary agreement, which will be legally binding, will give my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary the power to seek injunctive relief.
<P>

<a name="00726w31.html_para12">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary intends to use the provisions of the voluntary agreement instead of those in Section 127, while awaiting Parliamentary time to effect the changes in legislation. However, it is clear on all sides that Section 127 would be used in the event of a breakdown of the agreement.
