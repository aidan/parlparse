 We have received financial plans for 2007-08 and these are now subject to final validation and sign-off with the national health service. At this stage, the figures are encouraging, with only around 6 per cent. of organisations forecasting a year end deficit, compared with 22 per cent. in 2006-07, as reported in our provisional outturn in the Department&#146;s NHS Financial Performance in Quarter Four 2006-07 report.</p>

 It is for primary care trusts to assess local health needs and commission services to meet them. The Department supports primary care trusts by funding them on the basis of their assessment of their population&#146;s health needs. Waiting lists are at a record low and falling. Guidance produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is promoting much more consistent access to cost-effective drugs and other specific interventions.</p>

This is in part due to changes in the way the data is collected and coded. For example, health visitors, district nurses, general practitioners and other professionals, who are not formally coded as public health staff, perform public health tasks. There has been growth in many of these groups. There is also variation from trust to trust in which exact roles are classed as public health. In addition, the definition of the public health specialty has been more closely defined in recent years resulting in the exclusion of groups of staff such as health visitors and school nurses who some trusts and PCTs previously included as public health staff.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had no recent discussions on this subject. The DTIs guidelines on the Meaning of R and D for Tax Purposes, 5 March 2004 already allow for expenditure on the design process to be claimed &#147;when achieving design objectives requires the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty within a project.&#148; The Government consider that the economic case has not yet been made for incentivising design more generally, outside the scope of R and D, even if the practical problems of definition and state aids could be overcome.</p>
