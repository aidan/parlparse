<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51020w01.html_spnew0"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 Improvements in access to the Parliamentary Estate for people with disabilities have been ongoing for many years. A Disability Access Audit Report was produced in April 2004 which set out the then current situation and recommended a continuing programme of improvements. Notable recent projects have included installation of ramps, such as in Star Chamber Court; installation or modification of lifts and the installation of hearing loops in Committee Rooms. There is an ongoing programme of work to improve lifts in and around the Parliamentary Estate to aid access for people with disabilities and access audits have been commissioned for each building comprising the Parliamentary Estate.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research the Government have commissioned to ascertain whether recent severe weather conditions have been due to climate change as a result of carbon emissions.  [19128]</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51020w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 An important part of DEFRA&#039;s Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre is specifically directed towards better understanding of how the frequency and intensity of severe weather events may be changing in response to changes in global climate, as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Recent research by Hadley Centre has shown for example that the European hot summer of 2003 was up to four times more likely to have happened because of the increased levels of greenhouse gases. Studies also suggest that the frequency of droughts and extreme rainfall events may increase overall in response to global warming although there will may well be local and regional variations. The effect of global warming on storminess is less clear but the Hadley Centre has recently published work indicating a significant increase in the number of severe storms over the UK as a whole since the 1950s, which may be at least partly related to global warming.

<p><a name="qn_18"><a name="51020w02.html_wqn4"><b> Ms Abbott: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the Contraction and Convergence strategy for combating climate change.  [19681]</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51020w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Certain aspects of Contraction and Convergence are appealing, including the identification of a fixed level for stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations, and comprehensive global participation. However, one key element of any future regime must be 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2005 : Column 1106W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
its workability and one particular concern with contraction and convergence is the question of how globally acceptable, and in consequence how workable, it would prove to be.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51020w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_7">First, we do not yet see evidence that other key Annex I countries are likely to support this approach. The US has already indicated that it is opposed to a per-capita approach, and as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, their inclusion will be vital if we are to solve the problem. Australia, Canada and New Zealand would also need to take on much more stringent targets under this regime. Many of the major developing countries, such as China, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil are approaching, or have passed the level that would be permissible for per-capita emissions, and would be forced to take reductions in the short-term if the scheme were implemented. They would be very unlikely to support the proposal as it would be seen as a curb on their development. Experts from these countries have shown some interest in alternative frameworks including an element of historical responsibility and capacity to act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51020w02.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_8">Second, the approach requires upfront agreement to a global stabilisation target, but many countries outside the EU are reluctant to discuss this. Logically, it would make sense to agree a stabilisation level and then from this the respective responsibility of each country would flow. However, the complexity of the issues and political reality is such that a sequential approach is unlikely. The UK is therefore pursuing a two-pronged approach&#151;pressing for agreement on a long-term stabilisation limit while simultaneously maintaining pressure on countries to take ambitious short-term action to mitigate emissions.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51020w03.html_spnew1"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The North American ruddy duck was introduced to wildfowl collections in the UK in the 1940s, from where a small number escaped from captivity and began to breed in the wild. As the UK population of wild ruddy ducks increased, so did the number of ruddy ducks on the European mainland. Hybridisation with the Spanish population of the globally threatened white-headed duck, now numbering some 2,600, is recognised as the most significant threat to that species&#039; long-term survival.

Initial research on control methods was carried out by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (Hughes, 1996) and the three year UK Ruddy Duck Control Trial, commissioned by my Department, sought to verify their findings. The report (published in July 2002, copies available in the Library of the House) indicated that eradication of ruddy ducks from the United Kingdom was feasible within 10 years, and that shooting on over wintering sites was the most effective means of control.

Since that time DEFRA has been funding additional research to refine the effectiveness of the control strategy, and to investigate the effectiveness of alternative control measures such as egg oiling and pricking. A report of the research undertaken to the end of September 2005 is due to be published imminently, and will be available in the Library of the House in due course.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51020w05.html_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Article 8 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 says that no application may be determined until 21 days have elapsed since notice of the application was displayed or served. This period is to allow people time to comment. Most householder and other minor development must be publicised by notice near the application site, or by letter to those with land adjoining it. Larger schemes should also be publicised by advertisement in local newspapers and on the authority&#039;s website. In DoE Circular 15/92, Publicity for Planning Applications&quot;, authorities are urged to do more than comply with the legal requirement. Moreover, the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires each authority to prepare Statements of Community Involvement, which should include the authority&#039;s policy for community involvement on planning applications.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">As you will know, adult participation in education and skills development can take many forms. The main LSC-funded programmes are Work Based Learning (WBL), general Further Education (FE) and Adult & Community Learning (ACL). Annex 1 attached shows how much funding has been allocated to each of our local Learning and Skills Councils for these programmes, in total, for the 2003/04 and 2004/05 years. For 2005/06, you will see that in some regions (where monetary amounts appear against the Regional Office) the details are not yet finalised. We aim to publish final information on our web site as soon as we can.</p>
</ul>

Taken together, approximate funding levels for these programmes over the 3 years are 2003&#150;04 &#163;84 million, 2004&#150;05 &#163;140 million, 2005&#150;06 &#163;196 million;</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">In addition, we provide support for learners through Additional Learning Support for specific student needs, around 40 per cent. of which is attributable to adults or, over the 3 years roughly &#163;123 million, &#163;132 million and &#163;135 million, Learner Support Funds, also provide financial support in cases of hardship and to meet childcare costs. These total &#163;80 million a year for adults. Adult Learning Grants are also being piloted in 19 LSC areas at an annual cost of &#163;12 million.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">I have not included in Annex 1, the current funding for these programmes, because this would distort the comparison between local LSCs, as some of this funding is routed to particular parts of the country where provision is available or where we are piloting.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">Annex 2 provides the participation information requested for 2003/04 and 2004/05. Figures for 2003/04 are actuals. Those for 2004/05 are estimated outturns&#151;the 2004/05 academic year is yet to finish and, particularly for adult education which is primarily made up of shorter courses, the pattern of delivery across the academic year changes from year to year, making accurate prediction of full-year outturn difficult. Local LSCs are currently talking with providers across the whole range of our programmes for the 2005/06 year. It is too early to say what levels of participation we will see, but the LSC expects to achieve the targets we have been set on delivering the Government&#039;s priorities. This will lead to shifts in the balance of provision across programmes and we do expect a reduction in adult numbers in 2005/06 as a result. Our current estimate is that this will be around 300,000 learners, a reduction of around 7 per cent. from the 2004/05 planned level.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">Regarding your question on future enrolments by over 25s in level 3 and level 4 courses, we are not able to say at this time, what the impact will be. Whilst each of our local LSCs plan provision with their providers, we don&#039;t manage providers at that level of detail. Colleges and other adult education providers will make their own decisions on the number of learners they recruit and the level of fees they may charge to meet course costs.</p>

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51020w17.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 October 2005]:</i> Information is not centrally collected on the number of specialist rehabilitation beds and no such estimate has been made of the optimum number of specialist rehabilitation beds per 1,000 people in England. The number of beds in national health service facilities varies, depending on the range and type of services they provide and the way in which the admission and discharge of patients is managed. These are matters for the NHS locally to determine, but work is in hand to scope the current provision of rehabilitation services across health and social care.

<i>[holding answer 14 October 2005]:</i> The Your Health, Your Care, Your Say consultation is a deliberative process designed to find out what the public wants from community health and social care services to meet its everyday needs. The programme includes four regional public engagement events, held in Gateshead, Leicester, London and Plymouth and a national event in Birmingham. Local health and social care communities, as well as stakeholder and voluntary organisations, are being encouraged to facilitate local public engagement events. People can also take part in the consultation by completing an on-line questionnaire at www.nhs.uk/yoursay. The estimated eventual cost of the nationally organised elements of the consultation is expected to be about &#163;1.2 million, funded from the Department&#039;s running costs budget.

 We remain deeply concerned by the reports of ongoing human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, including the mistreatment of human rights defenders and others, and take every opportunity to raise this issue with the Uzbek Government.

<a name="stpa_155">We made our most recent representation on 14 October. In a diplomatic note, passed by our Embassy in Tashkent to the Uzbek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we expressed our alarm at the reported treatment of three human rights defenders. One of these was the recently arrested Mukhtabar Tojibaeva; we have requested clarification of the charges brought against her. The Other two were Elena Urlaeva and Shavkat Madumarov. We have asked the Uzbek Government to confirm that all three are being treated in a manner compliant with international standards.

 The net additional costs of operations in Afghanistan are published each year in the MOD&#039;s Annual Report and Accounts.

However, these are subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office and final figures will be published in the MOD&#039;s Annual Report and Accounts in the autumn.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his policy is in respect of integrated project team leaders visiting bidders and potential suppliers outside the UK; and what records are kept of such visits.  [13464]</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51020w25.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has no specific policy in relation to visits by integrated project team leaders (IPTLs) to bidders or potential suppliers, regardless of their location. Visits to non-UK suppliers would be consistent with the principles of EC Public Procurement and MOD&#039;s Defence Industrial Policy, as outlined in MOD Policy Paper No. 5&#151;Defence Industrial Policy, which encourages MOD to engage with suppliers from all sectors and nations with the aim of being more transparent and inclusive from the early stages of a procurement project thus enabling potential bidders to frame bids accordingly at the outset. Importantly, IPTLs need to acquire and maintain a global understanding and expertise in the market of their particular business area to maximise opportunities and technological benefits to create a healthy and competitive environment aimed at securing the best solutions and value for money for our acquisition requirements. Decisions to visit bidders and potential suppliers, or to undertake any other visits, are based on business requirements and are in accordance with the normal departmental travel and subsistence rules. Travel and subsistence costs must be authorised and records maintained as appropriate for audit purposes.

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51020w25.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The MOD&#039;s policy is not to pay bid costs. However, it is in the interests of MOD and industry to minimise the time and costs of tendering. MOD makes every effort to do this through a well established selective tendering process aimed at choosing the tender offering the most effective solution and best value for money. The general policy includes normally inviting a maximum of six bidders, specifying tender assessment criteria designed to facilitate early decision-making and a structured selection procedure to preferred bidder&quot;. The process was recently reviewed and continues to be monitored for effectiveness. The newly formed more effective contracting initiative applies a phased approach to contractual commitment and provides for the option of early down-selection during the assessment phase.

 The focus of the UK Government&#039;s space policy is on civil and scientific uses. However, we also derive important security benefits from its military use. Like many countries, the UK uses satellites for a wide range of military functions such as secure communications, meteorological predictions, and effective monitoring of various arms control treaties.

<a name="stpa_162">Although the military use of space is integral to our security responsibilities, the UK Government have no plans to deploy weapons in space. As one of the depository states (along with the US and Russia), the UK Government continue to fully support the 1967 Outer Space treaty, which places important constraints on the use of space, including prohibiting the development of weapons of mass destruction in space and military activity on the moon and other celestial bodies.

 With the progressive introduction of competition to the majority of the Ministry of Defence&#039;s science and technology budget since 2001, the proportion of single tender work awarded to QinetiQ has diminished and will continue to do so. The NAO report The Management of Defence Research and Technology&quot; published on 10 March 2004 shows how competition will affect QinetiQ&#039;s share of the elements of the research programme that equated to applied and corporate research. QinetiQ&#039;s assured share of these elements of the research programme will decline over time, dropping to less than 10 percent. by financial year 2008&#150;09. We currently have about &#163;80 million pounds work on contract with QinetiQ through single tender action for the Department&#039;s science and technology budget over the period of financial years 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland which health trusts in the Province have commenced their own internal bank staff system; and what costs each has incurred <i>(a)</i> setting up, <i>(b)</i> staffing and <i>(c)</i> operating these systems in each of the last five years.

<p><a name="st_266"><a name="51020w29.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Bank staffing arrangements are in place across a number of services and professions across health trusts. Bank nursing systems are the most significant and widespread of these, and are in place at all trusts providing acute services. For most trusts the operation and management of bank staff systems is not readily divisible from their normal workforce management functions. Further information concerning costs of either the bank staff themselves or running such systems could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

 In response to concerns about the number of violent attacks on patients and staff, the Department issued guidance to health and personal social services employers. This guidance urged employers to regularly review the assessment of risk associated with different facilities/locations, to introduce a standard method of recording all incidents of verbal and physical abuse and to regularly train staff and ensure that the training is appropriately tailored for the different staff disciplines. Employers were also encouraged to press charges in situations where staff have been the subject of violent or abusive behaviour and to provide lone peripatetic workers with a mobile telephone and develop protocols to monitor the safety of the worker. The guidance also advised that the number of entrances to A and E departments should be restricted, particularly late at night and that limits should be placed on the number of persons, not themselves requiring treatment, given entry to an A and E department.

<p>
<a name="51020w31.html_para4">
