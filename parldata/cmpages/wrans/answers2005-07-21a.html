<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50721w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Government introduced new Dispute Resolution Regulations and Tribunal Rules of Procedure in October 2004.

 Renewable and sustainable microgeneration has the potential to make an important contribution towards the achievement of the renewable electricity generation targets set out in the Energy White Paper. The range of technologies included under the microgeneration umbrella; the different stages of their development; and the fact that the overall industry is in a formative stage makes it difficult to quantify the future costs and benefits of microgeneration.

 The principal sources of EU funding for enterprise and economic development are the European Structural Funds.

 The Government have introduced a number of measures to help working parents and parents with disabled children participate within the labour force.

<p>
<a name="50721w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_8">The Employment Act 2002 gave parents more choice and flexibility in balancing work and family life; extending the period of maternity leave and pay, introducing paid paternity and adoption leave for the first time, and providing the right to request flexible working. The scope of the flexible working law is wider for parents of disabled children, enabling requests to be made up until the child&#039;s 18th birthday. This recognises the particular challenges these parents face in balancing work and caring responsibilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50721w02.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_9">The flexible working law has been a success. Almost a quarter (22 per cent.) of those employees eligible to make a request have done so in the last two years, and over this period the proportion of requests being refused has declined by half. Due to the small proportion of employees with disabled children it is difficult to assess the specific impact on this group.

<a name="stpa_10">The Government have provided support and guidance to a number of organisations, including those who have an interest in parents of disabled children, such as Contact a Family.

 Ensuring a high quality of advice for clients is a priority for the Legal Services Commission (LSC). The LSC has developed, and is continuing to develop, a number of successful quality assessment systems, such as peer review, which are used in both civil and criminal contracts. These systems will be applied as appropriate to contracts awarded under the price competitive tendering scheme.

 Competitive tendering is one of several policy initiatives that the Government are exploring in order to achieve greater value for money across the Criminal Defence Service as a whole.

 Improving the quality of service for clients is a key objective of the Legal Services Commission (LSC). All firms wishing to bid for a contract under the price competitive tendering project will have to pass a quality assessment. Once a contract is awarded, the LSC will employ quality assurance mechanisms to monitor the quality of advice being provided throughout the term of the contract. Among those quality assurance mechanisms currently under consideration are peer review and file assessment.

 Mortality rates of mammals can only be determined from long term, intensive studies. Only two such studies exist on badgers, both in southern England (Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, and Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire). Mortality rates at these sites varies from year to year in relation to weather conditions and hence food availability. Cub mortality is thought to be relatively high, both pre-emergence from the sett, and also up to the end of the first year. At Woodchester Park, where TB status is also recorded for each animal trapped, the average mortality rates foruninfected adult animals were 30.4 per cent. for males and 23.6 per cent. for females. For the small proportion of animals which had a history of more than one positive test for TB, mortality was 66.7 per cent. and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1952W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
48.0 per cent. for males and females respectively. Overall at Woodchester, the average mortality is thought to be about 50 per cent.

<a name="stpa_65">It is important to note that these studies are in high density populations, and therefore cannot be extrapolated to the country as a whole.

<sup>(3)</sup>In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed In 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had e longer period In which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2002 is not comparable with other years.<br>

Similarly, the harbour porpoise <i>Phocoena phocoena</i> is widely distributed in all waters around the UK. The 2002 report of the Advisory Committee on Ecosystems of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ECES) estimated 36,280 harbour porpoise in south-west waters.

 As part of our overall strategy for improving sustainability and reducing the impact of climate change, the Government supports the use of energy crops for the generation of electricity and heat. Grants are available to farmers in England to plant energy crops. The single payment and &#8364;45/ha energy aid payment are also available in certain circumstances. Funding has been provided to develop supply chains throughout the UK to supply energy crops to all types of energy end-users. A UK-wide grant scheme is developing dedicated biomass heat, combined heat and power, and electricity generation projects, particularly those fuelled by energy crops. Recent changes to the rules on co-firing of biomass with fossil fuel in conventional power stations give longer timescales for the use of biomass. This makes co-firing with energy crops a more attractive option for both farmers and power generators. The Biomass Study Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, which is to report later this year, is working with stakeholders to identify the barriers to developing biomass energy and will recommend ways to overcome the problems.

 Mesh sizes have been increased progressively over a number of years. For example, the mesh size for targeting cod was 80 mm when the Common Fisheries Policy was introduced in the 1980s, was increased to 100 mm in the early 1990s and is now 120 mm in the North Sea and west of Scotland. The most significant problems for the adoption of higher mesh sizes is in mixed fisheries where fish of different sizes are caught together. European Union funding of up to 40 per cent. is available for fishermen to adopt environmentally friendly fishing methods such as more selective gear to reduce impact on fish stocks (e.g. hand lining, separator trawls, benthic release panels).

This will involve striking the right balance between public concerns about self regulation, the standards expected of veterinarians by their clients, the protection of animal welfare and the costs to both veterinary practices and individual vets.

 Attendance allowance provides a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people aged 65 or over as a result of long-term disability. The purpose of the six-month qualifying period is to establish that disability and the care needs arising from it are long-term, rather than the result of short-term or transient illness. However, the decision maker will always look at for how long care has been required when the disabled person claims the allowance or reports an increase in their care needs, and will consider whether some or all of the qualifying period had already been completed.

2.From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what research his Department has undertaken to assess the reasons for the difference between the number of people claiming carer&#039;s allowance and the number of people who are entitled to claim.  [5616]</p>








<p><a name="st_211"><a name="50721w22.html_spnew0"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 No research into this area has been possible because entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance depends upon a number of factors, one of which is that the disabled person being cared for must be in receipt of attendance allowance or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component. Entitlement to those benefits can only be reliably established after a claim has been made and the care and mobility needs of the disabled person fully assessed. As there is no means of reliably calculating the number of people receiving them as a proportion of the overall eligible population, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1996W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
it is not possible to make a realistic estimate of the number of people who, if they claimed, might be entitled to carer&#039;s allowance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many people his Department estimate have an underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance but are ineligible due to <i>(a)</i> overlapping benefit rules and <i>(b)</i> earnings above the limit.  [5617]</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="50721w22.html_spnew1"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 As at 28 February 2005, some 265,000 people who were entitled to carer&#039;s allowance were not receiving it because of the operation of the overlapping benefit rules. Carers who earn over the earnings limit are not entitled to the allowance, and thus do not retain underlying entitlement.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_129">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning what the <i>(a)</i> pay scale, <i>(b)</i> turnover in the last period for which figures are available and <i>(c)</i> required level of training is for (i) disability employment advisers, (ii) jobcentre plus personal advisers and (iii) Pathways to Work advisers. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_130">It is the policy within Jobcentre Plus (as with other parts of the Department for Work and Pensions) to collect staffing information by grade and location, not by job role. It is not, therefore, possible to provide pay or turnover information by job role. However, as all job roles upon which information is being sought are within the same civil service grade&#151;Executive Officer&#151;it is possible to provide you with information relating more generally to our staff in this grade.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_131">At 1 July 2005, the national pay scale for executive officers was &#163;17,290to &#163;22,820 (with those working in London on a slightly higher scale). A small number of senior advisers receive an additional responsibilities allowance of &#163;1,000 per annum.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_132">The national turnover rate amongst executive officers for the period June 2004 to May 2005 was 3.84 per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_133">I am able to be more specific with the information requested on training. All advisers are required to complete the basic training package; in total up to approximately 34 days learning. In 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>21 Jul 2005 : Column 2007W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>addition, disability employment advisers receive a further eight days training to equip them with the specialist advisory skills required to support the most disadvantaged disabled customers in securing work, and to work with others to encourage and support good practices in the recruitment, retention and development of disabled customers. For Pathways to Work Advisers there is an additional 18 days training.</p>

 The Department for Work and Pensions does not intend to make an assessment of the merits of providing financial assistance to companies that incur additional insurance costs because they employ disabled people. The Government do not provide funding to employers to enable them to meet their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. In fulfilling their duty to make reasonable adjustments, employers are required only to make adjustments that are reasonable for them to make given all the circumstances of the case. Factors such as the cost of the adjustment and the employer&#039;s available resources are taken into account in determining what is reasonable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50721w25.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_197">No data is held on people who have been refused employment or dismissed because employers claim that insurance costs are prohibitive. Therefore the Department for Work and Pensions has not made any estimates of the numbers of disabled people who have been affected in these circumstances. If insurance costs are prohibitive&quot; it may be unreasonable for an employer to pay the higher premium. Furthermore, an unacceptably high premium, or a refusal by an insurance company to provide cover for the disabled individual, may provide grounds for the employer to justify discriminatory action against the insurance company.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50721w25.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_198">The Department has made no estimate of the accuracy of risk assessments undertaken by insurance companies that increase premiums when disabled people are employed. The Government are not in a position to intervene in the decisions of insurance companies when determining whether or not to offer insurance. An Insurer&#039;s Guide to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&quot;, published by the Association of British Insurers includes guidance to the insurance industry on the use of relevant information and data in underwriting and we would expect insurance companies to follow this guide. The guide has been endorsed by the Disability Rights Commission which has undertaken to monitor its effects to help the industry improve its performance. The Disability Rights Commission proposes to begin research this summer.

<i>[holding answer 5 July 2005]:</i> Between 1979 and 1997 the number of people receiving incapacity benefit rose from 700,000 to 2.5 million&#151;the equivalent of an additional 2,000 inactive people every single week. However, between November 1997 and November 2004 inflows declined by around 30 per cent. This has resulted in the slowing down of the growth in the caseload since 1997. In fact in the year to February 2005 the caseload fell by 29,000&#151;a small but significant change, reflecting the success of our management of the economy and the success of our welfare to work policies.

We are already providing this support in the Pathways to Work pilots, which are doubling their recorded job entries, but we want to do even more and that&#039;s why we will be publishing a Green Paper in the autumn outlining our proposals. Our ambition is to move a million people off incapacity benefit and into work.

Notes:<br>

1.Expenditure information is on an accruals basis.<br>

2.Outturn information is available for the financial year 2002&#150;03. Data for other financial years are forecasts.<br>

3.Although statutory maternity pay is originally paid for by the employer, they are entitled to receive a reimbursement of 92 per cent. of their costs through deductions to national insurance contributions. Small employers, in addition to the 92 per cent. reimbursement, receive Small Employers Relief of 12.5 per cent. which brings their total reimbursement to 104.5 per cent. As a result the final net expenditure paid by the employer is much lower than their initial outlay.<br>

4.There is a large increase in expenditure between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 because the number of weeks a woman is entitled to claim SMP rose from 18 to 26.<br>

 The new deal has been successful in helping more than 1.3 million people into work. 577,020 people have started the new deal more than once. There are several possible reasons for this. In a dynamic, shifting labour market, it is inevitable that some people entering the new deal will return to unemployment. Equally a person may cease their involvement on the new deal because they move from jobseekers&#039; allowance on to another benefit or stop claiming at all. These people may subsequently reclaim and return to the new deal. However, the new deal is a long-term investment to make a real difference to the lives of its participants.

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fobrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

 As data on bullying is not collected centrally we do not have statistics relating to the incidence of bullying at primary or post-primary level in Essex and London. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise. However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.

<sup>(16)</sup>Pensions not included 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Price Base: Real terms.<br>

2.Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of the education formula spending settlement and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS.<br>

3.Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;19, and exclude EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those LEAs in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

4.The pupil numbers used to convert m figures to per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC 3-year-old maintained pupils and estimated 3 to 4-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5.Rounding: Per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10. Total allocation figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million.<br>

6.Status: 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

This is an essential part of putting the employer in a position where, in effect, they are able to make the purchasing decision about what training they get. Brokers, acting on behalf of the employer, will be able to source training from any LSC-approved provider, whether colleges or other providers.

Beyond that core of free training up to Level 2, employers will be able to access more comprehensive training packages to meet their wider needs, including at Level 3 and higher, and non-qualification based training. As part of the partnership between Government and the employer in raising investment in skills, we will look to employers to pay a fair contribution towards the cost of this wider training.

 Last year we worked with a balanced sample of six LEAs and about a dozen schools in each to assess the costs of implementing PPA time.

The funding settlement was welcomed by members of the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group, including all representatives of head teachers.

 The Department has not assessed the impact of excessive television watching on children&#039;s learning progress. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, has not had any meetings on this issue. However, current international research evidence points to the following:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_202">Watching good quality educational programming in the early years can benefit children&#039;s language development, in the right conditions.</p>
</ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_203">Conversely, extensive viewing of age-inappropriate or entertainment programming can hinder language development.</p>
</ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_204">In addition, television viewing before age 3 has been shown to have a modest adverse effect on cognitive outcomes at age 6 and 7.</p>
</ul>

</ul>

</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_207">Having a television in the bedroom is negatively associated with test scores for children aged 8.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_208">The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends that children watch a maximum of 2 hours of quality programming per day.

But we have not ruled out the possibility of asking Parliament to agree to a larger number if further evidence is needed for the purposes of a more reliable final assessment.

 Some correspondence has been received from the organisers of wine tasting sessions. Their main concern is whether or not wine tasting requires a licence under the Licensing Act 2003. Generally this would not be the case. Normally a wine tasting club would buy wine collectively for each wine tasting session and at the session the wine would be provided free of charge. As such, in most cases, this would be similar to a private party where one or more people club together to purchase the refreshments to be consumed. This would not be licensable. However, if a club admits non-members for a charge which entitles them to consume a certain amount of alcohol, the event would be licensable. Furthermore, if the club sells or supplies alcohol to its members for a charge, it may be necessary for the club to take advice as to whether a club premises certificate is required.

The new arrangements will take into account the disposition of appliances under an authority&#039;s Integrated Risk Management Plan, and optimise the response.

<p>
<a name="50721w49.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_341">Since July 2004 there have been two significant changes to the FRES requirement. The first is our planning assumption for the number of FRES vehicles we expect to procure. To meet the Army&#039;s requirement to replace a wide range of vehicles this assumption has been increased to around 3,500 vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50721w49.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_342">The second change is the removal of the requirement for FRES vehicles to be deployable in C-130 aircraft. This was always recognised as being challenging, and further analysis has shown that to meet it we would have to make unacceptable compromises, particularly on protection. In addition, in the timeframe in which FRES will enter service the balance of our air transport fleet will shift towards the new, more capable A400M.

<p><a name="st_470"><a name="50721w50.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence, like all UK employers, is subject to the Health and Safety Executive Noise at Work Regulations (NAWR) 1989&quot;. These require employers to take certain actions where any of their employees is likely to be exposed to noise at or above any of the three action levels set out in the Regulations. MOD procedures meet, and in many instances exceed, both these requirements and those of the Physical Agents (Noise) Directive (PA(N)D), which comes into force in February 2006. The instructions promulgated by the armed forces to their personnel are summarised as follows.

<a name="stpa_344">Under the new regulations set out in the PA(N)D, RN warships will have until 2011 to comply with the prescribed weekly and daily limits. In 2003 the RN introduced a hearing conservation programme to ensure compliance with NAWR 1989&quot;. This programme requires noise assessments to be carried out where personnel may be at risk from noise-induced hearing damage. Where such a risk is identified commanding officers are required to identify persons at risk, provide those potentially affected with information and awareness training, put in suitable control measures to mitigate this risk, which may include the provision of suitable hearing protection, and ensure that potentially affected personnel are provided with audiometry assessments at a frequency determined by the level of risk. Hearing protective equipment that is available to personnel complies with British Standards.

In addition, noise assessments are conducted to determine the level and type of hearing protection required, and any member of staff working in such an area is managed via the Hearing Conservation Programme (HCP) which includes annual audiometry testing. This concurs, and in certain areas exceeds, the recommendations made by the NAWR 1989&quot;.

 As the Government made clear in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (Cm 3999) and in the December 2003 Defence White Paper (Cm 6041&#150;1), because of the risks of proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the certainty that a number of countries will retain substantial nuclear arsenals, the UK&#039;s minimum deterrent is likely to remain a necessary element of our security.

 The purpose of project PRIME (thePortsmouth Regeneration and Investment in the Maritime Estate project) was to release part of the Portsmouth naval base estate for development. Work on PRIME has been halted after concerns emerged about the effect that proceeding with the project would have on the base&#039;s operational role. A key requirement, stated at the outset of the project, was to safeguard full operational capability of the base. After careful analysis it has been decided that the constraints that a development of this nature, in the heart of the historic dockyard, might place on operational capability outweigh the potential benefits of the scheme. Survey and technical work undertaken by the project will be fully utilised during the exploration of other options for the use of elements of the naval base estate.

 We evaluate as a matter of course the effectiveness of our programmes to promote smarter choices, such as the travelling to school initiative and the sustainable travel towns project. However, it would not be practical or cost-effective to carry out individual evaluations of research reports and good practice guides.

<sup>(49)</sup>Operators are part funded by PTEs. Where a PTE retains revenue risk, it pays the gross operating costs less the actual revenue. The subsidy figures in the table are based on the assumed revenue levels, either set out in the Franchise Agreement or based on actuals provided by the PTEs. This, however, may overstate the actual subsidy paid where it has been based on the Franchise Agreement. Actual subsidy per kilometre figures may therefore be less than stated for these operators.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Subsidy figures are stated on a cash basis and exclude any payments under the incentive regimes but include adjustments made to reflect the consequences of the Regulator&#039;s charges review. Figures in brackets show where the SRA is in receipt of payments.<br>

2.2004&#150;05 represents the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005, with the exception of Arriva Trains Northern, which is from 1 April 2004 to 11 December 2004; First North Western which is from 1 April 2004 to 11 December 2004; Northern, which is from 12 December 2004 to 31 March 2005; ScotRail which is from 1 April 2004 to 16 October 2004; and First Scot Rail, which is from 17 October 2004 to 31 March 2005.<br>

<a name="stpa_381">As the notes to this table explain, adjustments to the subsidy profile have been made to reflect the consequences of the ORR&#039;s December 2003 Access Charges Review. One of the effects of this review was to allow for some funds which would otherwise have been paid to TOCs from the SRA and then passed through to Network Rail (NR), to be paid by the SRA to NR directly. This had the effect of reducing the subsidy payments made to the TOCs (or increasing the premium payable by them).

<a name="stpa_382">The amount paid direct to Network Rail in the financial year 2004&#150;05 was around &#163;1.8 billion. Taking this direct funding into account the true subsidy per passenger kilometre for 2004&#150;05 across the network is around 6.6 pence.

 At a population level, the fluoridation of water supplies offers the most potential for reducing dental disease in children. By reforming the relevant legislation we have given strategic health authorities a realistic option of fluoridating their water, provided they can show they have the support of the local population. In addition, advice on oral health promotion is given in schools and we have piloted the Brushing for Life&quot; Scheme in areas with the highest levels of tooth decay including all Sure Start areas which do not receive fluoridated water. The scheme provides for health visitors to give packs containing a toothbrush, a tube of fluoridated toothpaste and a leaflet on oral hygiene to the parents and carers of young children when they attend child health clinics for development checks at eight months, 18 months and three years and above.

I have received a number of representations about the development of a national framework, all of which will be taken into account in its development. In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, we will consult on the official guidance and any legislation required later this year.

n/a=Population data not available.<br>

<sup>(52)</sup>2003 estimated population figures.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.The number of registrations are based on a snapshot of the Dental Practice Board&#039;s registration database taken at the end of March each year and subsequent retrospective notifications of changes to registrations have not been included.<br>

2.An active registration is a patient registered with a dentist at the end of March each year.<br>

3.Some double counting may occur in the totals when a patient has been newly registered with a dentist in one PCT, but not yet de-registered from a dentist in another PCT. These considerations contribute to some of the month-to-month fluctuations at PCT level.<br>

4.Most PDS schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of 15 months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under GDS.<br>

5.Some PDS schemes do not have any registrations, e.g. dental access centres and will not therefore be included in these figures.<br>

6.A dentist with a GDS or PDS contract may provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT.<br>

7.The Dental Practice Board has no information concerning the amount of time dedicated to NHS work by individual dentists.<br>

8.The patients&#039; registrations have been allocated to areas according to the postcode of the dentist&#039;s surgery.<br>

9.The areas have been defined using practice postcodes within the current boundaries.<br>

10.There are a small number of unallocated registrations.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.The figures are based on the numbers of dentists with open GDS or PDS contracts.<br>

2.The dentists include principals, assistants and trainees.<br>

3.Prison contracts have not been included in this analysis.<br>

4.The figures provide a snapshot of the number of individual dentists with an open contract at 31 December.<br>

5.A dentist with a GDS or PDS contract may provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT.<br>

6.The Dental Practice Board has no information concerning the amount of time dedicated to NHS work by individual dentists.<br>

7.The figures provide an accurate figure taking into account any notifications received up to 31 January 2005.<br>

8.The figures given by PCT and SHA include all dentists practising in that area.<br>

9.Some dentists may have an open GDS or PDS contract in more than one PCT or SHA and therefore they will appear in the figures for each PCT in which they practise.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.The figures given by SHA include all dentists practicing in that area. Some dentists may have an open GDS or PDS contract in more than one SHA and therefore have been counted more than once. Therefore the England figure is not a sum of SHA totals.<br>

2.Prison contracts have been excluded.<br>

3.The areas have been defined using practice postcodes within the specified areas.<br>

ePACT Data<br>

1.This information was obtained from the Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by GP practices in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions written within a GP practice but dispensed outside the primary care trust will be included in the PCT in which the GP practice is based.<br>

2.Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some BNF sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, Central Nervous System&quot; has a fair proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community&#151;these prescriptions are not included in the PACT data.<br>

<i>[holding answer 20 July 2005]:</i> The Government&#039;s policy to protect public health includes the protection of the rights, safety and wellbeing of people who participate in clinical trials that test the safety and efficacy of essential new medicines for those with disease. The Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) underpins this policy throughout the European Union by introducing a statutory basis for international standards of good clinical practice for commencing, conducting and verifying the results of clinical trials, for good manufacturing practice that provides assurance of the quality of medicines being tested, inspection against these standards and enforcement for non-compliance. Many of the requirements of the Directive were already accepted standards for governance of research in the United Kingdom before it was implemented by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.

 The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, as amended, provides for the registration of babies born dead after 24 weeks gestation and this is described as the legal age of viability. Guidance from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine introduces the concept of a threshold of viability&quot; as being from 22 to 26 weeks gestation. Although the possibility of survival of extremely pre-term babies has improved, data suggests that, even with modern intensive care, chances of survival at 22 weeks gestation are only approximately 1 per cent., whereas this increases to 26 per cent. at 24 weeks. A recent briefing paper from the British Medical Association, Abortion time limits&quot;, highlighted that gestational age is not the only factor that affects the possibility of a foetus being considered viable.

 In April 2003f the national health service security management service (NHS SMS) was created and assumed policy and operational responsibility for the management of security in the NHS, including work to tackle violence against NHS staff. In November 2003, the NHS SMS introduced a comprehensive range of measures to tackle incidences of violence against NHS staff, both proactively and reactively. The NHS SMS has begun a programme of work to identify the true nature, scale and extent of the problem. Once this work is completed, meaningful and achievable targets for delivering a secure environment for NHS staff will be set.

 The Home Secretary has not had any recent discussion with the Chief Constable or police authority of Thames Valley regarding structural reorganisation.

To inform the way forward, my right hon. Friend has commissioned Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine the issue of force structures. As well as looking at the case for structural changes, Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary will also be examining the case for greater collaboration and co-operation between forces.

 The police performance monitors published in September 2004 showed that 63.6 per cent. of police time is spent on front line policing. We expect the police service as a whole to improve the average to over 72 per cent. by 2007&#150;08. This will be a gain in time equivalent to more than 12,000 extra officers. Police authorities have set local improvement targets for their forces.

 The guidelines for completing a PSR are contained in Probation Service National Standards and in other guidance issued by the National Probation Directorate. The PSR will be informed by the CPS court papers and there will normally be at least one face-to-face interview with the offender. In all cases the Probation Service will assess likelihood of reconviction and any risk of harm posed by the offender. In the more serious or complicated cases these and other factors will be investigated through use of the Offender Assessment System (OASys&quot;). The finished PSR will take account of this and the other information obtained in its preparation and will contain a suitable sentencing proposal.

 We aim to increase educational opportunities for all offender learners and to offer opportunities which are relevant to future employability.

The new arrangements commence in three regions (the north-west, north-east and south-west), with the remaining six regions in England following in August 2006. An explicit link with mainstream post-16 education provision and a greater focus on skills will lead to greater employability on release, in order to contribute to reducing re-offending.

 On 31 May 2005 there were 2,299 juveniles aged 15 to 17 held in prison establishments in England and Wales, as recorded on the Prison Service IT system. Of these, 1,809 were sentenced juveniles held in young offenders institutions (YOI) under YOI rules. There were a further 488 remand juveniles held in prison accommodation under prison rules, and three juveniles aged 15 to 17 held under the Immigration Act. Juvenile prisoners are held separately from other young offenders in juvenile units.

<a name="50721w71.html_para3">
The number of hours that prisoners are permitted to spend out of their cells will vary across the estate. Some establishments may record in excess of 20 hours a day. This will reflect the prison&#039;s open category where the level of security is such that prisoners have the right to associate freely for most or all of the day and have broadfreedom of movement within the prison. Other establishments display considerably less time out of cell available due to the need for greater supervision and attention.

 Under their terms and conditions of employment all prison officers must comply with national policy set out in Prison Service Orders (PSOs) and Prison Service Instructions (PSIs). Policy on searching is set out in PSO 1000, which allows for female prison officers rub down search a male prisoner.

 Due to a change of computer system during 1995&#150;96 reliable data on staffing are not available prior to April 1997. At 30 June 2005, 24,180 officer grade staff (prison officers, senior officers and principal officers) were employed at public sector prison establishments (excluding Headquarters). A breakdown by each establishment is contained in the following table. Information on staffing levels within prisons managed by the private sector is not collected centrally in this form and is therefore not available.
