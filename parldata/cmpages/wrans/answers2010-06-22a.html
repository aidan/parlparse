The last period for which figures are available is for the financial year 2009-10. In that period, a dedicated family hearing centre was established within the Bradford combined court centre. As part of that scheme, a sum of £3,500 was expended in the creation of a retiring/meeting room for district judges (the overall cost of the scheme was £187,500). At York county court, additional district judge chambers were created within the existing court building at a cost of £83,020.</p>

District Judges in the civil courts usually conduct their duties in Chambers but, on occasions, will sit in open court.</p>

They will normally be provided with an office where they may undertake more confidential work such as considering applications for search warrants. Should any overnight accommodation be needed then District Judges will use commercial hotel accommodation for which they are entitled to claim reimbursement.</p>

 The Legal Services Commission does not pay independent social workers directly. They are engaged by solicitors who can claim the cost as a disbursement on account.

 It is not possible to give a precise answer to this question.

 The Government recognise the crucial support that rape crisis centres provide to victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence. The Coalition Agreement included a commitment to give such centres stable, long-term funding, and this commitment remains a priority for the Government.

No final decisions will be made until the autumn, when the results of the spending review are announced.</p>

 A person may be refused citizenship if they are unable to satisfy the requirement to be of good character. There are a variety of considerations taken into account when assessing an applicant's character for the purposes of naturalisation. If an applicant has been associated with an organisation known to have been involved in the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, this would cast doubt on their character and their application would be refused. This does not necessarily mean that these individuals have been convicted of an offence, simply that their behaviour or associations casts doubt on their good character.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 June 2010]:</i> Core Government funding to the police will be reduced by £125 million. Each force will have its core Government funding in 2010-11 reduced by the same percentage. This reduction is less than 1 per cent of expected total police spending in 2010-11.</p>

I am quite clear that this saving can be achieved by driving out wasteful spending, reducing bureaucracy and increasing efficiency in key functions, whilst leaving the frontline of policing strong and secure.

The £10 million savings package is taken from a £5 million reduction in the Metropolitan Police Services' Counter Terrorism Specific Grant and a £5 million reduction in the Counter Terrorism Specific Grant for local and regional counter terrorism capabilities. This was agreed following discussion with senior police officers to ensure that there would be no adverse impact on frontline delivery of CT policing. In 2010-11 there will be £569 million available for counter terrorism policing.</p>

 The special constabulary is an important and cost effective resource in policing. The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) is committed to supporting the special constabulary and increasing its numbers across England and Wales. The NPIA created nine regional co-ordinator posts to help police forces increase numbers and improve retention rates within their respective force areas. In particular, they are working in partnership with forces to develop effective marketing and recruitment strategies and to implement the national strategy for the special constabulary. This includes a best practice approach to the tasking and deployment of special constables.

 The Department for Communities and Local Government is drawing up plans for implementing a number of commitments contained in the coalition programme for Government, and in the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister's announcement on 'Building the Big Society', which will lead to the devolution of greater power to local communities. These include: radical reform of the planning system to give neighbourhoods far more ability to determine the shape of the places in which their inhabitants live; and the introduction of new powers to help communities save local facilities and services threatened with closure, and give communities the right to take over local state-run services. The forthcoming 'localism bill' will include new powers for communities, including greater financial autonomy to community groups, and the creation of new trusts that would make it simpler for communities to provide homes for local people.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what his most recent estimate is of the monetary value of local authority funds which will no longer be ring-fenced in 2010-11; and for what reasons changes have been made to that estimate since 24 May 2010. [3839]</p>

 The total of £1.7 billion used the latest published information for local government available prior to the announcement on 24 May of the efficiency savings to be found in 2010-11. The list of grants which will be de-ring-fenced takes account of the changes proposed by departments. The £1.7 billion also mistakenly included two grants where further work identified this funding as already providing local authorities with flexibility for local decisions on the use of that funding.</p>

The coalition agreement makes clear that Ministers want to signal a fundamental shift of power and end the era of top-down government by giving new powers to local councils. The Government will phase out the ring-fencing of grants to local government. Decisions on this will be taken in the context of the next spending review.</p>

A smaller Housing and Planning Delivery Grant (£29 million) was also included but this grant ended in 2008-09 and is therefore irrelevant to any calculations to provide a reduction in ring-fencing.</p>

 I have no plans to change the requirement for landlords to protect any deposits taken under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. The three existing schemes operate under contracts which come to an end in April 2012.

 Residential letting and managing agents are not currently subject to specific mandatory regulation, although, in common with all commercial organisations, they are bound by overarching fair trading legislation. There are three well established voluntary regulatory schemes which provide effective protection for consumers.

<i> [holding answer 16 June 2010]:</i> The Coalition Agreement sets out that the Government will phase out the ring-fencing of grants to local government. The decision by the Department of Health to end the restrictions on a number of grants, including the National Stroke Strategy, as part of the measures announced by the Chancellor on 24 May for over £6 billion of savings in 2010-11 to reduce the fiscal deficit, provides local authorities with the flexibility to continue to deliver essential frontline services.</p>

 The recent floods and landslides in Bangladesh have had tragic consequences, with thousands of people affected. The UK provides continuing support to the Government of Bangladesh for its planning and response to disasters, including £12 million to the Government's Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) (2009-14). Last month DFID facilitated a co-ordination meeting of the Bangladesh Consultative Group on Disaster Response, chaired by the Government of Bangladesh, to discuss how to respond to the needs of the flood-affected people. Local non-governmental organisations are currently responding to those needs and we continue to monitor the situation. Additional work is required to protect those at risk from further landslides.

<i> [holding answer 21 June 2010]:</i><i> </i>There is no specific measurement for 'functional illiteracy' in primary school children. However, in 2009 14% of 11-year-olds did not reach the expected level 4 or above in reading, and 32% in writing. The Government's aim is that no child who is capable of learning to read should leave primary education without a secure level of literacy. We will be seeking to strengthen the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics and encourage schools to adopt robust and well-evidenced approaches.</p>
