 Section 14 of the Coalition document confirms the Government's commitment to ending child poverty in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="100607w0001.htm_para7"><a name="1006076000071">The Child Poverty Act commits Government to meeting targets towards ending child poverty by 2020. The Government must also publish a strategy to show how they will meet these targets by March 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="100607w0001.htm_para8"><a name="1006076000072">The latest figures (2008-09) show that 2.8 million children remain in poverty, well off the target set by the previous Government of reducing this to 1.7 million by 2010-11. It is important that over the next 12 months a robust strategy be put in place to put the 2020 commitment back on track. In doing so we will want to listen to and consult a wide range of bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="100607w0001.htm_para9"><a name="1006076000074">We believe that the best way to tackle this issue is to address the root causes of poverty. It is only by doing this that we can effectively improve the outcomes for children in a sustainable way.</p>

 Eligibility for employment and support allowance is assessed using the work capability assessment. The work capability assessment focuses on the functional effects of an individual's condition on their physical and mental capabilities, rather than on the condition itself. The criteria are set out in Parts 5, 6 and Schedules 2 and 3 of the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (SI 2008 No. 794).</p>

If at this point the decision-maker determines that they no longer meet the eligibility criteria, they will be found fit for work.</p>
