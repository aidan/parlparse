To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will place in the Library details of the performance of the Integrated Casework Directorate against its four key performance indicators for each week since those performance indicators were first applied.  [101491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91213w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The four key indicators are those against which it was agreed that the recovery of the Integrated Casework Directorate's (ICD) business would be measured in the first instance. I have put in the Library a chart giving a breakdown of the weekly output in these four categories since January 1999. The categories are: general and settlement casework; asylum first decisions; asylum appeals dispatched to the Immigration Appellate Authority; and European casework. The chart shows that cumulatively the ICD first exceeded the target on week ending 22 May, and has consistently done so since 10 September.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the consistency between the absence in UK law of a public interest defence to breaches of the Official Secrets Act 1911 and <i>(a)</i> the UK's membership of the Council of Europe and <i>(b)</i> the UK's human rights obligations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91213w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 1999]:</i> I am advised that the absence of a public interest defence act in the Official Secrets Act 1911 is compatible with the United Kingdom's international obligations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what training is being given to <i>(a)</i> the police service and <i>(b)</i> the Prison Service on the implications for their work of the incorporation of the Convention on Human Rights into United Kingdom law.  [101979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91213w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Training in Human Rights issues is already included in a number of courses provided by National Police Training (NPT) including the Probationer Training Programme, when recruits to the police service are made aware of the extent and limitations of their powers as police officers. Human rights issues are also covered in the Strategic Command Course and the Accelerated Promotion Course which are delivered by NPT at Bramshill, and NPT have also held executive seminars for senior officers at Bramshill.
<P>

<a name="91213w03.html_para0">The majority of police training (about 87 per cent.) is delivered in forces. NPT is working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on an audit of ACPO policy which may identify service-wide training needs. Work is almost complete on the development of a Human Rights competency framework and further work is under way on the identification of the generic and role specific training needs of officers up to inspector. All NPT courses will be reviewed to ensure that Human Rights awareness is incorporated. Role specific training will focus on those roles, such as that of Custody Officer, which are most likely to be exposed to Human Rights issues.

 A large proportion of the costs are for reactive maintenance rather than routine preventive maintenance. This makes it difficult to finalise a firm budget until part-way through the year.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> The commitments made by WTO members, as part of the Uruguay Round, to reduce subsidised exports of agricultural products have been fully implemented.

This process will go ahead even though discussions on a wider Round of negotiations were suspended in Seattle.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> Many developing countries with concerns about TRIPS relate to their ability to implement and enforce the agreement effectively. These concerns can be addressed through capacity building and technical assistance to which the UK is committed. If we had been successful in launching a new trade Round at Seattle, other issues of concern to developing countries in particular those relating to the protection of traditional knowledge and skills and increasing the protection for geographical indications could have been included. Opportunities do, however, remain to discuss some of these issues, for example in the built-in agenda of the TRIPS Council and in the forum of the World Intellectual Property Organisation.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> The Government are working bilaterally and with a wide range of other organisations, including UNCTAD, the World Bank, ITC and the Commonwealth Secretariat, to help build the capacity of developing countries to participate effectively in WTO and the multilateral trading system. To date, the UK has committed over &#163;15 million to trade-related capacity building programmes of this type and a full list of activities has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="91213w04.html_para4">More specifically, in terms of helping developing countries participate in the WTO negotiations at Seattle, the UK has supported bilateral technical assistance programmes in Bangladesh (&#163;0.56 million), Malawi (&#163;0.25 million), South Africa (&#163;0.1 million), Zimbabwe (&#163;0.5 million) and the 14 CARICOM countries in the Caribbean (&#163;1.1 million). A project in Pakistan is currently under review. This technical assistance comprises expert technical advice, training, trade policy studies and negotiating skills and is typically provided to a broad base of stakeholders from national Governments, the private sector and civil society organisations who are involved in trade policy negotiations.
<P>

<a name="91213w04.html_para5">At the multilateral level, developing countries' participation in the WTO negotiations is being particularly supported by a major World Bank Trade Policy Development Programme (TPDP), to which the UK has committed &#163;3 million. TPDP comprises trade policy research and analytical studies; seminars on key issues for the WTO negotiations; training for trade policy officials; and a handbook for trade negotiators from developing countries.
<P>

<a name="91213w04.html_para6">In addition Commonwealth developing countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific are benefiting from the Commonwealth Trade and Investment Access Facility (TIAF), to which the UK has committed &#163;1.4 million.

office holders also have employment contracts making them "workers" for the purposes of employment law.

 There is one prime Digital Terrestrial transmitter site that covers London. This is located at Crystal Palace.

In addition, a number of broadcasters up-link their programmes material from within the London area to satellites for onward transmission, either direct to the home (e.g. for some BskyB services), or to cable head ends for subsequent distribution to the home through cable networks.

 Digital equipment is sited to deliver the best transmission and reception arrangements. For digital UHF, the higher the aerial the better the reception. Higher sited transmit antennas will also send a signal further, but with a greater potential for interference with other radio transmitters. The siting of the transmission masts and stations is a matter for local planning authorities in accordance with Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Planning Policy Guidance Note 8: Telecommunications (PPG8 revised) and circular 4/99: Planning for Telecommunications, copies of which are available from the Library of the House.

 Racal Telecom hold a number of licences which are issued by the Radiocommunications Agency, under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, to use the radio spectrum to up-link material to satellites for onward transmission from the News International building at Wapping.

<P>
<a name="91213w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 There are no plans to fit the Raven 2V frequency-hopping radio or the ROVIS digital harnesses into operational Scimitar or Sultan command vehicles. However, as part of a series of studies, my Department was provided with, free of charge, Raven radios and a ROVIS harness for trials involving Scimitar and Sultan. These trials, the result of which were shared with industry, were to improve the Department's ability to evaluate digitisation technology. As part of the partnership arrangement with industry, BAe carried out the installation and its cost is therefore not available to MOD.

 The majority of the RN's major warships are currently fitted with conventional domestic satellite equipment which provides reception while in harbour in European waters.

This type of dish will be also fitted to the third aircraft carrier, HMS Ark Royal, during her current refit at Rosyth. As there is no room to fit these dishes on the remaining major warships, an alternative system, which utilises existing satellite communications equipment, is currently being trialled. This system would allow the ship's crews to see broadcasts within about 12 hours of transmission. If the trials are successful, we plan to commence installation on board the major warships.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DU has been fired at the Kirkcudbright Range since 1982 and there is a continuing need for proof testing of the ammunition while it remains in service. Over the last 15 years, some 6350 rounds have been fired into the Solway Firth. A programme of environmental monitoring has been in place at the range since 1982. The monitoring programme has confirmed that there are only low levels of DU contamination which are well below anything that could be considered a health hazard either to those who work at the sites or those living nearby.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, in 1993 the MOD commissioned the consultants WS Atkins to conduct an independent environmental impact assessment of the firing of DU. The report of the study concluded that there was no significant risk to the public or to site personnel form air emissions from malfunctioning DU projectiles or marine food chain sources. A copy of that report has been placed in the House Library. Our own comprehensive environmental monitoring programme continues to confirm that this is still the case. The monitoring reports are all within the public domain; the most recent one was presented at a public meeting of the Dumfries and Galloway Stewartry Area Committee on 22 September 1999.</FONT></UL>

 The supply of food to our Armed Forces in the UK and overseas is contracted out. My Department does not specify the source from which our contractors should obtain beef (or any other products) but expects them to seek the best market price, whilst giving full consideration to British products. The beef currently supplied to our Armed Forces based in the UK is 100 per cent. British beef. The beef supplied for our service personnel based in Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, Kosovo and Bosnia is presently sourced primarily from Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and Brazil.

 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1999]:</i> Through its marketing and ticketing strategies, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is encouraging visitors to leave their cars and join public transport as close to their homes as possible. In addition, travel and tour operators are offering attractive travel and Dome admission packages. NMEC has parking capacity away from the Dome but close to good public transport links to North Greenwich using existing car parks where possible. When, in exceptional circumstances, NMEC is advised that parking is required for a particular VIP visit, it will be accommodated. There are no parking spaces dedicated for use by VIPs visiting the Dome.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is concerned not to affect the ongoing success of ticket sales through publication of selected statistics at this stage. Ticket sales and reservations are running ahead of expectations and, at over one million, are far outstripping advance sales for any visitor attraction anywhere in the world for 2000. I am confident that NMEC will achieve its 12 million visitor target and that the resulting income targets will also be met, enabling the project, over its lifetime, to be delivered within the &#163;758 million cash budget set for it in February 1997. I can confirm categorically that no tickets have been given away free to sponsors.

 <i>[holding answer 26 November 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company, in liaison with the Government and others, has aimed to achieve an inclusive, exciting event, embracing a wide range of people of all ages and backgrounds and with the majority from "ordinary" life, and others who have made a contribution to, or have a responsibility for some aspect of, the project. The criteria for the allocation of tickets has been framed accordingly. As NMEC announced in June 1999, up to 3,000 of the approximate 10,000 guests are being drawn from national and local newspaper competitions; other public tickets are going to Millennium Commission Award Winners and members of the public associated with Millennium Commission projects, together with residents from the London Borough of Greenwich as the "host" borough. In addition, some of the project's sponsors are running public competitions. NMEC's further press release on 4 November gave details

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> As the New Millennium Experience Company announced on 4 November, there will be a combined cast of over 900 performers using music, dance, and carnival, to move and inspire the audience within the Dome and the world-wide television audience of billions on 31 December 1999. The celebrations will start with the arrival of Her Majesty the Queen, following which the Archbishop of Canterbury will read the Lord's Prayer. The celebrations will feature Paul Daniel (Director of the English National Opera) directing an 80 piece orchestra, a mixed choir of more than 400, Jools Holland and his big band, and celebrity soloists from the worlds of popular and classical music.

<P>
<a name="91213w10.html_spnew12"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company's (NMEC) marketing, communications and commercial budget, for the Millennium Experience, which includes the costs of publicity is set out in the company's Annual Report and Financial Statements to 31 March and was published in July 1999. NMEC considers that individual components of that budget are commercially confidential and that publication of the information in the categories requested would adversely impact on the company's ability to obtain optimum value for money from future procurement of the services set out, and would adversely impact on the company's relationship with its existing contractors in those fields. In the absence of a London-wide authority, and at the invitation of relevant Government Departments, statutory authorities, and the Millennium Commission, NMEC agreed in December 1998 to take responsibility for the co-ordination and management of the Big Time event, which focuses on new year's eve celebrations in central London on and alongside the River Thames between Vauxhall Bridge and Tower Bridge and at other specific locations nearby. Big Time is supported by the Millennium Commission as part of its Millennium Festival programme and London is one of 22 cities being supported in this way. The resources for Big Time are separate from those of the Millennium Experience's &#163;758 million cash budget, but they will be accounted for by NMEC in the company's next Annual Report and Financial Statements, which will cover the period 1 April 1999 to 31 December 1999 and will be published in the new year. Details of the individual contracts relevant to Big Time are considered by NMEC to be commercially confidential.

south west of England. In the trials, benefit payments were made using plastic magnetic stripe cards, the Benefit Payment Card, instead of outdated paper-based methods of payment. This was supported by a new automated system at post offices. The trials undertaken were limited to Child Benefit and were carried out to provide experience of live running and to inform later stages of the BA/POCL project, including a full scale live trial of all aspects of the Card method of payment and the technology to support it.
<P>

<a name="91213w12.html_para1">The project, which was commissioned in 1996, suffered a series of setbacks and delays and the key milestone of a full scale live trial of the Card was not delivered. There were concerns that the project was too complex and would be undeliverable and in May 1999, the Government announced a new way forward to achieve the original objectives of the project, while simplifying it and reducing risk. Under this approach, the Benefit Payment Card element of the project was removed and, from 2003 DSS will move from paper-based methods of paying benefits to payment by automated credit transfer, a more modern, secure and efficient method of payment.
<P>

<a name="91213w12.html_para2">It was clear that the Benefit Payment Card had added substantially to the complexity of the BA/POCL project, and hence to the delay that had occurred and that its continuation could only increase the risk of further slippage to the programme. There were also increasing concerns that even if the Benefit Payment Card could have been delivered, the magnetic stripe technology on which it was based looked increasingly outdated as banks and others turned their attention increasingly to smart card technology. This, together with the combination of a three year delay to the project and the escalating trend of people opting for payment by ACT, had substantially reduced the role that the Benefit Payment Card could expect to play.

 Most students who are undertaking a full-time course of study, whether in a maintained school, college of further education or elsewhere, are not entitled to benefits as a means of supporting themselves while studying. Primary financial support for students comes from the education student support systems. However, certain students in vulnerable groups, including disabled students and students who are responsible for a child are eligible to claim Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. In addition, partners of students, who are not full-time students themselves, may claim benefits on behalf of the couple, providing they satisfy the relevant criteria.

 DFID funded a seminar last year organised by Saferworld and the South African Institute for Security Studies to consider how to tackle the proliferation of small arms in Southern Africa. The conference was attended by representatives from a number of EU countries and Governments from the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region, plus other Governments and organisations interested in small arms proliferation.
<P>

<a name="91213w14.html_para6">Participants identified a number of practical ways in which countries in Southern Africa could co-operate and how the EU might help. Participants agreed an EU/SADC regional action programme which set out four main elements for action, namely measures to combat illicit trafficking including strengthening laws and operational capacity, strengthening regulations on accumulation and transfer of arms, promoting collection and destruction of surplus arms, and enhancing transparency and information exchange on arms issues. The Programme was subsequently endorsed by EU/SADC Ministers in Vienna in November 1998.

 Available information is the average daily number of available and occupied beds by ward type for each National Health Service Trust. This is published annually in "Bed Availability and Occupancy, England", copies of which are available in the Library. However, as wards classified as "intensive care" may contain high dependency beds and general beds, we have piloted a new census focusing specifically on adult intensive care and high dependency beds. We expect to publish the results shortly.

<a name="91213w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP), also known as Factitious Illness by Proxy, is a form of abuse, usually perpetrated against a child. The term refers to a complex range of behaviours in which a person deliberately produces or feigns physical or psychological symptoms in another person who is under the individual's care. Typically the victim is a young child and the perpetrator is the child's mother.
<P>

<a name="91213w15.html_para4">We recognise that suspected cases of MSBP are among the most difficult and demanding areas of activity for paediatricians and other professional groups devoted to child care and protection.
<P>

<a name="91213w15.html_para5">The professionals involved are best placed to decide on the most appropriate means of determining whether MSBP is at issue and, if so, how to act in the best interests of the child and the carer throughout any intervention.

 The track layout at Ladbroke Grove is part of a larger scheme extending from Paddington station to past the Heathrow Airport turnoff at Airport Junction.

The works included Airport Junction and electrification on the overhead line system for Heathrow Express. Statutory approval by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) matched the stage at which the works had reached. Some of the works were approved but approval of the signalling was not completed before the accident at Southall occurred. After the Southall accident the remaining signalling approval was held in abeyance by HMRI pending the findings of the public inquiry.

 In the case of consents for crops in the farm-scale evaluation programme issued in conformity with Directive 90/220/EEC Part B (ie research and development consents), there is a requirement under the GMO legislation to make available the locations of the sites. These are held on a public register, and advertisements are placed in the local press. For crops which have approval for Part C consent (ie placing on the market), under the GMO legislation there is no requirement for companies to make the locations of these sites publicly available. At the present time, this applies to herbicide tolerant maize within the farm-scale evaluations. However, the locations of all fields within the farm-scale evaluations are notified to my Department, and the Department makes the information available to the public, including via the DETR website.

<a name="91213w19.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the reduction in carbon monoxide emissions over a 10-year period that would be achieved by replacing two 1200MW coal-fired power stations with two gas-fired power stations of the same capacity.  [101832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91213w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The amount of carbon monoxide emitted over a 10-year period will depend on a number of factors including, critically, the number of hours that the plant will operate over that time. For this reason an answer in tonnage cannot be given. We might expect, however, that a combined cycle gas turbine power station would emit approximately 5 per cent. of the carbon monoxide a similar capacity and similarly loaded coal-fired power station would. In total, power stations contribute only 1 per cent. to total carbon monoxide emissions in the UK.

<P>
<a name="91213w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is not a requirement that all trains be equipped with telephones that are operational at all times. The provision of telephones for passenger use is, along with other facilities provided on trains, a commercial matter for the train operating company concerned.
<P>

<a name="91213w19.html_para0">Most trains are fitted with radio communication systems to enable contact with signalling or control centres by train crew. In areas where the ability of radio communication systems to reliably operate is restricted or possibly not available at all, line side telephone equipment is available.

[101823]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91213w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Channel Navigation Information Service at the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Dover has not been suspended. Therefore, there have been no dangers caused to shipping as a consequence.
<P>

<a name="91213w19.html_para3">The responsibility for the safe navigation of vessels passing through or across the Dover Strait remains with the Masters of those vessels. The recently introduced mandatory reporting requirements for vessels of 300 gross tons or more is a means of assisting French and British coastguards in identifying vessels should they fail to comply with international regulations for preventing collisions at sea, specifically Rule 10 which covers the use of Traffic Separation Schemes.
<P>

<a name="91213w19.html_para4">The very brief, rare and temporary suspension of the mandatory reporting, not the Channel Navigation Information Service, following the serious collision between the Norwegian Dream and Ever Decent on 24 August 1999 did not endanger shipping within the Straits of Dover.

 The experimental rehabilitation scheme for drink drive offenders has been running since 1993 and 175 court areas are currently designated to refer offenders to courses. Research carried out for the Department has shown that those who attend a rehabilitation course are three times less likely to reoffend than those who do not. Having now been approved by both Houses of Parliament, the scheme will be made permanent and will operate throughout Great Britain from 1 January 2000. We are issuing guidance about the scheme to all course providers and to the courts, and will place a copy in the Library of both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91213w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Land Reclamation Programme (LRP) provides funding to local authorities to enable them to reclaim derelict land where there is no incentive for the private sector to undertake the task, typically because the land has no immediate prospect of development. LRP meets 100 per cent. of the approved eligible cost of approved projects because local authorities do not receive central government funding specifically for land reclamation. The widely accepted definition of local authority used for the purposes of LRP includes district, county and unitary authorities but excludes parish councils.




<P>
<P><I>13 Dec 1999 : Column: 69W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91213w20.html_para2">The vast majority of LRP projects have been promoted by local authorities within the context of an agreed land reclamation strategy for their area. They have therefore, on the whole, been large projects, which require intensive professional administration. It is unlikely that most parish councils would have the resources to manage such projects. However, a parish council can ask a borough, district or county council to champion a scheme on their behalf.
<P>

<a name="91213w20.html_para3">LRP is now administered by the Regional Development Agencies (RDA) and paid for from physical regeneration budgets.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> The circumstances whereby a crop from a GM farm-scale evaluation could enter the human or animal food chain are when it has received food and feedstuffs approval through the EU regulatory system, and where a pesticide has been applied, approval under the UK pesticide regulations. The crops will be grown in accordance with the SCIMAC guidelines which ensure segregation and identity preservation on the farm. Currently, none of the GM crops within the farm-scale evaluations have all the necessary approvals to enter the UK food or feed chain. Should any of the crops receive full clearance during the farm-scale evaluation period the produce, to ensure consumer choice can at all times be respected, would be used within identity-preserved channels. This would include any products reaching the consumer from livestock fed on such crops. The particular procedures chosen to achieve this, including labelling, would be established at the appropriate time.

 Last month my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment launched a consultation paper asking people for their views on possible solutions to the problems caused by high hedges. The consultation paper includes the report of a study, carried out by officials, which looked at the scale and nature of the problems and the effectiveness of a range of options for dealing with them. The study suggested that bringing the height of hedges under planning law might be disproportionate because it would not be targeted on hedges which were causing problems. It would also have other practical difficulties.

 The old system of registration of disabled people ended when the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 came into force on 2 December 1996. People who were registered as disabled on that date were given protection under the Act for a further three years, and into the future if they continued to meet the definition of disability contained in the Act. So employers, including the Chancellor's Departments now need to identify staff who might be covered by the employment provisions of the Act, rather than whether or not they were formerly registered as disabled. Current records show that about 4 per cent. of staff in the Treasury and Customs and 3.9 per cent. of staff in Inland Revenue have a disability as defined in the Act.

 The estimated increase in VAT revenues from road fuels resulting from a 1p per litre increase in pump prices is around &#163;50 million. However the net effect on total VAT revenues of recent increases in pump prices is likely to be small as the additional expenditure on road fuels will have been offset by reduced expenditure on other VATable products.

 There has been no such reduction. The &#163;300 million the right hon. Gentleman refers to is a full year cost for what will eventually be raised each year from this measure. It is not comparable to the first year cost shown in the 1999 Financial Statement and Budget Report.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear in his statement to the House on 23 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 179-96, and repeated on 8 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 824-26, we may spend some tens of millions of pounds. Any such expenditure would be required mainly in the DSS, Inland Revenue and Customs where the scale and complexity of their computer systems makes advance preparations critical so that we can maintain the flexibility for Britain to make any changeover as cost-effectively as possible.

The Inland Revenue's independence from Treasury Ministers in the handling of individuals' affairs must be scrupulously observed. Where disputes continue between taxpayers and the Revenue it is for the Appeal Commissioners and the courts to determine how the law is to be applied.

In 1999-2000, around &#163;40 million of this additional funding will be allocated to 57 Local Education Authorities with the highest levels of social need. The following table

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> The National Standards for Qualified Teacher Status reflect the Secretary of State's requirement for Qualified Teacher Status as set out in the DfEE Circular 4/98. The standards apply to all trainees seeking Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and should be met by those to be assessed for QTS from May 1998. Successful completion of a course or programme of initial teacher training (ITT), including employment based provision, must require the trainee to achieve all these standards. All courses must involve the assessment of all trainees against all the standards specified. Qualified Teacher Status is a requirement for all those who teach in a maintained school.

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> We recognise the vital role parents and the wider community can play in supporting children's learning. We have already introduced home-school agreements as one way of fostering a positive, forward-looking partnership between parents and teachers and recently launched a new website for parents. We also announced a "Parents Guide to the National Curriculum" to help them understand what their children are learning and how they can help. In addition, we are piloting National Curriculum topic leaflets for parents and a magazine containing practical tips and information. We also know that the family literacy and numeracy programmes we fund through local authorities can be effective in drawing into learning adults with low basic skills. This is particularly the case for parents who missed out at school, but whose concern for their children can renew interest in their own learning. This will be supported this year by &#163;6 million from the Standards Fund, increasing to &#163;7 million next year, to reach 20,000 parents and their children.
<P>

<a name="91213w24.html_para8">We are also working with others to increase parental involvement. For example, we have been working with the Community Education Development Centre (CEDC) to develop the SHARE project which supports parents in helping their children at home with reading; Parentline Plus have been looking at the feasibility of a new service for parents to help with their children's homework; and we have asked the Institute for Public Policy Research to explore further ways of developing family involvement in children's education and look more widely at extending family involvement in enrichment activities. We are working with Age Concern to extend their Trans-Age grandparent mentoring scheme to secondary schools; and the National Mentoring Network to engage older people with young people in school through mentoring and literacy programmes.
<P>

<a name="91213w24.html_para9">In the new year, the CEDC, partly funded by the DfEE, will publish practical advice to schools on how to develop as a community resource. We are also considering the recommendations in the report of the Schools Plus Policy Action Team on how activities such as study support, involving parents in their children's education, and engagement of the wider community can help reduce failure in the most disadvantaged areas.

 The Intervention Board's contract with Fibrogen is to incinerate 255,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal (MBM) from the Over-Thirty-Month-Scheme over a three year period at a total cost of some &#163;16 million. Under the terms of the contract, the Government have agreed to advance part of the gate fee payable for the incineration service. The amount involved is &#163;5.7 million, with a contingency of a further &#163;0.5 million, to meet the cost of converting the power station and to meet the Environment Agency's requirement. The cost to the taxpayer of the advance, estimated to be &#163;4 a tonne over the contract quantity of MBM, was fully considered in awarding the contract to Fibrogen. Even taking into account the cost of the advance, Fibrogen's gate fee to burn MBM is significantly below that negotiated with other incineration companies.

<a name="91213w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that the benefits of new technology are shared by the many not just the few. As a result we are working to extend our vision of Information Age Government, as set out in the "Modernising Government" White Paper, in close co-operation with the Devolved Administrations as well as local government.
<P>

<a name="91213w26.html_para0">Earlier this year we invited the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Central IT Unit and the Local Government Association to nominate representatives to act as their Information Age Government Champions (IAGC). This is the Group charged with driving forward our Information Age Government agenda across the public sector.
<P>

<a name="91213w26.html_para1">We have also established a new body, the Central Local Information Age Forum, which includes representatives from central and local government from across the whole of the United Kingdom. The Forum, which met for the first time in November, will encourage innovation and co-operation between central and local service providers and help to drive up technology standards.
