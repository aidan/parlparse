In some cases post mortem finding are also available. The following figures give the total number of tests completed and the number of complaints recorded that relate to test results. Instances when customers contact the VLA to discuss a test result or diagnosis but make no complaint are not recorded in a manor that permits analysis. In some of these cases it may be that customers are questioning a result or diagnosis but are content with the explanation given and make no complaint.

As a result of this deal, at least $1 billion a year will be freed in Nigeria, which the authorities intend to use for poverty reduction including employing an extra 120,000 teachers and putting 3.5 million children into school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51201w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">As part of the deal, the UK will cancel approximately &#163;2.8 billion and receive payments of &#163;1.66 billion. As the debts owed to the UK are denominated in a mix of currencies, these numbers may shift with exchange rates. DFID is supporting Nigeria by scaling up its assistance from &#163;70 million in 2005&#150;06 to &#163;100 million in 2007&#150;08 and encouraging the international community to increase its support to the country.

These funding streams already require universities to develop their implementation strategies in light of regional priorities. In addition, the Regional Development Agencies, who lead on the development of science cities, have their own science and innovation funding programmes, from which science cities can be supported. The Government will continue to work with the RDAs to consider how local, regional and national policies can best work together to support science cities.

an explanation of current Government policy. His comments about &quot;nanny staters&quot; were not a statement of policy. They were a personal observation made in response to a debate within the industry about, in particular, the merits of transferring the control of alcohol licensing from the licensing justices to local authorities. Mr Cunningham made the observation that if the industry allowed such an issue to divide them or to dilute their support for licensing reform, then opponents of reform could be expected to exploit that division. In referring generally to opponents of reform, Mr. Cunningham had used the expression &quot;nanny staters&quot; in his speaking notes which were subsequently handed to representatives of the trade press attending and he subsequently apologised for this use of injudicious language. Mr Cunningham did not refer to any Members of Parliament or any other individuals during the course of the conference.

 The UK does not earmark its contributions to multilateral institutions for the purpose of direct budgetary support. However, our general contributions to the European Commission, the World Bank and regional development banks are used, among other things, to finance policy based lending where resources are transferred directly to the developing country&#039;s budget. This quick-disbursing assistance is used to support policy reforms and institutional changes, either at the macro-level or in a sector or sub-sector. It helps countries implement their poverty reduction strategies and promote economic growth.

The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, chaired the Conference. My right hon. Friend, Hilary Benn was able to confirm the UK&#039;s earlier announcement of a doubling of our support for the Global Fund in 2006 and 2007 to &#163;100 million in each of these two years. The UK&#039;s pledge amounted to 10 per cent. of the US$3.7 billion pledged to the Global Fund for the two-year period by international donors, far exceeding our &#039;fair share&#039;. The amount pledged by 29 donors represents more than half of the Global Fund&#039;s total resource needs for the two-year period.

As a result of the GTT, the UK expects fundamental improvements in how the UN and international donors such as the Global Fund work together to support countries develop and lead effective responses to AIDS. To support this work, the UK doubled our contributions to the UNAIDS for the next two years.

The statement backs efforts to give people around the world better access to condoms and effective information. It advocates a comprehensive and evidenced based approach to HIV prevention including sexual and reproductive health information and services, harm reduction programmes for injecting drug users and reliable access to sexual and reproductive health commodities.

 The humanitarian situation in northern Uganda is extremely serious. 1.4 million people are living in camps for internally displaced people as a result of the conflict involving the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army (LRA). Those displaced are dependent on food aid and other humanitarian assistance. Mortality rates in the camps are high. 63 per cent. of the population in the North live below the poverty line, compared to 38 per cent. in Uganda as a whole. Although the conflict is characterised by low levels of engagement, there is a constant threat of child abduction and people live in fear of their lives.

So far in 2005&#150;06, we have already committed &#163;3 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) and are currently conducting a further assessment of need with the intention of providing additional resources to WFP and other humanitarian agencies in the next few months. As a result of recent LRA attacks, many humanitarian agencies have been forced to curtail their movement outside major towns.

Notes:<br>

Data on pharmacy numbers:<br>

From October 2002, PCTs took over responsibility for community pharmacies from health authorities. Therefore, data on the number of pharmacies in England with NHS contracts is broken down to health authority level until 2001&#150;02, and PCT level from 2002&#150;03 level onwards. The change from HAs to PCTs may have resulted in some boundary changes that is reflected in the data.<br>

Information on the number of community pharmacies is collected from PCTs via the annual PHS1 data collection. The latest data available on General Pharmaceutical Services (1993&#150;94 to 2003&#150;04) was published in January 2005 on the website www.publication.doh.gov.uk/public/sb0505.htm.<br>

Data for 2004&#150;05 is not yet available.<br>

 At the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 24 November, EU Minister agreed to reform the EU Sugar Regime. These major reforms will bring the regime into line with other sectors of the common agricultural policy which have already been through reform. They will produce significant economic benefits and put the EU in a stronger position ahead of the World Trade Organisation negotiations in Hong Kong in December. The reforms will also benefit producers in some of the world&#039;s poorest countries, which have had to compete with dumped EU sugar exports. This will open up new opportunities for them on world and regional markets.

<a name="stpa_34">We recognise the negative short-term impacts that the EU reforms will have on some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers with preferential access to the EU market.

The EU will also provide transitional assistance to help them improve their efficiency in the sugar sector where feasible or diversify into more profitable sectors.

 During the UK&#039;s presidency of the EU, we have pressed the Iranian authorities on several occasions to address the problems faced by the Baha&#039;i community. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary did so when he first met Iran&#039;s new Foreign Minister, Manuchehr Mottaki, in September. The access of Baha&#039;is in Iran to higher education is of particular concern. In 1993 the special representative of the UN Commission on Human Rights reported the existence of a 1991 memorandum from the Supreme Revolutionary Council of Iran that informed all authorities to deny Baha&#039;i students access to university. The Baha&#039;i International Community continue to report that Baha&#039;i students are not able to access higher education unless they deny their faith or accept that it is recorded incorrectly on official university forms.

The UK has been active on specific country issues. Working with the US, the UK was able to convince Libya in December 2003 to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programmes, which led to the uncovering and dismantlement of the international proliferation network run by AQ Khan and his associates. With France and Germany, supported by the office of the EU high representative, we have been working for two years to reach a long term arrangement which will give the international community objective guarantees regarding the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. While not directly involved in the 6 Party Talks on North Korea&#039;s nuclear programme, the UK has regularly expressed its support for the process as the best available means to reach a solution based on negotiation.

 A UK national must be resident at an address within an electoral area to be included in the relevant register of electors. Residence is not defined in law but it has been ruled by the courts to entail a considerable degree of permanence. In practice, Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) normally require someone to be resident at an address for four to six months of the year in order for them to be included in the electoral register. Provided the mobile home was permanently sited in a particular location for at least six months of each year and the elector could satisfy the ERO responsible for the electoral area where it was sited that he or she was resident in that mobile home during that period it is likely that the elector would be included in the relevant electoral registers and would therefore be entitled to vote there in any general or local election.

 The National Bureaucracy Adviser provides practical assistance to forces in the timely and effective implementation of their work on reducing bureaucratic burdens on police officers in order to increase the capacity of officers to undertake frontline duties.

 The main responsibility for promoting the Quality Mark to schools rests with the Basic Skills Agency&#039;s partner local authorities. Most local authorities (LAs) make the link between the Quality Mark and the school improvement agenda and self evaluation requirements. Some LAs use working for the Quality Mark award as part of the exit strategy from a period of additional support provided through the Primary National Strategy Leadership Programme or Intensifying Support Project. Local authorities also advertise the award through their own networks and communications with schools, including head teacher meetings and governor conferences. Many authorities also ensure that all their advisers are aware of the Quality Mark award and can suggest it to schools that they think will benefit when they are on school visits. The Agency publishes termly in &quot;The Times Educational Supplement&quot; the names of the schools who have gained the award and also produces print and website information about the Quality Mark.

<a name="stpa_103">On governance, in 1999, the Department established a company structure which Ufi then cleared with the Charity Commissioners. This led to the setting up of Ufi Charitable Trust (a company limited by guarantee registered as a charity) and Ufi Ltd. (a trading subsidiary, limited by shares wholly owned by the parent company). The Department and Ufi agreed the hub and centre structure for the delivery of learndirect learning as this was considered the appropriate structure at that time for ensuring that learndirect provision was responsive to local and regional skills need. The hubs and learning centres are a mix of private companies and other organisations.

 Local authorities already have a range of powers to enable them to intervene when a school is judged by Ofsted to be failing. These include appointing additional governors, appointing an interim executive board and removing the school&#039;s delegated budget. We intend to create an addition power to enable local authorities to force a weak school to join a federation with a stronger school. We also intend to strengthen local authorities&#039; existing powers to issue warning notices to schools that are badly under-performing, but which have not yet failed an inspection&#151;we want local authorities to intervene early to ensure a school&#039;s weaknesses are addressed at an earlier stage to prevent formal school failure. If a school failed satisfactorily to comply with the warning notice, the local authority would be able to use the powers of intervention described above.

<a name="stpa_105">We are also proposing a new duty on local authorities to consider radical options to secure school improvement at an early stage; and to reconsider action if the school fails to make adequate progress. We have already reduced the numbers of schools in special measures by over half since 1998, and significantly reduced the average time a school spends in special measures. We now need to ensure local authorities take swifter and more decisive action to address school failure so that all children can achieve their full potential.

 The marks required for a pupil to reach the level 4 threshold in each subject, tested at the end of Key Stage 2, is decided each year by a process, known as level-setting, designed to ensure that the level 4 standard is the same as the previous year&#039;s. The level thresholds are published each year on the QCA website. The exact number of marks varies from year to year according to the difficulty of the subject papers. The national curriculum tests have evolved over the years to reflect the curriculum, for example in 1998 mental maths was included in the key stage maths test.

<sup>(42)</sup> In 1995 the overall level was not calculated using a single level threshold. Writing and reading were combined in a two-way table (see following table) to provide an overall level.<br>

<sup>(43)</sup> In 1996 there were no separate mark allocations for reading and writing, therefore the level threshold was set for English overall.<br>

<sup>(44)</sup> In 1998, a mental mathematics element was introduced into the mathematics test. This increased the total number of marks available and therefore the level thresholds were intentionally raised in 1998.<br>

<sup>(45)</sup> In 2003, the model of English writing assessment was changed in order to normalise the distribution. The old model meant that most pupils achieved high marks, which was felt to be an inappropriate way of discriminating between levels. The new model of assessment means that the majority of the pupils are around the middle of the mark range. In order to maintain standards between the two models, the thresholds were intentionally lowered in 2003.<br>

 The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for the planning and funding of the Offenders&#039; Learning and Skills Service. The LSC is working in close partnership with the National Offender Management Service, the Prison and Probation Services, Youth Justice Board and Jobcentre Plus and other organisations to deliver our vision that offenders in custody and in the community should, according to need, have access to opportunities which enable them to gain the skills and qualifications they need to hold down a job and to play a positive role in society, so that they are less likely to reoffend. Information about its staff is an operational matter for the LSC. Mark Haysom has written to the hon. Member with further information. A copy of his reply has been placed in the Library.

 Strengthening the skills of the workforce that delivers public services is central to the Government&#039;s public service reforms.

<ul>improving the skills of workers delivering public services in the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s Priorities for Success; and whether this excludes workers delivering private services.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">The LSC&#039;s Annual Statement of Priorities identifies the key actions to be taken by the LSC in creating a more highly skilled and productive workforce. In 2004, one in five establishments (20%) reported that they employed staff that they considered not fully proficient and over 1.5 million workers are considered to be not fully proficient by their employers, representing 7% cent of the total workforce in England.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">This continues to be one of the biggest challenges for employers, and the actions within the Annual Statement of Priorities are aimed at addressing these issues in all businesses, whether private, public or voluntary. Our work with the public services sector includes workers employed directly in the sector and employees of private organisations sub contracted to the sector, for example in cleaning and catering.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">Improving the skills of workers delivering public services is a separate priority within the Annual Statement because the challenges they face are substantial in comparison with other sectors. In addition, the impact of better investment in skills on the improved delivery of services to the public, and of better targeted joint investment from the public purse are correspondingly significant.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">Our work with the sector on skills needs has identified that whilst the public sector workforce contains more Level 2 and above qualified workers than the private sector, 21% of employees are still without a first full Level 2. Based on 2003/04 Labour Force Survey data, over a million public service workers across a range of sub sectors have therefore not reached the minimum threshold for employability.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">In addition, a NIACE Skills for Life survey identified that 72% of healthcare staff have numeracy skills below Level 2 and 56% have literacy skills below Level 2. Skills for Life therefore remain a key barrier to upskilling the sector workforce and increasing the number of people with employability skills.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Dec 2005 : Column 780W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">Finally the LSC intends to enable the sector to attract and retain apprentices and new entrants in the workforce. The sector is characterised by an aged and aging demographic profile that does not match the profile of the communities that it serves. Currently, however, levels of participation in Apprenticeships are low compared to other sectors, with less than 10% of all Apprentices readily identifiable as working in public services.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">It is our intention, working across Government, to secure a joint investment plan for meeting skills needs in the sector. We will progress this work in conjunction with our range of activities detailed in the Annual Statement of Priorities that support employers and employees in any business, including the roll out of the National Employer Training Programme (NETP) which will better equip us to meet the skills needs of all employers by offering them real choice and flexibility in the training available to them.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">I hope that this information is helpful, and demonstrates the LSC&#039;s commitment to both targeted action with public services and to our broader work to address the skills needs of employees in all sectors.</p>

 The proportion of <i>(a)</i> capital and <i>(b)</i> revenue investment, in schools which have received private sector investment in the last five years, which is accounted for by private sector investment of each type, is set out as follows.

<p>

<a name="stpa_117">Except as noted, virtually all capital investment in schools over the period 2000&#150;01 to 2005&#150;06 is estimated to be publicly funded. While no records are kept centrally on local initiatives to generate private sector funding, these are believed to be small scale. Regarding the Academy programme, where the first school opened in 2002, private sector sponsors contribute up to around &#163;2 million towards an average cost of &#163;25 million. Sponsors of Voluntary Aided Schools contribute 10 per cent. towards capital costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51201w37.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">The proportion of revenue funding from private sources to all maintained schools and academies for the period 2000&#150;01 to 2005&#150;06 has been relatively constant. Accordingly, although data collection in its current form only commenced in 2002&#150;03, and figures have yet to be compiled for the current year, it is most likely that private funding will be less than 3 per cent. throughout this period. This is made up of income provided to the schools from foundation, diocese or other trust funds, business sponsorship, fund-raising activities, and voluntary contributions from parents.

 Following reviews of their staffing structures, it will be for individual schools to determine whether teachers currently holding Management Allowances meet the criteria for Teaching and Learning Responsibility payments.

 The latest information available relates to March 2004. It shows that an estimated 80 per cent. of full and part-time regular qualified teachers were still in service in 2004 after entering the maintained sector service for the first time between two and three years previously. The equivalent figure for those entering between five and six years earlier was 74 per cent; and for those entering between 10 and 11 years earlier, 60 per cent.

<a name="51201w38.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">Many teachers take a break from service at some stage and return later, and many take a break fairly early in their career. Figures show that in 2003&#150;04, 26 per cent. of all entrants were returning to service, and of these over a third had accrued less than five years service before their break. In addition to those on a break, an unknown number will be in teaching service outside of the English maintained sector.
