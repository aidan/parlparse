<a name="31210w01.html_wqn0"><B> Michael Fabricant: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House whether hon. and right hon. Members will be allowed to remain remotely connected to the parliamentary network during a Dissolution of Parliament.  [142800]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dennis Turner: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) on 27 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 129, what the change in demand for the Members' Dining Room has been since the change in sitting hours of the House.  [143580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I inadvertently gave a figure of five per cent. for the increase in demand for the Members' Dining Room since the new sitting hours came into effect. The correct figure was 0.5 per cent. based on a comparison of covers served in January-October 2003 against January-October 2002. I am grateful for this opportunity to correct the record.

<a name="31210w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Census 1911</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Carmichael: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs when he plans to release the 1911 decennial population census for England and Wales.  [141913]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The 1911 census returns, now in the custody of the National Archives, are currently closed for 100 years by Lord Chancellor's Instrument no. 12 of 1966, on the grounds that the information was supplied in strict confidence. s5(2) of the Public Records Act 1958 provides for the extension of the normal 30-year closure period in such cases. The National Archives is, therefore, currently considering ways of making the 1911 census data generally available to the public at the end of the 100 year closure period.

<a name="31210w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Legal Finance</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how much was spent on barristers' fees for criminal legal aid in 2002&#150;03; and how much of this was attributable to payments to QCs.  [141418]




<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2003 : Column 458W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Spending on barristers fees in the Crown court and above during 2002&#150;03 was &#163;317.36 million and &#163;1.4 million for assigned counsel in the magistrates court. &#163;0.4 million was also paid to counsel (both assigned and unassigned) for residual work not covered under the General Criminal Contract. It is estimated that of this amount, &#163;76 million was paid to QCs. It is not possible to give a precise figure because the type of barrister is not always recorded.

<a name="31210w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Legal Advice (Matrimonial Disputes)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_wqn4"><B> Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps the Legal Services Commission is taking to ensure adequate provision in Wales for legal advice in relation to matrimonial disputes.  [142408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 In order to ensure adequate provision of legal advice across Wales in all categories of law, including matrimonial disputes, the Legal Services Commission (LSC), the Legal Services Committee for Wales, and the local Community Legal Service Partnership monitor provision on a regular basis. Where gaps in provision are identified, the LSC can re-allocate the number of publicly funded legal matters which suppliers can start in any particular category of law, in order to meet priority needs. In addition, the LSC has just announced that solicitors in England and Wales can start an additional 20,000 legal matters by April 2004.

<a name="31210w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Supreme Court</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs whether it is his policy that the proposed Supreme Court for the UK should sit outside London on <i>(a)</i> an occasional and <i>(b)</i> a permanent basis.  [142709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 It is envisaged that the main permanent base of the Supreme Court will be in London; however, no final decision has yet been taken. That would not preclude the court sitting elsewhere in the United Kingdom from time to time when it is judged appropriate to do so.

8. <a name="31210w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales, how much money was spent by the Government on assisting small businesses in Wales in 2002&#150;03.  [142076]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Welsh Assembly Government provides financial support for small businesses. The majority of this is supplied by the WDA, which contributed more than &#163;75 million in 2002&#150;03. In addition UK Government supports small businesses through cost saving initiatives such as R&D tax credit, the improvement of the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme and raising the audit threshold for SMEs.

9. <a name="31210w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Roger Williams </B>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales, what discussions he has had with the Education Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales Government concerning the funding of higher education courses in England for students from Wales.  [142078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Welsh students are currently eligible to apply for fee remission grants to cover tuition costs and for income contingent loans for living costs. From 2004&#150;05, students will also be eligible for the new HE grant of up to &#163;1,000.

<P>
11. <a name="31210w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales, what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> the Treasury and <i>(b)</i> the National Assembly for Wales Government on the outcome of the Yvonne Watts v Bedford Health Authority case on the Treasury block grant for Wales under the Barnett formula.  [142079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 As the Government is appealing against the ruling in this case, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the final outcome of the case. However, funding for the NHS in Wales is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales, which is free to allocate resources from within the block grant as it sees fit. The Government has no current plans to review the Barnett formula which has produced fair and transparent settlements over the years.

: My right hon. Friend and I have regular discussions with Assembly Secretaries about matters affecting Wales. In June 2002, the Assembly published a comprehensive national waste strategy for Wales: "Wise about Waste". It contains challenging targets for local authorities to increase their recycling and composting of municipal waste to 40 per cent. by 2010. The Assembly has also issued guidance to local authorities to assist the development of their own municipal waste management strategies. There has been some early and encouraging progress showing significant increases in recycling and composting: for example eight authorities have reported achieving the initial 15 per cent. target for 2003&#150;04 by 2002&#150;03.

 Intense work is under way involving our partner nations and industry to enable contracts for the second tranche of Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to be placed as soon as possible. The cost to the United Kingdom is expected to be of the order of &#163;5,000 million. Under the original schedule, the contracts had been due to be placed during 2003 but the programme, including the delivery of Tranche 1 aircraft, has been subject to delay. We are determined to ensure that Industry's proposals for Tranche 2 are soundly based to deliver capability to a schedule against which the Royal Air Force can plan with confidence.

 It will be physically possible to fit and operate any weapon that has been integrated with Typhoon on any nation's Typhoon aircraft, although not all nations would necessarily have the airworthiness clearance and training to use any weapons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w02.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We currently have no requirement for Typhoon to be armed with a gun. For overall armament safety there is a Remote Position Indicator for the Master Armament Safety Switch (MASS), which removes power from all the armament systems on the aircraft, and confirms to the groundcrew, before they approach the aircraft, that the MASS has been set to safe.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w02.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Assessments have been carried out to determine the flight limitations necessitated by the thermal effects of high-speed carriage of weapons on the Eurofighter Typhoon. The merits of an internal weapons bay were assessed during the early design phase of the aircraft. However, this arrangement was rejected because the aircraft was designed primarily for the air superiority role where the rapid availability of weapons mounted on external pylons offers greater operational advantage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w02.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Typhoon's incremental acquisition strategy means that enhancements to the aircraft's capabilities will be incorporated progressively after its initial entry into service. It is too early in the Typhoon programme to consider whether a formal mid-life update for the aircraft might be needed or how it might best be achieved.

<a name="31210w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 On current plans it is expected that the RAF's Hercules C-130K aircraft will be progressively withdrawn from service from around the end of this decade to be replaced by A400M aircraft. Consequently there is no upgrade programme for the C130K fleet. However, a small number of aircraft have had their capabilities enhanced to meet the demands of recent operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This did not include upgrading of their wings.

The RMAS have also been given the opportunity under the Acquisition programme to compete for a package of work similar in scope to their current portfolio.

No further discussions on this matter have taken place either with public or private sector bodies.

 The Government have great sympathy for the pension scheme members who have suffered pension losses due to their insolvent company's scheme winding up underfunded. These cases have highlighted the need for urgent action so that their situation can be avoided in the future.

The amounts payable from the NIF are subject to statutory upper limits. In addition, the Pensions Act 1995 requires salary-related schemes to meet the Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR), and provides for a statutory priority order for the distribution of a scheme's assets if a scheme, that is required to meet the MFR, winds up.

 The Pensions Schemes Registry (PSR), administered by the Occupational Pension Schemes Regulatory Authority (OPRA), holds information on the number of final salary schemes which are currently in the winding-up process and the number of schemes which have entered and completed winding-up. The registry database is, however, limited in a number of ways as described in the footnote. Consequently, it does not provide all the information requested, though it nevertheless remains the most comprehensive source of information available on the aggregate number of pension schemes in the UK.
<P>

<a name="31210w04.html_para3">According to the PSR's most recent data, around 1,400 private sector final salary schemes were in the winding-up process at the beginning of September, and 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2003 : Column 471W</I><P>
around 4,800 private sector final salary schemes have completed winding-up. The data does not permit any further analysis on whether these schemes have commenced/completed winding-up prior to 1997 or 1995.
<P>

<a name="31210w04.html_para4">It is not possible to split the above by whether they are connected to a solvent or insolvent employer. No alternative data source exists to provide this information. Also, the information collected does not facilitate analysis by region or constituency. As regards estimating the value of pensions lost (due to winding-up), this is also fraught with numerous difficulties. The extent of loss depends on many different factors&#151;such as the maturity of the scheme (that is, the age profile and retirement status of members), and the funding position before starting winding-up. The latter in turn is highly sensitive to investment decisions and conditions in the financial markets. With no information to draw on at an aggregate level, we are unable to comment on the extent of scheme under-funding and losses arising from wind-up. The PSR, as mentioned, was not designed originally for the purposes of such analysis, and therefore does not provide information on scheme funding positions and costs.

<P>
<a name="31210w04.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Pensions Act 1995 makes provision for the payment of compensation to trust-based occupational pension schemes in cases of dishonesty. The compensation scheme should provide some help where the sponsoring employer is insolvent and the value of the scheme assets has been reduced as a result of dishonesty.
<P>

<a name="31210w04.html_para5">There is legislation currently in place that provides that, when a salary-related occupational pension scheme winds up, any deficiency in the pension fund

becomes a debt on the employer. The Government have issued draft regulations designed to strengthen this protection. They state that where a scheme is wound up and the sponsoring employer is solvent, the employer should ensure that there are sufficient funds in the scheme to meet the full costs of the rights accrued by scheme members, unless doing so would put the company itself at risk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w04.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The current legislation which applies when a defined benefit occupational pension scheme winds up does not differentiate between accrued pension rights that have been transferred into a scheme, and other accrued rights that are already in the scheme. We have no plans to alter this position.
<P>

<a name="31210w04.html_para8">We have announced a package of measures to protect all members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes when their employer becomes insolvent. These include the introduction of the Pension Protection Fund and refinements to the priority order.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans the Government have to reduce the time taken to wind up final salary pension schemes.  [142386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w04.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 In April 2002, we introduced legislation to speed up the time taken to wind up pension schemes. Trustees are required to make regular progress reports to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra). Opra can direct that action is taken by those responsible if it considers that the winding up is being unreasonably delayed. Other people involved in running the scheme are required to tell Opra if there are no trustees so that consideration can be given to appointing a trustee. And trustees can apply to Opra for an order to modify the scheme so that it can be wound up.
<P>

<a name="31210w04.html_para9">In addition, there will be proposals in the recently announced Pensions Bill for the introduction of a more hands-on role for the new Pensions Regulator which will be based on risk analysis. This approach will further facilitate the winding up of schemes and will provide welcome support for trustees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w04.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government have not carried out studies into the use of annuities when a final-salary scheme is in wind-up. When a pension scheme is in wind-up, its trustees seek to discharge the scheme's liabilities, using annuities to secure pensioners' incomes.

 Evidence from the English House Condition Survey indicates that there are around 700,000 oil fired domestic heating installations in England.
<P>

<a name="31210w06.html_para0">Part J of the Building Regulations covers the pollution risks associated with the installation of domestic oil fired central heating. Ways of meeting the requirement are conveyed in Approved Document J (2002) and include compliance with BS 5410 (1997 amended 2001): Code of Practice for Oil Firing&#151;Part 1: installations up to 45 kW output capacity for space heating and hot water supply purposes, providing secondary containment where a risk assessment indicates this is necessary, and labelling storage systems with what to do if an oil spill occurs. BS 5410 refers to BS 799 Part 5 (1987) : Specification for oil tanks for steel tanks and to the industry (OFTEC) standard OFS T100 (1995) Polyethylene oil storage tanks and bunds for distillate fuels. OFTEC has since published OFS T200 as their specification for steel tanks.
<P>

<a name="31210w06.html_para1">The Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001, SI 2001:2954 provide minimum standards for domestic tanks where the storage capacity is in excess of 3,500 litres. There are no other regulations specifically covering the prevention of oil pollution from oil leakages arising from the operation of domestic oil fired central heating systems. However, it is a statutory offence to cause or knowingly permit the pollution of "controlled waters" (which includes ground and surface waters) under the Water Resources Act 1991.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No. The model used by the Boundary Committee looks at the "cost of being in business"&#151;that is, the recurring costs that an authority must incur regardless of the level of service that it provides. Other costs and savings that will result from re-organisation are heavily dependent on the policy decisions of the elected representatives of individual councils and cannot, therefore, be used for modelling purposes without making assumptions about the decisions that will be taken by authorities that have yet to be created. The cost of being in business, being less dependent on such assumptions, provides a sounder basis on which to make comparisons.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w06.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to collect centrally the costs of any reorganisation of local government; and if he will make a statement.  [142225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It is too early to say what the cost of and potential long-term savings from reorganisation might be. It will depend ultimately on the pattern of unitary authorities introduced following referendums and on decisions that the new unitary authorities take about their organisational structure. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will discuss how any costs will be funded with local authorities and the Local Government Association nearer the time.

 The nine market renewal pathfinders are each required to submit a strategic scheme to outline their proposals on how they plan to spend the Housing Market Renewal fund that they are bidding for and address the issues of low demand. These schemes are assessed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in negotiation with the pathfinder and independently scrutinised by the Audit. Following successful negotiations and a satisfactory report from the Audit Commission the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will allocate a proportion of the Housing Market Renewal Fund to a scheme.
<P>

<a name="31210w06.html_para4">&#163;125 million has already been allocated to the Manchester Salford pathfinder for implementation of its scheme over the next two and a half years.

The main points on which my right hon.

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> The Government are wholly behind Modern Apprenticeships as a high quality work-based learning option for young people. We are fully committed to implementing the reforms recommended by the Modern Apprenticeships Advisory Committee under Sir John Cassels, which included a major boost to the marketing of MAs, and to more recent Skills Strategy announcements. Under Sir Roy Gardner a business-led Modern Apprenticeship Task Force is taking a key role in promoting MA to employers and thereby contributing to increased take-up. We have adopted a PSA target for 2004 of 28 per cent. of young people entering a Modern Apprenticeship before the age of 22. We have made sufficient resources available to ensure that we meet this target and are on course to achieve it.

<P>
<a name="31210w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The regular rotation of audit partners plays an important role in upholding auditor independence. The Government welcomed the recommendation by the Coordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues (CGAA) last January to reduce the timescale for the rotation of the lead audit partner from seven to five years. The professional audit bodies implemented the recommendation immediately through revised guidance. They pointed out that audit firms would incur some costs in terms of familiarisation and planning (which would vary according to size of firm) in moving to the new five year cycle, but agreed with the CGAA that, as the requirements only relate to firms that are auditing listed and public interest entities, the benefits in terms of safeguarding auditor independence from the client outweighed any such transitional costs.

Improvements in energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewables in generation will both be important in achieving this objective. The White Paper sets an objective to double the recent rate of improvement in energy efficiency and an aspiration to achieve a 20 per cent. share for renewables in 2020, double the level of the Renewables Obligation set for 2010.

 To date, the Government have committed &#163;117 million to support early offshore windfarm development. No estimate has been made of the level of funding that may be needed to support future development in this area, but we expect industry to respond to the market for wind turbines created by the Renewables Obligation.

 The Government have set a target that 10 per cent. of electricity in the UK should come from renewable sources by 2010. However, no targets have been set for individual technologies, such as wind power. Decisions on which technologies to bring forward are left to the industry, consistent with the 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2003 : Column 491W</I><P>
Government's policy of an open and competitive energy market. We expect the industry to respond to the market for renewables (including wind) created by the Renewables Obligation.
<P>

<a name="31210w09.html_para3">However, it is acknowledged that electricity generated from wind turbines&#151; both onshore and offshore&#151;will make the largest contribution to the overall target. While we do not publish technology forecasts, it is estimated that to supply 7 to 8 per cent. of our electricity generation by wind turbines by 2010, which is what is likely to be required to achieve our 10 per cent. target, would require in the range of 3,000 to 5,000 turbines, assuming a mix of onshore and offshore devices. There are currently just over a thousand turbines within the UK.

 Responses to the British Crime Survey (BCS) on confidence in Nottinghamshire indicate that confidence in bringing offenders to justice has fallen from 36 per cent. in 2001/2002 to 28 per cent. in 2002&#150;03.

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 11 November that the Government have decided to begin the process of introducing a national identity cards scheme following the consultation paper published in July 2002.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para5">The Government are determined to ensure that the development of a national identity cards scheme is managed to the highest standards, and that the major business change and IT challenges which we face are dealt with effectively. A Programme Board has been established, chaired by the Home Office, to co-ordinate and drive forward the different elements of the identity cards scheme. Progress at every stage will be monitored and reviewed as further decisions are taken during the implementation. Before decisions are taken on implementation, there will be an intensive phase of feasibility assessment and prototyping so that decision making is soundly based and risks in the programme are kept to a minimum. Once the Office of Government 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2003 : Column 498W</I><P>
Commerce (OGC) has confirmed that the programme is ready to proceed, by means of an OGC Gateway Zero review, we will publish draft legislation to enable the scheme to be introduced.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para6">Set up costs for the first three years have been estimated at &#163;186 million. Costs thereafter will be covered by charges. It would not be appropriate to publish more detailed information while we prepare options for procurement and implementation of the identity cards scheme. However, we are continuing to work with potential suppliers and partners to ensure estimates are accurate, realistic and deliverable.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para7">An identity card scheme will provide a number of benefits including to help deter and prevent illegal immigration and illegal working and to combat identity fraud enhancing our capability to counter terrorism and serious and organised crime. Identity cards will make it easier to prove entitlement to public services and faster to prove one's own identity for public or private transactions, enabling individuals to assert their identity and that they belong here as well as protecting an individual's own identity from identity fraud.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2003]:</i> The powers and responsibilities of each devolved Administration are governed by the Acts of Parliament which established them and by any relevant Transfer of Functions Orders and post devolution Acts.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para8">It is intended that the draft Identity Cards Bill will include enabling powers so that in the future access to specified public services could be linked to the production of a valid identity card. In the case of services for which the devolved Administrations are responsible, decisions on whether the identity card should be required for access to these services would be a matter for them.

 The same legal restrictions apply to the publication of pornographic material on-line as they do off-line.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para10">The Obscene Publications Act 1959 makes it an offence to publish any article which is considered to be obscene; that is, an article which, in the view of the court, tends to "deprave and corrupt" a person likely to see, hear or read it. The Act has been successfully applied to material published via the internet although enforcement is more difficult because the publisher or website operator is frequently based abroad and beyond UK jurisdiction. In addition, the taking, making, distribution, possession or publication of indecent photographs or pseudo photographs of children are all serious criminal offences.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para11">Given the nature of the internet, we believe that it is not possible to prevent children under the age of 18 having access to pornographic internet websites by legislative means. However, there are ways of reducing the risk of children accessing such material by practical measures and raising awareness.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para12">For example, a wide range of filtering software packages have been developed to enable schools and parents to restrict the types of websites to which their children have access. The Task Force on Child Protection on the internet, a multi-agency group which was established in March 2001, has set up a sub-group on rating and filtering, to consider how to evaluate and provide advice in the long term on filtering and other safety software products. The sub-group has made an initial report to the Task Force and will report again in due course.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para13">At the beginning of the year, the Task Force published a single document covering separate models of good practice aimed at providers of chat services, instant messaging and web services, including providers of adult content. We consider that these models are a significant step forward in making the internet a safer place for children. As far as we know they are unique. They are voluntary but were presented to the industry with a strong recommendation that they be used. We are confident that they will be supported, by the major service providers represented on the Task Force and by the Internet Service Providers Association. The effectiveness of the models will be evaluated.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para14">The Task Force has also run two successful public awareness campaigns highlighting both the huge benefits that the internet has to offer and the potential risks particularly to children of giving out personal information online.
<P>

<a name="31210w11.html_para15">The Government are determined to deal with paedophile activity vigorously, and in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 we have introduced, among other child protection measures, new offences relating to a person showing a child sexual material. Section 12 makes it an offence to cause a child, for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification, to look at an image of a person engaging in sexual activity. It carries a maximum penalty on indictment of 10 years imprisonment.

 The Home Office continues to monitor the effectiveness of the arrangements that already exist for the referral by police forces of victims to Victim Support at local level.

The organisation is currently updating its volunteer strategy and as part of our general monitoring of Victim Support's work we will be discussing this strategy with them. The Home Office is, of course, keen to encourage people to become more active in their communities and volunteering with Victim Support is one of the many ways in which they can do this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many female deaths in England and Wales have been attributable to the abortion pill RU486 since 1990.  [141562]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w12.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 There were eight maternal deaths associated with termination of pregnancy reported to the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths for the period 1991&#150;99. None of these deaths were attributable to Mifegyne (also known as RU486). The data for 2000&#150;02 are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="31210w12.html_para5">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is responsible for medicines regulation in the United Kingdom, and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) receive reports of suspected adverse drug reactions to medicinal products via the Yellow Card Scheme. Since marketing authorisation was first granted in 1991, the MHRA and CSM have received two reports of fatal suspected reactions in association with use of Mifegyne. However, the reporting of a suspected adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug was responsible. Many factors, such as the medical condition that is being treated, other pre-existing illnesses or other medications might have contributed.

<sup>(8)</sup> Strokes defined as deaths with an underlying cause of cerebrovascular disease. These were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 430&#150;438 for the years 1998 to 2000 and, for the years 2001 and 2002, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes 160&#150;169.<P>

<sup>(10)</sup> Figures are for deaths which occurred in each calendar year.<P>

<P>

<sup>(11)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for strokes in this year and 2002 are not comparable with data for earlier years. The interpretation of international coding rules in ICD-10, compared with the rules used in ICD-9, has led to an apparent increase in the number of deaths coded to strokes of 13 per cent. for males and 9 per cent. for females. The figures should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the major changes to mortality statistics in ICD-10 compared with ICD-9 were described in a report published in May 2002*.<P>

<P>
<a name="31210w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The abstention rate for the Referendum was high with participation at only 20.04 per cent. Our assessment, based on discussion with Colombian election officials and international observers, is that the security situation played its part, particularly in the more remote and more conflict-ridden areas of Colombia, where despite a state security presence the participation rate was below national average. The complexity of the questions on which citizens were being asked to vote also caused a reluctance to vote.
<P>

<a name="31210w15.html_para4">The elections had a better turnout of 50.49 per cent. This was about average for Colombian elections. The turnout for the Congressional elections and Presidential elections in 2002 were 42 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively.

 When the "oil-for-food" scheme was launched in December 1996, the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) received 30 per cent. of the proceeds of Iraq's oil sales, allowing it to make regular compensation payments to successful claimants. This percentage was reduced to 25 per cent. pursuant to Security Council resolution 1330 (2000). On 22 May 2003 the Security Council adopted resolution 1483 (2003), which reduced the percentage of revenue from Iraqi oil sales to be paid into the Compensation Fund to 5 per cent. The total amount paid in compensation to victims of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait to date is over US$17.5 billion.

<P>
<a name="31210w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Where traffic management schemes require traffic regulation orders under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 the Local Authorities' Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England and Wales) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2489) apply to the making of such orders. Regulation 6 sets out who an order making authority should consult in particular cases. Otherwise it is a matter for authorities as democratically elected bodies to decide whom to consult in taking schemes forward. We have no current plans to amend the 1996 procedure regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the adequacy of the safety rules governing the use of bicycle rickshaws used on public roads; how many bicycle rickshaws are in use in London; what licensing and insurance rules exist to enable bicycle rickshaws to carry passengers; and what safeguards exist for the general public who hail bicycle rickshaws.  [142899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Bicycle rickshaws or pedicabs must comply with the Highway Code, road traffic laws, construction and use and road vehicle lighting regulations. We believe these are sufficient as principal measures for safeguarding public safety. Licensing of pedicabs to carry passengers is the responsibility of Transport for London, who we understand are looking at the issue. The numbers of pedicabs used in London is unknown.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on how many occasions in the last full year for which figures are available the DVLA initiated court proceedings against people who were believed not have paid vehicle excise duty; on how many occasions the DVLA <i>(a)</i> withdrew proceedings and <i>(b)</i> lost a case in court because the vehicle keeper showed that he or she had paid VED; how much the DVLA estimates such

 During the year 2002&#150;03, a total of 231,149 prosecutions were taken by DVLA against people who were believed not to have paid vehicle excise duty.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para0">Proceedings were withdrawn on 18,255 occasions and 1,303 cases were unsuccessful at court. Cases are withdrawn for a variety of reasons, but less than 1 per cent. are as a result of a licence being in force at the time.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para1">DVLA estimates that the cost of taking each case to court is &#163;45 and requests this amount at every successful prosecution. Last year the agency was awarded &#163;9.4 million in costs by the courts.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para2">DVLA already takes every opportunity to avoid unnecessary court action. In most cases of alleged unlicensed use of a vehicle, a letter is sent to the registered keeper offering to settle the matter out of court. This also provides the opportunity to produce evidence that vehicle excise duty has already been paid. In addition, procedures have recently been introduced to barcode the licensing transaction at Post Offices. This allows DVLA's records to be updated within three days of the application, thus reducing the risk of inappropriate enforcement action.

<P>
<a name="31210w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 DVLA's Medical Advisers do on occasions ask drivers to undergo driving assessments in order to help determine their fitness to drive. Referrals are only made to driving assessment centres which are members of the Forum of Disabled Drivers Assessment and Mobility Centres. Such Centres are experienced at assessing drivers with medical conditions and specifically assess the impact of medical conditions upon driving behaviour and whether performance can be enhanced by either tuition or vehicle modification. For these reasons, DVLA prefers to use disability assessment centres rather than ask individuals to take a standard 'pass or fail' driving test. However, if an individual has particular problems in attending at an assessment centre, the Agency is able to refer the individual for a formal driving test with the Driving Standards Agency.

 Comprehensive information on concentrations of air pollutants in England between 1985 and 1995 is available from the Air Quality Archive at www.airquality.co.uk. The following table shows, for urban and rural air monitoring site sin England, the average number of days for the years between 1985 and 1995 on which levels of any one of a basket of five pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, fine particles and sulphur dioxide) were 'moderate or higher' according to the Air Pollution Information Service bandings. These data are the headline air quality indicator, one of 15 headline indicators of sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para4">Data are missing for some years because there were, at that time, not enough air monitoring sites operating to provide data on all pollutants. Data for 2002 for England are available at www.sustainable-development. gov.uk/indicators/regional/2002/h10.htm and for 1987&#150; 2003 for the UK at http://www.defra.gov.uk./news/2003/030508a.htm.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para5">When the indicator was established in 1998, the back time series was constructed from results from an increasing set of monitoring sites as the network (particularly the urban network) was developed. Research demonstrated that the increasing number of sites used in the indicator in fact had little effect on the overall trend produced. However, caution should be taken when comparing data for the early years of the urban network, as the number of sites was much lower than present that could have resulted in a lower number 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2003 : Column 521W</I><P>
of exceedences being detected. The number of urban sites increased from three in 1992 to 35&#150;40 from 1998 onwards, while the number of rural sites has remained fairly constant since it started.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para6">The table also shows average concentrations of black smoke and sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the UK between 1985 and 1995. These two combustion-generated pollutants are also a good indicator of average air quality for the years in question.
<P>

<a name="31210w17.html_para7">There is no clear trend in the average number of days of 'moderate' or 'higher' air pollution between 1985 and 1995. There is annual variability due mainly to differences in weather conditions from year to year. Data since 1995 show a long-term improvement in the number of days of 'moderate' or 'higher' air pollution as a result mainly of reduced emissions from road vehicles, electricity production and industry. There is an improving trend in average UK concentrations of black smoke and sulphur dioxide between 1985 and 1995, which have almost halved.

 The National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (available on-line http://www.naei.org.uk/) compiles annual air pollutant emissions for the United Kingdom. The most recent year for which emissions have been calculated is 2001. Emissions of four known or probable human carcinogens are calculated: benzene, 1,3-butadiene, benzo[a]pyrene and dioxins. Table 1 shows the national annual emissions since 1997 taken from the National Atmospheric Emission Inventory.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Department has no plans to evaluate the impact on efficacy of culling of the use of anaesthesia in badger setts prior to lethal gassing. The gassing of badgers has been discounted as a culling option because it is considered to be inhumane.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for how long mycobacterium bovis bacilli can survive in badger setts.  [141394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not known precisely how long M. bovis (the causative organism of bovine tuberculosis) may survive in badger setts. The organism is killed by exposure to ultra violet light and extremes of temperature and humidity, as well as the growth of other bacteria and fungi. The lack of light and relatively constant temperature and humidity conditions found inside a badger sett would favour the survival of M. bovis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what predictions were made, in explanatory material made available to farmers by her Department as to the percentage of badgers which were to be killed by culling teams engaged in the Krebs trials.  [141993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In their first report, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, reported that informal estimates suggested a capture rate of up to 80 per cent. could be expected using cage traps alone. Information made available to farmers by leaflet, refers to "Proactive culling as many badgers as possible from a whole area (about 80 per cent.)" based, in part, on post-culling assessments of trapping efficiency. These assessments were based on field signs and are therefore largely

subjective. They are, however, carried out by experienced personnel and give a useful indication of the extent of badger population reduction in proactively culled areas.

<a name="31210w18.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what information she has collated on whether significant damage is caused by badgers to ground nesting birds.  [142460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Badgers are known to predate on ground nesting birds, although such predation is likely to be largely opportunistic. The impact of badger predation on bird populations has not been specifically quantified, but is not thought to significantly affect populations nationally. Locally, however, the situation may be different.
<P>

<a name="31210w18.html_para0">Bird remains are typically found in about 7.5 per cent. of badger dung in the U.K., and diet studies confirm that badgers eat eggs, nestlings and adult birds. These studies are unable to distinguish between scavenged and killed birds, and do not quantify the importance of birds in the badger diet.
<P>

<a name="31210w18.html_para1">Defra is currently funding research aimed at providing a scientifically vigorous assessment of the importance of badger predation for ground nesting birds. The project involves a review of current knowledge and intensive field investigations to assess to extent of predation by badgers. The project, which is being undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory, will report its findings in March 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the welfare implications are for badgers infected with TB; at what stage in the disease they suffer; and how long that suffering can last.  [142461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In a study by the Central Science Laboratory and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, TB as a cause of death accounted for less than 7 per cent. of badgers found dead. It is difficult to make objective assessment of whether these animals suffer. Typically, individuals may live for many months or even years while infected, showing no overt signs of clinical illness and maintaining normal body weights. Infected female badgers often give birth and successfully rear litters. However, post mortem findings where advanced pathological changes have occurred, particularly in the lungs, indicate that during the final stages of disease there would undoubtedly be an effect on the quality of life of such an animal. This stage is thought to last for a few weeks at most.

<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The information requested is as follows.
<P>

<a name="31210w18.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> It has at times been difficult for MAFF/Defra to carry out reactive culling in response to a herd breakdown as quickly as the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) anticipated its First Report. Resource limitations, including difficulties inherent in the recruitment and retention of appropriately skilled staff, have played a part. Difficulties became apparent in 2002 when, in effect, the impact of the suspension of TB testing in 2001 due to foot and mouth disease meant that two years1 worth of breakdown notifications required reactive culling, alongside the servicing of culling in the proactive areas. Defra has worked hard since FMD to meet the ISG's expectations both in terms of the time between breakdown and culling, and the number of operations completed. The ISG has helped by making some pragmatic decisions by assisting with priorities and by setting realistic, yet challenging, targets which Defra has either met or exceeded.

<P>

 Professor Bourne wrote to the then Parliamentary Secretary (Commons), Mr. Morley, on 9 May 2003 enclosing a number of reports including one reviewing the implementation of the reactive strategy in the randomised badger culling trial. This pointed out that clearance of the TB testing backlog, caused by the suspension of testing during the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak, had overwhelmed culture facilities and contributed to delays in the notification of TB herd breakdowns that triggered reactive culling operations. The paper brought the concerns of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB to the Minister's attention but concentrated on advising the Department on what it could do to improve notification and reactive response times.

<P>

<sup>(19)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her recent decision to end badger culling as a means of countering TB in cattle.  [143118]<P>

<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2003]:</i> The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) was appointed by Ministers in 1998 to design and oversee a large-scale field trial, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), aimed at evaluating badger culling as a means to reduce the incidence of cattle TB. The trial involves three experimental treatments: (i) proactive culling, which aims to reduce badger densities to very low levels across entire trial areas, (ii) reactive culling, which seeks to remove only those badgers geographically close to recent cattle TB outbreaks on particular premises, and (iii) no culling (survey only).
<P>

<a name="31210w18.html_para12">The ISG has advised Ministers that its interim analysis of trial data so far indicates that there has been a 27 per cent. increase in the number of cases of bovine TB (breakdowns) in cattle herds occurring in reactive culling areas compared to the related survey-only areas (where no badger culling took place). The culling of badgers in reactive treatment areas of the RBCT was suspended from 4 November, because of the risk that a further three months of culling would cause additional TB breakdowns.
<P>

<a name="31210w18.html_para13">On the advice of the ISO, operations will continue in proactive areas because the data for these areas does not yet yield a statistically significant result. The survey-only (control) areas will also continue to be monitored.
<P>

<a name="31210w18.html_para14">This is a significant step forward in the development of a strategy to control bovine TB. Although we have now effectively ruled out small-scale, reactive culling of badgers, it gives us and the industry a greater impetus to focus our attention on other measures, such as the development of an improved diagnostic test, improved biosecurity and husbandry, and the development of a vaccine.

 Defra has produced a concise list of disease prevention measures (including the need to always know the health status of animals being bought or moved) in the form of a yellow card which was developed with livestock industry representatives and vets. It was sent to all livestock farmers in 2002, and is available on the Defra website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what effect delays in obtaining TB culture tests results have had on the reactive cull trial.  [142336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w18.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In the majority of cases TB infection would have been confirmed on gross pathology, in abattoirs, by the presence of visible lesions, so culture results are of significance in only the non-visible lesion cases which were positive to the tuberculin test. Delays in culture results will have contributed in part to delays in the notification process but administrative and logistical delays, including the no cull period, would have a greater significance.

Farmers may then use any eligible land at their disposal in support of an annual claim for payment against their entitlements. Eligibility for the payment will not be dependent on any farming activity other than keeping all agricultural land on the claimant's holding in good agricultural and environmental condition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the basis was of her decision to recommend to the European Commission on 27 November a national plan rather than an emissions limit value approach on the Large Combustion Plant Directive.  [141322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 4 December 2003]:</i> The Government's decision to submit a national plan to the Commission was in order to keep the option open. The Directive requires that any national plan is submitted to the European Commission by 27 November 2003. The Government considers that further analysis is required before taking a decision which implementation approach it is in the UK's interest to adopt. The UK can withdraw the plan if further analysis suggests that the emission limits approach is in the UK's best interest. A decision on whether to withdraw the national plan would be taken before spring 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which of the two options under the Large Combustion Plant Directive other European countries have opted for; what discussions she has had with the Department of Trade and Industry on the option that fits most constructively with their energy policy; and what inquiries she has undertaken to determine the effects of implementing a national plan approach on UK energy jobs during the period in which further analysis on the two approaches is completed.  [141324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2003]:</i> In addition to the UK, Ireland have submitted a national plan to the European Commission, and that several other Member States are likely to submit national plans.
<P>

<a name="31210w19.html_para0">Government decisions on implementing the Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC) were reached following extensive contacts with all Departments having an interest in the issue. Both approaches are compatible with the Government's energy policy, but this is an area where we expect to undertake more analysis; for example, on issues surrounding security of supply.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w19.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clapham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the sensitivities associated with each option under the Large Combustion Plant Directive referred to in the press statement her Department issued on 27 November are; and if she will make a statement.  [141325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31210w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government have decided to look further into whether there is a different impact on the coal industry resulting from the emission limits approach to that from the national plan approach method of implementing the revised Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC) for plants first licensed before July 1987. In addition there is a possible direct sensitivity to other policies, for example in connection with the UK's implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, and the effect of the decision on the security of energy supplies.

 The lead in the matter of the strike action had been taken by the Minister of State, who had several meetings with the Prison Officers Association. I have been kept fully informed of events but have not been directly involved in meetings with the union representatives.

 Following notification of closure at Saintfield Yarns, the Department for Employment and Learning's Ballynahinch JobCentre offered to the company its job brokerage service and a full range of advisory services relating to training opportunities, redundancy payments and benefit entitlement. This took place over two days on the employer's premises and approximately 100 employees availed of the service. Representatives of the Social Security Agency, Invest NI, Enterprise Ulster, and local training organisations were also involved.

<P>

<a name="31210w20.html_para2">The Department has received 168 applications for Redundancy and Insolvency payments from former employees. These claims are being verified and processed and all eligible applicants are likely to receive a redundancy payment before Christmas. It is also anticipated that all claims for benefit will be processed within the same timescale.
