<i> [holding answer 26 October 2009]:</i> The dataset 'Children in Families in Receipt of Out-of-work Benefits' is currently used as a proxy to measure child poverty at the local level. This dataset is the basis for indicator 116 in the National Indicator Set, used by local government and its partners.

The revised indicator will be the proportion of children living in families in receipt of out-of-work benefits or working families whose income is below 60 per cent. of median income. This will provide information on both in-work and out-of-work poverty in the local area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="91027w0002.htm_para5"><a name="09102775000334">The data will also be available at both local authority and ward level. It will be produced annually. Data will shortly be available for 2006 and 2007.</p>

 The Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) takes very seriously its responsibility to stop illegal drugs entering establishments. Visitors, staff and others are required to undergo a rub-down search, and items brought into prisons are subject to a Rapiscan search. A passive drugs dog is used to screen visitors to prisoners before admission to the visits room. Prisoners entering or leaving the visits room are subject to either a rub-down or full search; the latter requires removal of clothing. CCTV operates in all visits rooms, and includes the use of new CCTV equipment at Maghaberry. Supervisory staff patrol the visits room with modern, discreet communication links to the CCTV operator. Searching takes place regularly throughout establishments including active search dogs trained to detect secreted drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="91027w0003.htm_para4"><a name="09102775000445">This year NIPS introduced new procedures for management of prisoners' private cash. Co-operation between NIPS and PSNI has increased with a better flow of intelligence and targeted searching of visitors and accommodation areas. Revised Prison Rules will be introduced by the year end to facilitate mandatory drug testing of all prisoners using new saliva testing procedures to replace the current urine test. Governors will have delegated authority to ban visitors and impose closed visits on prisoners and visitors who abuse the visiting arrangements.</p>

Cross compliance protects a variety of habitat features and in future will place greater emphasis on protecting water resources and water quality.

<i>  [holding answer 26 October 2009]:</i> The Ministry of Defence takes its responsibilities towards the environment very seriously. Prior to Exercise Joint Warrior, the Royal Navy consulted widely with interested parties such as non-governmental organisations, local authorities, various national rural agencies, and landowners. During the planning of the exercise, environmental impact assessments were conducted for all potentially damaging activities. All participants were given extensive briefs on safety and environmental considerations which specified that environmental awareness takes priority over military training objectives, and a precautionary approach is adopted to all aspects of the exercise which may have an environmental impact. Ships remain ready to take immediate action to minimise any risk. Before any active sonar transmissions, a full environmental impact assessment is conducted, look-outs are posted, and equipment is used to listen for marine mammal activity. If marine mammals are detected sonar transmissions are terminated or modified in order to minimise the risk. There are also continual monitoring procedures that ensure compliance with international pollution prevention standards and crews are also trained to manage onboard incidents to minimise environmental impacts. No environmental impact has been reported following the most recent Joint Warrior exercise.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 October 2009]:</i> Under schedule 7 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 the increases in the business rates multipliers each year are capped by the previous September's RPI. Under the same legislation, the multipliers will also be adjusted to ensure that the overall tax yield does not increase as a result of the 2010 revaluation. The September 2009 RPI of -1.4 per cent will exert a downward pressure on the multipliers and on 2010-11 rates bills, reducing the overall tax yield in cash terms.</p>

 The Government&#146;s national policy on residential parking is set out in Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing (2006) and Planning Policy Guidance 13: Transport (2001). PPG13 is clear that local authority policies in preparing their development plans should set maximum levels of parking for broad classes of development, including residential and non-residential development, and that there should be no minimum standards for development, other than parking for disabled people. PPS3 asks local authorities to develop residential parking policies for their areas taking account of expected levels of car ownership, the importance of promoting good design and the need to use land efficiently. This has been deliberately devolved to local authorities so they can make the right choices for their local areas, in consultation with their local communities.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 October 2009]: </i>The UK remains deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Burma. It is evident from the latest Report to the General Assembly by the UN Rapporteur, Mr. Tomas Ojea Quintana, that systematic and appalling abuses remain unchecked and that arbitrary arrests and the sentencing of opposition figures to long prison terms continues.</p>

EU sanctions have been in place against Burma since 1996, but following the sentence imposed on Aung San Suu Kyi on 11 August this year, the EU agreed to a further set of sanctions intended specifically to target the Burmese regime&#146;s economic interests, including a travel ban on those members of the judiciary responsible for the verdict.</p>

Their objective is to target those individuals and entities that are most closely linked to the regime&#146;s misrule, rather than punishing the Burmese population as a whole.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="2"><sup>(1 )</sup>There appears to be a shortfall of data from Milton Keynes General Hospital Trust in 2006-07. The figure for this year should therefore be treated with caution.<br>
<sup>(2 )</sup>Provisional information.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
 1. Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
 2. Alcohol-related admissions<br>
 The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
 Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
 Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
 Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
 Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
 Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing&#146;s syndrome (E24.4)<br>
 Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
 Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
 Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
 Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
 Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
 Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
 3. Ungrossed data<br>
 Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
 4. Finished admission episodes<br>
 A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
 5. Data quality<br>
 Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 6. Assessing growth through time<br>
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
 Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
 Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 7. Assignment of episodes to years<br>
 Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>

 Any person who wishes to receive national health service primary medical services can apply to a local general practice to register as a patient or as a temporary resident. However, under their contracts with their primary care trust the general practice can, where they have reasonable non-discriminatory grounds, decline an application, for example if they are not accepting new patients or because the prospective patient does not live within the practice boundary. Where an application is declined, the general practice must nevertheless provide as a term of their contracts any immediately necessary treatment for a period of up to 14 days free of charge.</p>

Illegal immigrants are therefore subject to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended, which set out a number of exemption from charge categories. Illegal immigrants are not exempt from charges except for certain services that are free to all, including treatment given inside an accident and emergency department or for certain infectious diseases.</p>

Further, treatment that is clinically considered urgent enough that it cannot await the patient's return home, must also be provided, although hospitals should attempt to secure payment during the period before treatment is provided. Non-urgent treatment that can await the person's return home should not be given unless payment is received in advance.</p>

1. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care collects and publishes data relating to the number of social workers directly employed by social services departments within councils with social services responsibilities.<br>
2. The information supplied is the number of social workers employed by the City of Leeds social services department. This has been calculated using the same definitions as that: used for the performance indicators which formed part of the &#147;performance assessment framework&#148; (PAF) and was last published by the former Commission for Social Care Inspection in 2007-08. PAF has now been replaced by the national indicator set but there are no comparable equivalent indicators.<br>
3. &#147;Social Workers&#148;, includes team leaders/managers, assistant team managers/senior social workers, care managers, field social workers and child protection, family placement and juvenile/youth justice workers working in children&#146;s services. Councils employ social workers in other roles. These may have social work qualifications and registration with the General Social Care Council, but not be classified as &#147;social workers with children&#148; in the return.<br>
4. Data on the number of staff employed by local authorities in social services departments in England are collected annually by The Information Centre for health and social care by means of form SSDS001; prior to 2005 the data were collected by the Department.<br>
5. The data presented are for whole-time equivalent staff.<br>
6. The latest date for which data are available is 30 September 2008; data for 30 September 2009 for England are expected to be published in spring 2010.<br>

 The United Kingdom has made clear that it wishes to see global emissions reductions consistent with limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius. The UK has committed to reducing its emission by 80 per cent. on 1990 levels by 2050. This is consistent with the EU's commitment to reduce its emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2020. The EU is prepared to increase this to a 30 per cent. reduction in the context of a global agreement in Copenhagen, provided the other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities. In this context the UK is calling for developed countries to set mid-term emissions reduction targets that, collectively, would reduce developed country emissions by 25-40 per cent. on 1990 levels; and is calling for developing countries to take significant action to reduce their emissions growth by 15-30 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2020. The UK has made these representations in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, other international forums including the Major Economies Forum, G8 and G20, and in bilateral contacts.</p>

 Since 1998 when antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) were introduced we have introduced a wide range of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour. These measures are being used by practitioners to bring relief to communities across the country. Local agencies decide on the most appropriate intervention to use in each case. The overall aim is to tackle antisocial behaviour at the earliest opportunity with the most appropriate tool.</p>

crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) concerns. Since 2002 we have invested over &#163;1 billion to ensure that there is now a neighbourhood policing team in every neighbourhood, including over 13,500 officers and 16,000 PCSOs, with a range of tools and powers to deal with ASB. These teams engage with their local communities to understand their concerns&#151;which will usually include ASB&#151;and work with partners to address them. Between March 2008 and March 2009 public confidence that police and local agencies are dealing with local crime and ASB matters has increased from 45 per cent. to 49 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"><a name="91027w0018.htm_para0"><a name="091027102000537">In December 2008, we introduced the policing pledge, which outlines commitments that the police service have made to the public, including minimum response times, holding monthly meetings to understand local concerns, providing monthly updates on action taken to deal with those concerns and visiting victims of crime. I welcome the recent inspection by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) of the delivery of the pledge, in each police force ensuring that the public know how well their force is doing. Police authorities and forces are now working to respond to the challenge this has set them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="91027w0018.htm_para1"><a name="091027102000538">The Government are clear that there is more to be done. On 13 October I announced a package of measures to improve the collective response to ASB. This includes extra support for victims of antisocial behaviour and a crackdown on those that breach ASBOs and new local minimum service standards agreed with the public that outline what they should expect from councils, police and social landlords to deal with intimidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_489"><a name="91027w0018.htm_para2"><a name="091027102000539">In 62 priority CDRPs, support and advice will be provided from a Home Office regional delivery manager, supported by the ASB action squad of expert practitioners, to make sure that the police, councils and housing are working together effectively to tackle ASB. All 62 partnerships have had face to face meetings, five partnerships have already been visited to begin the assessment process and the remaining 57 are due to be visited in the next six weeks.</p>

 Breach of an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) is a criminal offence. Currently whenever a child is in court convicted of a criminal offence, the court must consider making a parenting order where the court's assessment is that this is in the interests of preventing a repetition of antisocial behaviour by the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"><a name="91027w0018.htm_para4"><a name="091027102000543">We are proposing to bring in legislation to make a parenting order mandatory when a child (aged 10 to 15) breaches an ASBO. In tandem with this we are also proposing that children being considered for an ASBO receive a parenting needs assessment.</p>

 The national DNA database (NDNAD) is constantly changing as profiles are added and deleted. It is not possible to produce information retrospectively on the state of the database in past years, unless this was collected by statistics produced at the time. The information sought on the number of those on the NDNAD by the ethnicity, gender and age groups specified is available for 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008 and is provided in table 1. Some information is also available for 31 March 2007, and is provided in table 2. The information sought is not available for years before 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="91027w0019.htm_para3"><a name="091027102000824">The tables show the number of profiles held, which is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because some profiles are replicates i.e. more than one profile is held for one individual. This may occur if, for example, an individual gives different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests. As at 31 March 2009, the replication rate on the NDNAD as a whole was 13.5 per cent. The tables show data on profiles loaded by all police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="91027w0019.htm_para4"><a name="091027102000825">It is not possible to calculate accurately the proportion of members of ethnic groups in the population as a whole who are on the NDNAD because the data held on the NDNAD are not directly comparable with census population data. The NDNAD does not hold self-reported ethnicity data on arrested persons who have a DNA sample taken, but on their &#145;ethnic appearance&#146;. The ethnic appearance data is based on the judgment of the police officer and is recorded for police intelligence purposes to assist in subsequent identification. It uses six broad ethnic categories (plus &#145;unknown&#146;) whereas census data is based on 16 ethnic groups self-reported by individuals.</p>

 Government policy is that English and Welsh police forces should not hold profiles of children under 10 on the national DNA database (NDNAD). Following the announcement of this policy on 16 December 2008, profiles of all those who were under 10 at the time a DNA sample was taken from them were removed, regardless of whether their current age was under or over 10. The national DNA database is regularly monitored to confirm that this policy remains in effect.</p>

 Since the merger of the Home Office Identity Cards programme and the UK Passport Service to create the Identity and Passport Service on 1 April 2006, projects to deliver passports including facial images and fingerprints, identity cards and other improvements have been necessarily combined. As much of the technology and operational processes needed to implement identity cards are also required for the implementation of these new passports, this is the most cost-effective way to deliver these initiatives.</p>

The work is accounted for as future development projects. Total spend since April 2006 to September 2009 on future development projects encompassing the NIS is &#163;216 million. The spend on future development projects in the 2006-07 financial year amounted to &#163;30.9 million. The costs accounted for as future development projects in the 2007-08 financial year were &#163;61.7 million, &#163;81.5 million in 2008-09 and approximately &#163;42 million for the period April to September 2009.</p>

 There are two types of sponsorship payments for academies: &#147;Traditional Procurement&#148; and &#147;Endowment Model&#148;. In the case of &#147;Traditional Procurement Academies&#148;, the timing of the receipt of cash sponsorship varies from academy to academy and is agreed as part of the funding agreement between the Department and the academy. In the case of the &#147;Endowment Model&#148;, receipts commence only after the academy has opened, and usually over a period of five years.

The second table, headed &#147;Endowment Sponsorship Academies&#148; shows for each academy where sponsorship is in the form of contributions to an endowment fund, the amounts pledged, the amounts reported so far to the Department as received and the amount still expected. As with the first category, there may be cases where further sponsorship has already been received by the academy trust but not yet reported to the Department.</p>

 Local authorities have discretion to provide financial support. There is no requirement for a local authority to provide financial support to an individual family. However, where an assessment of a person's need for financial support is made and it is decided that a person has such needs, the local authority must decide whether to provide the support and in making this decision they must act in accordance with regulations and must act reasonably.

 Clause 44 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill (as amended in Lords Committee (previously clause 43)) is intended to enable local authorities to support young people, particularly the most vulnerable, in securing a suitable learning place in which they can thrive and achieve. It gives local authorities powers to require institutions within the FE sector to provide a specified young person, aged 16-19, with education suitable to their requirements. This will be particularly important within the context of the forthcoming raised participation age in supporting young people to fulfil their duties to participate.</p>

 Parties attending employment tribunals are not required to have representation, legal or otherwise and if they wish to use a representative it is a matter for them, and there is no requirement for the representative to be legally qualified. However, all businesses who represent claimant parties in employment tribunals must be authorised under the Compensation Act 2006, (unless they are exempted), and are required to comply with strict rules of conduct which includes a requirement that they are competent to provide the claims management service. The impact of regulation has been independently assessed on an annual basis since regulation commenced in April 2007. The latest report concluded that in the employment sector</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) drew up an action plan in response to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman's 22 recommendations following Mr. Baranovsky's death in 2006 at HMP Rye Hill. 18 of the recommendations have been fully addressed, including those to do with further investigations. The remaining four were referred to Primecare, the healthcare provider at the time of Mr. Baranovsky's death, who have failed to respond. Following the death, the contract with Primecare was terminated.</p>

 Information held centrally by the Ministry of Justice combines offences under Section 107 of the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act with other similar offences under that Act. It is therefore not possible to provide prosecutions and convictions specifically under Section 107.</p>

 Section 26 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 deals with &#147;Release of certain long-term prisoners under Criminal Justice Act 1991&#148;. This was expected to have an impact on the prison population, and the impact was included in the projections of prison population published in September 2008 and August 2009.

After then the impact gradually reduces by around 100 per year to 2012, and then reduces more slowly to around 40 by 2015.

 Transfers of prisoners between prisons take place daily for a variety of reasons and for varying lengths of time. Reasons may include, for example, temporary moves on compassionate grounds; or to allow visits to take place; or to take part in particular regime activities. Information on the number and reasons for every temporary transfer of a prisoner is not recorded centrally. On 20 October 2009, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Mr. Straw) made a statement to the House asking Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of prisons to work with the Ministry of Justice director of analytical services to investigate whether any temporary transfer of prisoners had occurred before an inspection by Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of prisons. The results of this investigation will be made available in due course.</p>

 The Small Business Finance Forum (SBFF) is an important means through which Ministers can engage with key representatives of the small business community and banks to facilitate better and more effective communication on finance issues. Business representatives have recognised the impact that the forum has had in improving relations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_661"><a name="91027w0031.htm_para10"><a name="091027102003130">Key achievements of the SBFF include the agreement of the Statement of Principles and the formation of the SME monitoring panel. The Statement of Principles defines how banks and their small business customers will work together, and aims to establish the right relationship from the start and outline how banks will help if companies get into difficulties, The SME monitoring panel was set up to monitor bank lending and initiate a constructive dialogue with individual lenders on the availability, risk and overall cost of lending. The panel reports monthly to Ministers.</p>
