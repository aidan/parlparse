 For the 2006-07 reporting period, District Policing Partnerships (DPPs) carried out a self-assessment of their effectiveness against the targets set out in the DPP Monitoring Framework. The targets for DPPs reflect their statutory functions, as set out in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. I will write to the hon. Gentleman with details of those DPPs who did not achieve set targets. The Northern Ireland Policing Board recognises the importance of DPP effectiveness and was pleased that the 2006-07 assessment found the majority of targets set were met by most DPPs. The Board reviewed the performance management system for DPPs, and introduced a new effectiveness framework in April 2008.</p>

Had the Government simply uprated the duty in line with inflation then all motorists would have to pay &#163;200 in 2009. Therefore, all cars purchased prior to 2001 will pay no more in real terms in 2009 than in 1997. The single VED band meant that all car owners were taxed the same amount, regardless of the type of car that they drive. By introducing and then reforming graduated VED since 2001, the Government have made the system less regressive, as well as ensuring that the most polluting cars pay more than the least polluting.</p>

 The possibility of the small hive beetle arriving in the UK is a recognised threat to the health of honey bees and the National Bee Unit remains vigilant for the arrival of this and other exotic pests and diseases. To promote early detection, publicity material has been distributed to help raise individual beekeepers&#146; awareness of the risk. Plant health import inspectors and horticultural marketing inspectors have also been alerted, as one possible entry pathway is imported fruit. To help mitigate this threat, DEFRA has developed a contingency plan in consultation with stakeholders and is also pressing the European Commission to introduce tighter contingency arrangements to reduce the risk of spread should the small hive beetle be introduced into another member state.

The findings of these studies are in the final report of the Independent Scientific Group report on cattle TB In addition TB99 also identified not using feeding supplements as a risk factor for confirmed cases of TB.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 July 2008</i><i> ]: </i>The underlying principle of our bovine TB test and slaughter programme is to identify infected cattle as early as possible and minimise the risk of the transmission of the disease within and between cattle herds. Many countries where infection is maintained solely through spread between cattle have eradicated bovine TB through the systematic testing and reactor slaughter programme that we use today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80721w0008.htm_para8"><a name="0807224000077">DEFRA has funded, and is currently funding, a number of research projects modelling the potential impacts of various cattle movement control scenarios on the spread of TB&#151;final reports are published on the DEFRA website. We recognise the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of the TB control programme&#151;and we will enhance controls in the light of emerging evidence. New policies introduced in recent years include: zero tolerance for overdue TB tests (i.e. herd movement restrictions applied immediately a test becomes overdue); mandatory pre-movement testing of cattle in high risk areas; and increased use of the gamma interferon blood test. These measures increase our ability to identify infected cattle, thereby reducing the risk of disease spread. We have also been working with stakeholders to raise awareness of simple biosecurity measures to further reduce transmission risks between animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80721w0008.htm_para9"><a name="0807224000078">Increasing the frequency of bovine TB testing in some areas was one of the additional measures recommended by the Independent Science Group (ISG). Initial cost benefit analysis of increasing the frequency of cattle testing suggests that they would come at a high cost with limited benefits&#151;and so would be difficult to justify in terms of Government expenditure. Decisions about the value of such measures, and how they might be funded, are as much, if not more, a question for industry as for Government and will need to be discussed by the Bovine TB Partnership Group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80721w0008.htm_para11"><a name="0807224000082">It is very difficult to make such forecasts due to the chronic, multifactorial and insidious nature of bovine TB. The number of cattle slaughtered as tuberculosis (TB) test reactors and direct contacts largely depends on (i) the underlying prevalence of the infection in the cattle (and badger) population and (ii) the intensity and accuracy of the TB screening programme for cattle herds. The former is subject to cyclical changes in the endemic TB areas that are difficult to predict, whereas the latter is subject to annual changes as TB herd testing frequencies are reviewed every year in response to the incidence of herd breakdowns in the previous years. Furthermore, the enhancements to the TB testing regime introduced over the last two years (such as pre-movement testing and gamma-interferon blood testing) are expected to result in higher numbers of reactors being identified each year, at least in the short to medium term.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has met with the Royal Agricultural Society of England to discuss the Society&#146;s role in promoting best practice, science and innovation in the farming industry; to see how links in these areas can be strengthened and to explore where the Society and DEFRA could work more closely together. We believe that the Royal Show continues to play an important role in the agricultural calendar. DEFRA Ministers will continue to take the valuable opportunity to engage with industry stakeholders and the public at the show.</p>

 Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA), local authorities can issue residents with a notice specifying requirements as to the collection of household waste receptacles. These requirements may include the specifics of how and when to present the receptacles for collection, or the articles which must be placed in the receptacles. It is an offence for somebody to fail to comply with these requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80721w0012.htm_para0"><a name="0807224000790">Section 47ZA of the EPA allows local authorities to issue fixed penalty notices for offences under section 46. These fixed penalty notices can be issued by the following people:</p>

It is important that contractors receive adequate training and have a full understanding of any locally set procedures or policies before they begin to issue fixed penalties. The published guidance can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>

 The Code for Sustainable Homes is a framework for the design and construction of sustainable new homes. Existing homes can not be assessed against the standard because some elements of the standard apply to the construction process, such as having a site waste management plan. There are also a number of sections that would be unrealistic to expect in existing homes where major renovation or re-building would be required to achieve them.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent estimate he has made of long-term trends in the price of food in developing countries; what assessment he has made of the contribution of <i> (a)</i> the price of fuel and <i> (b)</i> the effects of climate change to such trends; and if he will make a statement.

 The UK Government have been working closely with the major international organisations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN agencies and International Food Policy Research Institute) in order to assess future price trends. Increased cereal production and the removal of export bans have brought about a recent calming of markets, and prices have fallen back from the very high levels seen earlier this year. But the consensus remains that the underlying demand for food remains strong, and according to the World Bank, this is likely to keep prices well above 2004 levels for most food crops until 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="80721w0018.htm_para7"><a name="0807227000113">The Government recently published a detailed analysis of the causes of recent price rises. High oil prices have put upward pressure on food prices by increasing production costs, through high fuel, fertiliser, transport, packaging, and processing costs. The World Bank estimates that a 10 per cent. rise in crude oil prices translates into a 1.6 per cent. increase in agricultural commodity prices. Weather has a direct impact on agricultural yields and food supplies. While recent food price rises cannot be linked directly with longer-term trends in climate change, there is no room for complacency. The UK Government will continue to push the international community for significantly higher investment in water management in developing countries, to ensure their agriculture is better prepared for the increasingly erratic weather patterns that are predicted.</p>

The BBC are in the process of building a number of new transmitters to ensure that their multiplex reaches at least 90 per cent. of the population by the end of this Charter period in 2012, and I have asked them to write to the hon.

<i> [holding answer 17 July 2008]:</i> The depiction of smoking in films is covered by the guidelines for the British Board of Film Classification, which were reviewed in 2005 after extensive public consultation and were updated accordingly. Any films which are found to be (1) aimed at children and (2) "Works which promote or glamorise smoking" receive a restricted rating. We have no plans at present to examine the impact on screen depiction of smoking but we do of course, keep these matters under constant review.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 July 2008]:</i> The following tables cover funding provided to projects relating to energy generation, renewable energy generation and energy transmission. No figures are provided for energy efficiency however as a significant proportion of the Technology Strategy Board's current portfolio of 750 projects with a combined business and Government investment of over &#163;1 billion, are driven by considerations of efficiency, both energy and natural resource.

It does not include grants awarded in the area of clean coal technologies, worth &#163;5 million in 2003-04, and approximately &#163;6.5 million in 2004-05.

 The Government considered a number of policy options in the course of the comprehensive spending review, as would be expected. We decided to alter the rules for the payment of teaching grant to give a greater priority to first-time students in higher education because this is intrinsically a fairer way to spend public money, and because doing so is consistent with our ambitions for higher level skills and increased access to higher education. Other ways of releasing more funding to support new students would have been providing less money for student support; reducing the unit of funding for teaching; or cutting back, on funding for research.</p>

<p><a name="st_339"><a name="0807227000671"><a name="80721w0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="0807227001523"><b>Bill Rammell</b>
<i> [holding answer 15 May 2008]:</i> The number of student loan borrowers who have received refunds for over-repayments made in each year since 2001 are set out in Table A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para1"><a name="0807227000672">Table B shows that the number of borrowers making over-repayments from 2001-02 to 2006-07 amounted to 3 per cent. of all borrowers making repayments over this period. The table also shows the amount refunded to borrowers who over-repaid over the same period amounted to just 1 per cent. of the total amounts repaid by all student loan borrowers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para2"><a name="0807227000673">There are a variety of circumstances why borrowers overpay but this mainly occurs when loans come to the end of repayment. Over-repayments from mortgage style borrowers will only arise once their loan has been cleared where the borrower has failed to cancel repayment arrangements with their bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para3"><a name="0807227000674">For student loan borrowers with income contingent repayment loans, repayments are predominantly made through the tax system. Due to the time lag in the Student Loans Company (SLC) receiving information from HM Revenue and Customs it is possible for borrowers to over-repay before the SLC becomes aware that their repayments should stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para4"><a name="0807227000675">Where the pattern of payments shows that repayment will be completed during the coming year, the SLC invites borrowers to get in touch to discuss when repayments should stop. Borrowers are then able to make manual repayments. If they do not respond promptly to the SLC, or ignore the invitation, they will probably overpay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para5"><a name="0807227000676">From June this year the SLC is introducing a new website facility specifically for repaying customers. This will give borrowers the ability to view their most current statement and it will also give them the chance to calculate their balance based on what they can see in their payslips.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para6"><a name="0807227000677">The SLC is working on further improving the loan end process and has been asked to put in place arrangements which will reduce the number of borrowers over-repaying at the end of repayment. Those arrangements, which are likely to be voluntary, are expected to be in place towards the end of next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="80721w0022.htm_para7"><a name="0807227000678">Any borrower who has repaid, should contact the SLC immediately to obtain a full refund with interest. All refunds include interest at the same (Retail Price Index) rate that was charged on the loan.</p>

At its open meeting on 19 July 2007, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Board discussed the extent to which the establishment of the LBRO might affect the delivery of consumer protection in relation to food and drink by the FSA directly, by the Meat Hygiene Service as the FSA&#146;s Executive agency or through the FSA&#146;s enforcement partners in local authorities. Following the meeting, the FSA Chair submitted a formal response to the consultation, covering the most significant points.

 We have been advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that there are 6.5 veterinary meat hygiene advisers employed in Great Britain to undertake visits to premises handling wild game to assess whether those premises meet the requirements for approval as set out in European Union Hygiene Regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="80721w0024.htm_para9"><a name="0807227001060">In 2006, there were 55 game handling establishments approved to process wild game.

There are currently 139 catering butchers under local authority control and which the FSA is in the process of assessing for approval as cutting plants under the Hygiene Regulations. Those that meet the necessary requirements will be approved by the FSA for cutting meat and for processing game if any carry out such processes and they will then fall under the control of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS).</p>

1. Assignment of Episodes to Years<br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>

3. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 4. Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be counted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 5. Ungrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 DWP&#151;The majority of the DWP estate has been sold (freehold, feuhold and long leasehold interests) or transferred (short leasehold interests) to Land Securities Trillium under a Private Finance Initiative contract known as PRIME which runs until 2018.</p>

absence abroad and the introduction of an indefinite assessed income period for those pension credit customers aged 80 or over or who have an assessed income period spanning their 80th birthday (benefiting most customers aged 75 or over) are part of a package of pensions measures that will make claiming benefit entitlements simpler and less intrusive and deliver extra support to pensioners. This package includes the introduction of a more automatic claims process for housing benefit and council tax benefit claims made over the phone with pension credit claims, which will benefit around 50,000 pensioners over the next few years. The costs and savings associated with wider pension measures along with the costs of the proposed changes to rules on temporary absence abroad in pension credit and introducing an indefinite assessed income period for those aged 80 or over are set out in the following table.</p>

In line with these aims, a comprehensive error reduction strategy is in place and stretching targets have been set for the recovery of overpayments.

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2008]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary issued a statement on 9 July in which he said "the attack on the UN-African Union (AU) peacekeepers in Darfur on 8 July was a horrific and cowardly act of violence. We reiterate the UN Security Council's demand for those responsible to be brought to justice. The work of the UN-AU peacekeepers in Darfur, operating in hugely challenging circumstances, deserves our utmost admiration and support. Yesterday's attack, and the continuing crisis in Darfur, further emphasises the urgent need for a full and rapid commitment by all sides to work with UN-AU mission in Darfur. I have emphasised in Khartoum today the pressing requirement for urgent humanitarian help and security cooperation as the basis for serious political dialogue".</p>

 Developing low carbon travel is becoming increasingly important at the local level.

 The current normal practice is that when an offender has reported for Unpaid Work but work cannot take place, the offender is allowed to go home and is credited with one hour. This is in accordance with a recommendation from Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Probation. When it is necessary to terminate a work session early, normal practice is to credit the hours to the point at which the offender is discharged from work for the day.

 The Prison Service Incident Reporting System (IRS) processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The data provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute. In addition information recorded as assault incidents may involve one or many prisoners as some assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim. In a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="80721w0044.htm_para3"><a name="08072217002537">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) defines violence in prisons as 'any incident in which a person is abused, threatened or assaulted. This includes an explicit or implicit challenge to their safety, well-being or health. The resulting harm may be physical, emotional or psychological'. This definition takes into account the impact of fear on emotional health and well-being.</p>

The recorded incidents of prisoner on officer are not completely exclusive to officers; establishment recording sometimes includes in this category assaults on other prison staff. The category &#145;prisoner on other&#146; contains few entries and these may also include prison staff as well as visitors, legal visitors etc. However, for the purpose of this response the categories &#145;prisoner on officer&#146; and &#145;prisoner on other&#146; are used to answer the question regarding prisoner on staff assaults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para0"><a name="08072217002541">Figures are available for the last eight years. The 2007 figures do not include the three prisons (Albany, Camphill and Parkhurst) where the incident recording has transferred to the NOMIS system which is not currently accessed from Prison Service headquarters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_576"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para1"><a name="08072217002542">There is no definition for offensive weapon therefore all weapon types recorded have been shown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_577"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para2"><a name="08072217002543">Ministers, NOMS and the Prison Officers Association are collectively committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_578"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para3"><a name="08072217002544">Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy. This policy has recently been revised and from mid-2007 applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. The strategy requires each prison to undertake regular analysis of the problem areas, consider solutions and provide an action plan to improve personal safety and reduce violence. All closed establishments are required to undertake a cell-sharing risk assessment to inform cell allocation. A good practice toolkit supports the violence reduction strategy and guides establishments to develop practical solutions, including environmental and physical measures as well as alternative ways of managing behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para4"><a name="08072217002545">As set out in the NOMS National Security Framework (NSF), establishments deploy a comprehensive range of robust searching techniques and security measures to detect and uncover weapons at the point of entry or concealed in the establishment. Such measures include the rub down and full searching of prisoners, staff and visitors, as appropriate; the use of technical devices, such as metal detectors; the deployment of searching dogs and the routine and intelligence-led searching of living accommodation and communal areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_580"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para5"><a name="08072217002546">While figures indicate that the numbers of assaults has risen in recent years, it is not possible to quantify how much of this is due to the rise in prison population, increased reporting, better data processing, or an actual increase in incidents. The increase during the earlier part of the period is most likely to do with changes in the reporting system (increase in available fields/ranges of incident capture). Additionally, a violence reduction strategy&#151;dating from 2004 and revised in 2007&#151;has further encouraged better recording. Rises in assaults may also be linked to imported violence (more prisoners held for violent offences (in 1996 prisoners held for offences of violence against the person accounted for 18 per cent. of first receptions into immediate custody, by 2005 this had risen to 23 per cent.)).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="80721w0045.htm_para6"><a name="08072217002547">The reported numbers are useful for internal management purposes, but they should not be considered as absolute. Data on assaults are complex. In particular, the level of detail requested here means that the totals in this response will not necessarily match figures provided in previous NOMS responses.</p>

The stock of VAT registered businesses in Bexley district has increased by 595 (12 per cent.) between the start of 2000 and the start of 2007 and in the London region there has been an increase of 38,350 (14 per cent.) over the period.</p>

 In its report into the Supply of Groceries in the UK, published on 30 April, the Competition Commission (CC) identified that excessive risks and unexpected costs were being transferred from grocery retailers to suppliers. To address this concern, the CC is extending the supermarkets code of practice (SCOP) to include a larger number of retailers and prohibit some practices that take place. The CC is also seeking undertakings from the grocery retailers covered by the new groceries supply code of practice (GSCOP) to establish an ombudsman to monitor and enforce compliance with the GSCOP. If the CC is unsuccessful in establishing the ombudsman within a reasonable period of time, the CC will ask BERR to take the necessary steps to set up an ombudsman. BERR would then carry out a full consultation.</p>

Since these were implemented, the UK Border Agency has continued to monitor to ensure that further misdirections do not occur. This monitoring activity involves a combination of CCTV coverage, formal and discreet observation by UK Border Agency Staff to ensure that airline and airport staff are operating the correct procedures. In addition, a regular series of review meetings has been set up between the senior management teams of UKBA, BAA and British Airways to specifically monitor these issues.</p>
