 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the findings of the most recent survey of people's perceptions of organ donation.  [148800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Research has confirmed that 90 per cent. of the UK population support organ donation and nearly 20 per cent. have registered their intention to donate on the NHS Organ Donor Register.

<P>
17. <a name="40120w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Reed: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement about the funding of children's hospices.  [148801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Funding for children's hospices is available through primary care trusts which are responsible for funding health care for their resident population. Local authorities can also fund services, including children's respite care. The New Opportunities Fund has provided &#163;48 million over three years in support of palliative care projects for children.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the proposed introduction of a compensation scheme for hepatitis C sufferers infected with contaminated blood products.  [148802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Work on the detail of the scheme is being finalised and we hope to be in a position to announce the details soon.

<P>
19. <a name="40120w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his Department's contribution to the work of the World Health Organisation.  [148803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health is responsible for the United Kingdom's annual subscription to the World Health Organisation. This contribution is based on the United Nation scales of assessment, with the UK contributing&#151;in 2003&#150;04&#151;5.5 per cent. of WHO's regular programme budget, or &#163;13.5 million. In addition the Department supports WHO in practical ways, including secondment of staff, membership of expert committees and work in the formal meetings of the governing bodies of WHO.

<P>
20. <a name="40120w01.html_wqn4"><B> Shona McIsaac: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the provision of NHS dental treatment in North Lincolnshire.  [148804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to ensuring that national health service dentistry is available to all who need it and seek it. We recognise however that access to NHS dentistry can be difficult in some areas. We have announced additional resources totalling &#163;59 million over this year and next to support dental access.
<P>

<a name="40120w01.html_para0">A NHS support team is working with the hardest pressed areas, including North East Lincolnshire, and we hope that this and other local initiatives will ease the pressure on dental services in North Lincolnshire. We have also made available a one-off payment of &#163;30,000 to North Lincolnshire Primary Care Trust to improve access to NHS dentists. The PCT will use this money to extend a general dental practice in the area, which will allow that practice to register more NHS patients on an agreed basis over a three year period.
<P>

<a name="40120w01.html_para1">We are also working with the PCTs and dentists in North and North East Lincolnshire to see what support can be provided to move dentists on to personal dental services arrangements, which would take them off the bureaucratic treadmill of item of service fees.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact of the 2001 restrictions on non-EU-trained dentists practising in the United Kingdom on the availability of dentistry.  [147504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 From 2001, the General Dental Council (GDC) ceased making visitations to dental schools in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the result that dentists who qualified after this date and wish to practise here have to sit the GDC's international qualifying examination. The number of dentists from those countries admitted to the GDC register since 2000 is shown in the table.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B>

<P>
21. <a name="40120w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department is taking to promote respite care.  [148805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Government are committed to seeing a range of services available locally for people who need services and their carers.
<P>

<a name="40120w01.html_para4">The carers grant has provided an extra &#163;325 million since 1999 to support local councils in arranging breaks services for carers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_wqn8"><B> Charles Hendry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what role he envisages for the private sector in providing respite care facilities for people with learning difficulties.  [148687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The private sector has an important role in providing respite care and short break services for people with learning disabilities and we envisage that this will continue to be the case. Respite care and short break services should provide high quality and flexible support to people with learning disabilities and their families. Such support can be provided in different ways by agencies from a variety of sectors including the private sector. People with learning disabilities can also use direct payments to directly purchase for themselves services, from a variety of sources, to meet their assessed needs include respite care and short breaks.

<a name="40120w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Ehler-Danlos Disease</H3>


<P>
22. <a name="40120w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Pickthall: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will fund research into Ehler-Danlos disease.  [148806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Medical Research Council (MRC) is not currently funding any research into Ehlers-Danlos though it does fund a number of research projects into connective tissue and also into collagen physiology. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding.

<P>
23. <a name="40120w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the most recent statistics for the mortality rate from coronary heart disease are in the area covered by the Bolton primary care trust.  [148807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 In 2002, the most recent year for which data are available, the mortality rate from coronary heart disease for residents of Bolton Primary Care Trust was 230 male deaths per 100,000 population and 108 female deaths per 100,000 population.

<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what performance indicators are in place for NHS audiology services.  [149081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 There are no national performance indicators for national health service audiology services. It is for primary care trusts to plan these services in response to the needs of their local communities.

<a name="40120w01.html_sbhd9"><H3 align=center>Delayed Discharges</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_wqn12"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to fine social services departments in the case of delayed discharges in community hospitals.  [148370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 We plan to extend the system of reimbursement for delayed discharges to all hospital patients in a phased way, once it begins to make an impact in the acute sector.


<a name="40120w01.html_sbhd10"><H3 align=center>Emergency Readmissions</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_wqn13"><B> Sandra Gidley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason his Department no longer collects information for patients aged 75 and over on emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of discharge.  [149008]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w01.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The target, and subsequently the collection of monitoring information on emergency readmissions, was changed from that relating only to patients aged 75 because it was perceived as being ageist in that older people could be denied access to hospital services in order to meet a performance target. Emergency readmissions targets and data collections have, therefore, covered all ages since April 2002.

 In response to requests from national health service and research stakeholders the Department of Health will shortly publish a framework for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning for consultation. This framework will set out a national policy position for PET in the NHS which will set out, from the evidence, which tumour groups would benefit from PET scanning, likely future demand, and the optimal configuration and location of PET scanners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> As part of its overall preparedness strategy for dealing with bioterrorism, the Department has produced a detailed smallpox plan. This plan requires that each standard Government region should have a regional response group consisting of five response teams each comprising of five members vaccinated against smallpox. Corresponding arrangements are being made for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This cohort of healthcare workers would be the first responders in investigating any suspected or confirmed cases of smallpox and therefore need to be protected against the threat of disease. A programme to vaccinate the necessary cohort for England commenced in December 2002 and to date we have vaccinated 276 healthcare workers; exceeding our target of 261. The cohort comprises infectious disease physicians and paediatricians, public health physicians, microbiologists/virologists, acute care and communicable disease control nurses and occupational health staff. In addition, a further target of 90 ambulance staff to be vaccinated has recently been set for England. These are the only personnel being offered smallpox vaccination in the absence of disease.
<P>

<a name="40120w03.html_para1">While there is no evidence of a specific threat of smallpox attack on the United Kingdom, it is sensible and prudent to ensure that the national health service can deal effectively with any potential threat.
<P>

<a name="40120w03.html_para2">The Department's smallpox plan is available in the Library and also on the Department's web-site at www.doh.gov.uk/smallpox/smallpox.htm.

 The regime for prudential supervision of banks is kept under constant review, both at home and internationally, in forums such as the European Union and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. On 1 June 1998, responsibility for the supervision of banks moved from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority. The legislative framework for the regulation of banks was subsequently reformed under the Financial Services and Markets Act; this came into effect on 1 December 2001.

 National Savings and Investments will shortly launch a new savings account in response to changing customer needs. The new account will replace the Ordinary Account, which was introduced in 1861 and has not kept pace with changes in the savings market. The Ordinary Account is expensive to run and therefore only offers modest returns to savers.
<P>

<a name="40120w04.html_para1">The new account has been designed to meet these changing customer needs and will be straightforward and simple to operate, offering customers greater flexibility in the way they manage their savings. They will be able to make deposits at post offices, by telephone and by post and they will be given an account card which will allow cash withdrawals at post offices or ATMs in the LINK network. This means the new savings account will be cheaper to run compared to the Ordinary Account and the savings will be passed onto the customer in the form of better interest rates.
<P>

<a name="40120w04.html_para2">The new savings account will be available on 29 January 2004 and new Ordinary Accounts will not be available after 28 January 2004.

After that date, no further deposits can be made and any withdrawal will have to be for the full balance to close the account. In the meantime, National Savings and Investments will be writing to Ordinary Account customers explaining their options, including information about the new account and a simple transfer form for those wishing to transfer their savings into the new account.

<P>

<a name="40120w05.html_para2">HPT has been part of the qualification process for learner drivers, car, lorry and bus drivers, motorcyclists and prospective ADIs since November 2002.

On both occasions, instructor interests mainly favoured introduction for drivers and prospective ADIs, but not for existing ADIs. Other interests, such as road safety bodies and the police, mainly favoured the proposals, including for existing ADIs.

<a name="40120w05.html_para5">The Highways Agency and Association of Chief Police Officers "Roles and Responsibilities Report" identified plans that could free up the equivalent of about 540 full-time equivalent police officers. Based on figures from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary of 6,540 designated roads police in 2001&#150;02, the report estimated that a transfer of non-core police activities to the Highways Agency enabled approximately 8&#189; per cent. of police time to work on other key tasks. Resources will be freed up over a period of about three years as Highways Agency Traffic Officers are phased in across all motorways and some key trunk roads.

 The MOD keeps the size and location of its bases under constant review. In the estate strategy, "In Trust and On Trust" the Department set out its intention to define its mainland Great Britain sites as core' or 'non-core'. Initial classification work was conducted last year. Building on this the Department is now undertaking further work to identify where estate rationalisation may be possible. This work is consistent with the Department's contribution to the Government's Independent Review of Public Sector Rationalisation&#151;the Lyons review. Any specific proposals arising from these studies will be subjected to full consultation in due course.

 The value of fee repayments will depend on the number of students that decide to defer payment of their fees and take out a fee loan; on the levels of fees that institutions decide to charge; and on the earnings of the graduate population overtime. It is not possible to predict these numbers with certainty and therefore it would not be meaningful to estimate the value of fee repayments year-by-year, given the uncertainties above.
<P>

<a name="40120w07.html_para5">Estimates of the cost of fee loans using a variety of different scenarios are contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8 January alongside the HE Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 There has been considerable progress on the development of language learning in primary schools since November 2002, underpinned by the launch in December 2002 of the Department's National Languages Strategy for England. Implementation of the Strategy is being driven by Dr. Lid King, the National Director for Languages.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1129W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40120w07.html_para7">The Strategy recognises the importance of developing a workforce and resources to support successful implementation of primary language learning, and much of our work to date has focused on these areas. In developing a school workforce, we are building up a cadre of specialist teachers and non-teacher specialists to support primary language learning. 499 places have been filled this year for Primary Initial Teacher Training with a specialism in French, German or Spanish. 119 primary MFL Advanced Skills Teachers are now in place, and we have allocated 50 primary MFL places to the Graduate Teacher Programme. We are working with the TTA to pilot a CPD course for existing primary teachers to develop language skills and MFL pedagogy. The TTA has also begun the process of approving training providers for Higher Level Teaching Assistants, and we are working with the British Council to extend the foreign language assistants programme into primary schools.
<P>

<a name="40120w07.html_para8">On resources, we are working with a range of partners to develop a framework for language learning at Key Stage 2, to be published in autumn 2005. It is intended as a shared national reference point for all those involved in teaching modern foreign languages in primary schools. It will offer guidance on key considerations such as pedagogy, cross-curricular links, curriculum delivery models and transition at age 11. The framework will supplement existing non-statutory guidance for modern foreign languages at Key Stage 2, which contains a programme of study and attainment targets for listening, speaking, reading and writing.
<P>

<a name="40120w07.html_para9">In addition, we are developing schemes of work with QCA in Spanish and German to mirror those that already exist in French. The Spanish scheme of work will also be developed into a digital online resource. The Department has also funded the establishment of NACELL&#151;the National Advisory Centre on Early Language Learning&#151;which provides access to appropriate information, including resources and has an extensively used website for language teachers.
<P>

<a name="40120w07.html_para10">In addition to workforce and resource development, in September 2003 the Department launched MFL pathfinders in 19 LEAs to explore how language learning can best be introduced at Key Stage 2. The findings from those pathfinders will provide practical guidance and help to inform teachers, schools and LEAs of good practice. We are also developing the National Recognition Scheme, as outlined in the Strategy, and are currently trialling the scheme in a range of settings, including primary schools.
<P>

<a name="40120w07.html_para11">On time allocation, the Department does not specify how much time should be allocated to deliver modern foreign languages in primary schools, or indeed to any other subject. It is for head teachers to decide how they introduce language learning at Key Stage 2 and the amount and frequency of language teaching time. The Department will, however, be issuing guidance and good practice to help inform such decisions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w08.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The age limit is 50 for eligible students meeting the residence requirements. Those aged 50 to 54 at the start of their course can also apply for a student loan provided that they plan to return to work after finishing their course. We have no plans to change the age limits.
<P>

<a name="40120w08.html_para0">We already cancel loans when a borrower reaches the age of 65. We also intend to put a 25 year cap on the loan repayment period, so that outstanding loan amounts are written off after 25 years (or age 65, whichever is the earlier).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w08.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The planned number of student places is set during spending reviews in the light of the Government's target of increasing participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by the end of the decade. Planned student numbers for 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08 will be set as part of the current spending review, which will conclude next summer. However, the additional funds that we estimate will be raised by higher education institutions from charging variable fees are equivalent to the resources that would be required for around 135,000 students.

 As a result of political instability, widespread insecurity and fighting between rebel groups and the Government of Burundi army since 1993,there has been internal displacement of over 281,000 people with over 800,000 refugees living in neighbouring countries, mainly in Tanzania. The majority of the remaining population in the country continued to be victims of human rights violations caused by the rebels or undisciplined regular soldiers. Torture, cruelty and inhuman degradation and punishment were everyday burdens for the ordinary citizen who could not get effective recourse because of a poor justice system. About 8,300 Burundians are in prison but only 44 per cent. have been sentenced.

[148546]<P>

<P>
<a name="40120w10.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Humanitarian access to Darfur is constrained by the continuing conflict between government and rebel forces in the area. We have made representations to both sides that they should allow access from recognised international relief organisations for humanitarian purposes. I myself raised the issue with the Government of Sudan in my most recent visit there.
<P>

<a name="40120w10.html_para0">After June 2003 access improved briefly but, with the breakdown of the ceasefire and resumption of hostilities, access is now limited to the three provincial capitals.

 Conflict between government and rebel forces continues in Darfur. The Government controls the main towns, and has varying control in those areas outside. The rebels appear to be able to move freely in most areas, and can close roads between towns. Much movement between towns is by air. This is clearly impacting on the free movement of people and goods in the region.
<P>

<a name="40120w10.html_para2">Of particular concern is the difficulty of gaining access for humanitarian work: United Nations reports indicate that they have access to less than 15 per cent. of the population. Recent reports suggest the situation will worsen. My humanitarian adviser will be travelling to Sudan next week and plans to visit Darfur to assess conditions there.

 The UN joint assessment mission that took place last May found a critical humanitarian situation, a lack of security due to simmering tension between rival Hendu and Lema militias, and the town of Bunia nearly deserted. Aid groups were only able to assist a small number of people within Bunia, providing medical services to some 9,000 at camps concentrated around the local airport and 6,000 sheltering near the local UN compound. They had virtually no access to populations elsewhere in Ituri. My reply to the hon. Member of 19 January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 931W, describes the improvements since that assessment.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions he has had with his EU counterparts about possible further reforms to EU development assistance.  [148516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w10.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The EC's reform of its external assistance programmes is coming to an end. The UK Government, together with other member states, have urged the Commission to undertake an in-depth final assessment of this programme to assess its impact but, more importantly, to identify any need for further reforms. We believe further reforms should focus on increasing the level of resources to low income countries and also introducing more consistent use of best development practice throughout all EC programmes. A stronger focus on quality and results and a more rational institutional set up for managing EC aid are also important.

<a name="40120w10.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Because the activity is criminal there are no accurate figures for the numbers of people who are trafficked and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) lacks hard data on progress with reductions. DFID is supporting ILO with a &#163;6 million grant (over five years) to reduce vulnerability to trafficking through low incomes and ignorance of the realities. There is work in all five countries. The indications from China are that trafficking has been reduced or eliminated in communities (numbering around 80,000) participating in the programme. The programme includes work to improve the data.

<P>

 Needs assessments prepared by the United Nations and the World Bank, by the Coalition Provisional Authority, and Iraqi administrators, have estimated the reconstruction costs for Iraq to be $55 billion for 2004&#150;07. These plans were presented by Iraqi Ministers at the Madrid Donor's Conference on Iraq in October 2003, and at least $33 billion in grants and soft loans was pledged. This includes pledges from the US of $18.6 billion, and a further $1 billion from EU member states (and acceding countries).

 In Iraq, UNICEF are taking the lead, with USAID, on assessing the post-war state of the education sector. UNICEF are currently undertaking an education survey to be completed by the end of February. But due to continuing high levels of insecurity for staff of international organisations, and low-capacity in many parts of the Iraqi education system, it currently remains difficult even to mount a simple survey of the number of schools, classes, pupils and teachers&#151;and only in a limited range of geographical areas. We therefore understand that issues such as the number of special needs students will not be included in the present survey. UNICEF do, however, have a strong concern for special needs and will be seeking to encourage the Ministry of Education to take action in this area at the earliest realistic opportunity.

<P>
<a name="40120w11.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 While great progress has been made in reducing malarial mortality in the 1970s and 1980s, in many parts of Africa malarial mortality rates are now increasing. Malaria is Africa's leading cause of child mortality and constitutes 10 per cent. of the continent's overall disease burden. Approximately 3,000 people die from malaria each day in sub-Saharan Africa, most of them children.
<P>

<a name="40120w11.html_para1">A key cause of the rise in malaria deaths is an increase in resistance to antimalarial drugs, and the lack of affordable alternatives. In addition, the capacity of health systems to respond effectively to malaria is often inadequate.

not just in terms of disease burden, but also the potential it has to undermine economic growth and human development.
<P>

<a name="40120w11.html_para3">Since 1998 DFID has provided in excess of &#163;110 million to support malaria control activities globally and at country level. At the global level this includes support to Roll Back Malaria; a $280 million commitment to the Global Fund to Fights AIDS, TB and Malaria (which will fund distribution of insecticide impregnated bednets and appropriate anti-malarial medication); support to the Medical Research Council; support to the Malaria Consortium Resource Centre; and initiatives to help find new low-cost malaria treatments.

<a name="40120w11.html_para4">DFID also supports malaria control activities at country-level through our bilateral country programmes, either through direct support to the health sector or through general budget support.

In 2003, the percentage share of IDA's total lending on health and other social services was 19 per cent. ($1.4 billion). DFID country based offices work closely with the World Bank in financing and developing the health sector with country governments.
<P>

<a name="40120w11.html_para6">The Department provided &#163;12.5 million in 2003 to WHO international programmes, including support for their "Making Pregnancy Safer" Programme. This programme is providing technical support to countries to disseminate and apply evidence-based policy and practice in maternal health, particularly on skilled attendance, management of complications, and strengthening health systems. This includes work with government on regulatory frameworks that better support women's health, on training programmes for skilled attendance and on translating national maternal health strategies into provincial and district plans and

<a name="40120w11.html_para7">DFID is represented on the steering committee of the Partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health together with the World Bank, the WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and other organisations.

DFID will be monitoring the impact that its contribution makes to global partnerships, including the Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Partnership.
<P>

<a name="40120w11.html_para8">DFID gave UNFPA &#163;18 million in 2003. UNFPA plays an important role in providing the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods, including condoms to prevent HIV/AIDS. UNFPA is putting in place a medium term strategic plan, which seeks to enhance its organisational effectiveness. The UNFPA programme focuses on family planning, skilled attendance at birth and emergency obstetrics to prevent maternal mortality. Reproductive health and rights continue to be a key priority area for DFID and we remain firmly committed to the 1994 ICPD target of achieving access to reproductive health for all by 2015. We have continued to lobby hard for reproductive rights in international fora, and we work closely with partners such as the United Nations Population Fund.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the adoption and implementation of effective poverty reduction strategies by 2004 in all countries accessing International Development Association high impact or adjustment lending.  [148520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w12.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 All countries accessing resources, including adjustment loans, from the concessional lending arm of the World Bank&#151;the International Development Association (IDA)&#151;are required to have completed, or be in the process of completing, full Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). Of the 53 countries that are already in the process, 32 are implementing full PRSPs. In 2003, 14 countries with interim strategies moved to full PRSPs. It is expected that, during 2004, a similar number of interim strategies will be finalised.
<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para0">DFID attaches importance to countries preparing their PRSPs in a way that builds and sustains country ownership through broad participation and consultation. Some countries take longer than others to finalise their PRSPs, particularly if they are affected by conflict.
<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para1">DFID continues to press for improvements in the PRSP process to correct weaknesses that have been identified, such as inadequate specification of priorities, insufficient attention to public expenditure management systems, and weak analysis of the poverty impact of policies. We welcome the progress which IDA is making in aligning its assistance in support of PRSPs, and are encouraging other multilateral and bilateral donors to do so, too.

 For 2003 the UN reports that $237 million was provided for humanitarian assistance in Sudan, compared to a Humanitarian Appeal of $262 million: although the UN do not provide a breakdown, more than half of this is spent in south Sudan. In 2004 the UN is requesting $465 million. The larger amount this year takes into account the need to fund a wider range of activities in expectation of a peace agreement to end the civil war.

 The Government of Tanzania (GoT) carried out an initial crop assessment in May 2003 followed by a rapid vulnerability assessment in July. A further vulnerability assessment will not be appropriate until after the February 2004 harvest is complete. However, food insecurity remains widespread with pockets of scarcity in at least 17 regions of Tanzania. As requested by GoT, DFID is funding Save the Children and Oxfam to facilitate the production of a food security update over the coming month.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="40120w12.html_para3">Since 1997 the UK's level of official development assistance (oda) has increased in real terms by 93 per cent. UK oda will reach an oda/gni ratio of 0.40 per cent. in 2005&#150;06, up from 0.33 per cent. in 2003&#150;04, exceeding the EU target of 0.39 per cent. for member states, and more double the current G7 average of 0.19 per cent. The UK remains committed to the UN target of 0.7 per cent. oda/GNI and to meeting the Millennium Development Goals. To this end the Chancellor has proposed an International Finance Facility that would raise an additional &#163;50 billion per year for development assistance up to 2015. Any timetable for reaching 0.7 per cent. oda/GNI will be a matter for future Parliaments.

 As a result of the new auction system, the sale of foreign exchange at a realistic rate within Zimbabwe is now legal. This should make financial operations easier for aid agencies when exchanging their foreign exchange for Zimbabwe dollars and we do not expect it to have any negative impact on the ability of aid agencies to deliver humanitarian assistance.

 The information requested is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para4"><i>Financial</i>
<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para5">1. So far this financial year DFID have spent &#163;20.5 million in Zimbabwe, from a total budget of &#163;35 million. Of the total budget, we have committed &#163;5 million to WFP for general food distribution and we are considering a further contribution. &#163;19 million will be channelled through NGOs for targeted food distributions and subsistence farming inputs. The remaining funds are for HIV/AIDS mitigation, prevention and basic vaccines. Due to the anticipated continuation of the humanitarian crisis, funding for the financial year 2004&#150;05 is expected to be at a similar level.
<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para6"><i>Vulnerability assessment</i>
<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para7">2. The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVAC) conducts the national vulnerability assessments that form the basis of the humanitarian response. This committee is composed of government, NGO and UN Agencies' representatives. The most recent assessment undertaken by the ZimVAC is the Urban Vulnerability Assessment, which the Government are expected to release by the end of this month.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40120w12.html_para9">3. Initial government crop forecasts are usually made by the end of January. However, given the present capacity of the Government, these are unlikely to be accurate or reliable. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation are already working on their own forecasts which should also be available at the end of January. Preliminary estimates by one of the major donors suggest a harvest of around 500,000 MT of maize. This compares to a 2003 cereal harvest of about 900,000 MT and a cereal requirement of approximately 2 million MT.

<P>
<a name="40120w14.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Under the Water (NI) Order 1999, it is an offence to discharge or deposit, whether knowingly or otherwise, any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter so that it enters a waterway, the penalty for which on summary conviction is imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or a fine not exceeding &#163;20,000, or both. The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS), an Executive Agency of the Department of the Environment (DOE), is responsible for enforcing this legislation.
<P>

<a name="40120w14.html_para6">To prevent pollution incidents from occurring, and to minimise the effect of any pollution on the environment, pollution prevention advice is offered by EHS to educate the public and industry, in promoting good environmental practices. If a pollution incident is reported or discovered, EHS aims to locate and stop the source of the pollution, identify the polluter and if appropriate, collect sufficient evidence to secure a prosecution.
<P>

<a name="40120w14.html_para7">It is also an offence to discharge effluent to waterways or groundwater without the consent of the DOE. EHS is responsible for issuing "consents to discharge" that detail specific conditions relating to the quality and quantity of effluent discharged. The conditions are formulated to ensure that the discharge can be sustained by the receiving waterway without damage to the aquatic environment and without breaching national or EC Directive standards. Failure to comply with the conditions of a consent is also an offence under the Water Order, and where consent compliance is consistently poor, or there is a pollution incident, enforcement action will be considered.
<P>

<a name="40120w14.html_para8">Water Service is not bound by the statutory discharge consent requirements of the Water Order, however a separate but similar regulatory system has been established to control Water Service discharges. This system has been detailed in the recently published report "Regulation of Water Service Discharges 2001", a copy of which has been placed in the Assembly library. The report is also available on the EHS website at http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/pubs/publications/Reg WSD.pdf

Israel has implemented neither the settlement freeze nor the dismantling of settlement outposts erected since March 2001. The Palestinian Authority has not begun sustained, targeted and effective operations against terrorists. Both sides should now simultaneously fulfil the obligations they have both accepted under Phase One of the roadmap.

 The Government are working hard to help the people of St. Helena. A range of issues is under consideration at the present time with air access, a new constitution, improved sea access, exports of wild honey and student fees among them. Many of these issues require co-ordination across Government departments, which is currently under way. It is our intention and has been our practice to ensure that the Government of St. Helena gets the best possible advice from the relevant experts, funded in the main by the Department for International Development. The next major visit to the island by DfID/FCO officials will be in April/May when budgetary talks are due to take place.

It is constantly on the lookout for new ways of raising revenue so that it can become more financially independent and start to build its reserves. Tristan Islanders are working with EU officials to gain a licence that would enable them to export crayfish caught in their waters for sale in the EU.

 Different information is required for a declaration of an industrial injury than for a claim for Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit (IIDB). For example, in the case of a claim for IIDB, information is required as to whether other benefits are in payment; in the case of a declaration, an injured employee may not wish to claim benefit, and therefore information is required only to establish whether an incident can be accepted as an industrial accident.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Connarty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 17 to 18 December; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [145518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17 December. The Scottish and Northern Irish Ministers responsible for Agriculture and Fisheries were also present.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para0">The Council agreed by qualified majority a Regulation providing for the total allowable catches for fish stocks for 2004. Important increases in quota for haddock and nephrops were agreed subject to special licensing and control conditions (those for nephrops to be developed by the end of next February). Annex V of the Regulation provides for limits on fishing time in 2004 for vessels which can catch cod, which operate in the North Sea and west of Scotland waters (as for 2003) and for the first time for vessels in the Irish Sea and the eastern English Channel. Annex VI introduces an effort management scheme for the North Sea sandeel fishery, for which the Regulation also sets significantly reduced quotas.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para1">The Council also agreed by qualified majority a long term recovery plan for cod stocks, setting a mechanism for deciding on multiannual catch limits, and providing for annual limits on fishing effort as in Annex V to the TAG Regulation. It explicitly enables the Council to adjust the mechanism for fishing effort during 2004 should it so wish. Finally the Council agreed the guide prices for fish species for 2004.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para2">The Council adopted by qualified majority the Presidency's compromise text for a regulation reinforcing the current requirements regarding identification of sheep and goats. I welcomed this proposal which met the main concerns we had registered during negotiation. The arrangements take account of the unique structure of our sheep sector; and, subject to approval by the Commission, our current national sheep and goat identification system of movement tags, backed up by the animal movement licensing system, will remain until 2008; followed thereafter by the introduction of electronic ID, which we support.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para3">The Council noted progress made in discussion of the proposal to update rules governing the welfare of animals during transport. The proposal was remitted for further official discussion, in particular as regards the establishment of maximum journey times.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para4">The Council took note without discussion of progress on a draft regulation harmonising official controls on food and feed. A number of issues, notably the scope of regulation and the charges to be made in connection with its enforcement, remain to be settled.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para5">The Council also took note of progress in discussion of a draft regulation setting maximum residue levels for pesticides.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1184W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para6">There was no discussion. The Council discussed the package of proposals to reform the CAP regimes for tobacco, olive oil, cotton and hops. We reiterated our support for the Commission in extending the principles of CAP reform to these sectors but argued for greater decoupling of subsidies to the olive oil and&#151;particularly&#151;cotton sectors. We expressed support for full decoupling in the tobacco sector, as the Commission has proposed, and called for the shortest possible transition period. Detailed negotiation of these proposals will resume under the Irish presidency.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para7">Under Other Business, the Italian Presidency tabled a written report outlining progress on specific hygiene rules in the animal feed sector. The Presidency also reported on progress in negotiation of a veterinary equivalence agreement with Russia. Austria pressed for early action to deal with low prices in the pigmeat sector; we and several other Member States cautioned against reliance on export refunds in this sector. We raised the problems caused for Pakistan by recent changes in the concessionary import terms applicable to Basmati rice. The Commission took note and reported that it was consulting with Pakistan and India over the latest information available on prices and varieties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> British Waterways, <i>(b)</i> the British Disabled Angling Association and <i>(c)</i> the National Angling Association about the provision of greater access for disabled anglers under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 by 1 October.  [148423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government recognise the social and recreational importance of angling and are committed to improving access for the disabled. In response to the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Review Group report, the Government committed the Environment Agency to promoting angling.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para8">The Environment Agency works with a number of national and local bodies to provide angling opportunities for all. The Agency is working closely with the British Disabled Angling Association (BDAA) to integrate disability access into its work programme.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para9">The Agency has also encouraged the Joint Angling Governing Bodies (those organisations of the National Angling Association responsible for angling development and coaching) to work closely with the BDAA. To facilitate this co-operative work a Disability Working Group has been set up and is attended by all the main bodies involved in disabled angling and angling governance.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para10">The Agency also works with British Waterways on a number local initiatives. British Waterways aim to incorporate facilities for disabled anglers on its existing network and is committed to ensuring that all of its new angling facilities at reservoirs and other sources of closed waters are accessible for people with disabilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> The religious slaughter of animals without prior stunning is permitted under both EU and domestic legislation.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para11">We are still considering our response to the recommendations in the Farm Animal Welfare Council's report on the welfare of red meat animals at slaughter, including the recommendation that slaughter without prior stunning should be banned in this country. We expect to issue our draft response document for public consultation within the next few weeks, but I am unable to provide an exact date at this stage. The public consultation exercise will be widely publicised. We anticipate issuing the Government's final response to the recommendations towards the middle of the year.

<a name="40120w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether there are humane methods licensed for the stunning and slaughter of animals and poultry which rely on gases to render animals unconscious prior to their slaughter.  [148652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (as amended) lay down the permitted stunning and killing methods for both red meat animals and poultry. The permitted methods have been assessed for humaneness. The use of gas mixtures is a permitted method for rendering pigs, domestic fowls and turkeys unconscious. The use of gas mixtures is actually a stun-kill method, in that the animal or bird has to remain in the gas until it is dead.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the administrative boundaries of the Krebs proactive areas necessarily coincide with the areas inhabited by badgers.  [148658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The boundaries of treatment areas in which badger culling would take place were only prescribed once putative badger social group territories had been delineated. Any sett outside a trial area boundary which was associated with a social group of badgers whose territory fell within the trial area would be subject to the same treatment as the sett within the trial area (proactive or reactive culling) once allocated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what tests have been carried out by the Department to determine 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1186W</I><P>
whether healthy badgers have acquired or are likely to acquire infection after colonising setts left vacant as a result of clearance of TB infected badgers.  [148661]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is likely that the lack of light and relatively constant temperature and humidity inside a badger sett would favour the survival of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative organism of bovine tuberculosis). However, as there is currently no effective live test for TB in badgers, it would not be possible to tell if an incoming badger was healthy when colonising a vacant sett.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what controls are imposed on the relocation of badgers which are treated by animal hospitals and sanctuaries;  [148662]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Badgers are a protected species and it is an offence to take (or attempt to take) a badger from the wild, including for the purpose of relocation elsewhere (Protection of Badgers Act 1992, s.1(1)). A person guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for up to six months and/or a fine of up to &#163;5,000.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para12">There are certain exceptions to this offence, two of which are specifically relevant to the issue of relocating badgers. These are the treatment of injured or sick badgers, and relocations carried out under the authority of a licence.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para13">Under section 6, a person is not guilty of an offence by reason only of:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40120w20.html_para14">Like other native species, there are no specific restrictions under current law regulating where badgers are released once they have recovered from treatment. Once recovered, the badger will normally be returned to the location where it was originally found. This approach is recommended by Defra on welfare grounds due to their territorial nature, and also to avoid any risk of transmitting disease. However, there it is recognised that there are situations in which this course of action may not be feasible (particularly in the case of orphaned cubs).
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para15">A voluntary code of practice (prepared by the RSPCA, National Federation of Badgers Groups and Secret World Wildlife Rescue) provides comprehensive guidance on rehabilitating and releasing badgers. This adopts a precautionary approach aimed at protecting the welfare of badgers and critically, minimising the risk of transmitting bovine tuberculosis (TB). The code is publicly available via the internet at: http://www. badger.org.uk/action/badger-rehabilitation-protocol- contents.html
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para16">Under the code of practice, an adult badger is to be released at the exact location from which it was recovered. If this is not possible the code advises that the animal is euthanased. Badger cubs may be released at a different location. Animals to be relocated are tested for TB three times. Only badgers testing negative to all three tests are released and any animal testing positive is 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1187W</I><P>
euthanased. The code also requires that released badgers are permanently marked (by a tattoo or microchip) and registered.
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para17">Under section 10 of the Act, licences may be issued to permit badgers to be taken from the wild (and relocated if necessary) for a limited range of specified purposes. These include scientific investigation, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing serious damage to property. Depending on the purpose of the operation, licences are issued by either the appropriate statutory conservation agency or agricultural department (English Nature and Defra, respectively, in England).
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para18">Licences to relocate badgers are only issued if such action is clearly justified and where there is considered to be a very low risk of transmitting bovine tuberculosis (TB).
<P>

<a name="40120w20.html_para19">Before any badgers are released at a new location all animals must be tested three times for TB. All badgers testing positive to any of the three tests, or in contact with a badger testing positive, are euthanased.

This reduced and subsequently phased out any existing stocks of CFCs in the UK. The supply of CFCs for these uses is controlled by a licencing system, in which suppliers are given an import or export declaration. The amounts of CFCs requested by companies are also agreed in advance by member states. All import declarations are processed by Customs and Excise to ensure appropriate licences have been obtained, and no illegal imports have been detected in recent years.

 According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), it is the intention of the insurance industry, working in partnership with the Government, that flood insurance should continue to be available to the vast majority of existing properties. As set out in the ABI's Statement of Principles <sup>1</sup> , of the 1.9 million properties on the floodplain, flood insurance will continue to be available for all those properties defended to a minimum standard of 1 in 75, or for those properties where such defences are planned by 2007.
<P>

<a name="40120w21.html_para2">For other properties (currently estimated at 200,000), insurers cannot guarantee to maintain cover, but will examine the risks on a case-by-case basis, and will use their best efforts to continue to provide cover. ABI believes that nearly all homes are insurable to a degree, provided appropriate local action is taken to protect the property, e.g., use of flood resilient design, accredited protection products, and temporary defences. However, the insurance industry has signalled that inappropriate new developments in the floodplain are unlikely to be able to secure insurance cover.

<a name="40120w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), one of the main outcomes of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, aims to ensure the conservation of biodiversity, its sustainable use, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. As part of the Government's commitment to the CBD the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) was published in 1994. The UK BAP sets targets for the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity in the UK and individual action plans have now been published for 391 species and 45 habitats of conservation importance, including for 75 flowering plants.
<P>

<a name="40120w21.html_para3">With regard to payment of grants under the Defra agri-environment schemes, we encourage the use of native and local provenance seed as far as possible. Detailed guidance is provided in the Countryside Stewardship Scheme Handbook. For instance, when re-creating grassland on cultivated land the species of 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1192W</I><P>
grass used should be from a specified list of species and of native and local provenance. If applicants have problems in obtaining native seed or stock they are advised to discuss other options with their stewardship advisor. In some circumstances alternative seed mixes may be agreed and wild flower seed may be added.
<P>

<a name="40120w21.html_para4">There is also a specific stewardship payment which helps meet the cost of buying in seed. However, to qualify for this payment the seed must be native seed of local provenance. Similarly with tree and hedge planting and management, Countryside Stewardship agreement holders are required to use stock of native and local provenance where possible. Where this is not possible alternative options are to be discussed with the Stewardship Adviser. As regards EU legislation on accredited sources of seed for trees and the production of locally sourced plants, on 1 January 2003 the Forestry Commission brought in the Forest Reproductive Material (Great Britain) Regulations 2002, implementing EU Directive 1999/105 on the marketing of forest reproductive material. These regulations increase the number of species controlled by law to 46 species and the genus "Populus". This includes 15 tree species which are native to Great Britain. The regulations are deliberately structured in a way to encourage the collection of local seed. Sellers of planting stock are required to issue a supplier's document to the buyer, setting out whether or not the stock is locally sourced.
<P>

<a name="40120w21.html_para5">In addition, for native species not controlled by law, the Forestry Commission promotes the harvesting of local seed from native trees and shrubs through the Voluntary Scheme for the Certification of Native Trees and Shrubs. Further details of this scheme can be found on the Forestry Commission's website at: http://forestry.gov.uk/frm
<P>

<a name="40120w21.html_para6">In July this year we published the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate which set new targets to measure progress made to protect and improve biodiversity on the Government Estate. They include a target to assess and improve the condition of Government owned Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs); a requirement for all Government Departments who own sites of significant biodiversity interest to produce Biodiversity Action Plans; and a requirement to set a biodiversity target in contracts for new and refurbished Government buildings. The guidance which accompanies the targets encourages Departments, when renewing maintenance contracts, to consider building in clauses on the purchase/planting of native species of plants.
<P>

<a name="40120w21.html_para7">In 2001, recognising concerns that present arrangements for handling issues relating to non-native species were insufficient, Defra commissioned a Review of Non-native species policy. A range of organisations was represented on the working group, and its report was published in March 2003. The issues which it raises are complex, and a combination of measures will be required to address these. The report highlighted problems with non-native genotypes and recommended that there was a need to raise public awareness of this issue.

<a name="40120w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The European Union and its member states agreed to a target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12. The EU and its member states have agreed to meet their commitments jointly and, under a burden-sharing arrangement, the EU target has been redistributed between member states to reflect their national circumstances, requirements for economic growth, and the scope for further emission reductions.




<P>

<a name="40120w22.html_para1">Under the provisions of the Monitoring Mechanism Decision (Council Decision 93/389/EEC as amended by Decision 99/296/EC), member states are required to report annually to the Commission on their anthropogenic emissions of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol and on their national projections for emissions of these gases.
<P>

<a name="40120w22.html_para2">The European Commission uses this information to assess annually, whether the actual and projected progress of member states is sufficient to ensure fulfilment of the EU's and member states' commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The latest progress report, published in December last year, provides data for members states' emissions in 2001, and their projected emissions for 2010. That report notes that the EU had cut its total emissions to 2.3 per cent. below base year levels and that aggregate member states' "with existing measures" projections suggest that in 2010 EU emissions will have decreased by 0.5 per cent. leaving a gap of 7.5 per cent. from the Kyoto target. Eleven member states have identified additional policies and measures to achieve their commitments under the burden-sharing agreement. Taking into account these "with additional measures" projections shows that six member states&#151;Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the UK&#151;would over-achieve their individual commitments. The over-achievement by those member states would result in emissions reductions for the EU as a whole of 7.2 per cent. below base year emissions.

This requirement to retire allowances annually means that member states are obliged systematically to take steps to comply with their targets over a number of years. It will give early notice of any difficulties arising where member states are not likely to have sufficient allowances to cover their emissions over the full commitment period and so will need to take further action to reduce their emissions or to acquire allowances from other Parties to the Protocol that have a surplus.

 The plant passporting regime applies to certain plants and plant products known to host the most serious ("quarantine") pests and diseases. It applies only for movements within the European Community and there are no border checks carried out, although spot checks may take place anywhere in the trade chain. Producers of such material are required to be officially registered and be subject to official inspection at least annually in order to be authorised to issue plant passports.

<P>

<a name="40120w22.html_para10">In cases where official monitoring detects that a plant passport is missing on a plant or product covered by the passporting requirements, enforcement action is taken.

The employment of helicopters would therefore only be of assistance to identify areas of dense planting and woodland for further investigation in areas where the infection is considerably more severe than any of the UK outbreaks identified to date. Plant health inspectors already have access to an on-line aerial photograph mapping facility to assist them in planning ground based inspections. They also have experience of using aerial surveys to detect plant disease on arable crops, although this has been with fixed wing aircraft rather than helicopters. The possibility of aerial surveys will be kept under review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr Bradshaw: </B> 
 Methyl bromide is a fumigant approved for use as a pre-planting soil sterilant against some soil borne diseases including some Phytophthora species mainly in horticultural situations. Its effectiveness specifically against Phytopthora ramorum has not been evaluated because this is a new species. The 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1197W</I><P>
pesticide may already be used by nursery staff growing plant stock for the purpose of eradicating other known pests and diseases in soil pre-planting. However it is not approved for use against fungal pathogens on growing plants due to phytotoxicity problems caused by the high doses that would be necessary. The methodology of applying soil fumigants would also make it impracticable to use this a means of dealing with infection in the wider environment. There are considerable health and safety implications attached to the use of this acutely toxic substance.
<P>

<a name="40120w23.html_para0">The only form of treatment currently available to eliminate infection by Phytophthora ramorum is removal and destruction of plant material. Currently approved fungicides have a suppressive effect which masks symptoms rather than eradicating the pathogen from infected plants. However, Horticulture Development Council funded research at the Central Science Laboratory is looking at a range of substances to see how well they can eradicate infection or protect healthy nursery stock from new infection.

 The table below lists the 134 local authorities that had debt-free status as of 30 September 2003:
<P>

<a name="40120w24.html_para0">It was formerly our practice to take into account local authorities' capital receipts when issuing the credit approvals which allow them to borrow. That ended in April 2003. No estimates are available of the resources thereby redistributed from debt-free authorities to metropolitan authorities.
<P>

<a name="40120w24.html_para1">The redistribution of resources remains a fundamental principle of the housing finance system. It is currently achieved by the requirement for authorities to set aside for debt redemption part of their housing capital receipts. Debt-free authorities are exempt and have thus enjoyed an advantage unavailable to others, but that anomaly will be corrected from 1 April this year, when set-aside is replaced by pooling, under which all authorities must pay part of their housing capital receipts to the Government. Transitional measures will protect debt-free authorities from the full impact of this new redistribution mechanism for three years. Thereafter they will be treated on the same basis as authorities with debt. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consider that the recently introduced the new prudential framework for local authority borrowing and authorities who need to borrow and can afford to do so should not be deterred by artificial incentives to remain free of debt.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the feasibility of implementing the recommendations in the House of Lords report on the use of animals in scientific procedures; and if he will make a statement.

 The Home Office has not commissioned, or evaluated, any formal research into the feasibility of implementing the recommendations of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, published in July 2002. The Government's response to the Select Committee's report was published on 20 January 2003 (Cm 5729). Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para3">The Government welcomed the Select Committee's report and noted in particular, and endorsed, its finding that animal experiments are currently necessary to develop human and veterinary medicines and to protect humans and the environment.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para4">We also reaffirmed our commitment to the fullest possible application of the 3Rs&#151;the refinement of scientific procedures, the reduction in the numbers of animals used and their replacement wherever possible&#151;and to greater openness regarding the use of animals in scientific procedures, subject to safeguards for personal and confidential information.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para5">We were unable to accept four of the Select Committee's recommendations (numbers 15, 19, 23 and 27). These related to the inspection of establishments, the training requirement for visiting scientists and students from overseas, the requirement for lay members of local Ethical Review Processes, and the reporting of genetically modified animals which are bred but not used in the annual statistics on animal use.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1206W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para6">We agreed, or broadly accepted, eleven recommendations (11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 25, 29, 30 and 31). Action on these is in hand. In particular, we are currently exploring the recommendation that a United Kingdom centre for research into the 3Rs should be established. As part of this work the Chief Inspector of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate has sought the views of interested parties&#151;primarily those who fund and undertake animal research&#151;to gather information on the scope for such a centre.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para7">We are also looking again at the possible streamlining of the project licence application form, and at the arrangements for publication of licensing information, through a joint project team with scientific stakeholders.

<a name="40120w25.html_para8">One other recommendation (28), regarding the repeal of section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, has been the subject of a further period of review and consultation since publication of the Government reply. I hope to announce the outcome shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w25.html_spnew3"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 A feature of the regulatory regime under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is the discussion that often takes place at an early stage between applicants (or prospective applicants) and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. This means that proposals unlikely to meet the Act's stringent requirements are revised or withdrawn before formal refusal becomes necessary.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para10">Our central database records do not show all these dealings that commonly go on between applicants and individual Inspectors at various stages in the application process, and much of the requested information is therefore not readily available.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para11">We can say that in 2002, the last year in which figures were published, one project licence application was formally refused. Over the same period, 97 project licence applications, 17 personal licence applications and one application for a certificate of designation are recorded as not proceeded with.
<P>

<a name="40120w25.html_para12">For additional information, paragraph 12 of Appendix A of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals (Great Britain) 2002 (Command 5886, available in the Library) provides the total number of project and personal licences, and certificates of designation, granted and revoked during 2002, showing how many were in force on 31 December 2002.

The Government's policy remains to ensure that families whose asylum claims have failed are removed together. Where there are difficulties or delays with enforced removal, but families have been provided with opportunities to return voluntarily and at no cost to themselves, the Bill provides that families who refuse these opportunities would no longer be entitled to support at the expense of the taxpayer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w26.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Government are determined to support the police in tackling the problem of drug abuse with an effective and realistic approach to drug legislation, enforcement and education. Cannabis will not be legalised or decriminalised. It is a harmful drug that will remain illegal following its reclassification as a Class C drug on 29 January.
<P>

<a name="40120w26.html_para0">Our drugs laws and our educational messages to young people must reflect the relative harms of drugs, in accordance with the available scientific and medical advice, if they are to be credible. Reclassification will enable a more convincing and ultimately more effective educational message to be conveyed to young people about the dangers of misusing different types of drug, including cannabis.
<P>

<a name="40120w26.html_para1">We are publishing information about what reclassification will mean in practice&#151;through making a leaflet widely available to young people and through extensive radio advertising, beginning on 22 January&#151;to ensure that the clear message that cannabis is illegal 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1209W</I><P>
and harmful continues to be heard. This information will feed into the three year FRANK publicity campaign to better inform people's understanding of drugs and to provide a single, easily accessible source of advice and support for those affected by drug use. This will help young people, in particular, to understand what will happen to them if they are found in possession of cannabis (or any other illegal drug) or are supplying drugs.
<P>

<a name="40120w26.html_para2">Reclassification also sends a clear signal to the police that the priority is Class A drugs, like heroin and crack cocaine, which do the most harm. The Association of Chief Police Officers' cannabis enforcement guidance is rightly directed at ensuring that those who cause public order problems, those who persist in misusing cannabis, and those who use cannabis close to places where children are present are dealt with appropriately. But where none of these factors apply, it is not right that someone who is an adult who is found with cannabis should take up police time.
<P>

<a name="40120w26.html_para3">Time saved as a consequence of policing cannabis possession offences in this way, following reclassification, will provide the police with an opportunity to focus greater resources on priority areas like tackling Class A drug supply offences.

 The Government do not collect figures on the cost of credit card fraud but the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) assesses the cost of all plastic card fraud in 2002 (the most recent figures available) to be &#163;424.6 million.
<P>

<a name="40120w26.html_para4">In April 2002, the Government launched a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit (the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU)) based in London, which works closely with the banking industry to reduce organised card and cheque fraud, using intelligence largely provided by the card industry. DCPCU had significant success in its first year including recovery of more than 4,000 cards and 525 cheques, resulting in 59 arrests. Potential savings amount to &#163;13.35 million. DCPCU cases have so far led to 31 convictions, all following guilty pleas.

 Drivers must have proper control of their vehicles and drive carefully and safely at all times.

 Estimates of the costs of drug-related crime are not available annually. However, a recent study published by the Home Office provides estimates of the total economic and social costs of Class A drug use and puts these in the range of &#163;10.1 to &#163;17.4 billion for the year 2000. These costs include the costs of drug-related crime, which are estimated to fall in the range &#163;8.8 to &#163;15.8 billion. The costs of drug-related crime include victim costs and those accruing to courts, prisons and other parts of the criminal justice system.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many under 18-year-olds have been released under the early release of short-term prisoners; and how many were assigned a mentor on release.  [146997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w27.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 January 2004]:</i> The standard custodial sentence (up to 24 months) for offenders under 18 is the Detention and Training Order (DTO). Half the term is spent in custody and the remaining half under supervision in the community. Early release from custody (of one month, in the case of offenders serving terms of eight, 10 or 12 months; or one or two months, for those serving 18 or 24 months) has been available since the DTO was introduced in April 2000. In May 2002, new guidance specified that, in future, DTO trainees granted early release would be electronically monitored up to their original release-from-custody date.
<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para1">Since 29 May 2002, 2,451 DTO trainees have been granted early release. The guidance does not specify that those released should be assigned a mentor. It is open to Youth Offending Teams to arrange this, and those offenders who undertake an Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme during the community part of their DTO are usually assigned a mentor, but figures on this are not collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how the Government will ensure that usable spectrum is available to bidders seeking to supply and manage new radio network systems for the emergency services following the award of the contract for a new modern digital radio system for the police service to Airwave/02 in February 2000.  [147809]<P>

<P>
<a name="40120w27.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Potential suppliers of public safety radio networks may apply to the interdepartmental Public Safety Spectrum Policy Group (PSSPG) for suitable radio spectrum. The PSSPG is an interdepartmental committee that ultimately answers to the UK Spectrum Strategy Committee of the Cabinet Office. Regularly updated information on available spectrum is available on the Ofcom website.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) whether the residents of the nations securing membership of the EU in May will have automatic right of access to the United Kingdom on that date; and whether they will have access to social security and housing benefits;  [146651]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w27.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 12 January 2004]:</i> Under the EU Accession Treaty, citizens of all 10 new member states will enjoy the same right to travel freely across the EU as is enjoyed by citizens of the current member states, for all but one of the purposes envisaged by the EC Treaty. The Accession Treaty allows the 15 current member states to impose temporary restrictions on the right of citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia to travel freely across the EU for the purpose of work. These restrictions may last, at the most, until 30 April 2011. Cypriot and Maltese citizens will enjoy free movement for work across the EU automatically on accession.
<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para2">The United Kingdom Government, along with Denmark, Netherlands, Greece, Ireland and Sweden, have decided to allow access to their labour markets immediately upon the accession. Many other member states have yet to make any final decisions. France and Germany have indicated that they will impose some temporary restrictions on workers for at least two years from accession.
<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para3">Citizens of the new member states will have the same rights and restrictions as citizens of existing EU member states in relation to access to social security and housing benefits.
<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para4">Under EC law, a citizen of the European Union may not be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality and must enjoy the same access to social security benefits as a national of the state of residence.

<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para7">Citizens of other EU member states cannot come to the UK simply to claim benefits. They must first meet the Habitual Residence Test (HRT). The HRT covers non-contributory benefits including income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, and council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para8">The Government are committed to ensuring that the benefits system and the taxpayers who support it are protected against abuse by people with little or no connection with the UK. Measures already in place under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, together with the HRT, help insure this. This area is kept under constant review to ensure that the benefit system remains fully robust and resistant to abuse.

This involves assessing the training needs of a range of professionals and offering them training.
<P>

<a name="40120w27.html_para10">The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 received Royal Assent on 30 October. The Government will take steps to ensure that relevant professionals are informed about this new legislation and their duties under it.

laboratories would probably need to come from some form of Private Finance Initiative (PFI). This has not been assessed in detail as my right hon.

<P>
<a name="40120w27.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Assessment of the capital expenditure requirement for the Forensic Science Service (FSS) was undertaken within the recent review of this organisation, led by Robert McFarland. It was estimated that the FSS requires capital expenditure in the region of &#163;20 million to &#163;30 million to sustain business at its present level in the emerging competitive climate. The Review team did not undertake a detailed study of the FSS's capital investment needs, which would be necessary to determine a precise figure and establish the investment required at each of the centres.

<i> [holding answer 12 January 2004]:</i> The available information is given in the table. The statistics collected centrally relate only to the illegal conversion into firearms of anything which, though having the appearance of being a firearm, is so constructed as to be incapable of discharging any missile through its barrel. It is not possible to make a distinction between the type of guns converted, but the conversion of air weapons is not covered by the offence under section 4(3) of the Firearms Act 1968 since most are already classified as firearms.

 The Prison Service acknowledges that family and other community links are vital to effective resettlement of prisoners, and that families have a valuable role to play in helping to reduce re-offending and protect the public.
<P>

<a name="40120w30.html_para4">With regard to offenders under the age of 18, and all those sentenced to the detention and training order, there is a mandatory requirement on governors to ensure that, where appropriate, families are given the opportunity to contribute to the sentence planning process throughout the custodial part of the sentence. For adult prisoners the extent of involvement is left to the discretion of individual establishments.

<a name="40120w31.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the reasons why the Somerset Drugs Service has stopped providing drug rehabilitation support for drug addicts in the Yeovil constituency other than for pregnant women and suicide risks; and what assessment he has made of the effects of this decision on levels of crime.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2004]:</i> The Government have provided the Somerset Drug Action Team (DAT) with substantially increased funds in order to reduce waiting times for admission to treatment in the county. This year Somerset Drugs Service (SDS), one of the service providers, had their budget increased by &#163;200,950 to &#163;1,763,214. Following the consequent increase in availability of treatment there has been a substantial increase in those seeking treatment. In quarter 2 of 2002 SDS had 287 active clients of whom 74 were in Yeovil; in quarter 2 of 2003 SDS had 426 active clients of whom 146 were in Yeovil representing almost a 100 per cent. increase in demand in the town in the space of a year. Such dramatic increases have put some short-term pressure on budgets, which has temporarily prevented waiting times being reduced as quickly as originally anticipated. However no one who needs it will be denied treatment. All those presenting for treatment continue to be to prioritised according to assessed need and the risk of harm to self and to the community.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para2">In order to continue to expand the service to drug users and provide the most effective treatment in the face of increasing demand the DAT commissioned a strategic review from Oxford Brookes University of the whole of its adult drug treatment system. The results of this review are being considered at a meeting on 13 January. In addition to &#163;35,000 allocated this financial year, from April, the DAT has been allocated an extra &#163;284,462 from the Governments Criminal Justice Intervention Programme Throughcare and Aftercare Budget. These increases will ensure that treatment provision continues to improve by assisting the DAT and implement the recommendations of its strategic review.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para3">As a result of targeting prolific offenders and making rapid treatment available to them, where necessary, the county has seen significant falls in rates of burglary over the first three quarters of this financial year when compared to the same period last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w31.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on street crime in towns and cities, with particular reference to Romford.  [148489]<P>

<P>
<a name="40120w31.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Street Crime Initiative was launched on 17 March 2002 to reduce levels of robbery in England. It covers the 10 police force areas which together account 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1230W</I><P>
for the great majority of recorded robbery: Avon and Somerset, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire, Thames Valley, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para4">The Initiative involves a wide range of agencies working in partnership and delivering a programme of practical measures. Through this work, the Government has reduced street crime in the 10 police force areas by 17 per cent. in 2002&#150;03, which means 17,000 fewer offences, and by 21 per cent. in the Metropolitan Police area. Havering, which includes Romford, saw a 13 per cent. reduction in robbery in 2002&#150;03, with 479 offences, down from 549 in 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w31.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he is taking to ensure that speed cameras do not take pictures of a vehicle's reflection rather than the vehicle itself to calculate speed; and how many drivers he estimates have been wrongly penalised by reason of such errors.  [149006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w31.html_spnew6"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The rigorous type approval process operated by the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) is designed to ensure that speed camera evidence can be fully relied on
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para5">As a further precaution, however, all automatic static camera devices provide for a secondary check. This enables the officer viewing an apparent offence to make a judgment as to the vehicle's speed independent of the speed measured by the device. To enable this check, the device takes two photographs 0.5 seconds apart. The secondary check is performed by measuring the distance travelled along white lines painted on the road between the taking of the two photographs and calculating the vehicle's speed from these.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para6">While it is technically possible for a camera to record a vehicle's reflection, rather than the vehicle itself, this is extremely rare in practice. Where it does occur, the difference revealed by proper application of the secondary check will make it obvious that there has been an error.

 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate gives priority attention to applications for children who need to travel urgently. Extra staff have been allocated to resolving payment issues and process timelags that can delay these applications from being decided. Resources have been prioritised to ensure every effort is made so that schoolchildren and other customers who wish to travel urgently have their applications completed or a short period of leave granted to enable them to travel.

 To ensure that effective treatment is available when it is needed, we have made significant investments in the youth justice system and drug treatment sector.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para8">An arrest referral scheme for young people is currently being piloted, to get young offenders into treatment or other appropriate interventions as early as possible. &#163;6 million is being invested to pilot arrest referral for young people in 10 high crime areas across England. Trained staff in the police custody suites identify if young people have a substance misuse issue and refer them to appropriate treatment or intervention.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para9">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) has provided &#163;8.5 million funding each year for all 155 youth offending teams across England and Wales to have access to an allocated named drugs worker. The drugs worker is able to assess the needs of young people and ensure that they receive appropriate treatment or other interventions.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para10">80 per cent of drug action teams areas now have access to community-based young people focused treatment services. DATs across the country are 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1232W</I><P>
continuing to improve and build on existing provision so that the number of different modalities of treatment for young people are increased.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para11">The Youth Justice Board is investing &#163;10 million this year and for the next two years. This will establish integrated substance misuse services through out all juvenile custodial institutions that will ensure that young people are able to access similar levels of service provision within the juvenile secure estate as in the community. The Youth Justice Board will ensure that custodial institutions are able to provide: identification, assessment and planning services; prevention and education work; support and appropriate programmes; detoxification and clinical management; and on release throughcare and resettlement.

<P>
<a name="40120w31.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the decision to re-introduce young offenders into Gloucester Prison; and whether the decision was affected by the closure of Ashfield Young Offenders Institution.  [146729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40120w31.html_spnew10"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The allocation of young adult offenders (YAOs), aged 18- 20, into Gloucester prison forms part of the ongoing programme to adjust the population mix of adult and young prisoners at a number of establishments. This is in response to the requirements of the Youth Justice Board for juvenile places and to increasing demand for spaces for adult male prisoners. This will be achieved through careful monitoring of population changes and the allocation of prisoners to establishments appropriate to their needs. It will also ensure maximum use of all available spaces in the prison estate, while minimising the distance of remand prisoners from the courts. This will enable the Prison Service to maintain its service to the courts despite the population pressures.
<P>

<a name="40120w31.html_para12">Ashfield prison is not being closed, but will instead only hold young prisoners, aged 15&#150;17. Gloucester and other prisons in the area will hold remand and sentenced YAOs. Sentenced YAOs returning from court will be held at Gloucester for the minimum time possible before being transferred on to other establishments with YAO regimes.
