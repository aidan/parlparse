 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) if she will oppose in the Council of Ministers proposals providing for journey time of longer than eight hours for all animals travelling for slaughter or further fattening;  [166931]




</p>



<p>(2) if she will make representations for EU regulations on the maximum legally permitted temperature at which animals can be transported to be reduced; and if she will make a statement;  [166933]

</p>



<p>(3) if she will make representations for EU regulations on the maximum stocking densities for animals in transit to be reduced to allow animals to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;reposition themselves so as not to fall and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;lie down comfortably; and if she will make a statement.

<p><a name="40518w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 These are all important matters that were considered at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 26&nbsp;April. The talks failed as the Presidency could not secure a qualified majority for its proposals, which in our opinion failed to do enough to improve animal welfare. For this reason the UK was among those member states which could not support the Presidency.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions her Department has had with Asian countries in order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure that surveillance of the vaccination programme to combat the bird influenza outbreak in chickens is rigorous enough to spot the evolution of new strains of the virus.  [165261]</p>








<p><a name="40518w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We have had no direct contact on this issue. Our key protection against the disease is to control or ban imports. That operates regardless of the strain. We have received reports on the outbreak through the OIE and from EU representatives in south east Asia and have acted immediately to ban imports from wherever the disease has occurred.

<p>
<a name="40518w01.html_para0">
Thailand is the only country in the region from which imports of poultry products were permitted prior to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outbreak of avian influenza. Imports of poultry products which could transmit the virus have been stopped and will be allowed to resume only once it is clear that the disease has been eradicated. Thailand has reported that it has not used vaccination in its efforts to eradicate the disease.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which European Union directives for which her Department has responsibility were not transposed into UK law before the passing of the transposition deadlines in each of the last five years.  [168368]</p>








<p><a name="40518w01.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 While every effort is made to ensure that transposition deadlines are met, it is inevitable that this will not always be the case. Transposition can be complex, and it is important that timely transposition is balanced against other objectives, such as avoiding over implementation and unnecessary regulation. In most cases these directives require transposition by the devolved Administrations as well as at Westminster and in some cases also in Gibraltar.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs plays a leading role in the United Kingdom&#039;s EU policy on the environment, agriculture, fisheries, animal and plant health.

 Under EU legislation governing the Single Payment Scheme, land under permanent crops, including top fruit, is not eligible to use in support of a payment claim in any member state. However, land used to grow soft fruit will be eligible in those member states and regions which adopt the flat rate or &#039;hybrid&#039; payment models. Our current understanding is that Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Luxembourg, in addition to England, Northern Ireland, are likely to adopt such models. We expect that no payments will be made in respect of land used for fruit production in the remaining member states, nor in Scotland and Wales.

 The Government&#039;s approach to cutting fast food litter, with the voluntary code we have promoted resulting in a 20&nbsp;per cent. cut in fast food litter in pilot areas compared with a general worsening by 12&nbsp;per cent. across the country between 2002 and 2003. The challenge now is for all concerned to put the lessons into practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para0">
In October 2003 Defra launched a consultation exercise in order to establish a Voluntary Code of Practice for the Fast Food Industry, following 18 months of research with industry representatives. Defra commissioned ENCAMS (formerly Tidy Britain Group) to develop the voluntary code. In February we published the Local Environmental Quality Survey for England 2002&#150;03 (LEQSE) carried out by ENCAMS which showed fast food litter had increased by 12&nbsp;per cent. over the last year, and that it had become more widespread. However, with practical application of the code&#039;s recommendations, a good practice example project led to a 20&nbsp;per cent. reduction in fast food littering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para1">
The aim of the proposed voluntary code of practice is to reduce fast food litter and waste that becomes litter in the local environment by outlining best practice and recommendations for action to be taken by all fast food retailers working with local authorities and seeking to involve the local public. It will allow all parties to work together in a mutually supportive partnership, to find local solutions to local problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para2">
In addition the Government are involved in studies regarding the health effects of waste management processes, although these have not been concerned with small scale local issues such as commercial waste from food outlets. These are dealt with effectively by way of local authority Environmental Health Officers.

 The Government have taken a number of measures to control the manufacture, storage and use of AN fertiliser in the general climate of heightened security.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para4">
We are continuing our dialogue with industry and have asked them to produce a code of practice to encourage direct deliveries from manufacturers to farmers to shorten supply chains and ensure better traceability. We have also endorsed industry guidance, produced in collaboration with farmers unions and the police, on &#039;Security of Fertiliser Storage on Farm&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para5">
To supplement the voluntary measures, Defra has introduced regulations to control the supply of both home produced and imported AN. The regulations require AN fertiliser, with a high nitrogen content, including mixtures, to have satisfied a Detonation Resistance Test and all sellers have to maintain records of sales.

<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para6">
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has issued a self-help checklist to all those known to be handling or storing significant quantities of AN. The checklist has been distributed widely. It is aimed at spreading good&nbsp;practice and offering HSE as a source of further advice. Additionally, HSE has lowered the notification threshold under the Notification of Installations Handling Hazardous Substances Regulations 1982 from 500 to 150 tonnes and widened the range of products to be included in the notifications.

<p><a name="40518w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Pelagic fishing gear is normally used for shoaling mid-water swimming species such as mackerel, pilchards and sprats. Other species of fish may also be taken as a bycatch when pelagic gear is used and these may include demersal species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para10">
Sea bass can be taken in both pelagic (that is, fished in mid-water) and demersal (fished in contact with the seabed) gears and so could be classed as either pelagic or demersal since its behaviour at different times of the year leads it to swim in mid-water or near the bottom.

 The Pig Industry Development Scheme (PIDS) was initiated in March 2001 to establish an industry fund to help provide advice, services, facilities and financial assistance to British pig producers to assist with the prevention of exotic pig diseases such as Classical Swine Fever, and/or to help minimise their impact. Collection of this industry levy was delayed due to the foot and mouth disease outbreak of that year. In April 2001 the then MAFF and the Meat and Livestock Commission concluded a loan agreement to enable early payment of the industry top-up to producers.

<p>
<a name="40518w02.html_para14">
Under the terms of the loan agreement, repayment, including interest, was due on 31&nbsp;July 2003. However problems associated with the unforseen decline in pig slaughterings delayed the collection of the levy from pig producers to repay the loan. By mutual agreement the loan deadline was extended to 31&nbsp;December 2003 and repayment was made by that date, including the interest to that date.

 As Defra&#039;s Final Report into the 2003 Ring Rot Outbreak in the UK makes clear, it has not been possible to trace the origin of infection which resulted in the ring rot outbreak in Wales. However, Appendix VI of the Report (see http://defra.gov.uk/planth/ring/repfinal/app6.pdf) outlines the itinerary for the Provento seed potatoes which were supplied to the Welsh farm, from which the crop was grown which resulted in the outbreak.

<a name="40518w03.html_para0">
In essence, the Dutch report indicates that the seed potatoes were exported from the Netherlands to Honduras on 26&nbsp;September 2002. The consignment was refused entry to Honduras because it did not meet their requirements on the absence of soil (not because of a concern with the potatoes) and was returned to the Netherlands on 5&nbsp;December 2002. Following re-sorting and re-bagging, to remove potatoes which had sprouted, the seed potatoes were split into different lots which were then sent directly to various destinations (Wales, Portugal, Iraq, Honduras and Ukraine) between the period 5&nbsp;December 2002 and 1&nbsp;May 2003.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which species of wildlife <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;inhabit and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;visit Two Tree Island in the Thames during a typical year.  [171871]</p>








<p><a name="40518w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Two Tree Island is split into two areas, eastern and western. The eastern part of Two Tree Island consists of a small tidal island with the adjoining 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 May 2004 : Column 833W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
saltmarsh (86 acres) and a large area of inter-tidal mudflats (271 acres). It is part of Leigh National Nature Reserve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w03.html_para1">
The mudflats are noted for their dense, vigorous growth of eel grass species, which, together with a large resource of invertebrates, support nationally and internationally important numbers of dark-bellied Brent geese and waders, such as grey plover and knot. Waders such as curlew, dunlin, and redshank, occur in significant numbers outside the breeding season. The nearby Leigh cockle sheds bring winter flocks of turnstone close inshore and attract some of the rarer gull species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w03.html_para2">
The saltmarshes are the most important on the north side of the Thames Estuary. They are of considerable botanical interest being noted for the five glasswort species that occur there. Sea aster, with small cord-grass, common cord-grass and glasswort species are found on the lower marshes, while sea purslane dominates the upper marshes. In addition the area also supports other saltmarsh plants such as golden samphire, sea wormwood, common and lax-flowered sea lavenders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w03.html_para3">
At its western tip a range of birds can be seen such as redshank and heron. The island itself consists mainly of grassland and scrub, with the former rubbish tip supporting a number of interesting alien plants and &#039;escapes&#039;. A wide variety of birds can be seen at its western tip, including kestrels and short-eared owls during the winter, hunting for field voles. Grass snakes and lizards are seen. Insects of note include the marbled white butterfly, Roesel&#039;s bush cricket, the house cricket and the lesser marsh grasshopper.

<p><a name="40518w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 As part of its annual application for approval of a core training commitment, each tonnage tax company or group is required to provide a breakdown of the number of deck and engine ratings employed on its ships according to whether they are British, other European Economic Area (EEA), or other, non-EEA, nationality. The company or group is also required to state which of the training and employment recommendations of the Ratings Task Force it expects to implement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w05.html_para0">
Where a company is meeting part of its training commitment in respect of officers by employing apprentices or ratings to officer conversion trainees, this is reported to us on end of period adjustment reports due three times a year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment his Department has made of reductions in traffic accident rates at vehicle activated sign sites; and if he will make a statement.  [171897]</p>








<p><a name="40518w05.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Vehicle activated signs are used predominately where there are concerns about inappropriate speed. They are not designed to deal with excessive speed. Research into the effectiveness of vehicle activated signs at a range of locations was carried out by TRL Ltd. on behalf of the Department for Transport in 2002. Results of this work concluded that across all sites there was a 31&nbsp;per cent. reduction in accidents following installation. In addition where vehicle activated signs were used to remind the driver of the speed limit in force, speed reductions of between three and nine mph were achieved. Where installed to warn drivers of a potential hazard, reductions of up to seven mph were achieved. Guidance on the use of vehicle activated signs is available in the Libraries of the House (Ref: Traffic Advisory Leaflet 1/03&#151;Vehicle Activated Signs).

It will be met if the estimates reported by local authorities through their Business Plan Statistical returns and the regulatory returns from housing associations submitted in July 2004 (stating the number of non-decent homes as at 1&nbsp;April 2004), show that in aggregate the number of non-decent dwellings has reduced by at least one third reduction since 2001; and the 2004&#150;05 continuous EHCS (reporting in October 2005) confirms there are 1.1&nbsp;million or fewer non-decent social sector dwellings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w05.html_para3">
The target was for both sectors combined not each sector separately. Our estimate, based on local authority and registered social landlord (RSL) out-turn data up to the end March 2003 and their plans to March 2004, shows a 26&nbsp;per cent. reduction across both sectors. Local authorities show a 32&nbsp;per cent. reduction taking into account the stock they transferred. There was a 6&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the RSL sector, which takes into account all the non-decent stock they receive through stock transferred from local authorities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w06.html_para2">
The assistance available under KWL is:

</p>
<ul>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w06.html_para3">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not changed the eligibility criteria for the scheme: school teachers in London with seven or more points are eligible for up to &#163;100,000 equity loan assistance; school teachers and Further Education teachers are also eligible for up to &#163;50,000 equity loan assistance. Points are awarded under the scheme for:

The eligibility criteria and the points system for the KWL programme were devised following discussions with the key worker sponsor Departments including Department for Education and Skills.

A key aim of KWL is to retain more experienced teachers in London. Since the scheme was launched we have received over 1,600 applications in London. As the KWL budget is limited, school teachers in London with four points or more are being prioritised for assistance, and those with less than four points are being placed on the waiting list for assistance.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the cost was of gap funding for housing transfers in each year since it was introduced; and what the projected costs are for the next financial year.  [173666]</p>









<p><a name="40518w06.html_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 No gap funding has been paid to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional Housing Boards (RHB) provisional allocations for 2004&#150;05 are &#163;1.029&nbsp;million for the transfer of housing on the Tarling Estate and &#163;1.759&nbsp;million on the Crossways Estate both in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Provisional allocations for 2005&#150;06 are a further &#163;3.564&nbsp;million for the transfer of housing on the Crossways Estate in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and &#163;2.0&nbsp;million for the transfer of the housing stock of North East Lincolnshire Council.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what his estimate is of the annual cost of the extra gap funding he has announced for housing transfers in areas with negative equity; and whether gap funding allocations will be increased for such areas already in the process of transfer.  [173667]</p>








<p><a name="40518w06.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The annual cost of any gap funding will be dependent on those authorities whose decent home delivery option appraisal determines that a negative value transfer is the best value for money option to pursue and who then secure a positive tenant ballot result. Those transfers already on the housing transfer programme have demonstrated they have deliverable transfer schemes and it is not anticipated that they should therefore require gap funding.

<p><a name="40518w06.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much money has been committed to date for setting up arm&#039;s length management organisations for housing transfer; and on what basis this is allocated.  [173668]</p>








<p><a name="40518w06.html_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Expenditure under the arm&#039;s length management organisation (Almo) programme to the end of 2003&#150;04 has been approximately &#163;365&nbsp;million. Current commitments for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 total &#163;952&nbsp;million, subject in some cases to Almos achieving at least a 2* rating from the Housing Inspectorate. Further allocations are subject to the outcome of the 2004 Spending Review. Expenditure on setting up Almos is a matter for the local authorities concerned. Under the Almo option the local authority remains the owner and landlord of the housing stock : no transfer of ownership occurs. Almo funding for work towards the Government&#039;s Decent Homes target is allocated on the basis of local authorities&#039; bids, which are assessed against the criteria set out in the Almo Guidance published in March 2003.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 May 2004 : Column 846W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="40518w06.html_spnew8"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Where tenants have rejected transfer and arm&#039;s length management organisations prior to local authorities being required to have an option appraisal signed off by Government Offices they will be asked to undertake an option appraisal. Guidance on option appraisal makes it clear that local authorities should engage with their tenants from the very beginning of the option appraisal process. The decision on which option to pursue should therefore incorporate the views of tenants before any ballot is held. Effective tenant engagement is a key criterion of the option appraisal assessment process and appraisals will not be signed off unless this has been achieved.

The Community Housing Task Force (CHTF) is the main resource available to assist councils and their tenants in delivering option appraisals. Tenants may also seek advice from their Independent Tenant Adviser (ITA). Further training and capacity building for tenants to help them with options appraisal is funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and provided via the Tenant Participation Advisory Service (TPAS), PEP and the National Tenants Resource Centre (NTRC).

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit has commissioned into the barriers that stop sport and renewal working together more closely.  [173708]</p>








<p><a name="40518w07.html_spnew0"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit (NRU) has recently received the report from a study on joint working between sport and neighbourhood renewal agencies. The research aims were to identify existing arrangements for joint working, to highlight barriers to further integration, and to provide suggestions for overcoming these in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w07.html_para0">
The report finds that at both the regional and local levels, joint working is generally underdeveloped. Where joint working does occur, projects are rarely focused on the achievement of well-defined outcomes or targeted towards influencing mainstream services. There is incomplete data on sporting participation in deprived areas and amongst specific groups. There are also few explicit targets for raising participation and a lack of incentives for joint working. Nevertheless, there are some noteworthy examples of joint strategic working between local authority health and education Departments and sport&#151;in ways that will impact on deprived areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w07.html_para1">
In response to these findings, the NRU has produced a short practitioner guide for local and regional decision-makers and frontline workers in both sports and regeneration organisations. It explains the importance of linking sport and renewal activities, provides practical advice on how to do this, and shows where to find further resources and help.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on progress on the consultation on the operation of home sellers&#039; packs.  [173867]</p>








<p><a name="40518w07.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Wide-ranging consultation and extensive research by independent contractors have endorsed the benefits of home information packs in helping to make the home buying and selling process easier and more certain. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working closely with industry and consumer stakeholders on the detail of the proposals in order to ensure a smooth introduction of mandatory home information packs from January 2007. Many home buyers and sellers will not have to wait until 2007 to benefit from home information packs. An increasing number of estate agents, surveyors and conveyancers are operating pack schemes on a voluntary basis.


</p>







<p><a name="40518w07.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what discussions he has had on the proposal by chartered surveyors to remove mandatory home condition reports from home sellers packs.  [173868]</p>








<p><a name="40518w07.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 None. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) supports the Government&#039;s proposals for mandatory home information packs, including a home condition report. These reports will provide at the start of the transaction process reliable information about the condition of the property. This information is important to the decisions buyers and sellers need to make and, along with other components of home information pack, will make home buying and selling more transparent and more certain.


</p>







<p><a name="40518w07.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research he has undertaken on possible legal and insurance claims against surveyors in advance of the introduction of home condition reports.  [173869]</p>

<p><a name="40518w07.html_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Home Inspectors preparing the home condition report will be required to have appropriate indemnity insurance to protect the home seller, a potential or actual buyer, and mortgage lender. With assistance from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Association of British Insurers and other industry stakeholders, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is carrying out research into the insurance requirements. This includes an analysis by insurance specialists Willis Ltd. of historic claims made against surveyors for negligent surveys to determine the average number of successful and unsuccessful claims as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the average sum paid and the cost of claims administration. We expect to publish an interim report very shortly.


</p>







<p><a name="40518w07.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what charge he estimates will be levied for home condition reports.  [173870]</p>








<p><a name="40518w07.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The home condition report will be a professional and objective report on the condition and energy efficiency of the property, which can be legally relied upon by sellers, buyers and mortgage lenders. It will be for the market to determine the price of home condition reports in practice and the point at which any charge is paid. Based on current prices, it is estimated that the report will cost about &#163;300 on average (plus VAT). This estimate is based on a report on a three bedroom semi-detached house in a provincial town and can be compared with the typical costs of a building survey (&#163;500 plus VAT) and mortgage lenders valuation report (&#163;180).

<p><a name="40518w07.html_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The initial view of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is that the introduction of home information packs (HIPs) is unlikely to have a significant effect on property prices. This is supported by evidence from other countries that have introduced similar measures and by a survey carried out by the UK&#039;s largest estate agency group which suggested there would be little impact on the number of properties sold if HIPs were introduced. We will continue to keep this assessment under review during our discussions with stakeholders and consumer representatives on the final contents of the HIP.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what investigations have been carried out by his Department on the reliability of the drugs tests currently available.  [161181]</p>








<p><a name="40518w09.html_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Drug testing technology and its reliability is kept under constant review by the Home Office due to its applicability to roadside impairment testing and its relevance in the workplace. The extent and definition of &#039;reliability&#039; in these different settings is by nature of the criminal law different in each case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w09.html_para7">
Recently there has been research on the reliability of different methods of drug testing carried out by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) for the specific purpose of testing persons in custody suites to see if they have used drugs. The research used saliva as a point-of-contact using the Cozart RapiScan TM electronic test strip reader, one of few commercially available on-site testing kits for oral fluid (saliva). Overall, the results of this study revealed that saliva based testings are not reliable enough to evidence impairment for the purposes of charge for driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w09.html_para8">
In the workplace, the requirements of the criminal law do not have to be met and it is up to employers to decide what margin of proof is required to consider action against specific employees. Saliva, urine, hair analysis or blood tests may all be sufficiently reliable. The Home Office does provides guidance on the various types of tests available to any companies who seek advice, which suggests that some tests are more reliable than others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w09.html_para9">
In the July 2004, an independent inquiry report on drugs testing in the workplace will review some of the complex and wide reaching issues surrounding drug testing in the workplace including the reliability of different testing devices. The report will be the first attempt to give a full picture of drug testing in the workplace and will include recommendations to government, employers and other relevant bodies.

 The power to close premises has been widely welcomed and applauded by both the police who use it and the communities to whom its use has provided immediate relief from the blight of drug supply and use, and associated antisocial behaviour. This power provides a genuinely effective tool to tackle nightmare premises such as &#039;crack houses&#039;. The power has been used at least 19 times in our Anti Social Behaviour Trailblazer sites alone since January and indications from discussions with the police and courts suggest that the power may have been used over 100 times in England and Wales.

<p><a name="40518w11.html_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 13&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The general principles which govern the allocation of funds received from the confiscation of criminal assets under proceeds of crime legislation, are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(a)</i> to build asset recovery capacity in front line law enforcement and prosecuting agencies as a contribution to crime reduction;</p>

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(c)</i> to recycle a proportion of the proceeds of crime into community based crime reduction projects.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w11.html_para1">
The Recovered Assets Incentive Fund was set up last financial year to incentivise asset recovery by asset recovery agencies including law enforcement and prosecuting authorities. &#163;15.5&nbsp;million a year for three years has been allocated to the fund. The funds have been fully committed to projects, agreed by the Association of Chief Police Officers and others that will increase the confiscation of criminal assets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w11.html_para2">
Of &#163;46.5&nbsp;million that will be available under the fund over three years, up to &#163;12&nbsp;million a year has been allocated to set up four new multi-agency Regional Asset Recovery Teams (RARTs) to disrupt organised crime groups, confiscate more criminal assets and to tackle money laundering. A successful pilot in the West Midlands has been rolled out to the North West, North East, Wales and London. The teams have been operational since February and comprise staff from the police, National Crime Squad, Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Excise, National Criminal Intelligence Service, Crown Prosecution Service, Assets Recovery Agency and the Inland Revenue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w11.html_para4">
Last year &#163;4&nbsp;million was allocated to the Adventure Capital Fund to regenerate communities across England. &#163;3&nbsp;million was allocated to regional government offices, of which &#163;1.5&nbsp;million funded anti-gun crime initiatives and &#163;1.5&nbsp;million funded capacity building in crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Of the &#163;7&nbsp;million available this year, &#163;3&nbsp;million has been committed to funding a community justice centre pilot scheme in Liverpool; &#163;2&nbsp;million to fund support services for victims of sexual offences in England and Wales; and &#163;2&nbsp;million to fund new and existing projects to tackle gun crime in England and Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w11.html_para5">
On 24&nbsp;February I announced a new police incentivisation scheme to be introduced in 2004&#150;05 that will enable police forces in England and Wales, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to receive a share of the criminal assets they recover locally, in the following year. Separate arrangements exist in Scotland. The scheme has the full support of the Association of Chief Police Officers in England and Wales. Police forces will benefit by receiving a third of all the recovered assets above &#163;40&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05, increasing to half for 2005&#150;06. The maximum benefit available to the police will be &#163;43&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05 rising to &#163;65&nbsp;million in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2005&#150;06. The Government will be using the first &#163;40&nbsp;million to help fund existing commitments in the asset recovery field.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w11.html_para6">
There will be no restrictions on how the police should spend this money so there may be scope in the future for them to devote some of the funds to community-based projects aimed at crime reduction. We are currently considering how we might be able to extend the scheme to 2006&#150;07 and beyond.

<p class="tabletext">In April, Swansea Safer Partnership contacted the Action Line about the procedure for obtaining a closure order on a property which was causing serious nuisance. This included intimidation and harassment of residents, drug paraphernalia and other dangerous items lying around, as well as high numbers of people entering and leaving the premises. CCTV footage showed up to 100 visitors in a 24-hour period. The ActionLine advised Swansea on the process and sent through a detailed example of how a similar problem had been tackled elsewhere. Safer Swansea Partnership secured a closure order&#151;the first one in Wales.</p>

The Government are working hard to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol enters into force and is effective. The Government&#039;s focus has been on securing full compliance with the obligations under the Protocol&#039;s first commitment period; these do not of course apply to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing countries. However, DFID is also considering how the UK should engage in a future debate about wider commitments. This includes looking at ways in which developing countries can become more engaged in the debate on global greenhouse gas mitigation on terms that will allow them to follow clean development paths whilst meeting their development and poverty reduction objectives. The Department for International Development will be working closely with our partners in tackling these issues.

The economic and security implications are loss of income through unemployment, lack of access to education and health care and increased vulnerability.

3.&nbsp;Persistent poverty using this definition is measured over four-year periods. The table presents figures for the most recent seven four-year periods.<br>

4.&nbsp;Estimates are for Great Britain.<br>

5.&nbsp;The definition used in the answer is used in the Government&#039;s Opportunity for all report (Cm 5956), which is available in the Library. This gives indicators of persistent low income for children, working age adults and older people using both 60 and 70&nbsp;per cent. of overall median income as the thresholds for low income.<br>

6.&nbsp;Using four-year windows to estimate the proportion in persistent low income, and the way in which response patterns vary within each of the survey years, has meant that it is not possible to present robust estimates of the numbers in persistent poverty using the BHPS survey. For this reason, proportions have been presented.<br>

1.&nbsp;Data are not available by parliamentary constituency.<br>

2.&nbsp;Blackpool South parliamentary constituency used to be part of Blackpool Social Fund District. This District was involved in a very complex interlocking set of boundary changes affecting an area from North Cumbria to Norfolk, which took place from September 2002 to June 2003. In May 2003, Blackpool Social Fund District was combined with Preston Social Fund District and parts of South West Lancashire, and Lancaster and South Cumbria Social Fund Districts to form Lancashire West Jobcentre Plus District. The two areas for which data are given in the table are thus different, so the data is not comparable.<br>

3.&nbsp;Sure Start maternity grants were introduced on 27&nbsp;March 2000. The very small number of cases for 1999&#150;2000 has been excluded for data protection reasons.<br>

<p><a name="40518w17.html_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Recent figures show that there were 5.2&nbsp;million households in 2002&#150;03 who paid more net council tax than income tax; in 1997&#150;98 there were 4.8&nbsp;million. The majority of these are pensioner

The Government have increased the aged personal allowances by at least 7.7&nbsp;per cent. in real terms since 1997. No pensioner aged 65 or over will pay income tax on income of less that &#163;131 a week in 2004&#150;05.

Council tax benefit (CTB) exists to help those on low incomes with their council tax bills. However, many of those eligible for CTB do not claim their entitlement. The Government have therefore been running a campaign alongside local councils to boost take-up. A tailored claim form has been introduced for pensioners; the restriction on the amount of CTB for those people living in Band F, G or H properties was removed in April 2004.

Council tax consumes a greater proportion of the incomes of older pensioners&#151;who have little or no opportunity to increase their incomes&#151;than it does for other households. Alongside CTB the Government believe it is right to help older pensioners with their council tax so that pensioner households with someone aged over 70 will this year receive a &#163;100 payment to help with their council tax bills. This is in addition to the winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for all over 60s households, &#163;300 for over 80s households. Furthermore the Government have introduced the pension credit, increased the basic state pension by the higher of 2.5&nbsp;per cent. or price inflation, introduced free TV licences for households with someone aged over 75 or over&#151;and the free eye test, free prescriptions and concessionary travel for those aged over 60.

<p><a name="40518w20.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 Government is determined that companies and other organisations should not be prevented from carrying out their legitimate activities by intimidation and harassment from animal rights extremists. Ministers and officials from the DTI have frequent meetings with colleagues in the Home Office, and in other Government Departments, to discuss the impact of animal rights extremism on biomedical research in the UK, including the pharmaceutical industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w20.html_para0">
We have made a number of changes to strengthen the law to deal with extremists. The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 strengthened police powers to deal with smaller, intimidatory protests and office occupations by extremists. Government has funded a new police unit to provide tactical guidance on policing extremists. A National Forum on policing and prosecution of animal rights cases has been set up to work on improving both operational policing and legislative measures. We are also considering as a matter of urgency what further legislation may be necessary.

 <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;The DTI has no plans to reintroduce licensing arrangements for the private recruitment industry and there is no general support for such a proposal. Licensing schemes, particularly those where a fee is demanded, are burdensome for business and that burden falls especially heavily on small enterprises: The licensing arrangements required by the Employment Agencies Act 1973, which were repealed in 1995 proved not to be effective and were replaced by a new power, introduced under the 1973 Act, to prohibit unsuitable persons from running employment agencies and employment businesses for up to 10 years. The Government does not hesitate to make use of this power where this is warranted.

 The Government recently introduced the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003. These include a new requirement that an employment agency can only charge a fee, for providing work-finding services for people in certain occupations in the entertainment, modelling and sports sectors, out of the work-seekers&#039; earnings in any such employment that the agency has found for them. This requirement has outlawed the practice of unscrupulous agencies, which took money from workers in the entertainment and modelling sectors but offered little or no work.

Between 130,000 and 160,000 people were expected to have benefited from the October 2003 uprating of the National Minimum Wage.

has to employ additional trained staff to assist defendants with completing means inquiry forms.  [173121]</p>








<p><a name="40518w22.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 One of the key measures in the Courts Act 2003 is the introduction of Fines Officers who will lead on collecting and enforcing financial penalties. Among other things they and their teams will help defendants complete means enquiry forms. The Fines Officer role is currently being piloted at six Magistrates&#039; Courts Committees, namely Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Devon and Cornwall, Gloucestershire and South Yorkshire.

 Fines will no longer be written off. They will be pursued until they are paid. The new policy to deliver this was introduced on 5&nbsp;January 2004.

<p><a name="40518w22.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Data on the percentage of courts in England and Wales where it is possible to make regular cash payments is not held centrally. Magistrates&#039; Courts Committees provide a range of convenient payment methods to offenders including cheque, credit card, debit card, postal order, cash deposit boxes, &#039;Paypoint&#039; and &#039;Girobank&#039; but not all have cash offices in every court.

We plan to double the size of the current pilot from September by making the adult learning grant available across the South-East and North-East regions. We are also considering how other existing funds for supporting adult learners in further education and training can best support the priorities of the Skills Strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w22.html_para3">
Proposals for improving the package of financial support for undergraduates were announced in January at Commons Second Reading of the Higher Education Bill. This includes introduction of a non-repayable grant of up to &#163;2,700 each year for students from lower income backgrounds. We are improving the package of support for part-time students, many of whom are mature. In 2004&#150;05 part time students on low incomes will be able to get a grant of up to &#163;575 for fees and a grant of up to &#163;250 for course costs. We will continue to provide additional, targeted financial support for vulnerable students, through Higher Education institutions, to ensure that more of them are able to access and remain in higher education.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The financial data are taken from Sefton LEAs&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2.&nbsp;The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3.&nbsp;Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>





4.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year and pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

5.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

6.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

7.&nbsp;Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The financial data are taken from Manchester LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2.&nbsp;The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

3.&nbsp;Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

5.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

6.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

7.&nbsp;Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Prior to 2002 national level analyses by pupil characteristic were not possible.

The introduction of the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) in 2002 meant that for the first time pupil characteristic information could be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matched to pupil attainment data, allowing comparisons of the performance of different groups of pupils.

<p><a name="40518w26.html_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Further education colleges are independent corporations which set their own pay and recruitment arrangements. However, we are increasing the total funding for FE by &#163;1.2 billion between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06 (19&nbsp;per cent. in real terms) and increasing flexibility in the use of this money. This will give colleges more scope to meet local recruitment and retention needs.

We also support colleges through the following specific recruitment and retention initiatives:

<p><a name="40518w26.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The DfES does not hold information on student numbers for individual constituencies. However, we estimate that there will be about 3,900 extra sixteen year olds in the North West Region in further education this September who would not be participating without EMA. Salford is an EMA pilot area and at present there are 1,200 students in receipt of EMA.

The 2002 Spending review settlement allows for an expansion in the numbers of young people in FE. The additional funding takes account of the impact of EMA in further education colleges.

<p><a name="40518w26.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The Secretary of State has not been involved in any discussions on this issue. The Learning and Skills Council and Warrington Borough Council have been chairing a working group looking at skills needs in relation to the site (the Omega Skills Challenge Group). The group includes representatives of local higher education institutions. This is a prudent measure, and does not pre-empt any decision on the planning application to develop the site.

[173897]</p>








<p><a name="40518w26.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The overall school and LEA funding system recognises the higher costs of recruiting and retaining staff in some areas by giving these LEAs, including inner London LEAs like Greenwich, additional resource through an Area Cost Adjustment.

Teachers are able to apply for this new scheme which builds on the foundations laid by the Starter Homes Initiative which since September 2001 has been helping key workers to buy homes in areas where high house prices undermine recruitment and retention.

We have identified the need to assist those potential future leaders who wish to remain in London but may have otherwise chosen to leave as a result of prohibitive housing costs. Over the next two years we will be aiming to assist 1,000 of these teachers by offering equity loans of up to &#163;100,000 to help them purchase property within travelling distance of their schools. In addition, there will also be another strand to the scheme which will make available equity loans of up to &#163;50,000 to qualifying experienced teachers. Finally, newly qualified teachers will not be excluded and will be eligible to receive support through the Shared Ownership and Intermediate Renting strands of the new scheme.

<p><a name="40518w27.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Swire: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what monitoring of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;geographical distribution of funding and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;equal opportunity the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) carries out in order to ensure that it provides potential students with equal and fair access to LSC-funded provision.  [174034]</p>









<p><a name="40518w27.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC decides on allocations at individual college and regional level. Information about these allocations is not collected by the Department. This is a matter for the LSC. Mark Haysom, the Council&#039;s Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Gentleman with this information and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w27.html_para0">
The LSC&#039;s equal opportunities remit was established by the Learning and Skills Act 2000. The Council is required to publish an annual report on the arrangements it has made during the year, how effective they were and the plans for the following year. A copy of the report must be sent to the Secretary of State. The last such report was published in November 2003 and a copy of the Department&#039;s response is available via the Department&#039;s website.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what targets he has set for the number of small and medium-sized enterprises engaged with the Modern Apprenticeship scheme in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;2003&#150;04 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;2004&#150;05; what measures he has developed for assessing employer engagement in Modern Apprenticeships; and if he will make a statement.  [169470]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 May 2004 : Column 924W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40518w27.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> We have not set any targets for the number of SMEs to be engaged in Apprenticeships. The &quot;Learning and Training at Work&quot; survey assesses employer involvement in apprenticeships by firm size and sector. The last survey in 2002 revealed that 5&nbsp;per cent. of employers were involved in Advanced Modern Apprenticeships and 4&nbsp;per cent. were involved in Foundation Modern Apprenticeships. This equates to around 36,000 employers of which two-thirds are SMEs. The Department and Learning and Skills Council are considering the most effective way to collect data on employer involvement in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w27.html_para1">
It is crucial, however, to the success of Apprenticeships and in meeting the high demand from young people, that more employers, including SMEs, are involved. Therefore on 10&nbsp;May 2004, a television advertising campaign started directed at engaging with more employers and there will be direct marketing to employers of all sizes. The Modern Apprenticeship Task Force, chaired by Sir Roy Gardner, has increasing employer engagement as its primary function and good progress is being made. The taskforce is due to report in autumn 2004.

<a name="40518w27.html_para2">
The majority of capital support is now allocated to schools and local education authorities by formula, and they decide how to invest it in line with their asset management plans. The Department does not, therefore, have complete information about capital investment at constituency level; this should be held at local authority level.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The financial data are taken from Lancashire LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;00 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. Figures up to and including 1997&#150;98 figures are for Lancashire LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&#150;99 onwards parts of Lancashire LEA became Blackpool and Blackburn LEAs. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;00. 1999&#150;00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>





2.&nbsp;The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3.&nbsp;Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

5.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

6.&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

7.&nbsp;Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

 The small numbers of maternal deaths in Northern Ireland preclude any robust statistical analysis of maternal death by mode of delivery. Wider literature from within the United Kingdom does indicate that whilst mortality rates for mothers are low no matter how delivered, caesarean section does carry a slightly increased relative risk compared to that for all deliveries.

With regard to mortality and morbidity in infants, without differentiating the underlying reasons for sections (emergency or planned), it is impossible to establish any direct correlation between mode of delivery and the nature of the subsequent morbidity.

As in England, Northern Ireland schools benefit each year from an additional budget allocation over and above their Local Management of Schools (LMS) delegated budgets. There is on-going provision for this in my Department&#039;s baseline for 2005&#150;06. As the 2005&#150;06 allocations for English schools do not represent additions to planned allocations, the question of additional allocations for either English or Northern Ireland schools does not arise.

<p><a name="40518w35.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 There has been an increase in the use of contraceptive injections administered in family planning clinics among girls aged under 16, in the last five years. There is currently very low uptake of non-user dependent methods of contraception in women of all ages. Increasing and improving access to all methods of contraception are aims of both the teenage pregnancy strategy and the sexual health and HIV strategy, to reduce rates of unintended pregnancies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w35.html_para1">
Decisions about the most suitable type of contraception are for individuals to make in consultation with health professionals. Health professionals can provide contraception to young people under 16, working within an established legal framework, provided they are satisfied that the young person is competent to fully understand the implications of any treatment and to make a choice of the treatment involved.

<p><a name="40518w39.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14&nbsp;May 2004]: &quot;</i>The New NHS&quot;, published in 1997 set out a vision for the national health service and for primary care trusts (PCTs) as a key driver to improve health and make the NHS modern and dependable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w39.html_para0">
This was followed by two key guidance documents. The first document, issued in April 1999, &quot;Primary Care Trusts Establishing Better Services&quot;, sought to address questions about how PCTs would be established and the principles for coverage and size. This was followed up with &quot;Primary Care Trusts: Establishment, the preparatory period and their Function&quot;, which provided additional guidance on PCT boundaries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40518w39.html_para1">
Neither document specified numbers of, or population to be covered by PCTs. The function of PCTs is to meet local health care needs by making local decisions that respond to the community. PCTs were encouraged to centre around natural communities and to seek coterminosity with other bodies where appropriate. However, the overriding principle for determining a PCT boundary is a coherent and cogent focus on meeting the needs of all people living within that community.

Cancer networks across England are currently drawing up action plans to implement the guidance. Progress in implementing the guidance will be assessed during the next round of peer review due to start later this year.

In addition, as part of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP), all general practitioners in England have been sent an evidence-based resource pack to help them counsel men worried about prostate cancer. The PCRMP is reducing geographical variation across England by: standardising guidelines for GPs; standardising information for patients; and providing explicit quality standards for prostate cancer testing.

In November 2002, the National Health Service Appointments Commission (the body responsible for making appointments to NHS boards) instructed the Nuffield Centre at Leeds University to carry out an analysis of the candidates appointed by the Commission and their political activity. The research found that the higher number of Labour activists appointed largely reflected the higher proportion of Labour activists that applied; and did not suggest any systematic preference for one political party over another.

Some members refuse to accept any payment, so it would not be possible to calculate the figure that trusts, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities actually pay out to their board members without going to all the individual bodies for the information. Therefore, the information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
