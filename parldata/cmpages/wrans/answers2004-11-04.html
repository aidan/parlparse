 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the percentage of compensation payments for animals destroyed because of <i>(a)</i> suspected foot and mouth and <i>(b)</i> bovine tuberculosis which may have been paid at above the level of average market values in each of the past five years.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41104w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No estimate has been made of what percentage of the compensation payments for animals compulsorily slaughtered because of FMD in 2001 were above the level of average market values. The average value for each type of livestock increased during the epidemic, peaked in May 2001 and gradually declined. No compensation for FMD was paid in each of the other four years.

<p>
<a name="41104w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">For bovine tuberculosis it is not possible to provide a meaningful assessment of the percentage of animals that might have received compensation over and above &quot;average market values&quot;. However, there is evidence to show that the provision of above market value compensation has been a significant problem in England and Wales, particularly since the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in 2001. This is one of the reasons why my Department will shortly be consulting stakeholders on a proposed new compensation system.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the number of households in <i>(a)</i> Lancashire and <i>(b)</i> Chorley which (i) composted and (ii) recycled in the last period for which figures are available.  [194623]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41104w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Local authorities do not currently report on the number of households participating in recycling and composting schemes, or the numbers that carry out home composting. The 2002&#150;03 Municipal Waste Management Survey established that 14.5 per cent. of household waste in England was recycled, about one third of which was centrally composted. Chorley borough council recycled and composted 16 per cent. of household waste, and Lancashire county council 20 per cent. The Government&#039;s Best Value Performance Indicators for local authorities show that in 2002&#150;03, 86 per cent. of the population of Chorley were served by a kerbside collection scheme, or lived within 1 km of a recycling centre. The regional average for Lancashire was 80.3 per cent.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41104w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 November 2004]</i>: Waste is a devolved issue.

The latest (2001) Defra survey of public attitudes to quality of life and to the environment found that in England, paper was recycled on a regular basis by 53 per cent. of households, glass by 42 per cent. cans by 30 per cent., plastic by 23 per cent. and kitchen waste by 20 per cent. Local authorities do not report on the number of households participating in recycling schemes or on the numbers that carry out home composting, but the 2002&#150;03 Municipal Waste Management Survey identified that 14.5 per cent. of household waste was recycled in England, about one third of which was centrally composted. Audited figures for 2003&#150;04 are expected in December.

<p><a name="qnpa_0">(2) what representations she has received from Fleetwood fishermen on effects of the operation of the Cod Recovery Plan on the plaice fishery in the Eastern Irish Sea; and what action she has taken in response.  [192953]</p>









<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41104w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I have met representatives of the Fleetwood fishing industry on several occasions this year. They expressed concerns that the EU days at sea scheme did not allow them sufficient days to use their preferred 100mm plus nets to target plaice and that they were therefore forced to use smaller mesh nets (which attracted a higher number of days) and thus increase their catches of undersized and juvenile fish. My officials explained that the scheme did, in fact, allow them to continue with their normal fishing patterns and offered to provide individual guidance, where required, to the fishermen concerned&#151;which was subsequently taken up. Separately, we are discussing with the commission potential improvements to the operation of the scheme for the benefit of fishermen generally.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41104w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b>

<a name="41104w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_25">Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is an important element of the Government&#039;s new energy policy, as set out in the Energy White Paper. While developing the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the Government undertook analysis to assess whether the proposed methodology would act as a disincentive to good quality CHP capacity. This analysis concluded that, on average, the baseline methodology used for the National Allocation Plan published earlier this year resulted in a baseline emissions level that was no lower for CHP plants than for installations in the power stations sector. It was therefore decided that the allocations to CHP should be calculated on the same basis as for other installations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41104w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_26">However, following consultation earlier in the year on whether various types of change to installations would be eligible to apply for a free allocation of allowances from the new entrant reserve, the Government have now decided to seek the Commission&#039;s agreement to extending eligibility to include, among other things, significant increases in the &quot;good quality&quot; capacity of CHP schemes. New combined heat and power (CHP) installations <sup>1</sup>  which come online from 1 January 2004 onwards will also be eligible for allowances from the new entry reserve (NER).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41104w04.html_para2">

<a name="41104w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">Emissions trading is potentially an efficient and cost effective way to achieve emissions reductions. Installations covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (including some universities) have the opportunity to benefit from trading by reducing their emissions below the number of allowances allocated by Government and selling these on the EU market.

<p>
<a name="41104w04.html_para4">

For example, Artsreach and Dorset Dance Forum will each receive over &#163;50,000 from Arts Council England in 2005&#150;06, representing increases of 73 per cent. and 55 per cent. respectively compared with 2002&#150;03. Ten feature films and television programmes have been filmed in and around South Dorset in the past two years and a number of film projects have received Lottery funding, including the Purbeck Film Festival.

This support is aimed at helping smaller museums develop their documentation and funding a second museum development officer post for the county.

Notes:<br>

For the years 1999&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by the Office for National Statistics to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291: Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303: Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0: Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571: Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860: Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2003 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10: Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70: Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73: Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74: Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45: Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Neither of these systems provides information on patient outcomes, including death, but an in-depth study of deaths possibly related to health care acquired infections (including MRSA) is being commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer.

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="41104w16.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The report of an independent review of access to yellow card scheme was published in May 2004 and my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Lord Warner, immediately accepted the recommendation to introduce a system of direct patient reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). An expert working group of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) has been established to advise on how best to develop effective patient reporting nationally, including aspects of communication and evaluation. The expert working group is chaired by Dr. Patricia Wilkie, a lay-member of the CSM; is multidisciplinary, has broad representation and has met twice to date. Work has commenced on the development of pilot patient reporting schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41104w16.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_118">In advance of the first formal pilot, the MHRA has already begun work on a pre-pilot survey of patients who have experienced suspected adverse drug reactions during the last year, so the patient perspective can be built into the development of pilot schemes from the outset. Invitations to patients to be involved in this survey, which will help to shape the future design of direct patient reporting systems are going out this week, to coincide with &quot;Ask About Medicines&quot; week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41104w16.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_119">The independent review of access to the yellow card scheme also includes recommendations to strengthen the scheme by raising public awareness of the important role the scheme has in protecting public health. The report recommends that a communications strategy should be developed to improve professional and public education and provision of information about the yellow card scheme and that the scheme should receive greater emphasis during the clinical training of all health professionals, whether they prescribe or not. These specific recommendations are being considered in conjunction with the other recommendations in the report.

 A project for the replacement of the Government of Ghana&#039;s Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD2) was agreed between Britain and Ghana in May 1999. The total commitment was &#163;3.5 million, of which &#163;1.5 million was designated for contracts for goods and services and &#163;2 million was designated for financial aid to the Government of Ghana. The projected completion date was October 2000. When that date was reached, expenditure amounted to &#163;2.3 million, of which &#163;1.2 million had been spent on contracts for goods and services and &#163;1.1 million had been spent on financial aid. However, DFID decided that there were serious obstacles to the achievement of the project&#039;s objectives, and informed the Government of Ghana that the funding commitment would not be extended.

<a name="stpa_124">The issue of access is key to the precarious humanitarian situation in Darfur and the rest of Sudan. Humanitarian access has been improving. In the initial stages of the crisis the humanitarian community faced many obstacles in responding to the situation. Significant pressure was placed on the Government of Sudan by the UK and others to help ensure the entry and movement of humanitarian staff, commodities, and equipment into Darfur. As a result, the Government of Sudan have made positive steps in enhancing access and DFID is monitoring the situation. This progress is reflected in the rise in the number humanitarian staff operating in Darfur. This has increased from 2,043 staff of which 322 were international on 1 July 2004 to a figure of 6,154 staff on 1 October, of which 779 were international.

Access by the UN to people involved has gradually improved. In the UN&#039;s most recent Humanitarian Needs Profile (1 October), it reported that it had reached 88 per cent. of the 2 million people affected by the conflict. The level of access differs from 98 per cent. of the affected population in West Darfur to 89 per cent. in North Darfur, and 73 per cent. in South Darfur.

<p>
<a name="41104w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_125">Humanitarian access in Darfur mainly depends on two factors: the degree of insecurity on the ground and road and weather conditions. Although the UN has agreed operating procedures with the Sudan Liberation Movement, access to Sudan Liberation Army-held areas remains problematic due to recent restrictions imposed by the rebel groups as well as several security incidents. Across the rest of the country, the picture is mixed, It is still difficult for some agencies to access areas such as Southern Blue Nile and parts of Kassla State (Hamesh Koreb). Elsewhere, access is better, although the security situation can change at short notice.

 There are currently 19 publicly funded town centre CCTV systems installed across Northern Ireland for the purposes of tackling crime and antisocial behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41104w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_132">The former Police Authority for Northern Ireland who handled the allocation of funding for most of the town centre schemes in Northern Ireland, required each individual scheme to arrange an evaluation of their performance in the two years after the CCTV system became operational. All evaluations received to date indicate that in the areas where CCTV was in operation, crime was reduced or, the rate of increase was slower than other areas and the level of detection of crime increased. In some areas the level of reported crime increased as the cameras witnessed crimes not normally reported, thought this was usually combined with an increase in detection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41104w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_133">It is also important to point out that levels of recorded crime have fallen across Northern Ireland over the past two years. This is due to a number of factors, including improved police performance. However, I have little doubt that CCTV has also played a part in this reduction.

<a name="stpa_164">One of the recommendations of the Home Office-led Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) report was that the movement of vehicles between motor traders, as well as in and out of the trade, should be recorded. An electronic system for this purpose will be introduced by DVLA in 2005. This will ensure that DVLA will have details of where such vehicles are at any time, and which traders are involved.

<p><a name="st_228"><a name="41104w27.html_spmin1"><b>The Advocate-General for Scotland:</b> 
 Since 25 October, 23 devolution issues have been intimated to me. 19 of these issues were in the civil sphere and concerned personal injury actions in respect of prison conditions. The remaining four devolution issues related to criminal matters, including pre-trial delay, self-incrimination under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, the use of lay justices to determine criminal proceedings in the district courts and one case which raises issues about both the lack of an appeal to the House of Lords in extradition proceedings in Scotland under the Extradition Act 2003, and a challenge to Ministers of the Scottish Executive in relation to extradition proceedings.
