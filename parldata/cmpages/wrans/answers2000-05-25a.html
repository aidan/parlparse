<a name="00525w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the funds required to clear the current backlog of repairs to and modernisation programmes of local authority housing stock; and how much this figure represents per dwelling.  [123013]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00525w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We estimate, on the basis of sample data collected in the 1996 English House Condition Survey, that the backlog of renovation work on the council housing stock amounts to around &#163;10 billion with a further &#163;9 billion being required for improvement/ modernisation work. This equates to an average of between &#163;5,500 and &#163;6,000 a dwelling. The renovation backlog will have been tackled in around a quarter of a million homes by March 2002 as a result of the extra resources we have made available for housing investment.

 I am not aware of any studies currently under way on this issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 12 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 485W, on housing, what plans he has to include guidance to local authorities and fire authorities on the standard of fire safety provision for houses in multiple occupation, in the guidance documents that accompany the draft legislation; and whether that guidance will include reference to the installation of residential automatic fire sprinkler systems.

<P>
<a name="00525w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 As we indicated in the Housing Green Paper we are developing a housing health and safety rating system to replace the existing housing fitness standard. Within this we envisage risk-based guidance on

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> The list of main waste disposal facilities in the east of England, in order of quantity of waste dealt with, is given in the table. For the purpose of this response, a main waste disposal facility is taken to mean their taking in excess of 90,000 tonnes of waste per year. The figures relate to 1998-99 (or the nearest available year).

<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para1">

<BR>
I refer to the recent questions you asked The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions regarding progress of the Abnormal Indivisible Loads Notification System which is being developed for the Highways Agency under tender number 3/276. The Secretary of State has asked me to provide you with a detailed reply since it concerns an operational matter for the Highways Agency.
<BR>
The contractor (W. S. Atkins) has yet to appoint the independent checker to evaluate the structural software associated with the system. However this remains a contractual requirement and will be undertaken prior to the completion of the trial. This element of the system is subject to the Highways Agency's Technical Approval procedures. Consequently, the appointment of the independent checker will be subject to the agreement of the Highways Agency as the Technical Approval Authority.
<BR>
It was envisaged that the internal trial of the Abnormal Indivisible Loads computer system would be carried out (in Highways Agency Maintenance Area 2) following a six month development period, and once the system had been checked and validated to the satisfaction of the Highways Agency's Designated Officer. The contract was awarded on 11 October 1999 and is scheduled to run for a period of twelve months. However, amendments to the contract programme agreed by the Highways Agency have resulted in the validation testing being delayed from 10 April 2000 until 10 July 2000 with a start revised date for the internal trial of the 1 August 2000. Final delivery of software was originally due 12 months after contract award, following the development and trial phases. It is now programmed for 11 January 2001.
<BR>
A programme for external application (in other Highways Agency Maintenance Areas) of the automated abnormal load system has yet to be finalised. This will depend on the outcome of the trial and agreement between other interests responsible for dealing with abnormal loads including DETR, local highway authorities and other bridge owners.
<BR>
I hope this provides you with the information you require. However, should you wish to discuss the project further, our Designated Officer for the contract, Martin Lynch, would be pleased to hear from you. He can be contacted on Tel: 0117 987 8560.

<a name="00525w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department did not hold any formal consultation before the Government's new HFC policy was announced in the draft climate change programme, which was published for consultation on 9 March 2000. However, officials have been involved in meetings that have taken place at international and European level between technical experts, industry representatives, officials from other countries and officials from the environment and enterprise sections of the European Commission on the use and projected trends in emissions of hydrofluorocarbons.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para2">In addition my Department commissioned a report in 1998 from March Consulting Group to provide updated annual UK emissions data for HFCs, PFCs and SF <sub>6</sub>  in each user sector. This also covered projects to 2020 and assessed the costs and benefits of options to reduce future emissions. In compiling their report, March Consulting Group consulted many companies within the UK air conditioning and refrigeration industry, and industry was given the opportunity to comment on the report.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para3">My Department has not formally consulted other countries about the new HFC policy. However, several countries such as France, Italy, Germany and Finland indicated initial broad support at official level. Other countries will be considering their policies on HFCs as part of their development of programmes to deliver their Kyoto targets, but few have yet made clear statements on their position. The Danish Government have recently announced their new HFC policy, which would ban the use of HFCs in many applications.

 The transfers of existing bodies takes place on four main dates. As I announced in response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) on 1 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 420-21W, the London Ecology Committee, London Planning Advisory Committee and London Research Centre were abolished, and their staff, assets and liabilities were temporarily transferred to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para4">On 8 May these staff, assets and liabilities (other than those relating to a small number of London Research Centre staff who will transfer later to Transport for London) transferred to the Greater London Authority (GLA), along with a small number of planning staff from the Government Office for London, and the GLA Transition Team and staff newly recruited for the GLA.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para5">Transfers to Transport for London (TfL) and the London Development Agency (LDA), and to the London Transport Users Committee (LTUC), will take place on 3 July. On that date the following will transfer to TfL:

<a name="00525w02.html_para9">On the same date the staff, assets and liabilities of the London Regional Passengers Committee will transfer to LTUC, which will report to the Assembly of the GLA.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para10">Most of the above transfers will be achieved through transfer schemes prepared under powers in section 409 of the GLA Act. In preparing their transfer schemes, predecessor bodies are identifying which of their property, rights and liabilities, such as buildings, contracts, staff or other assets, will transfer to the GLA's functional bodies and which will remain with the predecessor body itself or be transferred elsewhere. Among other things, they will need to consider whether existing contracts can transfer in their existing form or whether changes will be needed to meet the needs of the functional bodies.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para11">In addition, those predecessor bodies, such as the Highways Agency, which are designated as Public Records bodies under the Public Records Act 1958 will need to review those records which are intended to transfer to the functional bodies to see whether particular records are worthy of preservation in the national archive. Predecessor bodies will also need to identify whether all of their existing records are appropriate for transfer to the functional bodies, on the basis that all relevant records should transfer, unless 



<P>
<P><I>25 May 2000 : Column: 577W</I><P>
they identify any papers, such as advice to Ministers of the present and previous administrations, which would be inappropriate for transfer. We expect that each predecessor body will identify very few, if any, papers which are unsuitable for transfer. In conducting this exercise they will need to ensure that they take full account of existing and proposed freedom of information legislation and the openness regime under which the GLA and functional bodies will operate.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para12">Budgets for the GLA, TfL and LDA are as set out on 17 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 637W.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para13">To permit the GlA, TfL and LDA to start functioning immediately on their respective start dates, orders to facilitate the transition have been made under powers in sections 405 and 406 of the GLA Act. These enable the new organisations to make arrangements for their financial operations and, where necessary, to prepare standing orders for their initial meetings. In addition temporary appointments of certain statutory office holders in the GLA, TfL and LDA have been made by the Secretary of State using powers in section 407 of the GLA Act.
<P>

<a name="00525w02.html_para14">To remove any doubts about the application of the Transfer of Undertaking (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 to transfers of staff to the new organisations, an order has been made applying the 1981 Regulations to all transfers of staff by means of transfer schemes or orders under the GLA Act powers. A further order added the new organisations to the list of bodies eligible to be members of the Local Government Pension Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what outcome he expects from the forthcoming UN Informal Consultative Process on the Oceans to be held in New York on 30 May to 2 June.  [124190]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00525w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The establishment of a UN Informal Consultative Process is a new and promising development. For a long time, I have been calling for a single global focus for integrating action on the oceans. At the 1999 meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development, I particularly highlighted the need for better preparation of the annual UN General Assembly debate on Oceans and the Law of the Sea and better implementation by all states of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and Chapter 17, Oceans and All Seas, of Agenda 21. I believe that the new Informal Consultative Process will address both these points.
<P>

<a name="00525w03.html_para0">The UK has played a leading role in getting the new Process established and we are looking forward to participating in a productive meeting. Although all aspects of the oceans and seas are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole, discussion should focus on one or two main areas, to get agreement on the progress to be made. In this inaugural meeting, the issues of tackling illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries and the economic and social implications of marine pollution have emerged as issues of particular concern. These are important issues and we want to ensure that the new process makes a real difference to progress in tackling them. In particular, there needs to be early entry into force of the UN fish stock agreement and full implementation 



<P>
<P><I>25 May 2000 : Column: 578W</I><P>
of that agreement, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and the Global Programme of Action against land-based marine pollution. The new Process should promote concerted action for this purpose by all the different international bodies involved.

 I understand that a distinguished, international delegation organised by the National Democratic Institute visited Zimbabwe from 15 to 22 May. After over 30 meetings with representatives of government, political parties and civil society the delegation called for "heightened observation" of the elections by the international community. Their findings reflect an atmosphere of anxiety and fear, a news bias in favour of the ruling party, and that the Registrar General has so far failed to establish an open and transparent electoral process. We hope that the delegation's observations are closely heeded in Zimbabwe.

<a name="00525w04.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Our recently published sports strategy-- A Sporting Future for All--and the report of Policy Action Team 10, recognise the unique contribution which sport can make to tackling social exclusion. As a result, we will be working with other agencies to develop creative and innovative ways of using sport to re-engage people and equip them with the skills and confidence to re-join the main stream of society. We have also asked all funding bodies in sport to ensure that the promotion of social inclusion is a key part of all their work, and have called for a concerted effort to recruit, train and support more women, people with disabilities and people from ethnic minority groups as coaches, officials and sports administrators. All agencies receiving public funding will be required to demonstrate that they have adopted pro-active solutions to any inequities which exist.
<P>

<a name="00525w04.html_para0">Sport England's Lottery Strategy, which was published in May last year, sets out its commitment to target funding at social inclusion and deprived areas. This means that at least two-thirds of its Lottery funds are invested in community facilities or activities, of which at least 50 per cent. will go to areas of greatest need; young people, recreationally deprived groups and people with disabilities are a priority; and equality of access for all. Specific programmes include the Priority Areas Initiative which targets deprived areas and allows a higher rate of funding and Sport Action Zones, the first 12 of which were announced in January, which aim to provide comprehensive sports development infrastructures aimed at increasing opportunities for participation in some of the most recreationally deprived areas of the country. Sport England will also be using its powers of solicitation to invite applications for funding from schools in Sport Action Zones, Education Action Zones and Excellence in Cities areas.

 On 22 May the Millennium Commission considered an application for additional grant totalling &#163;38.6 million from the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC). While the Commission had serious reservations about providing further grant, they concluded that it would be foolish to withdraw support when the best of the year for visitor attractions is yet to come. They also felt that the value of the Dome as the centrepiece of the nation's millennium celebrations

<a name="00525w04.html_para1">In light of this, the Commission announced that a further grant of &#163;29 million, subject to stringent conditions, would be made available to NMEC.

In addition, the largest derelict site in southern England has been regenerated and the foundations have been laid for a lasting legacy providing jobs and homes for thousands of people.
<P>

<a name="00525w04.html_para7">In line with the commitment made by the previous administration that any additional Lottery funds required to support the Dome should not be at the expense of the Millennium Commission's wider programme of work, the Government confirmed that Lottery money would, if necessary, be made available to the Commission to ensure that it's wider programme does not suffer.

 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain, the conclusions of any study.
<P>

<a name="00525w04.html_para8">In the six month period ended 31 March 2000, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:

 On (<i>a</i>), the estimate that 1.2 million children will be lifted above 60 per cent. of median income looks at the effect of all personal tax and benefit changes announced in the past four Budgets; all of these measures will have taken effect by April 2001. On (<i>b</i>), the estimates given in Box 5.1 of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report are net of any children in households whose incomes move below the income thresholds.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 19 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 294W, on poverty, if the figure of 1.2 million children to be lifted above 60 per cent. of median earnings includes tapering for <i>(a)</i> housing benefit and <i>(b)</i> council tax benefit.

 The definition of income used in this figure is consistent with that in "Households Below Average Income" and includes Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. The estimate of 1.2 million children therefore includes the effect of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit tapers.

 Since 1994, the DTI has acted as guarantor to the former British Coal pension schemes. In doing so it underwrites 100 per cent. of any downside risk to guaranteed benefits in the event of scheme deficits. The guarantee means that basic pensions will always rise at least in line with inflation and will never fall in cash terms. In return the Government receive 50 per cent. of any actuarial scheme surpluses--the remaining 50 per cent. being available to the scheme Trustees for distribution among their memberships. The Government have no plans to re-open the guarantee arrangements, but it is discussing with the Trustees whether there are opportunities to build upon them to the mutual benefit of Scheme members and Government.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2000]:</i> The Queen's Awards for Export, Technological and Environmental Achievement (formerly The Queen's Award for Industry) were reviewed in 1999 by a Committee under the chairmanship of HRH The Prince of Wales. The Review Committee made 16 key recommendations including a new generic title, "The Queen's Awards for Enterprise", with broader criteria for the three categories: International Trade, Innovation, and Environmental Achievement. The Committee also recommended further work to define criteria for a Queen's Award in the field of sustainable development to be incorporated into the Awards in 2001. The Committee's recommendations were accepted in full by Her Majesty The Queen and the Prime Minister in September 1999.

<P>

<a name="00525w09.html_para0">The Review commissioned market research into perceptions of the Queen's Awards among a structured sample of businesses across a wide range of sectors of business activity. Almost 90 per cent. of all respondents said that British business continued to attach importance to the Queen's Awards; over 90 per cent. of organisations said that people employed in Award winning units continued to be enthusiastic about the Awards and that the Awards provided recognition of outstanding achievement; 74 per cent. of respondents said that the Queen's Awards were the most prestigious awards for achievement in the UK economy; and 78 per cent. of Award winners said that the Awards provided an incentive to outstanding achievement.
<P>

<a name="00525w09.html_para1">Since the Awards were first introduced in 1966, a total of 45,534 applications have been submitted with a total of 4,282 applicants being granted a Queen's Award.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2000]:</i> The data are not available to provide all the information requested. However, an evaluation of SMART in 1991 forecasted a grant:profits ratio of 9:20 resulting from awards made in 1988. A second evaluation of SMART in 1994 calculated a grant:sales ratio of 1:6. An evaluation of SPUR in 1994 concluded that it was too early to assess the grant:profit ratio, given that SPUR had only started in 1991. A further evaluation of Smart is planned for later this year.

 I have proposed that a new Authority for the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) should be established to increase the breadth of experience and expertise guiding the OFT's work. Recent legislation including the Competition Act 1998 has increased the regulator's powers significantly. The role of the new Authority will be to work under the chairmanship of the Director General of Fair Trading to promote effective and competitive markets which benefit consumers. The Authority will have a minimum of five members. The Authority will have the powers currently vested in the Director General of Fair Trading. We will introduce legislation to create an Authority when parliamentary time allows.

 The Government have asked the Low Pay Commission to assess the impact of the minimum wage. Their Second Report, published on 15 February, said early indications were that the vast majority of businesses throughout the UK were meeting their obligations to pay the national minimum wage and that the Inland Revenue had made a successful start to enforcement. As at the end of April 2000, minimum wage compliance offices have dealt with 204 cases of suspected underpayment of the national minimum wage in Wales.

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> The process for winding-up the Astra Group Pension Scheme started on 1 April 1999. Since then no new pensions have been awarded as members reach age 60, but payments to existing pensioners have continued to be made. The scheme's administrators still have some outstanding issues about the restoration of members' rights in the state pension scheme. These need to be resolved to establish the amount of money available to buy annuities to protect current pensioners and preserved annuities for members with preserved pensions. Until this process is completed, nobody will know the extent of any shortfall in the scheme's assets to meet its liabilities.

 The Government are committed to meeting their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. Government policy is that prisoners should be given every assistance to enable them to play a full and active role in society, and that they should have full, though not preferential, access to the range of social support generally available to members of the public.
<P>

<a name="00525w11.html_para7">The Government are conscious that the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 has resulted in the release over a relatively short period of significant numbers of long-term prisoners, many of whom will not have been able to prepare for release in the normal way. In order to meet its overall aims within these special circumstances, the Government set up a co-ordinating group to ensure that released prisoners had proper access to support services, and that services themselves were aware of and geared to cope with the likely patterns of release. Potential difficulties in both immediate and longer-term provision for prisoners have been addressed in a manner consistent with ensuring that there is no differential in provision between ex-prisoners and the general public.
<P>

<a name="00525w11.html_para8">Many wider reintegration issues would involve changes to current practices or laws.

 I assume that my hon. Friend is referring to the comments made by the previous SACEUR, General Clark, at the Senate Committee on Armed Services on 21 October 1999. No formal assessment has been made by MOD of the views he expressed then. However, we agree that co-ordinated international pressure on all fronts, diplomatic, economic (trade and financial) as well as military, is an important factor during crises. Electronic methods on their own would be unlikely to have achieved the desired result against Serbia.

General Clark's analysis, based on access to a wide range of sources, concluded that 93 tanks/self-propelled artillery pieces were successfully struck (in other words destroyed or damaged), with physical evidence of 26 such vehicles having been destroyed (14 tanks and 12 self-propelled artillery pieces) remaining on the ground after NATO had entered Kosovo--the remainder of the assessment is underpinned by evidence from other sources. NATO assessed there to have been 153 successful strikes against Armoured Personnel Carriers, with the destruction of 12 such vehicles confirmed by evidence on the ground. The methodology used to put together the NATO assessment is explained in detail in the transcript of General Clark's presentation, available on the internet at the NATO website: www.nato.int/kosovo/press/p990916a.htm. Battle Damage Assessment is not an exact science, but these are the most comprehensive figures available.

 The MAMBA programme covers the procurement of radar systems to meet the Army's requirement for a lightweight and mobile weapon locating radar. It is currently in the concept stage of the procurement process and it is planned to commence the assessment phase in June 2000 when the procurement options and associated costs will be addressed in detail.
<P>

<a name="00525w12.html_para2">The current plan is for the radar systems to be in Service by 2008-09. However, in order to satisfy a capability gap identified by the Service Customer, it is planned to provide an initial operating capability by 2002-03 with the balance of deliveries by 2008-09.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00525w13.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 XM777 is based on the Ultra-lightweight Field Howitzer (UFH), which was designed as a private venture in the United Kingdom by the then Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd., now part of Royal Ordnance Defence. The UFH won a competition run by the US Marine Corps and became the XM777 Light Weight Howitzer in the US Engineering and Manufacturing Demonstration (EMD) phase of acquisition.

[122980]
<P>
<P>
<P>

 The ALSLs are required to move men, equipment and stores to wherever they are required in the world and to be able to deploy them as a fighting force. Each vessel's minimum payload will include 350 military personnel, 500 linear metres of vehicles, 106 tonnes of war maintenance reserve plus two Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs) and two Mexeflote powered rafts. The achievement of greater payloads, within cost constraints, is being sought in the Invitation to Tender.
<P>

<a name="00525w13.html_para1">Contract placement for the design and build of two new ALSLs is planned to occur later this year. The estimated target price for the construction of the two vessels is approximately &#163;138 million.

 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> Parish Councils may provide grants to police authorities under section 92 of the Police Act 1996.

15,118 releases on temporary licence between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000.

 The Director General of the Prison Service authorised the search in the light of intelligence suggesting that some prisoners on the working out scheme might be engaging in criminal activity.
<P>

<a name="00525w16.html_para8">Sixty-two officer grades (prison officers, senior officers and principal officers) from other establishments were involved in the operation.

 In 1997, some 63,000 defendants were committed for trial at the Crown Court in either-way cases; 14,000 represents about 22 per cent. of that number. In 1998, the proportion of defendants pleading guilty to either-way offences in the Crown Court was 66 per cent., but, for costing purposes, our model assumes a higher guilty plea rate of 80 per cent., which has the effect of minimising the savings which might be expected from the reform. About 38 per cent. of defendants contesting either-way offences in the Crown Court were convicted, and a similar rate was assumed for costing purposes.
<P>

<a name="00525w17.html_para1">The savings for the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No.2) Bill were measured using the flows and costs model which was developed by the Home Office in collaboration with the Lord Chancellor's Department and Crown Prosecution Service to estimate the cost of initiatives in the criminal justice system. The costs are

 As I have made clear on previous occasions, the conservation of fish stocks is essential for the long-term future of the fishing industry, and all concerned--fishermen, merchants and processors--have a key part to play in preventing the trade in blackfish. This Government have not flinched from taking tough measures to curb such activity whether at the national level or through the Community.

Over the first 11 weeks of the scheme, 2,243 pets have entered the UK without having to go into quarantine.

 The Agenda 2000 agreement takes us a significant step closer to securing a more competitive and sustainable industry with a stronger market orientation.

 The Government are pressing for the relationship between farm animal welfare standards and trade rules to be addressed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). One of these ideas we are currently examining is permitting payments made to offset additional costs associated with farm animal welfare requirements to be included in the "Green Box" under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. The effect of this would be that any such payments were not included in the aggregate measure of domestic support which is subject to reduction commitments.

 Officials wrote to the Services of the European Commission on 5 April asking them to make a proposal to the Beef Management Committee on 14 April to remove the weight limit on payments of Over- 30-months scheme cattle. The Commission were unable to prepare a proposal in time for submission to that meeting, and there was no second meeting of the Management Committee in April. A proposal to remove the weight limit was agreed at the Beef Management Committee on 12 May.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2000]:</i> Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.
