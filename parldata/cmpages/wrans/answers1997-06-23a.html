<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 I have no plans to change the definition of local authority capital spending in General Government Expenditure. The definition is consistent with international statistical conventions as laid down in the European System of accounts (ESA).

 The information is given in the table. It is based on OECD information for 1995 or 1995-96 tax years, the latest for which comprehensive information is available. The income figures relate to earned income of single taxpayers and have been converted to &#163; sterling using 1995 OECD purchasing power parity figures.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the cost <i>(a)</i> to the Treasury and <i>(b)</i> to public expenditure throughout Government of making the adaptations to computer programmes required by the change to the year 2000. [3540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Treasury and other Government departments are producing, by October 1997, fully costed plans for undertaking the work needed.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para0">The cost of the work will be met from within the published departmental expenditure plans for 1997-98 and 1998-99.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will report the Government's response to Mr. Malcolm Bates's review of the Private Finance Initiative; and if he will make a statement. [5392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 I am today placing in the Members' Library a summary of the Bates review and a list of all its recommendations. It is a thorough piece of work for which the Government is most grateful. It builds upon the 12 Point Plan for Partnership originally published in the Labour Policy's Business Manifesto.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para1">The Government promised to re-invigorate the PFI and that is what we have done. Malcolm Bates has applied a businessman's mind to this policy and produced specific recommendations which we accept in full as an agenda for action.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para2">The review says that the PFI can secure improved value for money when handled well. But the public sector structure must be simplified and responsibilities made entirely clear.




<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1997 : Column: 345</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para3"> Departments and agencies must be accountable for their own procurement decisions. However, it identifies a temporary need for a strong central input to help ensure delivery of quality transactions that provide a sound basis for future business.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para4">To meet this need, we will, as recommended, create a new Treasury Private Finance Taskforce--combining central project and policy expertise. Its Chief Executive on the projects side will report direct to me. We will make an appointment in due course.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para5">This individual will focus on the quality of PFI transactions. He will be supported by 6-8 Executives from the private sector with direct project management experience and financial skills. Until now, the Treasury has been involved too late in the process, leading to frustration and increased costs. The Taskforce will help central government departments and agencies road-test significant projects for their commercial viability <i>before</i> procurement begins.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para6">The Taskforce's policy side will also have its hands full. The review includes specific recommendations to produce rapidly more standardised documentation for key stages of the procurement process. The Government wants greater certainty wherever it can be provided to help reduce bidding costs.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para7">The Private Finance Panel will be stood down. I have written to all members today thanking them for their past contribution. The review acknowledges the immense value that high calibre members made in freely giving their time to meet key players, speak at conferences, write articles and support a growing band of Executives. However, it concluded that their on-going role was unclear and that there was a need to simplify organisational structures.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para8">The recommendation to strengthen departmental Private Finance Units alongside the new Treasury Taskforce also takes away the need for the Private Finance Panel Executive. The Government accepts the Review recommendation that it should be disbanded by the end of September. Opportunities will, of course, exist within the new structure for those individuals currently with the Executive who have the skills and experience now required.
<P>

<a name="70623w01.html_para9">The agenda for action is detailed, practical and full of common sense. It will be welcomed as long overdue by companies and departments who have struggled for two long under previous management.

<a name="70623w02.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Letwin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if it is his policy that all cows born in a given BSE-infected cohort within a given herd, regardless of the location of subsequent rearing, should be culled in any case where one or more cows in such a cohort are culled under the selective cull scheme. [3916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The scientific basis of the cull is that animals which ate the same feed as BSE cases in the first six months of their lives are likely to be at risk of exposure to infection through that feed. Any such exposed animals which have been sold from the natal herd will be traced as far as possible. Those animals found alive will be restricted and slaughtered.
<P>

<a name="70623w02.html_para5">We intend also to include animals which were reared together in their first six months of life, irrespective of where they were born, provided we can be reasonably sure that it was there, rather than in the natal herd, that exposure to infection took place. We are currently seeking agreement from the European Commission that to do so would be in line with the relevant EC legislation.

 The measures which Member States should take in order to avoid the feeding of BSE contaminated feed were discussed with representatives of the Commission and the other Member Stases in the Standing Veterinary Committee of 18-19 July 1989.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w02.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Advice given by the authorities of the other Member States to their farmers is a matter of national competence and we do not have records of such advice.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to ensure that the United Kingdom's EU partners take steps to eradicate classical swine fever; and if he will make a statement on the extent of classical swine fever in other EU countries.[3920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 European Community legislation lays down requirements for the control and eradication of classical swine fever within the territory of a Member State and to prevent the spread of the disease from one Member State to another. Classical swine fever is currently present in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. The situation is being kept under continuous review by the EC Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC), on which the UK is represented. The SVC may adopt additional ad hoc safeguard measures which they believe are necessary to consolidate existing control and eradication measures.

<a name="70623w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We have not sought advice on the legality of a unilateral ban on imports of European beef since we are not proposing to introduce such a ban. The announcement made on 5 June by my right hon.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what mechanisms for monitoring standards in overseas slaughterhouses his Department has evaluated in connection with its consideration of an import ban on beef from slaughterhouses not meeting United Kingdom standards; and what conclusions have been reached.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No import ban on beef from slaughterhouses not meeting UK standards is under consideration.
<P>

<a name="70623w03.html_para0">All fresh meat imported into the UK, whether from other Member States or third countries, must have been produced in accordance with harmonised Community rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC as amended, on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat. 
<P>

<a name="70623w03.html_para1">These rules require that, amongst other things, all fresh meat which is intended for human consumption fulfils the required public health standards. As far as slaughterhouses are concerned, they must be approved as meeting the requirements of the Directive and all meat leaving the slaughterhouse must bear a health mark. The inspection, approval and monitoring of slaughterhouses in third countries is the respnsibility of the European Commission. The inspection, approval and monitoring of slaughterhouses in Member States is the responsibility of the competent authority of the Member State concerned, although the Commission make on-site checks to ensure uniform application of the Directive.

<a name="70623w03.html_para2">Following advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, however, and in the absence of EU wide rules on the removal and disposal of specified bovine material (SBM), we are now consulting on proposals which would mean that our requirement to remove and dispose of SBM would apply not only to cattle which have died or been slaughtered in the UK, but also to bovine material which has been imported into this country. This is not an import ban.

<P>
<a name="70623w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The State Veterinary Service (SVS) makes monthly unannounced visits to hunt kennels handling specified bovine material to audit the controls under the Specified Bovine Material Order 1997. Those premises at which failings were found during such visits since 1 January 1997 are listed below. The fact that failures have occurred does not necessarily mean that there is a risk to public health. Visits may be recorded as unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons, including minor, technical and short-lived problems. Following an unsatisfactory visit the operator of the premises is required to take immediate remedial action. A further unannounced visit is made shortly afterwards to check that this has been carried out.

 Remediation will normally be undertaken on MoD land if there is a significant risk to health and safety or the environment, for instance where contamination poses a threat to individuals, water courses or neighbouring property. No special arrangements apply to bases formerly occupied by US forces. No significant costs incurred to date on their remediation have been identified. The Environment Act 1995 may impose additional remediation responsibilities on landowners and new enforcement arrangements, but the full implications for MoD land, including any formerly occupied by US forces, cannot yet be assessed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list <i>(a)</i> the number of landowners making their land available for training on private land and <i>(b)</i> the number of hectares they make available, adjacent to (i) Salisbury Plain training area, (ii) Otterburn training area and (iii) Sennybridge training area; and by what percentage training land is extended by the availability of training on private land in each of the three areas. [4750]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The type of training undertaken on private land will usually differ from that conducted on MoD training areas: for example, training on Salisbury Plain training area is primarily armoured training whereas that on adjacent private land will not involve armoured vehicles. Training on private land cannot therefore be regarded as a simple extension of training on adjacent MoD land. The quantity and locations of training on private land will also vary from year to year. Subject to these qualifications, in the past 12 months, the figures requested have been as follows:

<P>
<BR>

 Estimates of defence expenditure in the current financial year are contained in "Supply Estimates 1997-98: Main Estimates", which were published in March this year. As I explained in my written reply to the hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife, (Mr. Campbell) on 3 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>121</i>), we do not intend this year to publish a forward looking statement of policy in the form of a Statement on the Defence Estimates (SDE). Factual material on the activities of my Department and the Armed Forces in the last year, which is usually contained in the SDE, will however, appear in an expanded MOD Performance Report which the Department plans to publish in the Autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 It is too early in the life of the Trident programme accurately to assess operating costs but we estimate them to be in the order of &#163;200 million per annum over a 30 year in-service life. This estimate encompasses manpower and related costs, refits of the submarines, stores and transport costs, a share of the running costs of shore facilities, an element of the costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, in-service support of the submarines and their weapon systems and decommissioning and disposal costs. Estimated future capital expenditure on the project is as stated by my hon.

<a name="70623w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 We are not aware of a recent report from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament concerning the costs of Trident. We have, however, recently received a number of letters and postcards on this subject. Our latest estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme is &#163;12.57 billion at 1996-97 economic conditions, over &#163;3.6 billion less in real terms than the original 1982 estimate. Operating costs are estimated to be some &#163;200 million per annum over a 30 year in-service life.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce legislation on fire safety analogous to the Fire Safety Bill introduced in the last Parliament. [5015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Government strongly support the aims of the Fire Safety Bill and will be looking for appropriate opportunities to achieve those aims. I have asked my officials, as a priority, to provide me with an outline of the options that are available. As part of that process, officials are in the middle of a series of discussions with some of the key stakeholders to hear their views on the best way to proceed. Discussion of the Fire Safety Bill will then be at the top of the agenda for discussion by the Joint Fire Safety Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council at its next meeting on 8 July.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of measures to deal with soccer-related crowd problems on other major spectator team sports. [3103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The measures taken to deal with crowd disorder in football have been specific to football. These include controls on the sale and possession of alcohol under the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985; the exclusion order scheme under Part IV of the Public Order Act 1986; the restriction order scheme under Part II of the Football Spectators Act 1989; and the creation of four football specific offences under the Football (Offences) Act 1991 and section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para0">The police have other powers which apply at all sports. In particular, the 1986 Public Order Act enables the police to take action against a broad range of disorderly behaviour. There are also powers to deal with vandalism, damage to property and assault.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para1">If there is evidence from the police that the problem of crowd disorder has become more widespread and is having a significant impact on other sports, we will review the need for further measures.

 None. Hypothecating the revenue from speeding fines would result in expenditure on traffic enforcement being determined by the income generated, rather than the relative priority of the activity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when he expects to conclude his review of PFI projects in the health service in Scotland; and if he will make a statement. [4201]<P>

<P>
<a name="70623w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Alongside the review being undertaken by the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) I have been undertaking a similar review of Health PFI schemes 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1997 : Column: 364</I><P>
in Scotland. I have today written to all Scottish MPs, giving full details of the conclusions I have reached.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para4">I am committed to delivering PFI-led service improvements in the Scottish Health Service. A number of high quality PFI projects, such as those at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and the hospitals at Law and Hairmyres, which will deliver clear health care benefits, are well placed to proceed to financial close. I wish to see those benefits on the ground as quickly as possible and have asked my officials to push forward with these.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para5">However it has become clear that other projects are not appropriate for the PFI process. Last week (Monday 16 June) I announced that, in view of the urgent nature of the maternity and theatre proposals at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, we would push these aspects of the project forward through &#163;36 million of public funding. Other aspects of the original project, such as catering and the car park facilities, will continue to be pursued under PFI.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para6">After consideration, I have concluded that the PFI process at the Western General in Edinburgh should also be halted. The PFI project for the Western is complicated by the fact that it is an existing NHS site with a large number of buildings of varying ages, functions and conditions. My view is that in the case of the Western General, PFI is not the right route. Instead the Government intend to provide around &#163;40 million to fund a new ward and theatre block which is so clearly needed. Our proposals will also enable the go-ahead of the midwife-led maternity unit.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para7">I think it only right that further major PFI projects such as the Western Infirmary should be taken forward only once the overall review of the PFI process in Health has been completed. However there are numerous other relatively smaller Scottish Health projects exploring PFI. I want Trusts and Boards to continue to pursue these projects and to come forward with new proposals. There will be rigorous scrutiny of these projects at every stage of their development. A project must be proven to be affordable, value for money and, most importantly, offer real health care improvements for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="70623w06.html_para8">I will be working closely with my hon. colleague, the Minister of State, Department of Health, over the coming months at improving the PFI product and will also be exploring the possibility of developing other models of structured private finance schemes in the longer term.

<P>
<a name="70623w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how he proposes to provide an effective and integrated transport policy; and what plans he has to carry out a strategic review of the roads programme in Scotland.[5142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 My noble Friend, the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, the environment and fisheries announced on Thursday--<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, column <i>136</i>--our intention to publish a White Paper early next year which will set out our proposals for a workable, effective and integrated transport policy appropriate to the needs of Scotland. Our development of that will operate in parallel with the development of the planned White Paper on integrated transport policy announced by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on 5 June, column <i>226</i>.
<P>

<a name="70623w07.html_para2">One key strand of developing an integrated transport strategy is the strategic review of the trunk roads programme promised in the Manifesto. We believe that we need a thorough examination of our rationale for new roads construction. Possible new roads projects must be properly examined in the context of their local and wider economic and environmental impacts and with the possible provision of alternative modes of transport properly considered in parallel. Our eventual decisions must meet our commitment to sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="70623w07.html_para3">This review will consider the full range of factors, including traffic growth, which will give rise to pressure for further major improvements across the trunk road 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1997 : Column: 369</I><P>
network over the next decade. In parallel with the review, as part of the work leading to the White Paper, we shall examine means of restraining growth, including consideration of the opportunities for doing so on the trunk road network. We will also consider the role which new technology and improved information systems can play.
<P>

<a name="70623w07.html_para4">The review will examine the criteria (including accessibility, safety, economy and environmental impact) for setting priorities within the trunk road programme. It will also review the scope for improved value for money for expenditure on maintenance, structural repairs and minor schemes.
<P>

<a name="70623w07.html_para5">The review is being conducted against the background of our clear commitment to control public expenditure overall and fundamentally to review expenditure priorities through the comprehensive spending review. Given this, no further procedural work on major schemes will be undertaken before the reviews are concluded. However, schemes under construction will continue; and the schemes for the A828 (Creagan Bridge) and the A75 (The Glen), which are both close to commencement, will also continue. Tenders are expected in July for a privately financed design, build, finance and operate contract on the M8 (Baillieston to Shotts) and a decision on that will be announced after the evaluation of tenders, in the light of the information provided by the tenders and other relevant factors. The review will reach conclusions on options for the Kincardine Bridge in advance of those on other projects because of the uncertainties attaching to the operational condition of the bridge and the need to progress contingency plans.
<P>

<a name="70623w07.html_para6">The Scottish Office will continue to invest in the maintenance and structural repairs of the existing network and take forward small schemes, costing less than &#163;3 million, where route action and accident plans have identified measures to alleviate congestion and improve safety.
<P>

<a name="70623w07.html_para7">There has been extensive comments about the previous Government's Green paper "Keeping Scotland Moving" and these, where appropriate, will be considered as part of both the development of our White Paper and the review of the trunk roads programme. We intend to consult about the options and the findings emerging from the review, with the objective of concluding the review by the Summer of 1998.

<BR>
I have been asked by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to reply to your Parliamentary Question on using Triumph motorcycles for the InterDespatch Service's courier despatch service. I am the Chief Executive of the Agency with operational responsibility for the InterDespatch Service.
<BR>
The current fleet of six motorcycles was purchased in April 1996 following a technical and operational evaluation of suitability for courier work. This included research with existing users, particularly in assessing load carrying capacity.
<BR>
The motorcycle fleet is due for replacement in approximately two years, and I will be carrying out a new assessment towards the end of this year. That assessment will include machines produced by Triumph.

 The Government is working with the industry, the tourist boards, local authorities and others to ensure that tourism is making its full contribution to the UK economy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The existing regulatory framework already allows for increased local provision.
<P>

<a name="70623w09.html_para2">The Radio Authority is required to secure a range and diversity of local services. Since its creation, the number of commercial local radio services has increased from 130 in 1991 to 177 in 1996. The Authority has also recently introduced small-scale alternative location licencees, and the number of short-term Restricted Service Licences continues to increase. These mechanisms provide a flexible structure within which more modest local operations can flourish.
<P>

<a name="70623w09.html_para3">The Independent Television Commission has recently published guidance on how it intends to implement the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1996 which introduced a new category of licence for local services and special events--the Restricted Service Licence.

<P>

<a name="70623w09.html_para4">We aim to secure a wide diversity of broadcasting services, and local services are an important element of that diversity. The Government will monitor the effectiveness of the existing and recently enhanced licensing arrangements in providing more local services.

 My right hon.

The conditions of ownership of radio stations are laid down in the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 and the use of powers under that legislation is solely a matter for the Radio Authority.

The Deputy Prime Minister announced at the recent Water Summit that the Government is to review the system of charging for water. Among other issues this review will consider alternative bases of charging, including the future use of rateable values, the use of council tax bands and metering policy. We shall be looking at the way in which metering works at present, taking special account of the effect on low-income households. We have made clear our opposition to compulsory metering for essential household use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Any Crown body wishing to secure planning permission for land prior to its disposal must apply for permission under section 299 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. As with applications for planning permission from non-Crown bodies, it is for the local planning authority to determine the application. Such determination shall be in accordance with the development plan for the area, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Other than where the matter is expressly referred to the Secretary of State--e.g. under the Town and Country Planning (Development Plans and Consultation) Directions 1992, or on appeal--my Department is not concerned with the specific proposals of other Government Departments to dispose of their land, nor the proposed use of any such land. The National Physical Laboratory is within the London Borough of Richmond, and the Unitary Development Plan policy for the site is for employment uses. We understand that no planning application has been made to the planning authority in respect of the site.

<a name="70623w11.html_para0">The previous President of the Board of Trade announced on 6 December 1996 that he intended to refer the proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, unless suitable undertakings were given by the parties to the alliance. He took the view that, without such undertakings, the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential competition on air routes between the UK and the US. He asked the Director General of Fair Trading to seek appropriate undertakings from the parties, and also to consider views from all interested third parties on the undertakings and other conditions which he proposed. The proposed undertakings and conditions included the release by the alliance of up to 168 take-off and landing slots at Heathrow. These slots were to be made available for use by competitor airlines only on transatlantic services, in order to ensure that the slot release addressed the competition concerns raised by the alliance.

<a name="70623w12.html_para0">The review is focusing on the key indicators identified by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in their 1990 report on the supply of petrol: market structure, profitability and prices. It is also looking at the longer-term market trends to see whether it is possible to draw any conclusions about the future competitiveness of the market and whether it will continue to operate to the benefit of consumers.

 There is no provision in the United Kingdom's petroleum licensing legislation for the suspension of production licences such as those awarded in the 17th Seaward Round.

 A good deal of research is available on levels of drug abuse which, while not necessarily commissioned by my Department, is taken into account when planning initiatives to support drug education in schools.
<P>

<a name="70623w15.html_para1">My Department did provide funding for an evaluation of The Advisory Council for Alcohol and Drug Education's--TACADE's--"Skills for Life" PSE programme for secondary schools, which had a particular emphasis on drug education. This included research into students' experience of drugs and the level of reported drug taking by students in a small sample of schools, as well as an in-depth study of how those schools were implementing the programme. A report will be published shortly. In addition, my Department has recently produced a booklet outlining the results of the independent evaluation reports of a number of LEA innovative drug education projects supported by our Grants for Education Support and Training--GEST--programme in 1995-96. These projects researched and trailled a range of different approaches to drug education work. A copy is in the Library.

33. <a name="70623w16.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what is his Department's policy concerning the recruitment of people to the legal profession from a wider variety of social backgrounds; and if he will make a statement. [3121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Recruitment to the legal profession is primarily a matter for the profession itself. Both the Bar Council and the Law Society have adopted policies designed to ensure that entrance to the profession is based on merit alone. The Government believes that opportunities in the legal profession should be open to those from the widest possible variety of social backgrounds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Since April 1995, the administration of the Crown courts has been the responsibility of the Chief Executive of the Court Service under the terms of the Framework Document for the Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor requires his Advisory Committees to draw candidates for the lay magistracy from a broad a spectrum of the community so as to ensure, as far as is possible, that those recommended for appointment broadly reflect the communities which they will serve. Both political affiliation and ethnic origin are taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w16.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Section 33 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 provides that a magistrates courts committee may submit to the Lord Chancellor a draft order proposing changes to the petty sessional divisions, or PSDs, in its area. Section 34 of the Act requires a magistrates courts committee to consult all the magistrates of the affected benches and the relevant paying authority, before the Lord Chancellor may consider any application for change under section 33.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The main aim of the pilot programme is to identify the types of service which support marriage most effectively. All the projects include an element of monitoring and evaluation, and organisations are required to provide an interim report on progress to the end of the calendar year 1997, followed by a full evaluation on completion of the project.
<P>

<a name="70623w17.html_para0">The Department will assess the effectiveness of the pilot projects in terms of their achievement of specific aims and objectives, and their cost-effectiveness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Department's programme of marriage support projects started on 1 April 1997. The programme will run for a year, and it is too early yet to identify the successful projects. The results of the pilot programme will be one of the factors taken into account by my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor in deciding on the future funding of marriage support projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As magistrates court buildings are the responsibility of the local authorities this information is not centrally held. The design standards set down for magistrates courts since 1991 require the magistrates' entry into the courthouse and access to a proportion of the courtrooms to be suitable for wheelchairs. Provision is also made for loop induction systems to be provided for those with hearing impairments. Disabled toilet facilities are also provided within the magistrates' circulation area. Applications by local authorities for grant aid to adapt older magistrates courts to provide improved facilities for disabled users including magistrates are treated as high priority bids when allocating capital grant.

 The Home Office "Model of Flows and Costs in the Criminal Justice Process" for 1995-96 shows the total cost excluding capital expenditure in the Crown Court was &#163;202,544,937 and in the magistrates' courts for criminal matters was &#163;257,885,498. The number of days sat in the Crown Court in 1996 was 90,956. The number of hours sat in the magistrates' courts in 1996 was 1,173,071.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w17.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), which is a non-departmental governmental body. Following a major programme of seminars in ethnic minority awareness between 1994 and 1996 for circuit judges, recorders, assistant recorders, district judges and stipendiary magistrates, the JSB continues to include such training as part of induction training for newly appointed assistant recorders and deputy district judges. It has also held a number of sessions in both induction and continuation training on equal treatment, including gender awareness, and is considering how training in this area might be developed.
<P>

<a name="70623w17.html_para1">Lay magistrate training is delivered by magistrates courts committees but the JSB has a role in setting the syllabus. Lay magistrates already address the issue of equal treatment for all in the light of their judicial oath and the JSB has recently begun a study to identify the skills and knowledge required by lay magistrates to ensure equality of treatment for all who appear in their courts.

 A key principle of the local management of schools arrangements is that a large part of a school's budget is determined largely by the enrolment. If the take-up of places in new grant-maintained schools affect the enrolments in other schools, it could also have implications for the budgets of those schools which will, of course, then have lower running costs.

Of these patients 29 were in the Ulster North Down and Ards Trust. A survey of discharge delays carried out by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board found that there were a number of reasons for such delays. While pressure on community care budgets was a contributory cause in more than half the cases,

 Responsibility for this matter has been delegated to the Social Security Agency under its Chief Executive, Mr. Alec Wylie, and I have asked him to arrange for a response to be given.

<BR>
I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about Disability Living Allowance reviews and appeals.
<BR>
The information you requested on the number of reviews and appeals is set out in the attached tables.
<BR>
I regret that information on the cost of review and appeal procedures is not maintained separately and to provide this would require a major clerical exercise generating disproportionate costs.
<BR>
As many customers provide additional evidence throughout the adjudication process, it is inevitable that some of the original decisions will be overturned at the review and appeal stages. Experience also shows that most customers routinely ask for a review or appeal where the higher rates of Disability Living Allowance have not been awarded. In most cases, arrears of benefit arising from overturned decisions are calculated and paid by computer which means that the impact of this work on the Social Security Agency is minimal.
<BR>
I hope this explains the position for you but I would be happy to provide any further information you require.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will permit housing benefit to be made available in the form of loans for deposits and first month's advance rental on private sector accommodation. [3831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 No. There is no provision within the housing benefit legislation for the award of loans and there are no plans to change this policy.
<P>

<a name="70623w18.html_para0">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive is supporting a rent guarantee scheme, which avoids the requirement for an advance or deposit, operated by the Simon Community (NI), a voluntary organisation working with the homeless. The scheme is currently operating as a pilot exercise in the Belfast area and, if successful, is likely to be extended in its scope.

 Responsibility for this subject has been delegated to the Northern Ireland Child Support Agency under its Chief Executive, Mr. Patrick Devlin, and I have asked him to arrange for a response to be given.

<BR>
When a child maintenance assessment is calculated notifications are issued to both the absent parent and parent with care informing them of the amount and the effective date of the weekly liability. At this stage accounts are set up and further notifications setting out the method, frequency, amount and date of the first regular payment are sent to both parents. They are also advised of the amount of maintenance due for the initial payment period. The absent parent is advised that if he has paid any maintenance during this time for any of the children named the amount of the initial payment may be reduced to take account of monies already paid.
<BR>
If an absent parent fails to make payment on the due date he is advised that child maintenance payments are in arrears. The notification sets out the due date, amount due, amount paid/adjusted and arrears. He is also asked to pay the arrears in full or if he is unable to do so to contact the Agency immediately to discuss an agreement to pay them. The notification also advises that if an agreement to pay the arrears is reached then payments of regular maintenance must be maintained.
<BR>
I hope you find this information useful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will estimate the cost of providing public sector dwellings for all homeless cases.[3833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Murphy: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate, since those classified as homeless by the Housing Executive are considered for allocations from the existing housing stock or from newly constructed dwellings. They may also be temporarily housed at present in hostels or bed and breakfast accommodation. The national cost of providing new dwellings for the estimated 4,000 currently classified as homeless would be &#163;140 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will amend the rules of the Housing Executive preventing sales of ground floor dwellings to those becoming tenants after the age of 60 years so as to permit house sales in certain circumstances.[3829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Murphy: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and its Chief Executive has advised me that in August 1996 the Housing Executive Board reviewed this aspect of its house sales policy. It decided not to change the scheme because the present policy achieved the necessary balance between the competing needs of tenants who require an adequate supply of such accommodation and potential purchasers who wish to buy their homes.

Information on the numbers and proportions of individuals, whose household income is below various levels, is published annually in the DSS statistical series "Households Below Average Income," a copy of which is in the Library. The estimates are drawn from household surveys, whose sample sizes would not allow any valid estimates to be made on a monthly basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is her estimate of revenue expenditure and savings, broken down by (i) income tax, (ii) national insurance and (iii) means tested benefits, arising from the introduction of a national minimum wage at <i>(a)</i> &#163;3.50 per hour and <i>(b)</i> &#163;4.20 per hour, accompanied by a reduction in housing benefit and family credit tapers to 50 per cent. and replacing the current 20 tax band with 10p.

 We will ask the independent Low Pay Commission, before it reaches a recommendation on the level at which the national minimum wage might be set, to take into account all the economic circumstances, including its likely impact. We will not speculate about the possible effects of hypothetical levels before the Commission has had a chance to consider the issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans she has to make the earnings limit for carers on income support equivalent to the earnings limit for invalid care allowance; and if she will make a statement. [2868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There is no fixed limit to the amount a carer can earn and continue to receive income support. Carers are exempt from the normal income support remunerative work rule. This means that they can continue to receive income support to top-up their earnings even if they work more than 16 hours each week. The first &#163;15 of a carer's earnings is disregarded in the income support calculation. Most other groups can earn only &#163;5 before their benefit is affected.
<P>

<a name="70623w21.html_para2">The invalid care allowance (ICA) earnings limit is fixed at &#163;50 per week, after the deduction of certain expenses. It is intended to help carers keep contact with employment. However, unlike income support, ICA is not an income-related benefit. People with earnings below the earnings limit can get ICA in full but people whose earnings are above the limit cannot get ICA at all.
<P>

<a name="70623w21.html_para3">We have no plans to change these limits at present but are keeping the position of carers under review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70623w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 There are no reliable estimates of the number of lone parents by constituency. As a broad indication of the number of lone parents not in work it is estimated that, in November 1995, there were 5,000 lone parents claiming income support in the metropolitan district of Bolton, which encompasses a larger area than Bolton, West.
