<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary question asking for how many deaths within Humberside police area, alcohol was found to be a primary cause in each of the last five years. (208364)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The latest year for which figures are available is 2003. The attached table shows the numbers of deaths among residents of the Humberside police area where the underlying cause of death indicated a condition directly related to alcohol use in the years 1999 to 2003.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> For the years 1999&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

<br>
291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

<br>
303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

<br>
305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

<br>
571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

<br>
E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

<br>
For the years 2001&#150;03 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes:<br>

<br>
F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

<br>
142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

<br>
K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

<br>




K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

<br>
K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

<br>
X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will extend to older children the advantages of saving up to &#163;1,200 a year tax free, which is available to younger children under the Child Trust Fund.  [209270]</p>




<p><a name="50118w01.html_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The Child Trust Fund goes live on 6 April 2005 and the Government have already backdated eligibility to September 2002. Older children can benefit from tax-free saving too. The market offers a wide range of savings and investment accounts designed especially for children from National Savings and Investment products to Friendly Societies, banks and building societies. Every child has a personal tax allowance of &#163;4,745 a year and parents are taxed on their child&#039;s account only when the gift produces more than &#163;100 gross income per year, per parent. The Child Trust Fund offers new opportunities and new incentives that never existed before. In conjunction with other saving products offered by the market it will help to encourage saving for all children. The Government keeps all saving incentives under review.

<p class="tabletext">Directive 2003/92 amends the sixth VAT Directive (DIR 77/388), 7 October 2003&#151;changing the place of supply of gas and electricity so that supplies to taxable dealers take place (and are therefore taxed) where the dealer is established, and supplies to others take place where the gas or electricity is used and consumed.</p>

<p class="tabletext">Directive 2003/49 is concerned with a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different member states.

</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext">Directive 2003/93/EC amends Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct and indirect taxation.

Under the directive, information will be collected automatically about the payment of savings income to residents in certain other countries and exchanged with tax authorities in those countries. During a transitional period, until they implement automatic exchange of information, three member states&#151;Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg&#151;will instead apply a withholding tax on cross-border interest payments made to individuals. Council Decision 2004/587/EC set the date of application of Directive 2003/48/EC as 1 July 2005.</p>

</p>



<p>(2) what representations she has received on extending the life of the Levy Board.  [209131]</p>




<p><a name="50118w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caborn  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 January 2005]:</i> I have received a number of representations from within the racing industry that the abolition of the Levy Board should be deferred and have met representatives of the British Horseracing Board (BHB) on several occasions since the European Court of Justice ruling was announced.

<p>
<a name="50118w05.html_para0">
In response to the ruling the British Horseracing Board has commissioned an independent review into the future funding of racing. I welcome this review and look forward to seeing its conclusions and the views of the BHB, the Levy Board and the Association of British Bookmakers.

<p><a name="50118w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Betting Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 includes no prohibition on flood-lit all-weather horse racing. However, it does prohibit the late-night opening of Licensed Betting Offices (LBOs) during the winter season.

<p><a name="50118w05.html_spnew2"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 Lottery distributors are required to take into account the need to reduce economic and social deprivation in making awards. It can be difficult to determine precisely the extent of their contribution to reducing social and financial exclusion but a significant number of Lottery-funded projects have helped to regenerate inner cities, create employment and strengthen communities. Since the Lottery began there have been 240 awards made in the constituency of Sunderland north totalling &#163;24.1 million.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the level of UK carbon emissions resulting from electrical appliances being left in standby mode in the last year for which figures are available.  [208190]</p>




<p><a name="50118w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s Market Transformation Programme estimates that consumer electronics, home computing equipment, domestic cooking equipment and office equipment left in stand-by mode produced approximately 650,000 tonnes of carbon (c6.7TWh) in the UK in 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w06.html_para2">
We are also aware that there is further energy consumption, for which we do not have firm estimates at present, from washing machines and dishwashers which are switched on awaiting use or after they have completed their wash cycles; consumer electronic equipment using external power supplies (e.g. domestic portable telephones) that continue to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled. Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around one million tonnes of carbon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w06.html_para3">
In order to try to tackle this problem the Market Transformation Programme (www.mtprog.com) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the stand-by power consumption of household appliances through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets. This approach has been fairly successful in respect of televisions: an EU-wide voluntary agreement will mean that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK now consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&#150;8 watts consumed by older models. Discussions are now under way to extend this agreement to cover other consumer electronics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w06.html_para4">
A similar agreement for external power supplies aims to encourage new power supplies consuming around half a watt in stand-by mode compared to the present average of just over 2 watts.

<p><a name="50118w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 As we set out in the 2003 Energy White Paper, one of the four goals of our energy policy is to put ourselves on a path to cut the UK&#039;s carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, with real progress by 2020.

We estimated then that, on the basis of our current policies, including the full impact of the Climate Change Programme, our carbon dioxide emissions might amount to some 135 MtC in 2020. The Energy White Paper said that, to be consistent with demonstrating leadership in the international process, we will aim for cuts in carbon dioxide emissions of 15&#150;25 MtC below that by 2020, which would put us on a course to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050.

<p><a name="50118w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 In 2002, the Department published new Climate Change Scenarios in support of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP). The scenarios were prepared by the Tyndall and Hadley Centres under contract to the Department and used the Hadley Centre&#039;s high resolution regional climate change model. They represented a significant step forward in providing a basis for assessing the potential impacts of climate change in different parts of the UK during this century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w06.html_para7">
The scenarios indicate that it is likely that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">UK annual average temperatures will rise by between 2 and 3.5 degrees Celsius by the 2080s;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p class="tabletext">High summer temperatures will become more frequent and very cold winters will become increasingly rare;</p>

<p class="tabletext">Extreme sea levels will be experienced more frequently.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="50118w06.html_para8">
These projections are based on four alternative scenarios of future global emissions of greenhouse gases and as such capture some of the uncertainty that surrounds our ability to predict future climate. However it is recognised that projections of climate change, especially at the regional level, are also subject to modelling uncertainties which are the focus of current research. Nevertheless the UKCIP scenarios provide a scientifically robust indication of the general trends in climate that are expected and a useful basis for assessing the potential risks and opportunities of climate change.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what advice she has received from the scientific community regarding the cessation of the compilation of Dobson Photospectrerra data from Camborne;  [207984]
</p>



<p>(2) what consultation she undertook before stopping research into ozone depletion at Camborne Meteorological Office;  [207985]

<p><a name="50118w07.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government are satisfied that the current arrangements for collecting ozone data are more cost-effective than those applying previously, and meet scientific and public information needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para0">
The Met Office, for the UK Government, has collected Dobson Photospectrometer data since 1957. Measurements at Camborne were taken between 1957 and 1967 and then between 1989 and 2003. In the intervening period, measurements were taken at Bracknell, near Reading. There have been continuous measurements at Lerwick since 1957.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para1">
Ozone measurements are also available from satellites and give complete coverage for the UK, although a few local measurements in an area the size of the UK are needed to calibrate the satellite data and to provide long-term data for analysing trends.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para2">
At the renewal of the monitoring contracts in 2003, bidders were asked to propose a rationalisation of both the ozone and ultra-violet radiation (UV) monitoring networks. Following an analysis of network requirements, provided by Imperial College, it was decided to move measurements of ozone from Camborne to Reading, for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There was a long record of UV measurements at Reading and co-location of the ozone and UV monitoring sites in the south was deemed to be useful.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Ozone measurements had been made at Bracknell, near Reading, previously.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Ozone measurements were also made in Valentia, Ireland, and that would be sufficient information, together with Reading, to provide cover for south west England.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para3">
A separate formal consultation was not undertaken but was not considered necessary as the open tender process, which included key players in ozone monitoring, sought guidance on the monitoring requirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para4">
The Met Office expressed the view to Defra that the measurements at Camborne should have been continued; but Defra, in reviewing all of the advice it had received, concluded that on balance relocation to Reading was the best option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para5">
The daily ozone data are analysed on a weekly basis, and the results, including those covering the south-west, are placed on a publicly accessible website (http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/ozone/). The record at Lerwick over the last 30 years shows a decreasing trend in overall ozone levels. However, there is some indication of ozone recovery in the last 10 years at both Lerwick and Camborne. If any short-term low or high ozone events occur, further analysis is carried out to ascertain the causes. Records are sent to international data centres where they are made available for studies to identify global ozone trends.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether a high level of protection and improvement of the environment as required by Article 1&#150;3(3) of the proposed EU constitution has been attained by <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> each other EU member state.  [208250]</p>




<p><a name="50118w07.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Article 2 of the existing Treaty establishing the European Community sets the promotion of a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment as one of the tasks of the EC. Similarly, Article 1&#150;3(3) of the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union sets working for the sustainable development of Europe as one of the objectives of the EU, with a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment as one of the bases for this. The UK welcomes this. The environment is an area where considerable progress has been made by EU member states working together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para6">
In relation to work in the UK, on 8 December 2004, Defra published its five year strategy, &quot;Delivering the Essentials of Life&quot;. This sets out Defra&#039;s achievements, vision and plans for work over the coming years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para7">
At EU level, the sixth Environmental Action Programme, adopted in 2002, set out priority areas for work over a 10 year period; work on more detailed thematic strategies covering key areas is in progress, and these are due to be published by the European Commission in 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para8">
Assessment of the state of the environment in other member states is a matter for those states, and for relevant EU institutions such as the European Commission, European Environment Agency (EEA) and Eurostat where collating such information lies within their remit. The EEA&#039;s &quot;Kiev report&quot; published in April 2003 provides an in-depth report on the state of the environment in Europe.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what efforts the UK is making within the EU to ensure that those EU countries that are off-target with their Kyoto commitments make better progress to meet their commitments; and if she will make a statement.  [207213]</p>




<p><a name="50118w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Demonstrating progress towards the EU&#039;s Kyoto Protocol target of a -8 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 will be a priority for the UK&#039;s presidency of the EU later this year. We are taking every opportunity to raise the issue in discussions with other member states, and stressing the importance of implementing measures to meet their commitments. We will also press for harmonisation across member states with respect to the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for Phase 2 (2008&#150;12).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w07.html_para9">
The latest emission projections from member states suggest that a combination of existing domestic policies and measures, additional policies and measures which are already in an advanced state of planning, and emission credits gained through the Kyoto Protocol&#039;s project-based mechanisms will deliver a total EU-15 emissions cut of 8.6 per cent. by 2010. We will continue to review and monitor progress towards this goal.

<p><a name="50118w08.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) has primary responsibility for providing advice to the Government on any new evidence which may affect the risk to those who use pesticides. At its meeting on 13 January the ACP considered the Report of the Department of Health&#039;s advisory Committee on Carcinogenicity relating to the link between prostate cancer and pesticides.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w08.html_para1">
The ACP concurred with that committee&#039;s view that there is some limited evidence to suggest an association between farmers/farm workers, exposure to pesticides, and increased risk of prostate cancer, but noted that this limited evidence did not prove a causal link between pesticide use and cancer. The ACP also agreed with the conclusion that the potential association between herbicide use and cancer in farmers and farm workers should be kept under review. Organophosphate pesticides were not identified in the report.

 As at 11 January 2005, some 200,000 applications for higher education entry in 2005 had been registered with the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) via their online application service, &#039;ucasapply&#039;. This compares with about 79,000 registrations at the same point last year. The majority of registrations (76 per cent.) were via schools. UCAS has announced that is gearing up to be able to handle over 450,000 electronic applications a year.

<a name="50118w11.html_para0">
I understand that UCAS have arrangements in place to evaluate customer satisfaction with the online application service, and are developing additional ones. In addition to information on how to use ucasapply, schools were sent a questionnaire to gain feedback on their experience of usage. Of those schools that had used ucasapply, 71 per cent. of respondents felt they had all the information they needed, and over 56 per cent. felt that it had cut down the amount of time staff spent on administering applications compared with previous paper-based applications. Schools that have not yet used ucasapply have cited lack of time to learn how to use the online system as the main reason. UCAS has contacted those falling in this category and offered them further support.

Since April 2004, a senior UK police officer seconded to DFID has been working in the region as a Police Adviser and DFID has provided over 50 urgently needed police vehicles (with additional funding of &#163;700,000) as well as some communications, computer and other police equipment.

On debt relief, Sri Lanka has been added to the list of countries eligible for the UK&#039;s multilateral debt relief initiative. The UK will pay 10 per cent. of its debt service costs to the International Development Association (IDA), which amounts to approximately $5.5 million in 2005, $5.8 million in 2006 and $6.2 million in 2007. Paris Club creditors have agreed not to expect repayments from affected countries that request it until the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have completed a full needs assessment of their reconstruction and financing requirements. It is not possible to quantify the value of any relief at this stage as the technical terms remain to be discussed with those countries that apply.

<p><a name="50118w17.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </b> 
Experts do not know the underlying cause of prostate cancer. We do know that the largest risk factor is age, with family history, ethnicity, diet and some occupational factors also playing a role. There has also been an increase in the number of prostate cancer being detected. Experts do not know if this is due to an increased risk of prostate cancer or to an increase in testing for prostate cancer. The lengthening of life expectancy may also have a role in this increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118w17.html_para2">
We do know that prostate cancers can be broken down into slow growing, non-aggressive and fast growing, aggressive types. The vast majority of prostate cancers are slow growing and will not cause any harm to the man in his lifetime. The fast growing account for approximately 20 per cent. of prostate cancers and if left untreated will cause harm.

The dilemma has been that we do not know how to distinguish between the fast and slow growing types. That is why we promised to spend &#163;4.2 million on research into prostate cancer by 2003&#150;4, which was achieved. This was part of the NHS prostate cancer programme, published in September 2000.

An evaluation of Worktrack was completed in May 2002, which concluded that, with some modifications there was a continuing need for the programme, at that time. Since then, the economic climate has improved, unemployment is at a very low level and there are more job opportunities. The programme is therefore considered to have a lower priority than other competing demands. The costs of an employment placement under Worktrack are also high. There is other provision available to assist people into work and significant resources available to increase skills through higher and further education.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the recent seizure by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety of unauthorised and counterfeit veterinary medicines.  [208308]</p>





<p><a name="50118w21.html_spnew3"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 During 2004 the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety was involved in a lengthy investigation into the illegal distribution and sale of unlicensed veterinary medicinal products, This investigation, undertaken with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, uncovered substantial evidence of an illegal manufacturing operation of these unlicensed medicines and also of a counterfeit product.

The products uncovered were mainly antibiotic preparations intended for food-producing animals. Their unauthorised use could pose a significant threat to human health through unacceptable levels of drug residues in food, and the potential for the growth of microbial resistance to essential human medicines. A file on this has now been passed for consideration to the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.

<sup>(15)</sup> WAVE Trauma Centre has a network of five branches around Northern Ireland. Major amounts of funding, such as Peace II (&#163;1.39 million) cannot be accurately allocated among the individual locations and have been credited to the Belfast office.<br>

Note:<br>

The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland (formerly Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust) also received &#163;1,123,324 through the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace I), which supported victims of violence. The Foundation allocated these funds in support of a number of projects for both ex-offenders and victims. Persons from these groups could benefit from the same project and it is not possible to disaggregate the assistance between the two groups.<br>

 The National Radiological Protection Board&#039;s independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) recommended that the Home Office should ensure that emissions from Airwave handsets and vehicle-mounted sets are within international guidelines. Accordingly, the Home Office specified that the maximum transmission power levels should be either 1 Watt (for handsets) or 3 Watts (for vehicle-mounted sets). Independent checks have found that emission levels from Airwave equipment are within international guidelines.

 There are two basic types of recording equipment that might be fitted to police vehicles: incident, or collision, data recorders (IDRs) and journey data recorders (JDRs). IDRs are fitted to a vehicle for the capture and short-term storage of data from on-board sensors. Their primary aim is to assist in establishing what occurred prior to and during a collision. They can be used to supplement physical evidence for incident reconstruction and act as an &#039;independent witness&#039; in the event of a collision. JDRs give management information on a vehicle&#039;s performance. They are typically used by fleet managers to monitor vehicle usage and efficiency.

The fitting of such recording devices is a local operational matter. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) does however recommend that forces consider such a course. We welcome this.

 The final decision on the franchise will be a matter for Parliament to decide.

The Westminster franchise consists of British citizens resident in the UK either currently or at any point in the past fifteen years, Commonwealth citizens with leave to enter or remain in the UK, and citizens of the Republic of Ireland (with whom the UK has a reciprocal arrangement).

 The Transitional Administrative Law, which came into force on 28 June 2004, made provision for the right of all Iraqis to join unions. We understand that at least 12 national trade unions have already been set up and four open conferences have been held. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions organised a successful fact-finding mission in early 2004, partly funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which looked at the state of trade unions in Baghdad, Basra and northern Iraq.

VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2003.

<p><a name="50118w29.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the effect has been on the UK retail car market of the European Commission Regulation No. 1400/2002, which exempts EC competition rules arrangements in the EU for the distribution of new cars and subsequent servicing; and if she will make a statement.  [208617]</p>




<p><a name="50118w29.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Since the introduction of Commission Regulation 1400/2002, the UK new car retail market remains substantially the same in terms of how and by whom new cars are supplied to consumers. However, agreements between manufacturer and retailer, or car repair and service business, made under the regulations provide considerably more freedoms for business, for example, to retail more than one make of new car, or to trade only in cars and carry out no servicing. The full effects of these new freedoms will not be felt before October 2005, the date when car dealers can set up subsidiaries and warehouses within any territory within the EU. The new freedoms will take a considerable time to work through, depending as they do on non investment decisions by individual businesses, but the result should be greater freedom for car sales and aftermarket businesses to operate as they wish, more competition, and better choice for consumers.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the effect of the new EU Block Exemption regulations EU 1400/2002 having on car repair and servicing; and if she will make a statement.  [208618]</p>




<p><a name="50118w29.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 There is more opportunity for business to compete in the market for repair and servicing new cars and more choice for consumers as to where they have their &quot;within-warranty&quot; new cars serviced as a result of the regulation. Any car repair or servicing business is free to become a part of any car manufacturer&#039;s or importer&#039;s approved repairer network, provided they meet the qualitative criteria set by the manufacturer. In addition, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Jan 2005 : Column 924W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
since the introduction of Commission Regulation 1400/2002 the Office of Fair Trading has ensured that manufacturers no longer include servicing ties to their approved repairer networks within the terms and conditions of new car warranties.

<p><a name="50118w29.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 It is reported that, on average, car prices fell in real terms by 9 per cent. between June 1999 and June 2004. While some of this decrease might be attributable to the effect of the Order it is only one of many factors which reflect the final market price of new cars.

<p>
<a name="50118w29.html_para2">
The EOC&#039;s report &quot;Monitoring Progress on Equal Pay Reviews&quot; in spring 2004, showed that by November 2003, 15 per cent. of large employers had carried out an EPR, 10 per cent. were in the process of conducting one, and a further 26 per cent. were planning to do one. If those employers planning to carry out an EPR actually do so, it will mean that around 45 per cent. of large employers should either have completed an EPR, or be in the process of conducting one, by the end of 2004. These findings suggest that our target for 35 per cent. of large organisations to have done an EPR by 2006 will be achieved.
