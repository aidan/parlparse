 Public sector organisations should: use good commercial practice in managing the flows of expenditure and commitments they deal with; settle their bills on time within contractual terms in line with The Better Payments Practice Code; and be bound by The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1988. In relation to grants, once an agreement has been made and payment schedules agreed to, public sector organisations should honour these in the same way as they would any commercial or contractual arrangements. Government departments are required to note as exceptional any interest payments in relation to late payments in their resource accounts. This is set out in the &#147;Managing Public Money&#148; guidance issued by HM Treasury on sound financial management of public funds.</p>

 The types of training delivered by the Fire Service College and the Emergency Planning College reflect their differing but complementary missions. The Fire Service College focuses on specialist training at the operational (bronze), tactical (silver) and strategic (gold) levels, and over 90 per cent. of its students are from the fire and rescue service. As officers progress through the levels, they receive increasing exposure to multi-agency operations. In contrast, the Emergency Planning College&#146;s courses bring together all the many services and organisations involved in multi-agency working at the strategic (gold) level in large-scale emergencies, including non-blue light scenarios such as influenza. As a result, fire and rescue service students comprise less than 10 per cent. of the Emergency Planning College&#146;s intake.</p>

 DFID Ministers and officials have had a productive and ongoing dialogue with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on the issue of European Union (EU) sugar reforms. This has included meetings and correspondence and has covered the depth and pace of the reforms, the amount and allocation of transitional assistance and the implications for sugar of the EU's duty and quota free market access offer under the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA's).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="71008w0002.htm_para1"><a name="07100827000132">Most recent communication between DFID and the ACP countries has been about the European Commission's proposal to terminate the sugar protocol (SP). A number of ACP countries have been concerned about the impacts of the ending of the protocol. However, it is a logical consequence of the EU internal sugar market reforms and the offer of duty and quota free market access as part of the EPAs.</p>

 In 2003 the European Commission undertook an impact assessment of the proposed reform of the European Union (EU) internal sugar market (this was formally adopted by the Agricultural Council in February 2006). In May 2006 DEFRA undertook a comprehensive regulatory impact assessment of the reform. This assessment looked at the potential impact of the reform on all stakeholders including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries that supply sugar to the EU market under a preferential trade agreement. In addition DFID has commissioned a number of independent studies looking at the impacts of the reform on the sugar industry in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the least developed countries (LDC's).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="71008w0002.htm_para3"><a name="07100827000136">The assessments and studies all suggest that the reform will present challenges for the ACP countries who will see the value of their preference decline.

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="71008w0002.htm_para4"><a name="07100827000137">In response to these assessments DFID successfully lobbied the Commission to provide transitional assistance for the ACP countries. As a result of the lobbying the EU has earmarked around &#8364;1.244 billion between 2007 and 2013. Allocation of these funds is based on a national Sugar Action Plan submitted independently by the ACP countries. DFID has provided technical and financial support to a number of ACP countries to draw up their individual plans.</p>

 DFID does not make its own estimates but relies on those provided by the UN. The UN uses the number of people in need of emergency aid as its criterion for defining those who are affected by conflict. This figure currently stands at 4.2 million, including 2.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). There are some 500,000 people across Darfur who are cut off from all humanitarian assistance and protection services. For many of the others, access to aid is only sporadic and frequently interrupted by insecurity and attacks on humanitarian staff.</p>

It will specifically examine factors which contribute to the attrition rate in relation to sexual offences and identify ways to address under reporting of offences, further improve inter-agency case management and develop services which meet the needs of victims of sexual violence.</p>

 Information on average waiting time on a housing list for households is not held centrally. While information is collected centrally on the number of households on local authority housing waiting lists, which is given in the annual Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA), there is no indication of average time spent on a waiting list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="71008w0004.htm_para4"><a name="07100827000660">The accuracy of the list also depends on the extent to which housing authorities keep the register up-to-date, e.g. some people might already have found housing, yet remain on the list. It is also important to bear in mind that not everyone on the waiting list will necessarily be in urgent housing need. It will also include those who consider social housing as their preferred choice, or one of a number of housing options.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2007]: </i>The Gloucestershire tri-service centre will not be broken up. The centre will continue to house staff from all three emergency services and support tri-service working after the control room of the fire and rescue service is moved to the South West Regional Control Centre. The Government are committed to creating a new national network of nine resilient regional control centres which will enhance the ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents and natural disasters in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner. We believe that the public will be better protected by this approach. The new Regional Control Centres will however build on the valuable lessons learnt on joint working from the tri-service pilots, including the recent experience of dealing with flooding in Gloucestershire.</p>

 We are committed to reducing the number of empty homes and in particular the number of homes that are left empty for long periods of time. The Government do not set a national target for the number of empty homes to be brought back into use as this can be affected by local housing market conditions. However, the Housing Green Paper makes it clear that local authorities should do more to tackle empty homes and we are exploring ways to achieve an increase in activity. We consider that all local authorities should have in place comprehensive strategies on how they intend to deal with empty homes. Many local authorities set their own empty homes targets.</p>

 On a provisional estimate, 9 per cent. of all new dwellings in England in 2005 were built in flood risk areas. A more robust estimate for 2004 shows that 10 per cent. of all new dwellings in England were built in flood risk areas during that year.

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="71008w0009.htm_para2"><a name="07100827001796">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. Flood risk areas account for about 10 per cent. of land in England, including parts of major cities, and around 10 per cent. of the population already live in flood risk areas. The Government&#146;s aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The Government published planning policy statement (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="71008w0009.htm_para3"><a name="07100827001797">PPS25 ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. In particular, more vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in high risk areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the need for the development outweighs the risk, and it will be safe, without increasing flood risk.</p>

Not everyone on the waiting list is necessarily in urgent housing need. The waiting list includes those who consider social housing as their preferred or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&#151;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time. The size of the waiting list is not an indicator of absolute need, it is only useful as a broad indicator of housing demand in an area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="71008w0012.htm_para10"><a name="07100827002726">PPS 3 gives local authorities the responsibility for deciding the most suitable location for housing, taking account of their local circumstances and the availability of deliverable brownfield sites. It is no longer appropriate therefore to require them to refer larger greenfield sites to the Secretary of State as the Greenfield Land Direction did, and to keep this requirement in place would mean that it takes longer to make decisions on planning applications which could delay the delivery of necessary new housing on suitable sites.</p>

 Yes. Power generation infrastructure, including electricity sub-stations is included in PPS25, table D2 Flood Risk Vulnerability Classification. They are defined as &#145;essential infrastructure&#146; as it is acknowledged that power stations and grid and primary substations may need to be located in flood risk areas. This is because power stations often need a ready supply of water and sub-stations need to be located near to the communities they supply. The PPS25 sequential test will ensure that they are located in low risk areas where possible, but where there are no alternative lower risk locations for this type of development then the exception test will ensure that they are safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="71008w0012.htm_para14"><a name="07100827002734">Recent flood events during the summer have highlighted the importance of essential infrastructure being protected during flood events and PPS25 aims to ensure that any new electricity infrastructure that is essential in areas at risk of flooding is designed and constructed to be operational during floods.</p>

 In 2006 the Department commissioned the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to evaluate evidence submitted by the British Air Lines Pilots Association (BALPA) in relation to cabin air &#147;fume events&#148;. The COT received information from oil companies, airlines, engine manufacturers, independent scientific experts and pressure groups. The COT reported on 20 September 2007. Its report is published on its website:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para2"><a name="0710096000362">The Committee on Toxicity considered that it wasn't possible to conclude whether cabin air exposures (either general or following incidents) cause ill-health in commercial aircraft crews. It recommended further work, in particular, and as a priority, to ascertain whether substances in the cabin environment could potentially be harmful to health. COT considered that this work should be designed to detect any potentially harmful substances, rather than focus on named substances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para3"><a name="0710096000363">In keeping with its commitment to promoting healthy flying, the Department accepts this priority. Through the Aviation Health Working Group, it has recently made preparations for such a study by testing equipment which may be capable of capturing substances released during oil and hydraulic fluid fume incidents. Once effective equipment has been identified it is intended to sample around 1,000 flights using more than one sampling device, more than one laboratory to analyse the results, and an independent project manager from the academic world.</p>

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that UK air operators whose aircraft are required to be fitted with oxygen equipment must provide guidance to crews on its use in air contamination incidents.

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para4"><a name="0710096000366">Compliance with the guidance in the event of incidents will be monitored by routine review of Air Safety Reports and Mandatory Occurrence reports.

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para5"><a name="0710096000369">The funding arrangements for airports are dependent on whether an airport is designated under section 25 of the Aviation Security Act 1982.

 The UK National Aviation Security Programme requires airports to comply with specific security measures which are subject to regular inspection by the Department for Transport to ensure that standards are adhered to. The programme does not mandate the number of security personnel required to undertake security tasks. As private businesses, decisions about staffing are rightly a matter for the airports themselves.

 The aerodrome conducted an immediate investigation into the incident that occurred on 8 August 2007 and the report was presented to the CAA. The investigation revealed that the First Choice aircraft (airbus A320) that had arrived from Reus (Spain) was unable to access the main aircraft parking area due to congestion. In agreement with Air Traffic Control (ATC) the aircraft was initially held on a taxiway until space became available.

They have also commissioned a review of the pavement strength for the main runway and other paved surfaces. The United Kingdom Aeronautical Information Package (UKAIP) entry for the aerodrome has also been amended to reflect the pavement values for the aerodrome surfaces.

 The Government regulate rail fares where operators are likely to have a high degree of market power. Increases in regulated fares are limited to RPI+1 per cent. and the Secretary of State for Transport recently announced that regulated fares will be capped at this level until at least 2014. Fares that are not subject to regulation are priced at the discretion of train operators. However, the recent White Paper, &#147;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&#148;, concluded that the fares structure requires simplification for the benefit of passengers and announced its intention to work with the rail industry to implement a simplified fares structure.</p>

 The Department has not had any discussions with the Transport Operational Command Unit on these matters. However, we keep in touch with TfL officials about a range of taxi-related issues.

 If individuals provide a minicab service without holding the requisite licences they are committing an offence.

Section 53 of the Road Safety Act 2006 repeals the exemption from PHV licensing outside London for vehicles which work on contracts lasting not less than seven days. When the repeal takes effect&#151;in January 2008&#151;it will be much harder for operators and drivers to evade licensing. A similar provision (section 54 of the Act) will bring operators and drivers dedicated to contract work in London within the PHV licensing regime&#151;in March 2008.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to the answer of 17 September 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 2195-6W, on taxis: licensing, what assumptions were made about the <i> (a)</i> total number of currently unlicensed drivers, <i> (b)</i> number of vehicles, <i> (c)</i> number of operators and <i> (d)</i> average licence fees when making the estimate referred to; and how the estimate of total costs of &#163;1 million was reached.

 The estimate of &#163;1 million was included in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the proposal to repeal the private hire vehicle (PHV) contract exemption; a copy of this is in the Library of the House. The RIA was based on the following assumptions: (a) 2000 drivers (b) 2000 vehicles and (c) 300 operators would have to be licensed as a direct result of the repeal of the contract exemption. Average fees for each of the licences were assumed to be &#163;250, &#163;200 and &#163;400 respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="71008w0022.htm_para2"><a name="0710096001051">These estimates and assumptions were based on the fact that the terms of the contract exemption are narrow and apply in a relatively limited number of cases. They made no allowance for eases now coming to light where transport providers might have believed, or claimed, that they were covered by the exemption but were not in reality so covered. A number of these cases are, and will remain, outside the definition of a PHV in the legislation and therefore will still not need to be licensed. Others should have been licensed as PHVs in the past and repeal of itself will not therefore create a new requirement to meet licensing costs. The Department has sought the views of stakeholders on draft guidance for local licensing authorities on the impact of the repeal and we expect to publish the final version of this shortly.</p>

Local authorities are responsible for surface drainage from roads and public spaces, and the operation of highway drains; they also have permissive land drainage responsibilities for non-main rivers. Water and sewerage companies have a statutory duty to ensure the effective drainage of premises in their area, including any piped surface water arising from them. Internal drainage boards have permissive powers to undertake work to secure drainage and water level management within their districts, which cover 10 per cent. of the country's land area (mostly rural areas currently). The Highways Agency covers drainage from trunk roads.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 September 2007]:</i> DEFRA has made an initial estimate of the total costs of the outbreak to the UK of &#163;20 million, based on an economic model that has been developed for foot and mouth disease. The full impact will depend on domestic and international restrictions that remain in place and the estimate may be revised as further data become available.

 The energy efficiency of the housing stock in England cannot be monitored directly but is modelled, using data from periodic surveys of the housing stock coupled with data on the installation of energy saving measures. Based on the delivery of measures by existing energy efficiency programmes, we expect to be on track towards the 20 per cent. target. DEFRA is currently analysing the effects of energy efficiency policies but cannot yet quantify the improvement precisely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="71008w0027.htm_para2"><a name="07100912000222">However, there is one positive indication that efficiency has already started to improve substantially. Against a long-term trend of rising gas consumption, household gas usage fell by over 8 per cent. over the period 2004-06. Of this, up to half could be attributed to higher prices; weather changes had little effect. Improved energy efficiency for heating, particularly higher levels of insulation (installed via the energy Efficiency Commitment) and more efficient boilers (required by Building Regulations), is likely to have contributed to the remaining reduction of gas, the principal heating fuel. However, more detailed analysis is required to quantify this effect, and to express it in terms of improved energy efficiency.</p>

In parallel with this we are working closely with the credit union movement and investing &#163;1 million of the Growth Fund to test ways in which the recently announced Transaction Banking Service can be introduced to enable even greater service through credit unions for those who find it difficult to access mainstream financial services.</p>

Finally, in each location where closure was being considered, Remploy reviewed whether they would be able to support their disabled employees in mainstream employment.</p>

 Entitlement to income-related benefits requires that a person has a right to reside and be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland (generally known as the Common Travel Area). If a person does not have a right to reside then he or she is treated as not being habitually resident and is not entitled to those benefits. A person who has a right to reside must also show that he or she is habitually resident in the UK unless he or she falls into an exemption category, such as that for EU workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="71008w0031.htm_para7"><a name="07100914000452">The term &#147;habitual residence&#148; is not defined in UK social security legislation but there is both domestic and EC case law on how that term should be interpreted. In order to determine whether a person is habitually resident, decision makers will, on the basis of the guidelines set out in the case law, consider a variety of factors about the person&#146;s circumstances. These include, for example, his or her attachment to and intentions in the UK; his or her reasons for coming here; and whether the person has family in the UK etc. Benefit decision-makers must be satisfied on objective grounds that a person who claims income-related benefits after arriving in the country has genuinely adopted the UK as his or her place of habitual residence.</p>
