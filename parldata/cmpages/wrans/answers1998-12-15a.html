To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will list the special advisers in his Department and the issues on which they specialise; and to what level they have been security cleared.  [62847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 My Department employs 3 Special Advisers, Ms Wendy Alexander, Mr. Murray Elder and Mr. David Whitton. Ms Alexander advises specifically on health, the Arts, social work, child care, housing and European affairs. Mr. Elder advises on issues relating to agriculture, the environment, forestry and fisheries, home affairs, devolution, local government and transport matters. In addition, both Ms Alexander and Mr. Elder deal with matters relating to business, industry and education. Mr. David Whitton has particular responsibility for the presentation of policy and relations with the media. Special Advisers are subject to the usual security clearance arrangements. It is not appropriate to give details about particular individuals' level of security clearance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will list the <i>(a)</i> landing capabilities and <i>(b)</i> designated sites associated with his announcement of expansion to the Highlands and Islands air ambulance service; and if he will make a statement.  [63309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The announcement concerned the recent contract awards made by the Scottish Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which has secured the continuing provision of Patient Air Transport Services for the people of Scotland. In addition to sustaining the high quality Air Ambulance Service and Air Ambulance High Dependency Service, both of which traditionally use fixed wing aircraft, significant improvements have been made to the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service.
<P>

<a name="81215w01.html_para0">The 2 new helicopters that are being commissioned into service are roomier, faster and quieter than their predecessors. Fully equipped for patient care, the aircraft are built for flying in more adverse weather conditions and in hours of darkness. Both will operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with air crew supported by ambulance paramedics and technicians and will be capable of landing at any of the 226 Civil Aviation Authority approved airports, landing strips and other landing sites located across Scotland. Outwith hours of darkness helicopters can land at any site so long as it is safe to do so. I shall write to the hon. Member with a detailed list of all of these locations as soon as possible, and will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library.

<a name="81215w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the forecast payment from the European Union with regard to the Highlands and Islands Objective I area for <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99; and if he will make a statement.  [63152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 In 1997-98, the amounts received from the European Commission with regard to the Highlands and Islands Objective 1 area totalled &#163;24.3 million, while the forecast receipts for 1998-99 amount to &#163;78.9 million. These payments include those made for the purposes of the Highlands and Islands Objective 1 Programme as well as those made in pursuance of various Community Initiatives using the European Union Structural Funds. The amounts shown do not include certain payments made from the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund where separate information for the Highlands and Islands Objective 1 area could not be identified except at disproportionate cost. Nor, for the same reason, do they include any payments made by European institutions other than the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="81215w01.html_para1">The amounts received from the Commission as shown do not necessarily correspond in terms of their timing either with the commitment of funds or the payment of funds to individual projects under the Objective 1 Programme or with the Community Initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when the Scottish Environment Protection Agency report into fragments of irradiated nuclear fuel in the Dounreay local environment will be received.  [64389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The report was submitted to my right hon. Friend by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency on 10 December 1998. Copies are available in the House of Commons Library. We have noted the recommendations contained in the report. These are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The primary aim should be to restore the area affected by the fishing restrictions and any other affected areas to a clean pristine condition, and that as far as possible, within SEPA's powers, SEPA should insist that UKAEA make all practicable efforts to assist in quantifying the risks involved as a result of the irradiated nuclear fuel fragments in the environment, as a matter of priority and urgency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the meantime, applying the precautionary principle, SEPA's advice to the Scottish Office is that the two kilometre fishing restrictions should remain in force.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The public should be kept well informed and any information issued to the public should make clear the low level of risk involved by reference to comparisons with other activities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ultimate aim should be to remove the restrictions as soon as possible and, to that end, greater and speedier effort should be made by the UKAEA to find and quantify the extent of contamination in the local marine environment, using the best available methodology and technology.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81215w01.html_para2">Accordingly, the two kilometre fishing restrictions will remain in force. Clearly these restrictions cannot be lifted until UKAEA find and quantify the extent of contamination in the local marine environment, and this work should proceed as a matter of urgency. I have asked SEPA to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring in place to ensure that any particles finding their way to the public beach at Sandside are promptly detected and removed.

<P>
<P>

 We have fully supported the INDICT campaign since its launch in the House last year. My right hon.

Some of these contacts followed requests for assistance from the Chechen authorities, but most were at our request. We provided some non-lethal police equipment to the Chechen investigating authorities, to assist them. At the last such meeting, with Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Atgeriev in London on 26 October, we emphasised the need to avoid endangering the four men's lives. Atgeriev agreed that the safety of the hostages was paramount. He confirmed that the equipment provided by the UK had been of assistance to his staff.

licence fee at the level indicated by the five-year formula announced by the previous Government; and if he will make a statement about future licence fee levels.  [64272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 On 11 December 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>636</i>, the Government announced their intention, after careful consideration, to retain the television licence fee formula for the five years from April 1997 introduced by the previous Government. The formula, based on a report by independent consultants, Braxton Associates, is based on an assessment of the BBC's financial needs and the potential for improved efficiency and the development of alternative sources of revenue. It is designed to allow the BBC to plan its business properly for the period as a whole.
<P>

<a name="81215w02.html_para0">Under the formula, licence fee increases for the five-year period as a whole are set just below inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI). However, the increases from 1 April 1999 are set at RPI plus 0.5 per cent., reflecting primarily the additional costs faced by the BBC in launching its new digital services. The formula provides for changes in the licence fee of RPI minus 1 per cent. and RPI minus 2.5 per cent. in 2000-01 and 2001-02 respectively.
<P>

<a name="81215w02.html_para1">Application of the RPI figure of 3.2 per cent. for the year to September 1998, plus 0.5 per cent., to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &#163;101.00 for a colour licence and &#163;33.50 for a black and white licence. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course.

 The BBC and Independent Television Commission are responsible for transmission arrangements for terrestrial television services in the UK. They estimate that analogue terrestrial television services reach 99.4 per cent. of the UK population and 98.3 per cent. of the population of Wales. The BBC and ITC estimate that the launch phase of digital terrestrial television will deliver services to around 90 per cent. of the UK population, and 70 per cent. in Wales, by the end of 1999. Coverage of each of the six multiplexes will vary and in some cases will be less. The BBC and ITC have jointly produced a CD-Rom containing coverage predictions for each multiplex for each transmitter site. Copies of the CD-Rom have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

However, 55 per cent. of all pensioner households and 47 per cent. of all households in which one member was in receipt of income-related benefit would pay less on a measured than an unmeasured basis.

<P>
<a name="81215w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government's policy, reflected in the Water Industry Bill, is that domestic consumers presently charged on an unmeasured basis should have the option of requesting a measured basis of charging. However, no household should be compulsorily transferred to a measured basis of charging where they are using water only for essential household use.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it is his policy to allow landlords of short-term tenants to deny them the benefit of metered charges for water.  [63244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Under the present provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991, neither tenants nor any other consumers have a legal right to be charged for water on a measured basis, although water undertakers have powers to install meters and to charge any customer on a measured basis.
<P>

<a name="81215w04.html_para4">We propose that domestic water customers should have the right to move to a measured basis of charging for water, free of any initial costs for meter installation. Consumers benefiting from this right would include tenants who pay their own water charges. The Water Industry Bill provides that any contrary provision of any tenancy agreement which might otherwise prevent the installation of a meter is not to block the exercise of this right by tenants. However, the right would not be afforded to tenants on fixed term tenancies of less than six months. It is the Government's view that such tenants do not have 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 1998 : Column: 429</I><P>
a sufficiently long term interest in the basis of charging for water to warrant over-riding any provision in the tenancy agreement.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in which year noise limits were first placed on individual aircraft taking off from Gatwick Airport; and when he expects these limits to be reduced.  [63453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w04.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Noise limits on aircraft taking off from Gatwick have applied since 1968. On 24 November 1997 we published a consultation paper proposing lower daytime and night-time noise limits for aircraft departing from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and more efficient noise monitoring arrangements. In February 1998 the International Air Transport Association (IATA) submitted an application for leave to apply for judicial review of that consultation paper. The Department subsequently undertook to publish a supplementary consultation paper and IATA withdrew its application for leave to apply for judicial review. We hope to issue the supplementary paper early in the new year. The consultation period will remain open until eight weeks after the supplementary paper is issued. As indicated in the November 1997 consultation paper, if possible the Secretary of State will aim to announce his decision within 3 months of this deadline. 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 1998 : Column: 430</I><P>
If the decision is to implement the proposals as set out, or with only relatively minor alterations, the Secretary of State would seek to bring them into effect within not less than 2, and not more than 3, months of the date of the announcement. Comments have been invited on these timescales as well as on the proposals.

 My Department publishes national traffic forecasts, the most recent being for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. These forecasts split traffic between the London area and the other United Kingdom airports but the Department does not produce forecasts for individual airports. Manchester Airport has not published detailed forecasts for the period beyond 2005, but I understand that the airport company expects passenger throughput to exceed 30 million by 2008. the standard operating procedure will be for arriving aircraft to use the existing runway and for departing aircraft to use the second runway. BAA's most recent 10 year forecasts for its London airports, published in October, include 39.2 million passengers at Gatwick Airport in 2007-08 and 40.0 million in 2008-09.

Work is continuing within Government to finalise the text of the Order and until work is completed, it is not possible to state with certainty what functions will transfer to the Welsh Assembly. Similarly, the functions which will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998, depend in part on secondary legislation which has yet to be passed.

The paper describes progress to date in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and sets out a variety of policy options for meeting our climate change targets. It covers both the UK's legally binding target from Kyoto of a 12.5 per cent. reduction in a basket of six greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 and our domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.

 The Government are currently consulting on options to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and meet their climate change targets. Our consultation paper looks at a wide range of options. It does not propose targets for particular sectors. Our aim is to develop a balanced climate change programme where all sectors play a part.
<P>

<a name="81215w06.html_para2">Only the emissions from domestic flights, beginning and ending within the UK, are included in our national inventory. These account for around 11 per cent. of total emissions from UK originating air traffic. The UK is working within the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which was given the responsibility under the Kyoto Protocol, on ways of reducing emissions from international aviation.

 The Rail Regulator is responsible for setting the access charges which meet Railtrack's costs of maintaining and repairing station infrastructure. The Regulator is presently reviewing all Railtrack's access charges and is required to publish his final conclusions by July 2000. In addition, the Regulator's approval is required for any changes to station access charges which Railtrack may agree with a train operator as a result of investment in station improvements. On 5 December, the Regulator issued guidelines to the industry designed to ensure that any such changes to meet Railtrack's additional costs from enhancing station facilities are justified and calculated in a fair, consistent and transparent manner.

<a name="81215w06.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The increase in the British Railways Board's external finance requirement between 1996-97 and 1997-98 reflects the combined effects of large changes in the Board's finances. In particular, as a result of privatisation, the Board's turnover fell from &#163;3,397 million in 1996-97 including grants of &#163;1,507 million, to just &#163;231 million in 1997-98 including grants of &#163;51 million.

 The Greater London Authority Bill will enable London's elected Mayor to levy a charge on non-residential workplace parking. Alternatively the London Borough of Westminster will be able to introduce a levy within its boundary, subject to the agreement of the Mayor. The Bill provides that, if any scheme is brought forward in the Westminster area, it will be able to apply to the parliamentary estate. The charge would be payable by the Corporate Officer of the House. Whether or not to pass the charge on to individual Members would be for the House itself to determine.

 The Government's White Paper on the Future of Transport (Cm 3950) made it clear that we consider that carnets are a desirable alternative to season tickets. They would be a particular benefit to part-time workers as well as occasional travellers and we wish to encourage all rail (and indeed other transport) operators to offer them as part of their ticketing range. The current arrangements for fares are a consequence of legally binding franchise agreements inherited from the previous Government. When opportunities arise for negotiating franchises, the structure and marketing of fares is one of the areas in which the new Strategic Rail Authority will look for improvements.

<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 1998 : Column: 444</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81215w08.html_para3"><i>Letter from the Secretary of State for Defence to Mr. Alan Simpson, dated 30 November 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In my answer to your Parliamentary Questions on 19 November, (Official Report, cols 712-713). I undertook to write to you about certain aspects of Trident computer systems.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked first about the percentage of computer chips purchased "off the shelf" from suppliers. The Trident Strategic Weapon System was procured "off the shelf" from the US Government under the provisions of the Polaris Sales Agreement as amended for Trident. It is not, therefore, possible to provide the level of detail called for in the question. However the US has a programme of work to provide certification of Year 2000 compliance for all items associated with the system procured by the UK</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As far as your question about audits and action plans on millennium compliance is concerned, I can tell you that a comprehensive audit of the deterrent is being conducted by a dedicated Deterrent Millennium Task Group. At the top level this includes areas such as the missile and warhead, fire control, navigation, targeting, firing chain, reactor and propulsion control, sonar, command and control and all associated shore based facilities. Each of these areas is further sub-divided into many hundreds of smaller sub-systems, each of which is being investigated. Extensive tests are being conducted on all equipment associated with the Trident Weapon System and its supporting infrastructure to confirm that it will not be affected by any key dates before, during and after the turn of the century. A programme of trials is in place to provide further verification. I trust this also addresses your question about systems identified as being critical to the safe and continuous operation of the Trident system. It would not be in the national interest to disclose the details of our audits and investigations as this would reveal information which could compromise the effectiveness of the UK's strategic deterrent. I am therefore withholding this information under exemption 1, Defence, security and International relations, of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As far as our discussions with the US are concerned, we are working extremely closely to ensure that common equipment critical to each nation's defence capability, including Trident, are millennium compliant. In addition to the regular, frequent meetings on the wider Year 2000 problem, regular meetings are held with the US under the provisions of the Polaris Sales Agreement with Year 2000 compliance one of the items on the agenda: The most recent such meeting was on 10 November. The US programme I have already mentioned has a forecast date for completion of 31 December this year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked about planned expenditure to ensure millennium compliance of the Trident systems. There is no separately identified central record of planned millennium compliance expenditure specifically related to the Trident system. I would, however, refer you to the answer given by Margaret Beckett to Maria Eagle on 21 October in which she announced the results of the latest quarterly review of Government departments and agencies progress in tackling the bug. The results of the next quarterly review will be announced shortly to the House and the updates to quarterly plans will be placed in the Library of the House and on the internet.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, there is no central record of the number of staff dedicated to ensuring the Trident systems's millennium compliance which you also requested. However, staff in relevant appointments are working to ensure the status of all systems is identified and that action plans are in place where required.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am copying this letter to Llew Smith to whom I also undertook to write in respect of his question on the issue of millennium compliance of nuclear systems.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this is helpful.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am placing a copy of this letter in the Library of the House.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the offices or agencies under his control which will be subject to L.2 of Head L in Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998; how many people are currently employed in these offices; and what equal opportunities practices are adopted in these offices.  [63804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 There were some 23,200 Service and civilian personnel based at 116 locations in Scotland, as at 1 April 1998 (the most recent date for which figures are available). All of these personnel will continue to be subject to the appropriate UK legislation. For the 10,000 civilian personnel this involves compliance with the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, listed in Head L2 of Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act, as well as Departmental policies against unfair discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, age and religious belief. In order for the Armed Forces to maintain combat effectiveness they are granted an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, in Section 85(4) of the Act, and from the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Current policy is also that homosexuals are not allowed to serve in the Armed Forces; this issue will be reviewed in the lifetime of this Parliament. Aside from these specific exceptions the Armed Forces are committed to equality of opportunity irrespective of gender, religion, ethnic or social background and vigorous policies are in place to ensure that this is achieved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The costs of the defence and subsequent appeal of the soldiers convicted of causing the death of the Danish tour guide were met by the Army Legal Aid scheme, and have been &#163;260K to date. This figure does not include the cost of the appeals process which has only recently concluded.

<P>

 The need to improve the skills of the British work force is well-recognised and this forms a key theme of the Competitiveness White Paper which I am to publish shortly. This report is the first substantive piece of British research on how people management practices impact upon business performance in manufacturing industries. I welcome the report's findings that recent business performance was better where firms encouraged acquisition and development of employee skills, and where workers had more job autonomy--either individually or in teams.
<P>

<a name="81215w10.html_para10">My Department has jointly funded the 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS). Data from this will be used to do a similar type of analysis but it will be for a nationally representative set of British workplaces with 10 or more employees.

The work will be taken forward through ten sectoral panels and three thematic panels looking at the aging population, crime prevention and the future of manufacturing. Associate Programmes will be run by professional institutions and other organisations, working closely with the Office of Science and Technology.
<P>

<a name="81215w11.html_para1">There will be many avenues for participation, with a particular emphasis on involving young people. An Internet-based Knowledge Pool will provide a unique resource to support Foresight participants and promote widespread debate on emerging results and conclusions.
<P>

<a name="81215w11.html_para2">The Government's vision is to put the future on Britain's side. We have the talent to exploit the opportunities of the future.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 1998]:</i> The 2 in 1 metering scheme is a trial one being run by the Hyder Group (Swalec and Welsh Water). I understand that it is currently confined to 3,000 customers who join the scheme on a voluntary basis. Swalec have issued proceedings seeking a judicial direction that their scheme is lawful, not contrary to the Electricity Act 1989 and that the Director General of Electricity Supply has no powers to issue enforcement proceedings under the Act. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further while this process is under way.

<a name="81215w13.html_para1">On 16 November, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities launched a consultation on the draft Code of Practice for Age Diversity in Employment. A final version of the code will be published early next year.
<P>

<a name="81215w13.html_para2">The draft Code of Practice builds on the results of the year long consultation on age discrimination set out in the report 'Action on Age' published in August. This pointed to the immediate impact a Code of Practice would have in tackling unfair age discrimination in employment. Proposals for the Code were widely welcomed by employers and individuals alike.
<P>

<a name="81215w13.html_para3">Given this Government's busy legislative programme, the Code of Practice is an effective measure that will challenge employment practices that unfairly discriminate against employees on the grounds of age. The impact of the Code will be evaluated and this will inform future plans for legislation in this area.
<P>

<a name="81215w13.html_para4">The Code of Practice is one of many strands in the Government's approach to helping older people enjoy an active life, participating fully in work and more widely. On 23 November "Building a Better Britain for Older People" was published, setting out the Government's wide strategy for supporting older people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 This information is not available to the Home Office and the hon. Member should approach the local authority.
<P>

<a name="81215w14.html_para0">Asylum seekers and refugees who are able to support themselves are currently free to live within the United Kingdom in a place of their own choosing. Asylum seekers who register their application for asylum at their port of entry may be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit and can then find their own accommodation. Refugees may also qualify for such benefits and are in a similar position. Asylum seekers who do not qualify for benefits, but who may be supported under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948, or the Children Act 1989 are supported by local authorities under the terms of that legislation. The Home Office currently has no role in providing support and is consequently not aware of the information sought. The Government plan a fundamental reform of the asylum and immigration laws to remove cash benefits and more strictly control where asylum seekers live.

 I regret that reliable information on the number of people residing in Eastbourne who have applied for asylum in the United Kingdom could be obtained only by examination of individual case records and is, therefore, available only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="81215w14.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B>

<P>
<a name="81215w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In accordance with Schedule 1 of the Charities Act 1993, the Home Secretary is responsible for the appointment of the Charity Commissioners. There are a maximum of five Charity Commissioners: the Chief Charity Commissioner is Head of the Department and Accounting Officer; there is a full-time Legal Commissioner; and three part-time Commissioners, one of whom must be legally qualified.
<P>

<a name="81215w14.html_para1">The Chief Charity Commissioner is Richard Fries, who was appointed on 1 June 1992 for a period of five years. This appointment was extended until 1 June 1999 with effect from 1 June 1997. The full-time Legal Commissioner is Michael Carpenter, appointed on 1 January 1998 until 7 October 2002. The part-time Commissioners are John Bonds, appointed on 1 January 1995 until 31 December 1997, extended to 31 December 1999; Jean Warburton (the other Legal Commissioner), appointed on 1 October 1996 until 30 September 2001; and Julia Unwin appointed from 1 May 1998 until 30 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="81215w14.html_para2">Whilst the Home Secretary is accountable to Parliament for the efficiency of the Charity Commission, his powers do not extend to investigating the Commission's decisions in particular cases. The Commission is a non-ministerial Government Department, accountable to the courts for its legal decisions. In exercising its powers under charity law, it functions in a quasi-judicial way and is not subject to Ministerial direction. In these matters it acts as an extension of the High Court and its decisions are subject to appeal to the courts. There are no plans to reform their lines of accountability.

 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) is currently considering the health effects of CS spray when used as an incapacitant. A comprehensive review of the available data has been prepared by officials at the Department for this purpose. The COT will consider the subject further at their February 1999 meeting. Their conclusions will be made known publicly once agreed and a copy of the review will be placed in the Library at the same time.

<a name="81215w16.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We are not currently aware of any representations concerning the effects of prescribing sodium valproate to people with epilepsy during pregnancy. Risks to the foetus are recognised for anticonvulsant therapies and information about whether and how to use medicines in pregnant patients can be found in the authorised product information for health professionals and patients. Women taking antiepileptic drugs who may become pregnant should be informed of the possible consequences. Those who wish to become pregnant should be referred to an appropriate specialist for advice. Women who become pregnant should be counselled and offered antenatal screening. The risks of epileptic control need to be weighed against the risks to the foetus of these treatments.

<a name="81215w18.html_para0">Monitoring in this area is based on ethnic origin, and not nationality. The 10 minority ethnic origin categories monitored by DfEE are those used in the 1991 census, which did not include an Irish category. The use of these categories will be reviewed in the light of any suggested changes for the 2001 Population Census.

 The Department has received a number of letters on these issues. The results of a Department- commissioned study of national occupational standards for engineering were published in 1996.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 1998]:</i> The guidance in Circular 9/98, Teachers' Pay and Conditions of Employment 1998, applies. The funding available through the Standards Fund to the school which is an advanced skills teacher's main employer includes an element to meet the cost of supply cover when the advanced skills teacher is operating outside the school. Advanced skills teachers are expected to spend most of their time teaching in their own school.

[63478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 As part of UK-wide programmes, I estimate that the Department for Education and Employment will spend around &#163;200,000 on programmes or activities located in Wales. The Government of Wales Act 1998 provided for a Transfer of Functions Order to be made to transfer Ministerial functions to the National Assembly for Wales. This Order was published in draft for public consultation on 12 November. Until the content of the Order has been finalised it is not possible to say with certainty what functions will transfer. Work is continuing within government to finalise the text of the Order and to establish whether any programme expenditure relates to those functions which will transfer. Funds will be transferred as necessary on this basis.

 The Department has received a number of representations from organisations and individuals about aspects of teaching PE, including sport, in schools. Physical education must be taught to all children throughout their compulsory schooling and is a key part of providing them with a broad and balanced education.

 No. Although admission authorities have a duty to vary standard numbers where these are incompatible with the class size limit, adjusting school admission numbers to multiples of 30 is only one of a number of ways of meeting the limit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w19.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will make a statement about Public Bodies 1998 and the Executive NDPB 1998 report.  [64385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The Government have today published <i>Public Bodies 1998</i>, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and the <i>Executive NDPB 1998 Report</i> (CM 4157) which has been laid before both Houses. <i>Quangos: Opening the Doors</i>, published on 29 June 1998, promised that future editions of both publications would develop in line with the Government's policy of making public bodies more efficient, transparent and accountable. <i>Public Bodies 1998</i> and the <i>Executive NDPB Report 1998</i> take important steps in that direction.
<P>

<a name="81215w19.html_para4"><i>Public Bodies 1998</i> provides a range of statistical information on those national and regional public bodies for which Ministers retain a degree of responsibility. This includes all nationalised industries and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) as well as certain public corporations and NHS bodies. On 1 April 1998, there were 1,073 NDPBs, a reduction of 55 over the previous year. As of 1 September 1998, 32 per cent. of appointments to bodies listed in <i>Public Bodies</i> were held by women; and 3.7 per cent. were held by ethnic minorities. In line with the Government's commitment to increase substantially the information publicly available on these bodies, <i>Public Bodies</i> includes for the first time the terms of reference of each of the bodies listed, the names of individual chairmen and chief executives (or their equivalents) and e-mail and Internet addresses where these are available. <i>Public Bodies 1998</i> provides more information than ever before in a single document about this sector of government.
<P>

<a name="81215w19.html_para5">The <i>Executive NDPB 1998 Report</i> brings together performance and trend data on 81 of the largest executive NDPBs each with expenditure of over &#163;20 million in 1997-98. The contribution of NDPBs is important to achieving the policy goals of the Government and the 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 1998 : Column: 486</I><P>
results that people want. The individual entries covering annual performance measures and key business summary data show that some NDPBs are performing well both in terms of meeting stringent performance targets and delivering more efficient and effective services. However, there are no grounds for complacency. Too many of the bodies do not have adequate performance measures in place nor proper measures of efficiency. It is vital that these measures are put in place so that it is clear where success is being achieved and where there are problems to be resolved if we are to make the best use of taxpayers' money.
<P>

<a name="81215w19.html_para6">NDPBs, like other parts of government, have the opportunity to increase the impact of their work and contribute to improvements in the quality and convenience of public services by linking up with other public bodies and working across boundaries to match people's needs. This will be a key area for further development over the next few years, and the Better Government White Paper to be published in the Spring will have more to say about what has been achieved and possible ways forward.
<P>

<a name="81215w19.html_para7">The <i>Public Bodies</i> and the <i>Executive NDPB 1998 Report</i> will in future years continue to develop and widen in scope. The Government recognise the important roles performed by the bodies listed in these publications and are committed to ensuring that they, like other parts of the public service, play their full part in helping to achieve the high level policy objectives set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review and the Public Service Agreements.
<P>

<a name="81215w19.html_para8">Both <i>Public Bodies 1998</i> and the <i>Executive NDPB 1998 Report</i> are available on the Internet via the Cabinet Office home page (www.open.gov.uk/co/cohome.htm).

<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w20.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 As I explained to the House on 21 October 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1267-68, the Government will publish a White Paper in the spring, setting out proposals for modernising government and joining up public services, to secure effective decision- making and services that work and respond to the people who need them. The Prime Minister has asked me to chair a Cabinet Committee to drive this agenda forward and the timetable remains firmly on course. I am keen to take into account a wide range of views and ideas in preparing the White Paper.

<P>
<a name="81215w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> European Union regulations on annual total allowable catches and quotas require that all landings be counted against a Member State's share of the total allowable catch for each quota stock. It is for each Member State to decide how its quotas are managed. We do not have detailed information on the management arrangements operating in other Member States although we understand that some have imposed restrictions on sea angling.
<P>

<a name="81215w23.html_para3">The Ministry does not collect information on catches made by vessels engaged in recreational angling. For the purposes of quota management in the UK all vessels used to convey pleasure anglers are, irrespective of their length, grouped with under 10 metre commercial fishing vessels. When therefore fisheries for individual stocks are closed to the under 10 metre commercial fleet by means of statutory prohibition orders, all vessels used to convey anglers fishing for pleasure are also prohibited from landing fish. Closures are imposed when the total available quota allocation for a particular species has been taken.

<P>
<a name="81215w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Zinc bacitracin and the three other antibiotics covered by the proposed suspension are authorised as zootechnical feed additives for growth promotion and not as veterinary medicines. The proposal was made because of evidence assessed by the EU 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 1998 : Column: 501</I><P>
Commission's Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition that the use of certain antibiotics for growth promotion contributes to the overall selected pressure for resistant bacteria. The Government have received advice from the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food and from the Veterinary Products Committee which recommends the phasing out of certain antibiotic growth promoters. This advice confirms the principles laid down in the Swann Report in 1969 that antibiotics which may impair the efficacy of prescribed therapeutic antibiotics used in human medicine through the development of resistant strains of organisms should not be authorised for growth promotion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81215w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 An abrupt suspension, as originally proposed by the European Commission, would have been likely to cause considerable health and welfare problems for livestock. That is why we argued successfully for an extension which permits us to introduce the ban with effect from 1 July 1999, allowing producers some time to adapt to the loss of zinc bacitracin.

 The figures obtained from the June Census returns do not provide sufficient detail to determine the number of intensive poultry units in England.

 The terms 'farm fresh', 'naturally fresh' and 'country fresh' may be used to describe eggs produced under any system. The word 'fresh' is reserved for eggs of Grade A quality, which is the highest standard of freshness and cleanliness laid down in the Regulations. The words 'farm' and 'country' are not considered to be misleading, as nearly all eggs are produced on farms of one kind or another or in the country.

<a name="81215w24.html_para3">EC legislation governing the marketing of shell eggs specifies which exclusive terms can be used to indicate type of farming (but exempts organic/biological farming). These optional descriptions are 'free range' eggs; 'semi-intensive' eggs; 'deep litter' eggs; 'perchery' eggs (barn eggs) and 'eggs from caged hens'. All these marketing terms are optional. Producers or marketing outlets can therefore use these terms if they wish to clarify the method of production for consumers, providing the minimum production criteria set out in the marketing legislation is met.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 1998]:</i> Farm fresh turkeys give consumers a choice and the Government would like to see traditional production of this product continue.
<P>

<a name="81215w25.html_para0">The Ministry will be issuing for public consultation a consultation document recommending that small off-farm poultry meat slaughterhouses should no longer be exempt from licensing. These proposals will not affect the exemption for small-scale on-farm production of traditional farm fresh turkeys.

&#163;125 million for research in 1998-99, spread between contractors throughout the UK. Some &#163;7.8 million of this sum will be paid to Welsh contractors, but Wales will benefit from all relevant research regardless of where it is carried out. Post-devolution, it is intended that the Ministry will retain responsibility for the budget for R&D carried out in England and Wales. The National Assembly for Wales will be consulted about priorities for R&D and these will be reflected in the programme of work commissioned.
