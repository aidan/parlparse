 The Government recognise that progress must be made to reduce waste. However, before considering setting waste reduction targets for local authorities, the Government will consider the levers local authorities have for reducing waste and whether a reduction target would be an effective means of encouraging waste reduction.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures are in place to ensure the safe transport of radioactive materials; and what recent discussions have taken place with the nuclear industry regarding the safe disposal of its radioactive waste.  [128109]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) publishes internationally agreed standards for the transport of radioactive material. These are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they reflect current safety standards and reflect current transport practices. These IAEA standards form the basis for various modal standards, which in turn, become the basis of legislation in the UK. There is a continuous cycle of reviewing IAEA standards and implementing them nationally.
<P>

<a name="30911w01.html_para1">Legislation in the United Kingdom is brought into line with the currently applicable version of these IAEA technical requirements on a regular basis, the latest amendment being SI 2003 No. 1867, The Radioactive Material (Road Transport) (Amendment) Regulations 2003.

<a name="30911w01.html_para2">Policy for the long-term management of the UK's higher activity radioactive waste is currently under review as part of the "Managing Radioactive Waste Safely" programme.

There will be further opportunities for input of views as the programme proceeds under the oversight of the new Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) in conjunction with other safety organisations has produced a voluntary code of Best and Safe Practice for Leisure Craft Users. This code is widely available, and encourages boat users to become familiar with their craft and to take a recognised training course. We keep the voluntary approach to training under review, taking account of the practicalities of implementation and enforcement that a regulatory regime would involve. All craft using our seas, regardless of size, must follow the rules of the International Regulations for the Avoidance of Collisions at Sea 1972 (as amended).

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what changes since 1997 have been made to the COBA formula for determining the value of road projects, with particular reference to the weighting of environmental factors against economic and safety considerations.  [129261]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 All major (and many minor) road projects are now analysed within the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA) framework, implemented in 1998. The NATA is a problem-oriented approach, focused on a range of alternative options to determine which provides the most effective solution within the context of a range of economic, environmental and social (including safety) objectives. Environmental factors are not given any explicit weighting. Rather an appropriate measure of each impact is presented to decision takers in the form of a one page Appraisal Summary Table to ensure that the full range of economic, environmental and social factors are actively considered during analysis and at decision points.

 The option for two new runways at Gatwick would provide total capacity of 115mppa. This is an additional terminal capacity of 75mppa beyond the base case capacity of 40mppa. Terminal capacity at Gatwick would be a multiple of 2.5 of the capacity at Heathrow Terminal 5 (based on T5 capacity of 30mppa). The amount and timing of terminal capacity provided would, in practice, depend on actual demand.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what total percentage fall in the cost of air travel over the period 2000 to 2030 is assumed in the future demand forecasts given in the consultation paper 'The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom'.  [129012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w02.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The central national forecast published in 'Air Traffic Forecasts for the United Kingdom 2000', May 2000, assumed that there will be a 1 per cent. reduction per annum in air fares in real terms between 2000 and 2020. No further reduction was assumed between 2020 and 2030. However, as described in Chapter 5 of 'The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&#151;South East', February 2003, greater competition between airlines, including the impact of the No Frills sector, suggests that the decline in the cost of air travel will be greater. It is argued in 'The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&#151;South East' that air fares are likely to fall by 1.5 per cent. per annum in real terms between 2000 and 2020, giving a total percentage reduction in the cost of air travel of around 26 per cent. in the period from 2000 to 2030.

 The airfield at RAF Halton is currently very well used by light aircraft; motorised gliders and winch launched gliders. The relocation of the Joint Services Adventurous Training (Gliding) activity to the airfield is expected to cause very little increased aircraft noise. The gliders used are, in the main, not motorised. The tug aircraft have four bladed propellers and their performance is maximised for quick take off and climb. This allows engine power to be reduced during the climb, all of which reduces noise output. Return to the airfield invariably utilises a constant descent at reduced power, causing very little noise.

 The Ministry of Defence has conducted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of Sonar 2087, a Low Frequency Active Sonar (LFAS) system. The EIA indicated that the sonar had the potential to be harmful to marine mammals.

 Prisoners are not routinely screened for hepatitis C. Individual prisoners often ask to be tested for evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection and this is done, after pre-test counselling. The Public Health Laboratory Service undertook an unlinked, anonymised survey of the prevalence of blood borne viruses among prisoners in England in 1997&#150;98. This indicated that 9 per cent. of adult men, 11 per cent. of all women and 0.6 per cent. of young men had evidence of previous exposure to hepatitis C.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will introduce legislation removing the upper age limit on employment rights.  [129038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 There is no upper age limit on the great majority of employment rights. However, under current legislation employees cannot generally complain of unfair dismissal if they have reached their employer's normal retirement age for their job, or, if there is no normal retirement age, the age of 65. Similarly, they have no entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment if they have reached the age of 65 or, if lower, the employer's normal retirement age for their job.
<P>

<a name="30911w06.html_para0">The public consultation on age discrimination launched on 2 July, "Equality and Diversity: Age Matters", proposes changing these provisions so that employees who believe they have been unfairly dismissed can seek redress at any age, but retirement at a justifiable retirement age will be a fair reason for dismissal. The upper age limit for entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment will depend on the decision we make about retirement ages. A final decision will be made in the light of responses to consultation.

 BNFL expects to complete their existing order book for reprocessing spent fuel at THORP by around 2010. Operation of THORP beyond completion of the existing order book would be dependent on there being new contracts for reprocessing further spent fuel at the plant which, in the first instance, is dependent on there being customer demand.
<P>

<a name="30911w06.html_para1">The Government's position on the future of THORP was set out in the July 2002 White Paper on Managing the Nuclear Legacy. We expect existing THORP contracts to be honoured. There are currently no proposals for new contracts for reprocessing further spent fuel at THORP. Before any such new THORP contracts could be concluded or changes made to existing contracts that increased the volume of spent fuel to be reprocessed at THORP, the approval of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would be required. Before making a decision on any such future proposal, the Government would review it against the specific criteria that were set out in the White Paper and would consult publicly.

 The 1999 strategy for sustainable development for the UK, A better quality of life, sets out key UK Government actions to achieve sustainable development, including those to achieve more prudent use of energy by the business sector.
<P>

<a name="30911w06.html_para4">The Climate Change Levy was launched in April 2001 to help fund measures to promote energy efficiency in business and the public sector. As part of the CCL package a number of measures were introduced including:

The Carbon Trust (CT) was launched "to take the lead on energy efficiency for business and the public sector, and to support the development of a low carbon economy", delivered through the trust's two main programmes: the Low Carbon Innovation Programme, and Action Energy (formerly the non-domestic part of the Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme) the UK's main energy efficiency information, advice and research programme for organisations in the public and private sectors. Since 1989, the EEBPP has helped many organisations save up to 20 per cent. of their energy bills, which equates to total UK energy savings of around &#163;800 million a year.

<a name="30911w06.html_para6">A review of "A better quality of life" has just started, to have a revised strategy in place by 2005. We intend to take a fresh look at how we achieve sustainable development in the UK, building on the current strategy to improve delivery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 None. However, employment legislation for which the Department is responsible requires employers to keep records showing compliance with the national minimum wage legislation and weekly working time and night work limits; and to provide the following documents: an itemised pay statement, issued at or before the time of payment; a written statement of employment particulars for employees who are employed for one month or more; and, for shop and betting workers in England and Wales who are or may be required to work on Sundays, a written statement explaining how they can opt out of Sunday work. The wording of that opt-out statement is prescribed by law and the written statement of employment particulars must contain certain prescribed information. The Department publishes an example form of the written statement of employment particulars for the assistance of employers.
<P>

<a name="30911w06.html_para7">The Department is fully aware of the need to regulate only where it is necessary to do so and to keep compliance requirements as simple as possible.

<P>
<a name="30911w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 In its first term (1997&#150;2001), the Government introduced a foundation of minimum standards in the workplace. Every employee now has, for example, the right to a minimum wage, paid holidays, rest breaks, time off for family emergencies, and a cap on the working week. Trade unions have the right to recognition by the employer where a majority of the workforce want it. Part-time workers have the same rights as their full-time colleagues.
<P>

<a name="30911w06.html_para8">In their second term, the Government are building on all these measures in its drive to raise productivity, including a range of changes to support families and to make work pay. The Government have improved existing maternity rights and introduced paid paternity and adoption leave for the first time. For example, the payment period of statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance has been extended to 26 weeks. It has also introduced a right for working parents with children under six, or disabled children under 18, to request flexible working. This new right builds on existing best practice and further enforces our aim to promote greater dialogue in the workplace to find flexible solutions that suit both employers and employees.
<P>

<a name="30911w06.html_para9">Recently, both Houses have passed regulations to tackle discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion or belief, which will take effect in December 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30911w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The banning of an estate agent by the Office of Fair Trading results in a press release that alerts other local estate agents and consumers. Local Trading Standards Officers are advised separately, and the OFT relies on them to notify it if the banned agent continues in business or is involved in the management of an estate agency company. It is a criminal offence for an agent banned by the OFT to continue doing estate agency work.
<P>

<a name="30911w07.html_para0">No estate agents banned since 1997 have subsequently been discovered to have continued or recommenced estate agency work or been prosecuted for such practices.

 I have stated that transmission licences will apply throughout the strategic areas and I shall legislate to achieve this. Transmission licences covering the strategic areas will provide certainty for generators that there will be a connector of last resort, in addition to providing infrastructure that is efficient, economical and which guards against the owner of the connection wielding market power. DTI and Ofgem are working together to create the necessary regulatory regime and will issue licences in a timely way that ensure that generation and infrastructure development can run concurrently.

<P>
<a name="30911w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK has long been conscious that reductions in the currently high levels of trade-distorting support in the agriculture sector are necessary to address over-production in the developed world and the consequent disruption of world commodity markets, which are of vital interest to developing countries. So the UK was pleased that all WTO members agreed at Doha in November 2001 to "comprehensive negotiations aimed at: reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support."

 My Department does not collate figures for all wind turbine generators in the UK. Only if a wind farm application is referred to DTI through section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 or through the Transport and Works Act 1992 (wind farms of an installed capacity of 50 megawatts or above onshore and 1MW or above offshore) would this Department have figures. The British Wind Energy Association states that the current number of wind turbines operating in the UK which are grid connected is 1,030, and the total installed capacity for operating wind turbines in the UK is 587 megawatts.

DFID also provides a range of trade-related support to help developing countries pursue their interests with respect to WTO agreements.

 Al-Qaeda and related groups continue to pose a significant global threat, including to British interests abroad. The mounting of more than one attack simultaneously is a technique that has been employed by such terrorist groups. It remains vital for the international community to maintain a co-operative and comprehensive approach to tackling international terrorism. The capture of a significant number of senior al-Qaeda figures and the disruption of terrorist operations, planning, financing and support as a result of the international effort, has had, and continues to have, a substantial negative impact on the organisation.

 The British Office in Baghdad has received no reports from members of the Christian community suggesting any form of discrimination against them since the commencement of military action in Iraq. However, FCO Ministers have received correspondence from MPs passing on constituents' concerns about religious freedom in Iraq. Our staff in Iraq meet regularly with representatives of many Iraqi political and religious groups, including Christians, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.

 With the agreement of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, my right hon.

The pool is intended to sustain the deployment of up to 100 United Kingdom officers at any one time. Some may be deployed to a third country to assist in the out of country training of the Iraqi Police service. In the event of deployment, secondments will be for a period of six to twelve months.

<P>

<P>
<a name="30911w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has a Private Finance Initiative contract for the provision of its telecommunications services which gives an overall operational availability of at least 98.5 per cent. Monthly service reports confirm that this requirement is being met or exceeded. There are typically 60&#151;70 failures per month on a network covering over 170 locations worldwide. Many of these failures last just a few minutes and some occur out of office hours. Around 40 per cent. of failures are caused by local in-country electrical supply problems. The introduction of dedicated satellite links to the FCO's more remote embassies has significantly improved network reliability.

<a name="30911w10.html_para1">My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie), the responsible Minister at the time, carried out a review of the Astra collapse in 1999. That review concluded that the Government did not have any case to answer to recompense former Astra employees for lost pensions.

 Local authorities have statutory responsibility for the administration of housing benefit, and have complete autonomy to select and contract with the software provider of their choice.

 Local authorities are statutory independent bodies responsible for the administration of housing benefit. A decision to offer the delivery of housing benefit for tender is ordinarily a matter for the individual authority.
<P>

<a name="30911w11.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has powers to direct an authority to put its benefits administration out to tender in prescribed circumstances, namely when: the authority has failed to meet the standards of administration set out in a previously issued direction; or the authority is failing to meet the requirements of the legislation relating to Best Value, particularly where it is failing to put in place the necessary steps to improve its benefits administration.
<P>

<a name="30911w11.html_para3">However, these powers would only be used as a matter of last resort. The Government's policy is to work with, and to lend appropriate support to, struggling authorities in order to achieve sustained improvement.

 The Department does not collect these figures, but takes the problem of arson in schools very seriously.
<P>

<a name="30911w11.html_para4">If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.

[129144]<P>

 Further education colleges themselves determine the range and volume of courses they offer, following discussions with the relevant local Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The local LSC is responsible for ensuring that public funding supports a broad offer of post-16 education and training adequate to meet the 



<P>
<P><I>11 Sept 2003 : Column 449W</I><P>
needs of local communities, learners and employers, as well as focusing resources on national, regional and local priorities. Each college is in the process of agreeing a Development Plan with its local LSC which sets out how the college will contribute to the range of needs and priorities over the period 2003&#150;06. Looking ahead, each local LSC is now leading a Strategic Area Review which aims to ensure that the future supply and distribution of courses offered by colleges and other providers offers breadth of choice and high quality to local people. The pattern of provision across a local area, and the precise mix and volume of provision offered by individual colleges, will and should evolve over time. We do not propose to put in place artificial constraints to prevent that. We have made clear our intention that we expect local LSCs to maintain a broad range of post-16 provision for local people and are confident that the mechanisms above will deliver this.

 The Secretary of State's responsibilities for skills are limited to England. Responsibility for the rest of the United Kingdom rests with the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30911w12.html_para5">We are taking forward a range of measures designed to raise the levels of intermediate skills. On the 9 July we published our National Skills Strategy.

<P>

<a name="30911w12.html_para6">The skills strategy builds on our recent proposals to reform vocational routes for young people. It includes a new entitlement to free learning for those adults without a good skills foundation. We will also provide targeted support to meet priorities identified by sectors and regions, with the emphasis on technician and higher craft level skills. We will strengthen modern apprenticeships and lift the age cap, so that adults as well as young people can benefit from a high-quality vocational route to employment and further learning.

<P><I>11 Sept 2003 : Column 453W</I><P>
28 will have no effect on what is taught. The Education Act 1996, as amended by the Learning and Skills Act 2000, places responsibility for sex and relationship education firmly on teachers and governors. Guidance sent to all schools in July 2000 makes this position clear.

<P>
<a name="30911w13.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Student loans are not commercial loans. The Government subsidise the actual cost of interest on the loans. However, to make sure that all borrowers pay back the same amount that they borrowed in real terms, the Government uprates the value of what is owed in line with the general rate of inflation. This is done by using the Retail Prices Index (RPI) and fixing the interest charged to that rate. The interest rate on student loans is set every year from 1 September and is based on the RPI for the previous March. This is the only way in which it changes. There are no plans to change this basis of setting the interest charged on student loans.

<i>[holding answer 9 September 2003]:</i> My Department has responsibility for fee support for English domiciled medical students in years 1 to 4 of their courses. During those years they have the same student support as any other eligible higher education students. Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary legislation, from 2006&#150;07 students will be liable for tuition fees of up to a maximum of &#163;3,000 pa which they can defer, adding to their loan instead. Students from poorer backgrounds will continue, as now, to receive means tested grants for fees of &#163;1,125 pa (2003&#150;04 rate). Three in ten of all students will also receive means tested Higher Education Grants of &#163;1,000. Many poorer students should in addition be eligible for bursaries and other support from universities under arrangements agreed by the Office of Fair Access. We therefore anticipate only a small average increase annually in low income students' loans as a result of the introduction of variable fees, and thus in their debt on graduation.




<P>
<P><I>11 Sept 2003 : Column 454W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30911w13.html_para1">Fee support for English domiciled medical students in years five and six is the responsibility of the Department of Health. Currently students in those years pay no contributions to fees. In addition students may also receive a means tested NHS Bursary of up to &#163;2,703 for those students studying in London. They remain eligible for the reduced rate of loan under the student support regulations. Department of Health Ministers have indicated that, whatever the future levels of tuition fees, they will take measures to ensure that any increase in the cost of university courses will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will <i>(a)</i> defer the payment of tuition fees until after students have completed their university course and <i>(b)</i> freeze tuition fee levels.  [129093]<P>

<P>
<a name="30911w13.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Students at English Higher Education Institutions will be able to defer payment of tuition fees charged in respect of academic year 2006 onwards until after they have completed their course: they will start repaying when their salary is above &#163;15,000. The Government has made it clear that HE Institutions need greater levels of funding to compete internationally, and that it is right to seek a greater contribution from students towards the cost of their course. It therefore intends to give HE Institutions the freedom to charge fees of between &#163;0 and &#163;3,000 from 2006: those that wish to charge above the standard fee will only be able to do so if they have an access agreement approved by the Office of Fair Access (OFFA).

 The Department has no plans to intervene in what is a matter for universities themselves. As universities are independent and autonomous bodies the Government plays no part in setting the levels of pay in the higher education sector, including London weighting. These are subject to regulations between employers, their staff and their representative trade union bodies. Both my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and myself have had correspondence and discussions with the unions for staff in higher education and the universities on this issue and we have stressed that we cannot intervene on this matter.

Through the Learning and Skills Council, we will improve standards in Modern Apprenticeships, engage more employers in providing them and ensure they meet employers' needs. Our target is that by 2004, 28 per cent. of young people will start a Modern Apprenticeship by age 22. We will also support individual learners through a new guarantee of free tuition for any adult without a good foundation of employability skills, so that many more can progress to skilled craft and technician level qualifications, and from there on to the Foundation Degree, a vocational, higher education qualification. We will test this approach from September 2004, before beginning to roll out nationally from 2005 onwards.

While the Court stated that it is permitted in principle to use criteria "relating to the preservation of the environment" when awarding a contract, the judgment makes it clear that such criteria must: be linked to the subject of the contract; not confer an unrestricted freedom of choice on the authority; be expressly mentioned in the contract documents or the tender notice; and comply with all the fundamental principles of Community law, in particular non-discrimination. This is in line with the UK's understanding of the position under the current EC procurement directives and is consistent with the Government's procurement policy based on value for money.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many <i>(a)</i> dog attacks have been reported and <i>(b)</i> complaints have been received by the Department of Environment regarding dogs in and around the grounds of Kirkistown Castle in the last 12 months; whether the land, lane leading to, and the grounds in which Kirkistown Castle lies are the property of the Department of Environment; and what action has been taken to prevent dogs from adjoining properties roaming in and around the grounds of the Castle.

 Kirkistown Castle, and the land on which it is sited, was acquired by the government in 1968. The site is now owned by the Department of the Environment and managed by the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS). To allow public access to the Castle, a legal right of way over the lane leading to the site was established when it was acquired. The lane also provides access to a privately owned house, adjacent to the Castle site. The boundary of the site owned by the Department has been fenced in accordance with the terms set out in the acquisition documents. This fencing is believed to be dog-proof.
<P>

<a name="30911w17.html_para19">EHS has no record of receiving from the public any reported incidents of attacks or other complaints about dogs in or around the Castle grounds in the last 12 months. Its own tour guide reported an incident involving herself on 17 July 2003 and this is now under investigation
<P>

<a name="30911w17.html_para20">The Castle is open to the public on a limited basis during July and August each year, when a tour guide is on site. Outside these months, signage identifies the Castle as being managed by EHS and provides a telephone number so that visitors can contact the local warden, (based at Scrabo Country Park), should they encounter any problems relating to the site.

This investment will facilitate an increase in the number of cardiac surgery procedures undertaken at the regional unit to the target level of 1,100 per year. Until capacity at the Royal is increased to the target level, additional cardiac surgery procedures are being purchased outside the HPSS for patients who are able and willing to travel.

 For all Structural Funds Programmes the N+2 requirement means that any part of an annual commitment not properly claimed from the European Commission by the end of the second year following the year of commitment will automatically be withdrawn. For the PEACE II Programme monies committed for 2000 and 2001 must be spent and claimed from the European Commission by the end of 2003, otherwise the monies will be lost to the Peace II Programme.
<P>

<a name="30911w19.html_para5">As regards the current position the PEACE II Monitoring Committee on 24 June 2003 adopted a strategy to ensure that funds are fully utilised. This strategy has three key components. The first is to maximise spend up to 31 December 2003 and this can be achieved by all Implementing Bodies and project sponsors continuing to approve and implement projects on the ground in line with the Priorities and Measures specified in the Programme. The second component involves working closely with the SEUPB and the European Commission to ensure that the N+2 target for the Programme at the end of the year is set with due regard to the full and proper application of the various Regulatory provisions involved. I anticipate this work will involve a reduction in the expenditure targets for this year. However, while both the above are producing results, they alone will not be sufficient to avoid a loss of funding. Therefore the third component is to increase spend through the inclusion

of projects which were not originally intended to be funded through the PEACE II Programme, but which nonetheless meet the distinctiveness and other requirements of the Programme.

 European Commission Regulation 2037/2000 on Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), which came into effect on 1 October 2000, requires the removal of controlled ODS from refrigeration equipment before these appliances are scrapped. Recovery, recycling, reclamation and destruction of such substances may be undertaken using only approved technologies. The necessary technology is not yet available anywhere in Ireland; a few facilities are now available in Great Britain.

<a name="30911w20.html_para5">Currently, responsibility for collection, storage and disposal of waste fridges lies with district councils. The Department of the Environment, through the waste management grant scheme, is fully funding district councils in taking forward this responsibility. The Department has also taken a proactive role in assisting councils to seek to achieve a cost-effective, environmentally-sound approach to the disposal of fridges. To this end a collective contract for the disposal of fridges on an all-island basis is currently under negotiation aided by the Central Procurement Directorate (Department of Finance and Personnel).

<a name="30911w20.html_para6">In August 2005 ultimate responsibility for collection and disposal of fridges will transfer from district councils to producers under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC.

The detailed out-workings of the directive continue, however, to be the subject of discussion between officials in my Department, the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Trade and Industry.

 The borrowing facility provided under the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative (RRI) will operate under the standard terms for borrowing from the National Loans Fund as determined by the Treasury. Access to the borrowing facility will be contingent upon the generation of additional rates revenue, and revenue from domestic water charges once introduced. Only revenue above the level needed to match average increases in England will count as qualifying revenue for borrowing purposes.

 There are approximately 2500 car parking spaces within the Stormont Estate. Around 400 of these are adjacent to Parliament Buildings and are for the use of Assembly members, staff and visitors. The remaining 2100 are used by civil servants working on the Estate, together with visitors and contractors. This total includes spaces designated for use by people with disabilities and for visitors. No extra spaces have been created since 1995 apart from 25 temporary spaces provided recently but the opportunity is currently being taken to upgrade a redundant builder's compound to provide an additional 70 parking spaces. Any further development for parking will be dependent upon decisions on the implementation of the recommendations in the recently completed Accommodation Review.

 Under Special Educational Needs Legislation, Education and Library Boards have a qualified duty to secure education for children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) in a mainstream placement. Therefore the majority of children identified as having SEN will have their needs met by mainstream teachers with, where required, support from a classroom assistant or outside specialist support, such as outreach from special schools, assistance from a behaviour support team, or speech and language therapy help from outside the school. In this sense, all teachers may have a role in providing educational help for children with SEN.
<P>

<a name="30911w22.html_para3">Under Local Management of Schools (LMS) arrangements, mainstream schools have the majority of funding for special needs within their delegated budgets. Schools have discretion as to how the money is spent, e.g. to employ additional teachers for children with SEN. It is therefore not possible to provide specific teacher numbers in primary and post primary schools within the timescale for the question. However, with regard to specialist support services the Belfast ELB provides additional teaching time to assessed pupils within all schools in Belfast for special needs in the areas of learning, dyslexia, behaviour, autism and physical and sensory disability. These services employ an additional 55 teachers.

<a name="30911w22.html_para4">In all mainstream schools a designated teacher known as the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) will be responsible for the day to day

It is not possible to provide details of such resources specifically for the North Belfast Constituency area within the timescale of the question.

<a name="30911w22.html_para5">In addition, since 1998, around &#163;38 million has been provided to support the introduction of the Code of Practice in Northern Ireland. As well as providing SEN training for teachers and school governors, these funds have helped meet the additional costs of strengthening mainstream provision for pupils with SEN, by expanding outreach and peripatetic teaching support and by providing more classroom assistants. Specific allocations to schools in the North Belfast Constituency area are not readily identifiable in the timescale, but it is estimated that in 2002&#150;03 these totalled approximately &#163;70,000 for primary schools and &#163;50,000 for post-primary schools.

<a name="30911w23.html_para1">The staffing figures to reflect both NI Civil Servants and Home Civil Servants, in each year since 1997, for the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Departments and their respective Agencies, are set out in Tables A and B.
<P>

<a name="30911w23.html_para2">The staffing figures for associated NDPBs are available from the Cabinet Office in its annual publication "Public Bodies". The information includes details of the number of staff employed by each NDPB at 31 March each year. "Public Bodies 2002" was published in January 2003. Copies of "Public Bodies" published each year since 1997 are available in the Libraries of both Houses.

<i>Staff costs</i>
<P>

<a name="30911w23.html_para3">With the introduction of Devolution in Northern Ireland in December 1999, Northern Ireland Departments restructured and increased in number from six to 11. In addition, as a consequence of the transitions to resource accounting, outturn information from 2000&#150;01 onwards is held on a resource basis, prior to this only cash based information is available. For these reasons, the only years for which comparable outturn information is available is for 2000&#150;01 onwards. However, the outturn information provided for 2002&#150;03 is based on provisional outturn and therefore is not directly comparable to 2000&#150;01 or 2001&#150;02, which are based on final outturn.
<P>

<a name="30911w23.html_para4">Staffing costs for the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Departments and their respective Agencies are set out in Table C.
<P>

<a name="30911w23.html_para5">The staffing costs for associated NDPBs of the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Departments are available from the annual accounts of each body.

<P>
<a name="30911w24.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There is no legislation in respect of wheelchair access in ambulances. However, it is standard procedure for A&E ambulance staff to place a wheelchair user on the ambulance stretcher so that any treatment which may be needed can be administered safely. As space does not allow wheelchairs to be safely transported in A&E ambulances, they must be left behind. Hospitals have wheelchairs available for use by patients. However, if wheelchair users wish to have their own chairs, a relative or carer would normally be asked to arrange for the wheelchair to be brought to the hospital.
