 Implementation of proper labour standards can play an important part in reducing poverty. DFID is supporting a range of activities to improve the treatment of workers in developing countries, including the elimination of child labour and trafficking for forced labour. Our support is primarily given through the International Labour Organisation. But we also support the work of non-governmental organisations, trade unions and business, for example through the Ethical Trading Initiative.

 The situation remains critical. More and continuing assistance is needed.

The focus of the Plan is an emergency shelter programme, medical evacuations, pre-positioning of food assistance for 700,000 and the maintenance of mobile health units and vaccination services. Additionally, site planning and construction of 30 camps, repair of vital damaged water supply systems

 The primary responsibility for the protection of vulnerable people lies with their Government. This was endorsed at the 2005 Millennium Review Summit, to which the Government of Sudan was party. The UK Government continues to press the Government of Sudan on its responsibilities in Darfur, and we press all parties to abide by their commitments they have made. We have done this both directly to the Government of Sudan, and in our role as EU presidency. The UK also played a leading role in securing six recent UN Security Council Resolutions on Sudan, including resolutions 1591 and 1593, which extended the Darfur arms embargo to cover the Government of Sudan, allowed targeted sanctions on individuals responsible for the worst abuses, and referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_14">The African Union (AU) mission in Darfur is also playing an important role in protecting the people of Darfur. Despite the recent worrying upsurge in violence in Darfur, including the attack on the Aro Sharow camp on 28 September, attacks on civilians have decreased where the AU is deployed. DFID welcomes the ongoing expansion of the force to more than 7,700. The UK has provided &#163;32 million to support the AU mission since its inception. The EU has provided &#8364;92 million (&#163;63 million) so far, and has recently committed a further &#8364;70 million (&#163;48 million).

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51109w03.html_spnew5"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The overall number of abattoirs has declined dramatically in Britain in the last few decades, reflecting an increase in slaughtering capacity in fewer and larger abattoirs. Much of this has been due to logistic requirements of the major supermarket chains. Regulatory impacts of measures to improve food safety have also played a part. Some businesses, particularly in older premises, may be faced with investment costs if they are to continue to comply with EU-wide standards for hygienic production.

<a name="stpa_27">Through English Nature, we have provided &#163;76,000 to Gateshead council for a &#039;Wildspace&#039; project, including a community liaison officer, which has resulted in five new local nature reserves (LNRs) being designated in the east of the borough, and the project has involved local people in caring for and enjoying the sites. Regular litter removal and maintenance of entrances and paths has ensured they appear well managed and welcoming. Along with management plans for the sites, this is maximising biodiversity, and there is a strategy to secure long term gains for local people. Due to the success of the project, Gateshead council have continued to employ the officer to carry on the good work.

<a name="51109w15.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_105">During 2004&#150;05, the Department relocated 12 posts from London to Hastings and 25 posts from London to Derby. The work of a further 10 posts was dispersed from London to VOSA staff located outside the South East, making a 2004&#150;05 total of 47 posts. No relocations under the Lyons Review are currently planned for 2005&#150;06, but further relocations are planned for future years.

<p><a name="st_124"><a name="51109w15.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 We are working with the bus industry and local authorities to ensure that all communities have the effective bus services they need. The Bus Partnership Forum brings together senior representatives of the industry, central and local government to find practical ways of improving local bus services. The forum has, for example, published guidance on improving the punctuality of bus services and has encouraged bus operators and local authorities to form local punctuality improvement partnerships to help bring about improvements in performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_106">Local and central Government provides funding of over &#163;1.6 billion annually to support bus services. This includes &#163;53 million this year provided by the Department in the form of Rural Bus Subsidy Grant to assist local authorities to support bus services in rural areas. Since 1998 we have also allocated a total of &#163;110 million to 300 rural transport projects under the Rural Bus Challenge scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_107">On 1 November we announced &quot;Kickstart&quot; support, totalling &#163;20 million, for 43 projects involving new and improved bus services which will become viable through growth in passenger numbers after an initial period of pump-priming from Government funds. 11 of these schemes will serve areas which are mainly rural in character.

<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_108">Finally, we are expecting all local transport authorities to include accessibility strategies in their next Local Transport Plans, due in March next year. These strategies should be based on evidence and analysis of the problems people face in accessing jobs and essential services and facilities. They should include consideration of the accessibility and availability of

<p><a name="st_125"><a name="51109w15.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 This Government has invested in long term public transport improvements in Leeds and West Yorkshire as a whole. Funding provided to local authorities for local highways and public transport capital projects in West Yorkshire has increased by 46 per cent. in real terms over the last five years, from &#163;34 million in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;54 million in 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_109">West Yorkshire has also benefited from significant investment in major bus schemes, with &#163;39 million committed since 2001 to schemes that are realising major improvements in bus services. These include East Leeds Quality Bus Corridor, A641 Manchester Road, Bradford Quality Bus Scheme and West Yorkshire Education Transport (My Bus).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_110">With regard to rail, 16 new four-coach Class 333 electric trains have been introduced on the Airedale and Wharfedale lines, which have seen a significant increase in patronage. This success story has helped rail patronage in West Yorkshire to rise from 16.3 million passengers in 1999&#150;2000 to 21.1 million in 2004&#150;05, an increase of 30 per cent. The new TransPennine franchise began in February 2004. It will deliver more than &#163;250 million worth of investment, with a brand new fleet of 50 trains due to be introduced in 2006. Also benefiting Leeds and West Yorkshire is a 44 per cent. increase in East Coast main line services since 1996&#151;currently 53 services per day, rising to 66 services per day in December 2007.

 Since the implementation of the Utilities Act 2000 licensing schemes and standard licence conditions in October 2001, Ofgem has had the power to appoint a Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) for all customers, domestic and non-domestic, in both the gas and electricity markets. This power is essential to ensure that all of a failed supplier&#039;s customers have continuity of supply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w19.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_149">Under the current licence conditions Ofgem can require any licensed gas supplier to become a SoLR and take the responsibility for supplying gas to customers of another supplier whose licence has been revoked. For customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be less than 73,200 kWh the authority can direct a supplier to be a SoLR. For customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be between 73,200 kWh and 2,196,000 kWh the authority can only direct a supplier to be a SoLR with that supplier&#039;s consent. There is no provision for appointing a SoLR (by consent or otherwise) for customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be more than 2,196,000 kWh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w19.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_150">Once appointed, a SoLR will initially be supplying the customer on a deemed contract. This deemed contract will cover the period from appointment until customers have agreed a replacement contract with the SoLR or another supplier of their choice. There are licence obligations to ensure that the prices charged under a deemed contract are not excessive. A SoLR&#039;s deemed contract must also allow for its termination when the customer chooses to take a supply from another supplier.

Analysis of the overall effects of changes in fuel prices and incomes, excluding consideration of energy efficiency improvements, suggests that the total number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by between 200,000 and 800,000 households in England between 2003 and 2006.
