To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what emission standards are applicable to cement kilns and high temperature incineration plants.  [142259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Processes subject to Directives 89/369/EEC and 89/429/EEC on the reduction of air pollution from municipal waste incineration plant, and 94/67/EC on the incineration of hazardous wastes are required to comply with the emission limits set out therein. Other processes subject to Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) are expected to achieve the benchmark emission standards set out in the Environment Agency's published guidance notes in accordance with BATNEEC. Benchmark emission standards for cement works are set out in the Agency's IPC Guidance Note S2 3.01, and for incinerators in Guidance Note S2 5.01. Where hazardous waste is burned in cement kilns, the processes must comply with the terms set out in the Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive. Specific emission limits have been set for each plant and are stated in individual authorisation, which can be obtained from the public registers located at the relevant local Environment Agency or local authority office.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will amend planning regulations to require a planning application to be submitted when composition of materials to be burnt in cement kilns is modified significantly.  [142263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The modification of the composition of materials to be burnt in cement kilns would not, in itself, constitute a change of use for which planning permission would be needed. We therefore have no intention to amend the planning system to require a planning application in such cases.
<P>

<a name="01218w01.html_para2">Any proposal to burn a modified composition of fuel will, however, require the operator to submit an application for a variation to their authorisation where they are regulated under the Integrated Pollution and control regime. If the variation is significant, the Environment Agency must consult with interests parties prior to its determination.

<P>
<a name="01218w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Plant burning fuel which are subject to regulation under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 are required to use the best available techniques not entailing excessive cost (BATNEEC) for preventing the release of harmful substances; where that is not possible emissions must be minimised and rendered harmless.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to allow the export of hazardous waste from the UK.  [142264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The legally binding UK Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste currently prohibits all exports of waste for disposal. This approach is consistent with longstanding UK policy that developed countries should be self-sufficient in waste disposal. Consistent with the UN Basel Convention, exports of hazardous waste for recovery are permitted only to OECD countries and Liechtenstein.
<P>

<a name="01218w01.html_para6">This summer the UK Government went out to consultation on revised UK export and import policies. The consultation paper proposed an exception to the current prohibition on exports for disposal in two tightly defined circumstances:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> to allow exports from Northern Ireland to Ireland for disposal so long as such movements are consistent with local waste management plans being drawn up under Northern Ireland's waste strategy; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> to allow exports to other EC member states and countries covered by the European Free Trade Area for trial runs. This is to allow UK companies to evaluate waste management processes in the EU and help decide whether or not to import the technology into the UK.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="01218w01.html_para10">I refer my hon.

 A system of licensing London's private hire operators, drivers and vehicles is being introduced in three stages through the implementation of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998. From 22 January next year, Transport for London will start licensing London minicab operators; from 22 October it will be an offence to operate minicabs without the appropriate licence. Transport for London will take forward the second and third phases of implementation. I understand that they are having discussions with the taxi and private hire trades. It is already an offence to tout for minicab services; enforcement is a matter for the police.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> The European Commission has not yet published its proposals for a Directive on access to port services, but officials have been keeping in touch with the Commission's thinking, and we understand that proposals may be launched early in the new year. Once these are public, we shall consult widely on them, aiming to take account of the full range of views on the possible impact, including port and terminal operators, port service providers, port users and customers, trade unions and other interests. There will also be opportunities for discussions with other member states. There are likely to be a number of important issues that will need to be addressed. Representations have been received from the UK Major Ports Group and we are also aware of the views of the British Ports Association and a number of port and terminal operators. Our general policy is to support the broad principles of liberalisation and competition in the provision of port services, subject to appropriate safeguards and standards.

 By law only a competent person can carry out gas fitting work. The Government, the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive undertake various awareness-raising and publicity activities to make the public aware of this. The Executive's leaflets and its Gas Safety Advice Line explain that do-it-yourself work can be dangerous and is likely to be illegal. Retailers have been contacted to encourage them to remind purchasers of gas fittings about the importance of using only competent, registered installers for gas fitting work.
<P>

<a name="01218w03.html_para3">The Commission addressed this question in its recent Gas Safety Review. Its review report proposes increased publicity to discourage do-it-yourself gas work, more encouragement to retailers to provide 'point of sale' safety advice to consumers and encouragement to equipment manufacturers to include warnings in product literature.

<a name="01218w03.html_para4">While the Commission has concluded in its Review that there is insufficient hard evidence from incident data at present to justify the introduction of a legal ban, it has proposed that the Executive should introduce improved arrangements for the reporting of incidents and the identification of accident causation, including do-it- yourself activity, so that the scale of the potential problem can be more accurately assessed. It is envisaged that the legal position will be reviewed again when this information has become available.

 On 24 November 1997 the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions published a new consultation paper proposing lower noise limits and improved monitoring arrangements. This consultation followed the Court Order of 16 April 1997, made after challenges by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to the 1996 decision on this subject. The Order, made with the consent of the parties, enabled interim arrangements to be put in place until the outcome of the new consultation. The November 1997 paper was also challenged by IATA but the association withdrew its application for leave to apply for judicial review when the Department undertook to publish a supplementary consultation paper. That was done on 26 March 1999. All the proposals were unchanged. They were:

paper. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to use data from the on-airfield anemometers and wind vanes in the formula for the tailwind allowance proposed in the consultation paper (i.e. without making it necessary to adjust the formula).
<P>

<a name="01218w03.html_para7">The reduction of 3 dB in the daytime limit represents a halving of noise energy but only a small reduction in loudness. This is a long accepted scientific fact; it is not disputed in the responses. The cumulative effect of even small improvements should be of benefit to many local residents, particularly those living under the departure routes from about 6.5 km from start of roll out to about 15 km. These small improvements will occur whenever an aircraft flies overhead that has changed its procedures (or adopted other measures) to meet the new noise limits.
<P>

<a name="01218w03.html_para8">Some major airlines consider they will incur disproportionate costs to achieve these small benefits; conversely, many of the local authorities and other groups representing those living around the airports consider there should be greater noise reductions, to give greater benefits. I am satisfied that the requirements announced today are reasonable, having regard to what is operationally achievable (as explained in the consultation paper), to the costs that may be incurred by some airlines, the benefits that will accrue to many local residents, as I have already indicated, and the disbenefits that will be caused to others, particularly the far smaller number of people living very close to the end of a runway. Operators of heavily laden services bound for Asia-Pacific destinations that are scheduled to take off in the late evening, which would have particular difficulty in meeting the new night-time noise limit if delayed beyond 2300 hours, should be able to plan their operations with greater certainty in the light of our decision not to apply the toughest limit until 2330. I should emphasise that I do not want to encourage late departures. On the contrary, I trust operators of these services will continue to do their best to minimise delays: that will be of benefit both to their customers and to local people.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to make an announcement about Regional Planning Guidance for the south-east.  [143600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Earlier this year, the Government published for consultation proposed changes to draft Regional Planning Guidance for the south-east. We have listened to comments made and strengthened our policies for delivering an urban renaissance, providing affordable housing, avoiding profligate use of land, promoting a living countryside and encouraging development to the east of London in Thames Gateway.




<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 13W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01218w04.html_para0">We have given local authorities the tools they need to achieve this. Our planning guidance for housing (PPG3) contains a clearly-stated presumption that previously- developed land and existing buildings will be re-used for housing before consideration is given to developing greenfields. The draft revised RPG will set a target for the south-east that 60 per cent. of additional dwellings should be provided by recycling land or converting existing buildings.
<P>

<a name="01218w04.html_para1">We have separately published advice on better design of development and on undertaking urban housing capacity studies. We have also made available (initially for comment) guidance on how to manage the release of land in such a way as to minimise unnecessary loss of greenfields to development.
<P>

<a name="01218w04.html_para2">A particular concern expressed by respondents to the previous consultation was about the availability of affordable homes in the region. We agree that affordability is of key importance, not least to maintain economic growth in the south-east. The draft revised RPG now provides stronger guidance on the provision of affordable homes. We also set out measures to help increase the supply of affordable homes in the Housing Policy Statement made to the House last week and especially the Government's proposals to introduce a new Starter Home scheme to help around 10,000 key workers, particularly teachers, nurses and police officers, buy their own homes.
<P>

<a name="01218w04.html_para3">Moreover, we are significantly increasing resources available for housing. We are doubling funding for the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme between 2001-02 and 2003-04 to support new social rented housing. In additional, there will be more than &#163;360 million spending next year by housing authorities in the south-east outside London.
<P>

<a name="01218w04.html_para4">In our Proposed Changes in March, we made clear that we rejected the rigid "predict and provide approach" taken by the Panel chaired by Professor Crow which conducted the public examination into the draft RPG. Nor could we accept the proposals of the regional planning body (SERPLAN) which did not take proper account of the region's future housing needs. We proposed to provide 43,000 additional houses on average each year throughout the region outside London. This compared with the 55,000 dwellings a year recommended by the Panel and the local authorities' (SERPLAN) proposals for 33,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="01218w04.html_para5">We have now decided in the light of consultation to revise the proposed housing provision downwards to an average of 39,000 a year, at least for the next five years. As a result of our policies, backed up by the new tools we have recently announced, we intend that no more land should be used for housing than SERPLAN assumed would be required in planning for 33,000 additional dwellings a year. After 2006, it is likely to be necessary to plan for the higher figure of 43,000 individual dwellings to meet housing needs but that will be a matter for review under our flexible 'plan, monitor and manage' approach. The review will take full account of the proposed studies on the potential growth areas of Milton Keynes, Ashford and the London-Stansted-Cambridge corridor.

Comments are invited on this proposed distribution by 12 February 2001.

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made in the House on 24 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 777-89, about our intention to proceed with the implementation of the Core Competence model for the DERA Public Private Partnership (PPP). Under Core Competence, around three quarters of the current DERA organisation will be turned into a company, referred to as NewDERA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Armed Forces regard drug taking as a matter of the utmost seriousness. A comprehensive drugs education and awareness programme, together with a random Compulsory Drugs Testing (CDT) programme is employed to dissuade Armed Forces personnel from taking drugs. A positive CDT test result by a member of the Services will, in most cases, lead to an administrative discharge which no rehabilitation offered. Those few personnel who test positive, and are retained under exceptional circumstances, receive a formal warning and are closely monitored and subject to no-notice drug re-testing for a period of between two and five years. They also attend the routine Services' drug education and awareness programme during the monitoring period.
<P>

<a name="01218w05.html_para5">The position for those Service personnel who are detained at the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) following a conviction for a drug related criminal offence is slightly different.

 I will assume that the hon. Member refers to those widows who have been awarded a War Widow's Pension by the DSS War Pensions Agency and who have, in addition, been awarded an attributable forces family pension under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). Attributable pensions for widows and widowers of ex-Service personnel were introduced to the AFPS in 1973.




<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 19W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01218w05.html_para6">The Defence and Social Security Secretaries announced, on 20 July 2000, that widow and widowers in receipt of an attributable forces family pension are to retain their pension if they remarry or cohabit. These changes, took effect from 31 October. Previously, an attributable widow's pension was withdrawn on remarriage or cohabitation, although it would have been automatically restored on second widowhood or at the end of a period of cohabitation. Those widows or widowers who had already remarried (before 31 October), and had their attributable pension withdrawn, were not included in the change. Those in receipt of a DSS War Widows' Pension or a non-attributable widows or widowers' pension were also not affected by the change; their pensions will still cease on remarriage or cohabitation.
<P>

<a name="01218w05.html_para7">The question whether widows who had already remarried should have their pensions restored was considered; however, it was decided not to include them because those women had chosen to remarry in the full knowledge that their pension would cease. Furthermore, successive Governments had held fast to the principle that improvements to public sector pension schemes are not applied retrospectively because the cost of doing so would mean it would be extremely difficult to introduce any improvements for current members of the armed forces.

<a name="01218w06.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We are committed as a Government to helping all children with special educational needs (SEN) to develop their full potential. We are taking a number of steps to raise the awareness of dyslexia and help teachers to improve the identification and assessment of children who have or may have dyslexia, including through baseline assessment, which--although this is not its primary purpose--can be a useful first screen to help teachers identify where a child has learning needs which may require further, more specialist investigation and assessment. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is now consulting on our proposals for revising statutory baseline assessment, including our proposal that the 90 current baseline assessment schemes be replaced by a single national scheme, which should help to improve the identification of learning needs. Any national scheme will incorporate the features of local schemes that have been most successful in identifying possible SEN. Training for teachers to support the new scheme would focus on how to use it to identify learning needs needing further investigation and how to devise strategy to help children progress.
<P>

<a name="01218w06.html_para0">The National Literacy Strategy has raised standards for all children, including those with dyslexia, and we have started to build on this success by introducing pilot projects in September in 17 LEAs involving over 200 schools to transform standards in English and mathematics for 11 to 14-year-olds. We will implement this nationally in 2001.
<P>

<a name="01218w06.html_para1">We are also taking work forward in partnership with some of the voluntary organisations that support children with dyslexia, including the British Dyslexia Association and the Dyslexia Institute. This includes the Department, together with the National Lottery Charities Board and WH Smith, funding a two year "Spell It" (Study Programme to Evaluate Literacy Learning through Individualised Tuition) research project run by the Dyslexia Institute to evaluate the effects of structured programmes of intervention, targeted at seven year old pupils who are experiencing specific difficulties in learning to read, write and spell. Two key aspects of the project are to develop activities that parents can do at home and to share the knowledge and skills of specialist teachers more widely.
<P>

<a name="01218w06.html_para2">Following a seminar convened by the DfEE in July 1999 to bring together bodies with an interest and expertise in the field of teaching children with dyslexia, the Pathways Group was formed consisting of representatives from the DfEE and key partners in the field of dyslexia. The Group has been engaged in producing a leaflet designed to help teachers interested in pursuing further training on specific learning difficulties to access relevant training. It is envisaged that the leaflet will direct these teachers towards more detailed course information which will be available via the Department's Inclusion website.

<a name="01218w06.html_para3">Children with dyslexia, along with all children with SEN, will also benefit from more general measures we are taking to support children with SEN. These include: the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech in 6 December; the revision of the SEN Code of Practice; and the Standards Fund, through which we are spending &#163;82 million in 2001-02 to improve support for children with special educational needs, which represents a 50 per cent. increase from the &#163;55 million this year.

 This information is not held centrally. Recent reports point to a wide range of formal, informal, statutory and non-statutory partnerships covering a wide range of interests. As a result, the Government are trying to encourage greater rationalisation. The recently issued draft guidance on local strategic partnerships is intended to encourage the development of a single co-ordinated framework for partnership arrangements at the local level. We have also set up the Regional Co-ordination Unit. The Unit has recently published an action plan which sets out how the Government intend to modernise the way it works at regional and local level and improve the way services are delivered on the ground.

 Section 19 of the Education Act 1996 places a responsibility on local education authorities to provide suitable education outside school for children unable to attend school because of illness, exclusion from school or otherwise. By 2002 provision for pupils excluded from school must be full time.

We do not collect centrally the number of pupils educated at home by their parents.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> The Learning and Skills Council's information technology (IT) systems are currently under development. A number of IT suppliers have been appointed, including FI Group for systems development and ICL for the support and maintenance of IT equipment. The general approach is to manage the transition to the Learning and Skills Council by making maximum use of existing systems from Training and Enterprise Councils and the Further Education and Funding Council and then gradually phasing in new systems. Some Learning and Skills Council systems, eg for payroll and finances, are already in place. Others will be brought in before the Council becomes fully operational.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on progress made towards the achievement of the Commonwealth Heads of Government target on the proportion of women in decision-making roles in political, public and private sectors by 2005.  [142513]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> Statistics are not currently held centrally on all areas listed. However, of the 35,000 appointments made to public bodies some 33 per cent. are held by women. This represents a rise of 10 per cent. on the position in 1991. The Government intend that 50 per cent. of all public appointments should be held by women. In some areas, such as appointments to NHS bodies, this has already nearly been achieved (some 48 per cent.), and the Women's Unit and the Public Appointments Unit are working closely together on strategies which will be sustainable over time to accelerate the overall rate of progress towards that target.
<P>

<a name="01218w08.html_para3">Eighteen per cent. of those elected to the House of Commons, 37 per cent. of those elected to the Scottish Parliament and 40 per cent. of those elected to the National Assembly of Wales are women. 23 per cent. of Cabinet members are women. While the Government believe that a more representative proportion of women in political office strengthens the democratic process, selection procedures remain a matter for the political parties concerned.
<P>

<a name="01218w08.html_para4">Statistics are not held centrally on women's participation in decision-making across the private sector. However, work continues to develop opportunities for women to participate equally in decision making in the private sector. For example, the Government's work-life balance campaign aims to raise awareness of the benefits of introducing policies and working practices which enable employees to balance their work with other responsibilities and needs in their lives.

status. This help includes advice and support on seeking and attracting appropriate sponsorship from the private sector including donations from charitable foundations, private trust funds and individuals.
<P>

<a name="01218w08.html_para5">The Government recognise the difficulties which some schools face in raising the private sector sponsorship to support their applications for specialist schools status. It is a challenging task, particularly in areas of socio- economic and rural deprivation. In recognition of this the Government have recently reduced the minimum sponsorship requirement from &#163;100,000 to &#163;50,000. In return, a school designated as a Specialist School receives a further &#163;100,000 towards its capital building project and additional annual grants totalling around &#163;500,000 over four years.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> We are determined to help people into work as quickly as possible.

We do not hold records centrally on the numbers of alarm clocks that have been given to jobseekers.

 Connexions Personal Advisers will be employed directly by Connexions Partnerships be seconded to partnerships from a range of organisations, or be employed by organisations sub-contracted to deliver Personal Adviser services. We are also working with Partnerships to broaden the pool of people from which Personal Advisers will be recruited. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to impose national salary scales, and there will not be a direct link to the pay of teachers. We have, however, been working with Connexions Pilots on how best to harmonise terms and conditions, and I will shortly be issuing guidance on setting salary scales to Connexions Partnerships.

 There are no compliance costs associated with payment of the climate change levy, as the sum payable will be added to energy bills.

 The DTI's expenditure on advertising through the Central Office of Information is set out in the tables. The criteria for assessing the effectiveness of each publicity initiative varies depending on the nature of the policy or service involved, and a judgment on the best means of getting messages to the target audiences. Specific advertising strategies form part of a wider range of activities to publicise individual policies or services, and it is sometimes difficult to untangle the impact of advertising from other actions. However, measures of success are incorporated into the planning for all campaign and advertising expenditure, and full account is taken of the guidance issued by the Cabinet Office on the use of public funds for this purpose.

In addition, a private sector helpline took 50,000 calls between January and March 1999. Therefore the total number of calls received up to the end of November 2000 is in excess of 220,000.
<P>

<a name="01218w09.html_para0">Information on the location of callers is not recorded by region or country. The vast majority of calls to the helpline are simply for information and advice and there is no need to take personal details.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the impact of the General Agreement on Trade in Services on developing countries.  [142512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> The General Agreement on Trade in Services was one of the agreements concluded at the end of the Uruguay round. It applies to all member countries of the World Trade Organisation (the majority of whom are developing countries) and includes specific provisions relating to flexibility for individual developing countries, particularly the least-developed countries.
<P>

<a name="01218w09.html_para1">The GATS provides for successive rounds of negotiations aimed at achieving progressive liberalisation of trade in services. Each member country, including developing countries, chooses for itself both which sectors they want to liberalise and the extent of that liberalisation by choosing the commitments they make (the "bottom-up" approach). They do not have to liberalise if they choose not to. In the current round, which began in January 2000, developing countries have sought to emphasise the importance of liberalisation in sectors of export interest to them, such as tourism services and movement of people. The Government support the GATS negotiations and believes that its results should bring benefits to all WTO members, including developing countries.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> START, built and operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at Culham in Oxfordshire from 1991, was a pioneering innovation in the research into the generation of electricity by means of nuclear fusion. START was the world's first working spherical device (the 'spherical tokamak') in which magnetic fields are used to confine the very high temperature plasmas required for energy release from fusion.
<P>

<a name="01218w10.html_para0">There were two important achievements in the period from May 1997. First, a world record for the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure was demonstrated, three times greater than the record from less compact tokamaks. Secondly, it was demonstrated that the spherical tokamak plasma could easily be made to enter a stable, improved mode of operation, in which energy leakage from the plasma is reduced.
<P>

<a name="01218w10.html_para1">START ceased operations on 31 March 1998. Since then its larger successor MAST ("MegaAmpere Spherical Tokamak") has been built at Culham and is confirming 



<P>

 The Government have made an unprecedented commitment to ensuring a successful census in Wales.

We are explicitly recognising the diversity of those who regard themselves as Welsh and who have other ethnic backgrounds.
<P>

 I have regular discussions with the First Secretary about a range of issues, including the 2001 census.
<P>

<a name="01218w11.html_para3">As the census informs billions of pounds of spending in Wales, whether through the Welsh Block grant, allocations to police or fire services, or overall measures of economic performance and thus economic aid, we have discussed how any disruption of the census, either through non co-operation or eleventh hour changes to its format, runs the risk of losing precious resources for Wales.

 I have received representations from my hon. Friend about this matter. I know my hon. Friend is meeting OPAS (the Pensions Scheme Advisory Service) which can provide advice on these issues. The responsibility for ensuring the proper statutory procedures of occupational pension schemes rests with the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority. The Pensions Ombudsman can investigate complaints of maladministration from members of occupational pension schemes.

<a name="01218w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The arrangements for clinical governance provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of measures to assure and improve the quality of patient care in the National Health Service. These arrangements are multi-disciplinary and all clinicians are expected to participate in their delivery.
<P>

<a name="01218w11.html_para6">The Health Act 1999 places a duty of quality on primary care trusts, health authorities and NHS trusts. They must ensure that this duty is discharged properly by putting and keeping in place arrangements for continuously monitoring and improving the quality of health care they provide through the implementation of clinical governance. NHS organisations are responsible for ensuring that clinicians participate fully in clinical governance arrangements.
<P>

<a name="01218w11.html_para7">The Commission for Health Improvement will monitor the implementation of clinical governance through a rolling programme of clinical governance reviews.
<P>

<a name="01218w11.html_para8">Clinical governance is underpinned by arrangements for professional appraisal. The NHS Plan proposes that, subject to Parliament, by April 2001, all doctors working in primary care, whether as principals, non-principals or locums, will be required to be on a list of a health authority and be subject to clinical governance arrangements. These will include annual appraisal and mandatory participation in clinical audit.
<P>

<a name="01218w11.html_para9">The NHS Plan also sets out provisions for making annual appraisal and effective job plans mandatory for all consultants. The intention is to introduce an agreed mechanism for employer-based appraisal, by April 2001, as a contractual requirement. The outcome of the appraisal process will need to be compatible with, and to feed into, the processes of clinical governance and General Medical Council revalidation, which will require all doctors to demonstrate that they remain fit to practise in their chosen field.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w13.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the reports and recommendations of the health pay review bodies.  [143602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 I am responding on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to the reports of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) and the Review Body on Nursing staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB), which are published today. I understand that a similar announcement is being made by the First Minister and the Minister for Health and Community Care in Scotland. Copies of the reports are available in the Vote Office and the Library. I am grateful to the chairmen and members of both Review Bodies for their hard work.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para0">The pay recommendations of the two Review Bodies are being accepted in full and without staging.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para1">Nurses, midwives and health visitors are to get an across the board increase of 3.7 per cent. For the third time in three years, the award is being paid nationally in full without staging. In addition one discretionary point is being consolidated into pay ranges of grades F, G, H and I, and the flat rate elements of London Allowance, on call and standby payments are also increased by 3.7 per cent. and the flat rate elements of London Weighting are being harmonised in line with rates paid to staff above grade B.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para2">On top of these increases, we are also introducing Cost of Living Supplements from 1 April 2001. These will be worth between &#163;600 and &#163;1,000 for qualified NPRB staff in London, and between &#163;400 and &#163;600 for equivalent staff in high-cost areas in the South of England.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para3">The minimum starting pay of a newly qualified nurse will rise to &#163;15,445, an increase of 30 per cent. in cash terms over the salary paid at 31 March 1997. In Inner London, starting pay for a new nurse will be &#163;19,178, 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 46W</I><P>
including London Weighting and the new cost of living supplement--an increase of 7 per cent. on the April 2000 figure.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para4">The pay of an experienced ward sister or charge nurse on the maximum of grade G will rise by 5.5 per cent. to &#163;25,420. This reflects the 3.7 per cent. award and the consolidation of one discretionary point. An equivalent nurse in inner London will earn &#163;29,535 including also the new cost of living supplement--a 9 per cent. increase over the April 2000 figure.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para5">On the issue of midwives' grading, the NPRB has endorsed the agreement reached between the parties and recommended that it be implemented from 1 April 2001. This means that all midwives will be able to move through to the maximum of grade F without needing to be promoted.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para6">This year, the largest increases go to the most experienced nurses, midwives and health visitors who are in the vanguard of delivering the modern NHS--providing leadership, assuring clinical and environmental standards and getting all aspects of basic nursing care right for the patients.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para7">The NPRB has also recommended an across the board increase of 3.7 per cent. for physiotherapists, radiographers and other professions allied to medicine (PAMs). Starting pay for basic grade PAMs with a degree after four years' training will increase on 1 April 2001 to &#163;15,920. PAMs in the pay ranges of the Senior II, Senior I and Chief/Head/Superintendent IV, and the Chief/Head/Superintendent III grades are also to have one discretionary point consolidated in recognition of the extra responsibilities placed on them by the NHS Plan. In addition, the qualifying period for discretionary points will be reduced to one year in line with the arrangements for other NPRB staff.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para8">These awards are fair and reflect the contribution of the key staff in the Review Body groups to the delivery of the NHS Plan and the whole modernisation agenda.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para9">The Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB) has recommended an overall pay increase of 3.9 per cent. for salaried doctors and dentists and general medical and dental practitioners.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para10">To encourage the retention of general medical practitioners, the DDRB has also recommended a 7 per cent. increase in seniority allowances, worth in the region of &#163;500 for a general medical practitioner with 25 years service. This is in addition to the 3.9 per cent. increase in intended average net remuneration.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para11">For consultants this 3.9 per cent. increase comes on top of the &#163;50 million package to recognise increased work load, contribution to NHS and intensity of work. Within this over &#163;40 million will be paid out in intensity supplements to consultants this year, paid in January 2001 backdated to April 2000.
<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para12">The DDRB pay rise takes the starting consultant salary to &#163;50,810 and a consultant on the maximum of the scale with maximum distinction award to &#163;128,935. The number of distinction awards has also been increased by 176 which will support the Government's proposals to reform the existing schemes to give more opportunity to reward consultants for their commitment and contribution to the NHS.




<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 47W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01218w13.html_para13">Doctors in training will benefit from this increase as well as from the new pay and banding system introduced in December 2000. This deal replaced the old, unfair system of half pay for extra hours with a banding system to reflect total hours worked. As well as giving doctors in training significant increases the pay deal acts as an incentive for employers to reduce excessive hours. With the addition of this pay increase a Pre-Registration House Officer (PRHO) on minimum of scale working more than 48 hours at most unsocial times (band 2A) will receive &#163;26,903 and a SHO on the maximum of the scale, again in band 2A, will receive &#163;44,820.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research he has carried out to determine which rivers in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales and <i>(c)</i> Scotland have flood conditions which exceed (i) 10 ft and (ii) 15 ft above low water level, at the frequencies of (1) one in 10 years, (2) one in 50 years, (3) one in 100 years, (4) one in 200 years and (5) one in 500 years; and where information arising from such research has been published.  [142030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Flood defence is a devolved responsibility. I am not aware of any research that has been undertaken to provide the information sought on a consolidated basis for rivers in England. Depth of potential flooding is highly variable even within an individual river catchment, as it depends on the flow and the degree to which it is confined or controlled. However, where schemes for flood alleviation or management are proposed, a significant part of the investigation is the derivation of such information on a site-specific basis.

To ask the President of the Council if she will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effect on the Blackpool, South constituency of her Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [142225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Privy Council Office's core role is as a Secretariat. As such it has no policies of its own which would directly affect my hon. Friend's constituency.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office when she will publish the next six-monthly update of information on task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews established since 2 May 1997.  [143497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Libraries of the House lists containing updated details about those live task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews established between 2 May 1997, and 31 October 2000. 



<P>

 We do not provide any direct formal or financial assistance to industrial business watch schemes, and there are no central records available as to the number of such schemes. We do, of course, welcome any such initiatives to combat crime. Among the projects to assist business to reduce crime is Business Crime Check which seeks to create, maintain and promote a database of information relevant to those who wish to reduce crime against business.

<a name="01218w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I am not aware of the National Retail Business Watch scheme. The Government's drive against retail crime is being taken forward by the Retail Crime Reduction Action Team (RCRAT) and its work with the police and others in the public and private sectors has already had an impact on retail crime. RCRAT has produced a comprehensive guide to setting up and managing a Retail Crime Reduction Partnership and to date almost 250 of these partnerships have been established, covering all the major shopping centres in England and Wales.

<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 49W</I><P>
on 1 July 2000. The main legislative provisions relating to police authorities are incorporated in the Police Act 1996, the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 and various items of local government legislation. Police authorities are statutorily required to publish annual reports and annual accounts. They are subject to the jurisdiction of the Local Government Ombudsman, but not the Parliamentary Ombudsman. They are subject to audit by the Audit Commission, but not by the National Audit Office. Section 100 of the Local Government Act 1972 as amended by the Access to Information Act 1984 sets out the legislative position regarding public access to meetings and documents relating to those meetings. Police authorities are statutorily required to admit the public to committee meetings, but not to hold additional public meetings. They are also statutorily required to publish the agendas, minutes and papers or documents for meetings. The public can be excluded from meetings during consideration of exempt items (as outlined in Schedule 12A of the Local Government Act 1972) and papers relating to such items may also be withheld from public access. Police authorities are statutorily required to keep and make publicly available a register of members' interests. There is no statutory requirement to consult and report to local authorities in their areas on their plans and policies and they are not statutorily subject to scrutiny by local authorities in their areas of operation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The British Crime Survey shows that crime levels are significantly lower in rural areas than in urban areas, with levels of burglary, violent and vehicle crime declining. Nevertheless, tackling crime and the fear of crime in all areas, including rural areas, remains a high priority for this Government. Our approach in all areas is to assist the police and the local crime and disorder partnerships to address local crime effectively.
<P>

<a name="01218w14.html_para2">We announced in June that rural police forces were to benefit this year from an additional &#163;15 million from the Police Modernisation Fund. The allocation to forces in the south-west is as follows: Avon and Somerset, &#163;494,892; Devon and Cornwall &#163;1,554,673; Dorset &#163;221,858; Gloucestershire &#163;387,093; and Wiltshire &#163;544,900. The money rises to &#163;30 million next year.
<P>

<a name="01218w14.html_para3">This money will make a real difference to policing in rural areas. In addition, we are providing funding for a range of initiatives and projects in rural areas as part of the Government's Crime Reduction Programme. In Devon and Cornwall, these include &#163;81,000 to tackle persistent offending in east Devon and &#163;950,000 to tackle alcohol related crime across the force area as part of the Targeted Policing Initiative; and &#163;367,200 for four projects as part of the Reducing Burglary Initiative.

<a name="01218w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December, 2000]:</i> Assessing the costs of anti-drugs activities is inherently difficult because these often form part of wider functional service expenditure. For instance, up to one third of all property crime is thought to be drugs related, imposing a considerable burden on the Criminal Justice System. Broad assessment of the costs imposed by illegal abuse on public services and the proactive measures centred on tackling their root causes were made in the 2000 Spending review. Indicative spending totals for the latter were published in the Spending Review White Paper (Cm 4807).
<P>

<a name="01218w15.html_para0">The Government are committed to improving their understanding of these totals. As part of its Service Delivery Agreement, the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for the United Kingdom Anti Drugs Co-ordination Unit, will implement a robust system for tracking total anti-drugs related expenditure and outputs by March 2002 and demonstrate that by March 2004 there will have been a 45 per cent. increase in spend on proactive effort on a 2000-01 base.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he has taken to encourage the <i>(a)</i> use of community beat officers and <i>(b)</i> assigning of named officers to patrol neighbourhoods; and if he will make a statement.  [142617]<P>

<P>
<a name="01218w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 put police participation in local crime and disorder partnerships on a statutory footing and the Government have made it clear that they see this local partnership approach as the way forward in fighting crime. The use of community beat officers is an important part of delivering this. In his thematic inspections "Winning the Race" and "Winning the Race Revisited", in 1997 and 1999, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary endorsed the use of community beat officers responsible for problem solving within their local areas. Progress on implementing those recommendations will be assessed in a further thematic inspection report to be published in January.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on recent Court of Appeal judgments relating to the use of mandatory sentences under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.  [142616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> On 9 November 2000, the Court of Appeal gave judgment in the cases of Matthew Offen, Peter McGilliard, Darren McKeown, Christova Okwuegbunam and Stephen Saunders. The first four cases were appeals, while the last, Saunders, was referred by the Attorney-General under his powers to refer for unduly lenient sentences. In all the cases challenges were made to the lawfulness of the automatic life sentence provisions introduced as section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (now contained in section 109 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000) on the grounds that the imposition of such a sentence was incompatible with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as protected by the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para0">Section 109 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides that an offender committing any of a list of certain offences (either sexual or violent) on two separate occasions should receive a mandatory life sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which would justify it not doing so.
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para1">In giving the judgment of the Court, the Lord Chief Justice confirmed the compatibility of the legislation with the rights protected by the ECHR. It therefore remains the position that a life sentence must be given to a person 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 58W</I><P>
who commits a second of the serious sexual or violent offences covered by the provision unless there are exceptional circumstances which would make it unjust to do so.
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para2">The court upheld Offen and McKeown's appeals, substituting determinate terms of three years in place of a life sentence; dismissed Okwuegbunam and McGilliard's appeals, confirming their automatic life sentences; and found in favour of the Attorney-General in the Saunders case, quashing the 12-year determinate sentence and imposing a new automatic life sentence.
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para3">The detailed matters for consideration relate to what should constitute "exceptional circumstances". We are currently giving consideration to these aspects of the judgment and their implications for sentencing policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December, 2000]:</i> In order to improve retention of police officers we have:
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>encouraged police authorities to ensure that officers are retired on grounds of ill-health only where they satisfy the requirements as to permanent disablement for police duties set out in the Police Pensions Regulations;
<P>
<BR>
been considering whether changes to those Regulations are required and we will be consulting the police service about the precise terms of revised Regulations shortly;
<P>
<BR>
set a target of 2 per cent. for reducing sickness absence in police forces in England and Wales as poor management of sickness absence may be a precursor to unnecessary medical retirement. In 1996-97 the average number of days sickness per police officer was 12.80. This declined to 11.55, or by 1.25 days per officer by 1999-2000.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01218w16.html_para5">In order to improve recruitment of police officers we have:
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>established the Crime Fighting Fund to enable forces to recruit 9,000 officers over and above the number they had previously planned in the three years 2000-01 to 2002-03;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01218w16.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>launched the first ever national recruitment advertising campaign.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01218w16.html_para8">In order to improve both retention and recruitment my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary agreed to increase from 1 July 2000, by &#163;3,327 per annum, London Allowance for officers in the Metropolitan police service and City of London police who joined on or after 1 September 1994 and receive no housing allowance.
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para9">The Police Negotiating Board is currently looking at whether there should be an allowance for officers in any other forces, and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary awaits any recommendations it may make on this or any other issues in relation to police pay and allowances.
<P>

<a name="01218w16.html_para10">Wastage rates from the police service are very low--4.8 per cent. of total strength in 1998-99, 4.7 per cent. in 1999-2000 and 2.3 per cent. for the six months to 30 September 2000. Police recruitment is rising. In the six months to 30 September 2000, for the first time since March 1997, the number of officers recruited into the service exceeded those leaving it.

<a name="01218w16.html_para11">Anti-social behaviour orders have been taken out by the police and local authorities in a variety of cases and with considerable success in tackling the crime and disorder that can blight the lives of the community. Police forces and probation services have welcomed the new sex offender orders and regard them as a useful tool.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, reprimands and final warnings replaced cautions for young offenders. They were introduced in seven pilot areas from the end of September 1998 until 1 June 2000, when both reprimands and final warnings became available nationwide. During the final quarter in 1998, 1,126 reprimands and 576 final warnings were recorded (these data were collected as part of the pilot). Centrally recorded data for 1999 are given in the table.

<P>
<a name="01218w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> Section 81 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established a new Sentencing Advisory Panel, to provide advice on sentencing to the Court of Appeal. The Panel must be informed when the Court is considering guidelines, and then provide advice, consulting with other interested parties. The Panel may also propose that the Court frame or revise guidelines if it considers this necessary or when directed to do so by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. These provisions came into effect on 1 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para0">The Sentencing Advisory Panel has made a proposal that the Court of Appeal should frame a sentencing guideline on four occasions. No proposals have yet been made to revise an existing guideline.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para1">On 21 September 2000, the Panel issued a consultation paper on a proposal that the Court of Appeal frame a sentencing guideline on handling stolen goods. It is hoped that advice will be submitted to the Court of Appeal in the new year.

<P>
<a name="01218w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> Life imprisonment is the mandatory sentence for murder. Section 109 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides for an automatic life sentence for a second serious sexual or violent offence. Section 110 of the 2000 Act provides for a minimum seven years imprisonment for a person convicted for a third time of a Class A drug trafficking offence. These provisions were both implemented on 1 October 1997. Section 111 of the 2000 Act provides for a minimum sentence of three years imprisonment for a third time domestic burglary. This was implemented on 1 December 1999.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para2">There are a range of motoring offences that carry an obligatory period of disqualification from driving. A substantial number of motoring offences also carry obligatory endorsement of the offender's driving licence. Although a substantial number of offences may be dealt with by a fixed penalty, the majority of which are road traffic offences, this form of disposal cannot be regarded as a mandatory sentence.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para3">The Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 also makes provision for mandatory referral of certain young offenders to Youth Offender Panels where the offender and Panel will discuss and seek to agree a youth offender contract.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para4">Fixed penalty notices are issued at the discretion of the issuing authority. The offender is offered the choice of avoiding prosecution by paying the penalty or electing non-payment and attending court. Any sentence passed following conviction for the offence is entirely at the discretion of the court.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the number of Neighbourhood Warden schemes in operation; what central Government funding has been <i>(a)</i> allocated and <i>(b)</i> spent on Neighbourhood Warden schemes since May 1997; what guidelines are in place relating to the operation of warden schemes; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December, 2000]:</i> Neighbourhood Wardens are an important part of the Government's regeneration and neighbourhood renewal programme and of our partnership approach to tackling crime and disorder. The Policy Action Team Report 6 on Neighbourhood Wardens surveyed 50 schemes. Subsequently the Government have made funding available for Neighbourhood Warden schemes. In September this year I announced the first 50 successful new schemes, and that 42 further bids were being deferred for development. These enhanced bids have to be submitted for consideration by 15 December. I will make further announcements about these schemes in due course. It is too soon to make any formal assessment of how many schemes will be funded; we will however be evaluating the schemes in a similar way to other schemes funded under the Crime Reduction Programme.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para5">We have allocated a total of &#163;13.5 million (from the Home Department and the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions) for Neighbourhood Warden schemes over the period 2000-03. The total value of the first tranche of approved schemes is &#163;7.6 million.
<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para6">The Neighbourhood Wardens Unit is providing technical support and guidance notes to all schemes as they develop their implementation plans. Guidance is routinely placed on the crime reduction website (crimereduction.gov.uk). Draft guidance on warden induction training has recently been circulated to successful schemes.

 Since 1997, the Government have undertaken a broad range of measures to reduce the level of domestic violence and strengthen support for victims.

<P>

<a name="01218w17.html_para7">Other recent measures include: the issue of multi-agency guidance to agencies dealing with domestic violence and of specific guidance to Health Service professionals; the issue of a new Home Department circular to the police; the inclusion of domestic violence within police Best Value performance indicators; the provision of &#163;120 million additional capital funding for a new Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund for

<a name="01218w18.html_para3">It was last May that I published the Government's consultation document which was based on reports of two separate studies. The first study was commissioned from the management consultants KPMG in order to take forward recommendations made by the Home Affairs Select Committee in its report on the police disciplinary and complaints procedures and by Sir William Macpherson's Report of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. The second study was by the human rights organisation Liberty.
<P>

<a name="01218w18.html_para4">The outcome of the consultation is that the Government propose to set up a new body to handle complaints; it will be called the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
<P>

<a name="01218w18.html_para5">I have previously indicated my sympathy for the principle of an independent system for investigating complaints against the police and I am pleased to announce that a key element of the new system will be the independent investigations of the more serious complaints. Two other key elements of the new system will be easier accessibility to the system for complainants and more openness in dealing with complainants.
<P>

<a name="01218w18.html_para6">I am very grateful to all those who took part in the consultation. In particular, the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which has called repeatedly for reforms so that it could increase its effectiveness and independence. The PCA's response pointed the way towards independent investigations, easier accessibility and more openness.
<P>

<a name="01218w18.html_para7">I have arranged for copies of the framework document to be placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent reports he has received from HM Inspector of Constabulary into delays in processing standard renewal applications for firearms certificates; and if he will make a statement.  [143109]<P>

<P>
<a name="01218w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1999 all forces are required to carry out a five year rolling programme of Best Value reviews of all areas of business. In the current year five forces have indicated that they will be reviewing their firearms licensing departments in this way. The outcome will be examined by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in accordance with their inspection protocols which were circulated to all police forces in March 2000 and which make specific reference to firearms licensing. The results will be made available through the appropriate police authority in due course.

<a name="01218w18.html_para8">My right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what has been the total expenditure to date on the development, administration and implementation of the child curfew order.  [143097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We estimate development and administration costs within Government as &#163;15,000. We do not collect data from local authorities on their development and administration costs: they would vary between authorities but we believe scoping work on a possible local child curfew scheme would cost under &#163;5,000. No schemes have been implemented.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many persons of Irish origin, descent or background have been the subject of notifications to the Special Branch in each year since Operation Pre-empt became live in the Humberside police area; and how many of these persons became the subject of notifications as a result of <i>(a)</i> being brought into custody, <i>(b)</i> being subject to a routine street or driver check, <i>(c)</i> being subject to a police inquiry for any reason and <i>(d)</i> being brought to the attention of the police by a member of the public;  [142756]

<P>
<a name="01218w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Operation Pre-empt was limited to the Humberside police area and was an operational matter for the Humberside police. I understand that the chief constable asked for a review of the policy. As a result of this review the operation was withdrawn on 12 December.
<P>

<a name="01218w19.html_para0">There were 4,728 people of Irish descent resident in the Humberside area at the time of the 1991 Census.

<a name="01218w19.html_para1">Information held by Special Branch is the responsibility of the chief constable.
<P>

<a name="01218w19.html_para2">The Government fully support the police in work to counter terrorism. The basis for this work is whether there is any information or intelligence which might link an individual to a terrorist organisation or activity, and not the nationality of those involved.

<P>
20. <a name="01218w19.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Quinn: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps his Department is taking to reduce the number of people leaving work because of long-term illness.  [141821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We believe that people with long-term illnesses should have the support to remain in work. The Inland Revenue has introduced a Disabled Person's Tax Credit (DPTC) Fast-Track to make it financially possible for sick and disabled people to stay in work. This allows people who become long-term sick or disabled while they 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2000 : Column: 72W</I><P>
are in work to receive DPTC on their return to work where they need to move to a job with lower pay (e.g. because of reduced hours).
<P>

<a name="01218w19.html_para3">This Department is also working with the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Health to implement, from next year, a series of Job Retention and Rehabilitation pilots to test the effectiveness of better co-ordinated, earlier work-focused interventions by health and employment services in helping people to stay in work.

24. <a name="01218w19.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Coaker: </B>

<a name="01218w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We plan to meet the main organisations representing pensioners during the consultation process.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the potential impact of the pension credit on pensioners on low and modest incomes.  [141829]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The credit will ensure that pensioners on low and modest incomes will be able to share in this country's growing prosperity.

 We continue to invest to help local authorities root out Housing Benefit fraud.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates are based on small sample sizes and are subject to large margins of error. Therefore estimates should be treated with extreme caution. In particular, estimates will only give a very broad indication (if any) of trends over time. Likewise, comparisons between regions in any given year should also be treated with caution.<P>

2. Estimates relate to the median net income of pensioner units within each region, in &#163; per week, at July 1998 prices.<P>

3. Pensioner units are defined as single people over State Pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over State Pension age.<P>

 Two separate service providers--ICL and Sema--were responsible for the Department's IT network infrastructure prior to 23 November 2000, under the terms of the Focus '95 contracts. These contracts were awarded for a period of five years and had a collective value of approximately &#163;250 million. Work in progress started during this period is being taken forward by the BT-led consortium Arcway to ensure continuity of service.
<P>

<a name="01218w21.html_para4">The contract with Sema has subsequently expired and has not been renewed. On current plans the contract with ICL is due to expire May 2001.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> As announced in Spending Review 2000, energy efficiency funding from the climate change levy will be administered by a business led, not for profit, limited company--the Carbon Trust, which is currently being set up through the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 12 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 118W, on the Climate Change Levy, how many small and medium enterprises are covered by the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations.  [143077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01218w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Approximately 20 per cent. of the sites covered by the Pollution Prevention and Control Part A regulations are operated by small and medium sized enterprises. However, significantly more small and medium sized enterprises will be entitled to climate change levy rebates as the size thresholds in the regulations--other than those thresholds relating to combustion plant--will not apply for this purpose.

<P>
<a name="01218w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> The climate change levy will raise an estimated &#163;1 billion in its first year, all of which will be recycled to business via a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers' National Insurance Contributions and &#163;150 million of spending on energy efficiency. We expect the levy to be broadly neutral between services and manufacturing. The effect on any specific business, sector or region will depend on a number of factors, including their future energy consumption, the level of employment, eligibility for discounts, use of renewable or combined heat and power energy, and take up of enhanced capital allowances. In recognition of the unique position of the UK horticulture sector, a special package of measures--including a 50 per cent. discount on levy payments--was announced in Budget 2000.

 The WFTC provides support for low and middle income working families with children.
<P>

<a name="01218w23.html_para0">The WFTC has been of particular benefit to lone parents, 90 per cent. of whom are women, helping to tackle poverty and support lone parents as they move off benefit and into work.
<P>

<a name="01218w23.html_para1">Working Families Tax Credit, along with other tax and benefit reforms implemented during this Parliament, delivers a Minimum Income Guarantee of &#163;208 per week for families working 35 hours a week and &#163;152 for families working 16 hours a week . 50 per cent. of WFTC recipients are lone mothers and another 10 per cent. are couples where the woman is the main earner.
<P>

<a name="01218w23.html_para2">On average, families are &#163;30 a week better off on WFTC than on Family Credit and 35 per cent. more lone parents are receiving WFTC compared to Family Credit. The net income for a lone mother with two children is now &#163;30 higher than it was under Family Credit.

<a name="01218w23.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The aggregates levy is based on independent research commissioned by the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions which has verified that there are significant environmental costs associated with quarrying that are not already covered by regulation, including noise, dust, visual intrusion, loss of amenity and damage to biodiversity. The research looked at sites in both densely populated areas and in remote and sparsely populated areas.

their true environmental costs. This will provide an incentive for all business to use more sustainable materials and to use all aggregates more efficiently. A proportion of the proceeds from the levy will be available in a Sustainability Fund to help the Scottish Executive deliver local environmental benefits. The remaining proceeds will fund a cut in employer NICs which will deliver economic benefits nationwide.
