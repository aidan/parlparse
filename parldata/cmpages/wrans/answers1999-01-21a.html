<a name="90121w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hume: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many full-time students, normally domiciled in the Northern Ireland Western Education and Library Board area, enrolled in higher education courses for the current academic year.  [65309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 This information is not available in the form requested. However, 2,534 full-time students domiciled in the area of the Western Education and Library Board applied for financial support to attend higher education courses in the current academic year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many students are enrolled at Clifton Special Care School, Bangor; if a nurse is available in the school; and if she will make a statement.  [65960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 98 pupils are currently enrolled at Clifton Special School. At present there is no nurse available in Clifton School, but the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust are working with the South Eastern Education and Library Board to arrange provision of the required level of nursing support.

<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. John D. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what estimate she has made of the number of retired teachers who subsequently returned to teach for limited periods in primary schools for the most recent 12 month period for which figures are available; and if she will make a statement about opportunities for recently trained teachers.  [65959]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 673 retired teachers were re-employed in primary schools on a temporary basis during the 1997-98 school year.

<a name="90121w01.html_para0">The Department of Education has advised employing authorities and schools that, wherever possible, preference should be given to newly qualified teachers or experienced teachers seeking to return to employment, when filling vacancies, including those of a temporary nature.
<P>

<a name="90121w01.html_para1">In the year after qualification, the vast majority of around 650 teachers who qualify each year should obtain teaching posts. For example, a total of only 11 primary and secondary school teachers of age 24 years or under were registered as unemployed for more than 6 months at the end of the 1997-98 school year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. White: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how she intends to fund the costs incurred by the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in caring for the dangerous wild animals that were taken into their care on behalf of public agencies, from Seskinore, Co. Tyrone, on 8 November 1997.  [67440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew3"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 Costs incurred by the USPCA in caring for these animals until ownership formally passed to the Society on 26 October 1998 amount to &#163;54,329. It is proposed to share these costs on an equal three way basis across the budgets for the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and the Departments of Agriculture and Environment for Northern Ireland. Parliament's approval to meet these costs in the current year will be sought in a Supplementary estimate for Department of the Environment Vote 4 (Environment and other Services). Pending that approval, payment will be made from repayable advances from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund.

<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland which NHS trusts and health boards are currently connected to the NHSnet; when he expects every NHS trust and health board to have a link to the NHSnet; what future resources will be required to <i>(a)</i> complete and <i>(b)</i> support this service; and what resources have been allocated to this project (i) this year and (ii) in each of the next three financial years.  [65762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 All Health Boards and NHS Trusts will be linked to NHSnet by 31 March 1999. The current position of Health Boards and NHS Trusts is set out in the table. Resources allocated to this project in this year are &#163;6 million. The ongoing costs of supporting these links will be met by the Health Boards and Trusts.

<a name="90121w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if full use of the NHSnet requires <i>(a)</i> GP practices and <i>(b)</i> NHS trusts connected to the NHSnet to have compatible software and hardware; and which companies have supplied the hardware and software for the project.  [65763] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 NHSnet provides a UK-wide secure private telecommunications network for NHS Organisations across the UK under contracts with BT, BT Syntegra and Cable and Wireless. Connection to NHSnet is achieved by connecting to a Service Access Point on the NHSnet. NHS organisations can either connect directly to an NHSnet Service Access Point or indirectly if they are already linked to a network, e.g. a private Health Board wide network, with a gateway connection to NHSnet. All networks (whether single GP Practices or Board level private networks) connecting to NHSnet must conform to the NHSnet Code of Connection which maintains the security and integrity of NHSnet.
<P>

<a name="90121w01.html_para2">Full use of NHSnet requires each GP Practice and NHS Trust (or the local network to which they belong) to meet published standards for NHSnet which comply with the Internet suite protocols (IP). GP Practices and NHS Trusts must therefore have systems which are compatible with NHSnet (but not necessarily the same as each other). A variety of suppliers will have supplied parts of the overall network; details of these are not held centrally.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when he expects all GP practices in Scotland to have a link to the NHSnet; what resources have been allocated to this project <i>(a)</i> this year and <i>(b)</i> in each of the next three financial years; what resources will be required to (i) complete and (ii) support this service; and what is the estimated cost saving over the next five years.  [65760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 97 per cent. of GP practices are already connected and the remaining practices which asked to participate will be linked by March 1999. The total cost of this project was &#163;7 million of which &#163;0.415 million was spent in 1998-99. Resources required for ongoing support of the installed systems and NHSnet connections will be met through the usual arrangements between Health Boards and GPs for reimbursement of expenses.
<P>

<a name="90121w01.html_para3">It is difficult at this stage to estimate the cost saving when the system is fully utilised. The main objective is to improve patient care through ensuring that clinicians have access to the information they need to care for patients wherever they are in the NHSiS. The benefits expected when the full infrastructure is put into place also include savings in costs and reductions in the bureaucracy of sending an estimated 10 million paper forms around the system each year, saving in staff time, and improved convenience for patients.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many and what percentage of GP practices are currently connected to the NHSnet.  [65761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 My most recent information is that 1,040 GP Practices are now connected to the NHSnet. This represents 97 per cent. of all practices in Scotland. Of the remaining 34 practices, 4 practices did not ask to participate and the remainder will be linked by March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Within the context of their mental health strategies, all Health Boards in Scotland are determining and putting in place the appropriate levels of in-patient and community-based provision they require to meet assessed needs for child and adolescent psychiatric care.
<P>

<a name="90121w02.html_para0">The growth of community-based psychiatric services should help promote better access for young people in rural areas. But, inevitably, in-patient facilities will tend to be close to population centres. Health Boards covering rural areas should take account of this in developing their plans.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> There are no areas where the New Deal Gateway is delivered entirely by private sector providers although in ten Units of Delivery the New Deal is private sector led. These are: Leicester, Colchester, West Lancashire, Exeter and East Devon, South Humber, North Tyneside, Forth Valley, Hackney and City, Solihull and Bridgend. Client outcomes for these are shown in the table. These figures are GSS from January to October 1998 and provisional Management Information for November 1998.

 The Department's letter of 12 November 1998 to Chief Education Officers set out details of the new Standards Fund Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant. Subject to the receipt of good action plans, local education authorities will receive broadly the same allocations for the support of ethnic minority education in 1999-2000 as the Home Office provided under section 11 in 1998-99, including that element for adult education.
<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para0">The Department's letter also set out the arrangements whereby up to 15 per cent. of allocations, or &#163;150,000 whichever was the greater, might be held back to provide central services including adult education. This should be satisfactory for the vast majority of Authorities. However, my right hon.

 Information is not available in the form requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para2">It is assumed that, from the announced rates for April 1999, the Minimum Income Guarantee is uprated in line with the growth in average earnings (assumed to be 1.5 per cent. per year more than the growth in prices).
<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para3">Estimates are not available of the number of pensioners who would be receiving payments of state second pension in future years. Overall, estimates taken from the PENSIM model suggest that under the new insurance contract for pensions approximately 1 in 4 pensioner units (2.5 million) would receive income from the Minimum Income Guarantee in 2050, and a lower proportion in years after 2050.
<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para4">Projections forward to the year 2050 are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, given the number of assumptions in making them. Some of those who will be pensioners in 2050 have yet to begin work, and most are today in their 20s and 30s.

<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para6">Legislation to enable pensions to be shared at the time of divorce will be included in the forthcoming Welfare Reform Bill.
<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para7">The financial implications of pension sharing are uncertain, and will depend on the number of spouses who obtain a pension share and the percentage of pension which is transferred. Current estimates are based on the assumption that there could be from 35,000 to 65,000 cases per year, with a central assumption of 50,000. All estimates made are also dependent on a large number of other assumptions and should be considered illustrative.
<P>

<a name="90121w03.html_para8">It is expected that any impact on the minimum income guarantee will initially be small, as income support entitlement will not be altered until a pension share comes into payment. As most divorces take place before the age of 40, it is likely that, in most cases, there will be a significant time lapse between a pension share being made and income being received from the pension. Broad estimates of the impact 20 years after implementation suggest that, using the central assumption of 50,000 pension shares per year, pension sharing on divorce could lead to a saving on all income related benefits of around &#163;10 million (within a range of &#163;0--&#163;30 million using alternative assumptions).

 It is not appropriate to extend Direction 25 to include 16-18 year olds on youth training placements. Payments from the Discretionary Social Fund are made from a cash limited budget and available resources must be targeted on those most in need of help. Eligibility for Social Fund Community Care Grants is therefore restricted by Direction 25 to those entitled to Income Support or income based Jobseeker's Allowance.

Any such research will be carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board but the results, which would be subject to external peer review, would be unlikely to be available until the latter half of next year.

 The Millennium Festival is a partnership initiative between the Lottery Distribution bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the New Millennium Experience Company. It aims to give as many people as possible financial and other support for events and activities within their communities during 2000. Promotional and administrative support for the Festival is provided by NMEC's twelve country-wide offices. Staff in those offices are available to advise anyone who is interested in the Millennium Festival and I have today placed contact details in the Libraries of the House.

 Rating assessments under both the English Tourist Board's current crown scheme and the new harmonised accommodation rating scheme are made on the range of facilities and level of services appropriate to each type of accommodation and not specifically on their value for money. Under the new harmonised scheme for serviced accommodation in England, hotels are given a rating of 1 to 5 stars covering the whole visitor experience (e.g. quality, level of services and range of facilities) and guest accommodation is rated entirely on quality, using 1 to 5 diamonds. The ETB, the AA and the RAC are currently carrying out inspections against the new harmonised scheme, which will be launched to customers later this year.

The General Affairs Council will consider these matters further on 25 January. Following discussions in the Security Council on 14 January, the President of the Council reported that members had discussed the need to improve the humanitarian programme and looked forward to a full report from the UN Secretary General on how this might be achieved.
<P>

<a name="90121w07.html_para1">However, it is important that these issues are put into context. Saddam Hussein has proven time and again that he is not prepared to provide adequately for his people's welfare. He has refused shipments of humanitarian aid, prevaricated over distribution plans for the "oil for food" programme, smuggled oil illegally out of Iraq for his own benefit and tried to sell wheat and barley to other countries at low prices, while complaining that his people are starving. The UN Special Rapporteur holds Baghdad responsible for the precarious food and health situation in Iraq. We are determined to do what we can to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people in the face of such neglect by their leader.

 The consultation referred to ran from 13 August to 2 October 1998. Views were invited on proposed offices and employment whose holders would be disqualified from also being members of the National Assembly by means of an Order-in-Council under section 12 of the 1998 Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will place a copy in the Library of the letter from the Head of European Division concerning the recent appointment of the Chief Executive of the Wales European Centre.  [66878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No. The head of the European Division is not a member of the Board of the Wales European Centre but attends as an observer. He was unable to attend the meeting of the Board at which the appointment of a new director was under consideration. He therefore sent a letter on a personal and confidential basis to the Secretary of the Board of the Wales European Centre. It was made quite clear that it did not present a view on behalf of my Department. The letter did not express a view on the proposed appointment but (a) conveyed points that had been raised with us by certain members of the wider partnership and (b) set out a number of questions which he suggested should be considered by the Board in deciding 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1999 : Column: 550</I><P>
whether they should accept the recommendations of the appointments panel. I understand that each of these questions were fully considered by the Board in reaching a conclusion.
<P>

<a name="90121w10.html_para2">I am sure that my hon. Friend would be the first to criticise any official who failed to pass on pertinent views in this way or who failed to suggest questions to which such a Board should seek answers. That he did so strengthens the appointment procedure and public confidence that the Board sought to appoint the best person for the job, in the best interests of Wales.
<P>

<a name="90121w10.html_para3">The Wales European Centre is an independent body, headed by a Board which includes representatives of the partners who fund and support its work.
<P>

<a name="90121w10.html_para4">Neither I nor my officials will interfere with its work but I strongly support the Centre as a partner in promoting the people of Wales in Europe and for that reason I visited the Centre two weeks ago to discuss how best to cooperate and complement each other's work. I hope my hon. Friend and all Welsh members will join in this endeavour.

 We are aware that early identification and intervention is vital for normal language development, and age at identification and consequent age at which a hearing aid is fitted have become important indicators of screening and service performance.
<P>

<a name="90121w10.html_para5">Most health authorities screen children who are at risk of permanent hearing impairment soon after birth.

 A 1997 review commissioned by the health technology assessment programme suggested considering a system of universal neo-natal screening followed at seven months by a targeted screening using an infant distraction test.

Any proposed changes

<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Section 11 grant funds projects in education and in other service areas including social services and housing. Total provision in the current financial year is &#163;82.68 million. Projects with 118 local education authorities, as well as grant-maintained schools and colleges in the further education sector, cover a range of educational activity. Some local education authority projects principally concerned with other activities (eg English language support for school pupils whose first language is not English) include elements of adult education (eg family literacy work delivered through schools). Precise disaggregation of costs in such cases is difficult. The table lists local education authorities which have specific adult education projects; and shows, in relation to the 1998-99 financial year, the potential grant cost of these projects as a percentage of the total potential grant cost of the local education authority's section 11 projects. The potential grant cost of specific adult education projects in relation to the 1998-99 financial year represents 1.03 per cent. of the total potential grant cost of local education authorities' projects, and 0.95 per cent. of the total potential grant cost across the section 11 programme as a whole.

 One of the Government's top priorities is faster and more efficient youth justice proceedings. One of our key manifesto commitments is to halve the time it takes to deal with persistent young offenders from arrest to sentence. In 1996, the average time taken was 142 days--the objective is to reduce this to 71 days. In the Public Service Agreements for the Home Office and the Criminal Justice System, the Government are committed to achieving a national average of 71 days by March 2002.
<P>

<a name="90121w11.html_para9">A range of measures have been introduced aimed at reducing delay in the youth justice system. The Home Office has prepared comprehensive best practice guidance on a range of issues--particularly the establishment of fast-tracking schemes in local areas. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 includes a whole range of measures to tackle delays--strengthening the ability of the courts to manage cases, and making procedural changes to ensure that unnecessary delays are avoided--we have just implemented some of these measures; others are being piloted.
<P>

<a name="90121w11.html_para10">More specifically, the Government's plans for ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place for remanded juveniles are being taken forward in the context of the wider programme of work arising from its review of all forms of secure accommodation for young offenders and young people held on remand or under sentence. The Government's aim is to implement provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 as soon as practicable, and by June 1999 at the latest, to allow the courts to remand directly to local authority secure accommodation 12-14 year olds, 15 and 16 year old girls and, where a place has been identified in advance, vulnerable 15 and 16 year old boys. The existing arrangements for remanding other 15 and 16 year old boys to Prison Service accommodation will continue for the time being, though the Government wish to move to a position where the practice of prison remands is no longer necessary.
<P>

<a name="90121w11.html_para11">In the meantime, work is being taken forward, with the Youth Justice Board, to improve the standard of care and quality of regimes for remanded and sentenced juveniles held in Prison Service accommodation to ensure that these are appropriate to the needs of young people. The Government are also making available funds, which will be administered by the Youth Justice Board, to develop local bail support provision to help ensure that custodial remands are used appropriately for the most serious and persistent cases.

<a name="90121w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 There are currently 15 uniformed officers, 6 per cent. of the total, from ethnic minority communities employed at Feltham Young Offender Institution.

<a name="90121w11.html_para13">The Prison Service has recently been reviewing levels of representation from the ethnic minorities and the opportunities it provides for its own ethnic minority staff. As at 1 January 1999, the Prison Service employed 1,246 members of staff, 3 per cent. of the total from the ethnic minorities. Proposals for action are being developed which will include the launch of a new national recruitment outreach strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what provisions he has made for the conversion of prison accommodation to suit an elderly prison population;  [66441]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to authorise conversion of prisons or prison wings to cater for the needs of elderly inmates.  [66434]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Prison Service meets the demands of elderly prisoners in the light of their particular circumstances and the facilities already available at the particular establishment where they are housed. At present, inmates over the age of 50 are held within the general prison population according to their legal status, security requirement and geographical location. This enables inmates to receive regular visits from professional advisers and maintain ties with their families. It also helps the Probation Service in their work to resettle offenders back into the community.
<P>

<a name="90121w12.html_para0">Kingston prison, Portsmouth, has a unit for elderly life sentenced prisoners, which was created in recognition of the increasing number of these prisoners. The Prison Service is keeping the position under consideration.

<P>
<a name="90121w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 In its recent annual report, the Board of Visitors of Feltham Young Offenders Institution asked the Home Secretary to look closely at the arrangements for the recruitment of prison officers, which they feel exacerbate local staffing problems.
<P>

<a name="90121w12.html_para1">Job simulation assessment centres form part of the new approach to the recruitment of prison officers. They have been developed to provide fairer, more objective and more reliable assessments of candidates than the recruitment process which they replaced.
<P>

<a name="90121w12.html_para2">The Prison Service is aware, however, of the difficulties being experienced at Feltham and elsewhere in recruiting suitable prison officers and other grades of staff. It is therefore carrying out a short review in order to identify ways in which the situation can be improved.

 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) has a target of 15 working days for replying to letters from hon. Members. This includes correspondence addressed to Ministers and addressed to the Secretary of the IND Board, to which IND officials reply. In addition, the Whitehall Service Standards operated across Government under the auspices of the Service First Initiative means IND has a target of 20 working days for replying to correspondence from members of the public which does not specifically relate to individual applications.

 No determination has been made by English Partnerships as to their possible involvement in the generation or development of the Havering Riverside site (known as Rainham Marsh). The Havering Riverside site is entirely in the ownership of the London Borough of Havering and, being included within the Unitary Development Plan prepared in 1993 has been considered to be of strategic importance to employment generation within the Thames Gateway area. Any development must meet the requirements for nature conservation also set out in the UDP. English Partnerships is one of the partner organisations examining options for its possible development. English Partnerships supports the strategic

[65902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Following LB Havering's initial outline planning application for development in January 1997, English Partnerships submitted a further identical application in November 1997 in an attempt to deal with the issue of securing benefits for the developing through a Section 106 Agreement. Clearly the Borough cannot submit such an application to itself; to assist the local authority, English Partnership, although in no way committed to this project, therefore became the applicant. That application has now been withdrawn in response to improvements embodied in the London Borough of Havering's amended scheme. The Council is in consultation with both English Nature, English Heritage and other environmental groups, on the environmental implications of the application proposals. All parties are

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what powers English Partnerships possesses to <i>(a)</i> make and <i>(b)</i> support planning applications on land in respect of which he has not given directions or consent as to its suitability for <i>(a)</i> regeneration and <i>(b)</i> development;  [65904]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The powers of English Partnerships, contained in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 are directed at its main statutory objective of securing the regeneration of land, across England, which is contaminated, derelict, vacant, unused or likely to become so. In pursuit of this objective the Agency can acquire, hold, manage, reclaim, improve and dispose of land, plant machinery, equipment and other property; give financial assistance to other persons (including for use on environmental improvements); and generally do anything necessary or expedient for the purposes of its objects or for purposes incidental to those purposes. Section 167 of the Act provides for the Secretary of State to issue guidance or directions. Guidance was issued to English Partnerships in April 1994 on which land is suitable for regeneration or development or how it is to exercise its functions. No guidance or directions have been issued since that time, and no guidance, directions or consents have been issued with respect to Rainham Marshes. English Partnerships is free to make planning applications on the same basis as any other applicant.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will meet the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health to discuss its proposal that the Water Industry Act 1991 be amended to place a duty on water companies and OFWAT to operate in such a way as to protect public health and the environment.  [66556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government are deeply committed to protecting both the environment and public health. However, the Water Industry Act 1991 already places the Director General under a duty to consider the environment when formulating or considering any proposal relating to water companies' functions. In the context of the current review of utility regulation, we intend to strengthen this so that the Director General will be under a statutory duty to have regard to statutory guidance on social and environmental objectives in the exercise of his statutory functions.
<P>

<a name="90121w14.html_para0">The 1991 Act also places a number of duties on the water and sewerage undertakers, and the protection of public health is at the core of these duties. The Water Industry Bill will further protect public health by removing water companies' ability to disconnect people's homes in the event of non-bill payment. There are therefore already clear duties on both the Director General and the water companies to take account of public health and the environment. Apart from strengthening the duties on the Director General through the utility regulation review, I do not see a need for further duties.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what method is used by OFWAT to determine the adequacy of investment in the sewerage network by the water and sewerage companies; and if he will make a statement.  [66558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Ofwat's approach to assessing the adequacy of capital maintenance expenditure on the sewerage network is to consider trends in the serviceability of assets

to customers and to the environment and, if appropriate, allow for the expenditure levels to be adjusted at the next price review.
<P>

<a name="90121w14.html_para1">In "Raising the Quality" (September 1998) we published guidance to the Director General of Water Services which suggested that sewerage companies should take a strategic approach to the maintenance of their sewerage assets by, for example, developing an assessment system similar to the one already used for water supply.

<P>
<a name="90121w14.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the <i>(a)</i> costs to date and <i>(b)</i> projected costs to the public purse of work associated with the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, including (i) land purchase, (ii) legal costs and (iii) policing costs; and what contribution to these costs will be made by Midland Expressway Ltd.  [66414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w14.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1999]:</i> Under the Concession Agreement with Midland Expressway Limited (MEL) the costs and risks of constructing the Birmingham Northern Relief Road (BNRR) and its link roads fall to MEL, though certain non-works costs involved in promoting a private finance scheme fall to the Government.
<P>

<a name="90121w14.html_para12">The total cost to date of selecting the private sector promoter, negotiating the Concession Agreement and contributing to the statutory Order-making process is estimated at &#163;9.8 million, of which &#163;1 million is attributable to legal advice. Land acquisition and management costs are recoverable from the concessionaire. Policing costs are a matter for the Police Authority and the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="90121w14.html_para13">Projected costs to the public purse associated with the BNRR include a contribution towards the reconstruction of the existing M42 near Water Orton to enable its use by BNRR traffic. Under the concession agreement the major part of the cost of this work is to be met by MEL, but the Department is to contribute a share currently estimated at &#163;20 million. This takes into account that much of the traffic on that section will not use the BNRR.
<P>

<a name="90121w14.html_para14">Further costs to the public purse could result from any changes imposed by the Department to the requirements of the concession agreement, for example, changes 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1999 : Column: 567</I><P>
reflecting revised engineering standards. Any imposed changes which involve extra costs to the Concessionaire have to be paid for by the Secretary of State. The present estimate of the agreed changes is a maximum of &#163;1.5 million.
<P>

<a name="90121w14.html_para15">In addition to these costs, about &#163;11.4 million in the period until June 1991 was spent on the earlier proposals for a publicly financed Birmingham Northern Relief Road.

<P>
<a name="90121w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We are today publishing a consultation paper, "Best Value in Housing Framework", allowing until 16 April 1999 for comments. Best value is a central part of the Government's agenda for modernising local government. Its application to housing, as one of the key functions undertaken by local authorities, is therefore of prime importance. Under the provisions in Part I of the Local Government Bill, currently before Parliament, local authorities will have to set, in consultation with tenants and others, tough targets for their investment programmes and for the quality of their service delivery. They will be judged by their performance. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 11 June 1998 a new Housing Inspectorate, under the auspices of the Audit Commission, will be established which will monitor their performance.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1999 : Column: 568</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90121w15.html_para0">The consultation paper explains the framework within which local housing authorities will need to operate in obtaining best value in housing. It takes account of key housing issues such as the relationship between best value and the housing investment programme process; the role of tenants and residents; the read across to registered social landlords; and principles around the operation and establishment of the Housing Inspectorate. I have placed copies of the consultation paper in the Libraries of both Houses.

As mentioned in para. 1.7 of the White Paper, published estimates of the costs include the CBI's of &#163;15 billion per annum, and National Economic Research Associates' of &#163;7 billion per annum.

The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) considers these applications on a case by case basis and advises the Government on the likelihood that herbicide tolerant weeks will result from the release of the genetically modified plant.

 The White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport", contains a wide range of proposals to encourage more sustainable car use, many of which should help to reduce private mileage in company cars. More specifically, the Government are committed to increasing the taxation on free fuel provided by companies for private motoring annually by 20 per cent. above usual pump price increases over the next five years, to discourage its provision. The Inland Revenue is also continuing to review how the company car taxation regime, covering both business and private mileage, might be structured to send better environmental signals.

<a name="90121w16.html_para5">The progress made by the Darwin Advisory Committee since it was set up will be examined and the results of that examination and of the prior options study will inform a detailed review of the Darwin Advisory Committee's policy and financial management systems.

 Changes in a number of areas were prompted by concerns put forward from within the fishing industry. These included the introduction of fixed quota allocations, action to link the registration and licensing of fishing vessels to the declaration of maximum continuous or permanently derated engine power, restrictive licensing for scallop dredging and measures to assist the replacement or introduction of pelagic freezer trawlers. Additionally, changes were made to EU rules to increase the selectivity of fishing gear, to increase the minimum leading sizes of shellfish and to extend the quota system to additional species of fish in the North Sea.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A study of brain tissue from cattle slaughtered in the Over Thirty Months Scheme was started on 4 January 1999. The aim is to collect, by the end of March, samples from 4,000 animals. The brain samples will be tested for the presence of abnormal prion protein (PrPsc) by two or more of the recently developed diagnostic tests, and also studied by histopathology for evidence of vacuolation. In compliance with a recommendation from SEAC, the study is being confined, in so far as is possible, to animals 5 years of age or over. 5 years is the average incubation period of BSE and PrPsc has been detected in brain tissue only quite late in the BSE incubation period.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what methods are available to confirm the diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy using brain materials from slaughtered animals.  [66499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90121w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 At the moment, all diagnostic tests for BSE using brain tissue rely upon the infectious agent having reached the central nervous system. Current evidence indicates that this event occurs late in the incubation period, shortly before clinical onset. Any diagnostic test applied earlier in the incubation period is therefore likely to produce a negative result, even if the animal is infected. Once infectivity has reached the central nervous system, several diagnostic options are theoretically possible although none will be absolute. In other words, there may be some false negative results and interpretation of positive results is still open to question, given that some of the available tests have not been fully validated. The options available include mouse inoculation, which could take up to three years to give a result; histopathological examination of the brain stem; extraction of "scrapie-associated fibrils"; or one of a range of immunologically based tests for the detection of abnormal prion protein. None of the latter have been fully validated as yet.

 Farmers in England are being asked for their views on the implementation of proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. Over 175,000 questionnaires have been sent out to farmers in England, asking them to indicate, by placing a tick in the appropriate box, whether they agree or disagree with options. Equivalent consultation exercises are being undertaken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Although it would not be meaningful to place copies of all individual returned questionnaires in the Library, summaries and analyses of the returned questionnaires will be deposited in the Library at intervals.

In addition, the Presidency made it clear that the Council would discuss proposals on the annual CAP price fixing, animal welfare, consumer protection and organic livestock standards.
<P>

<a name="90121w17.html_para3">The Council resumed its discussions of the Agenda 2000 CAP reform proposals by conducting an in-depth debate on reform of the beef and milk sectors. On behalf of the UK, I supported the Commission's proposal to reduce prices and abolish intervention buying in the beef sector, though with appropriate arrangements to safeguard the systems of extensively-reared beef production which is characteristic of the UK. On reform of the milk sector, I pressed the case for a more thorough-going reform than that proposed by the Commission, referring specifically to the proposal made by the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy and Sweden for reform in this sector which would lead to the eventual abolition of milk quotas.

<a name="90121w17.html_para4">The German Presidency outlined a programme of work on the CAP aspects of Agenda 2000, leading up to the meeting of the Agriculture Council beginning on 22 February.

 The Government have no plans to amend section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, which effectively bars research into how a jury has conducted its deliberations. It is possible to conduct research into certain other aspects of the jury system without contravening the Contempt of Court Act. Any proposals received by the Government for such research are considered individually.
