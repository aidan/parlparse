To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what plans he has to implement a complete ban on MBM in animal feeds in the United Kingdom;  [141648]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to issue new regulations relating to animal feeds for all animal livestock in the United Kingdom.  [141649]<P></UL>

 My Department is considering the measures necessary to implement expeditiously the Decision taken by the Agriculture Council on 4 December relating to animal feed.

<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the effect on quota values of including heifers in the suckler cow quota.  [142255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The inclusion of heifers on suckler cow premium claims up to a maximum of 20 per cent. is only one of a number of factors contributing to the recent rise in lease and sale values of suckler cow premium quota. Its effects cannot be determined in isolation. Other relevant factors include:
<P>

<a name="01215w01.html_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the reduction in the overall availability of quota resulting from the Agenda 2000 settlement;
<P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01215w01.html_para3">Most farmers already have sufficient quota to support their claims; only a small percentage of the 1.7 million units of quota in the UK is traded each year.

<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in which scientific journals post mortem tests for BSE used in other EU countries have been subject to peer review; and if he will arrange for these papers to be placed in the Library.  [141717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> According to our information none of the post mortem tests for BSE used in the EU have been submitted to a peer reviewed journal. However, the EC has undertaken an independent evaluation of BSE diagnostic tests. Four tests were submitted last year and a report outlining the results of this evaluation was published in July 1999. I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Library. The EC recently announced that an evaluation of five new tests for BSE will begin shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps she took at the G8 meeting on December 6 to 8 to urge G8 Governments to support developing countries, in exercising their rights under the TRIPs agreement, to use compulsory licences to reduce the prices of drugs to treat HIV/AIDS and related infections; and if she will make a statement about the outcome of the meeting with regard to development issues.  [141559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 At the recent meeting in Japan, the UK Government, with other G8 Governments, reaffirmed our commitment to improved access and affordability of health services, commodities and information to developing countries. There was increased G8 political and financial commitment to improving availability and affordability of medicines, in particular for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, for developing countries.
<P>

<a name="01215w01.html_para4">There is a need to ensure increased access to affordable, effective drugs and vaccines. We also need to ensure research and development for new medicines for diseases of the poor in the future. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) provide an essential incentive for private investment in research and development. The WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Property Rights (TRIPs) sets out minimum standards for IPR. TRIPs allows compulsory licensing under certain circumstances but this needs to be used in exceptional circumstances, otherwise it would reduce the incentives for pharmaceutical company investment in research better to meet the needs of poor countries.
<P>

<a name="01215w01.html_para5">As indicated in my Government's new White Paper on Globalisation, the UK Government have commissioned urgent work to develop new proposals to improve access to existing medicines, and to tackle the lack of incentives for investment in research for future vaccines and treatments for HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB medicines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 1,155 parliamentary questions were tabled to my Department in the parliamentary year 1997-98, 1,140 in the parliamentary year 1998-99, and 1,280 in the parliamentary year 1999-2000.
<P>

<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 A single quinquennial review is to begin in February 2001 embracing these four Defence medical agencies and covering also medical arrangements for personnel in Germany and Northern Ireland and interrelationships between primary and secondary care.
<P>

<a name="01215w01.html_para7">The aim of the review is to make recommendations on the future means of delivery of the functions and services provided by the organisations which are the subject of this review. In doing this Phase 1 of the review, which is expected to be completed by the end of June 2001, will:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Identify organisational/structural options for future service provision and provide costed options for change where this is considered appropriate in order to ensure responsive, coherent and cost-effective service delivery.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01215w01.html_para10">Following consultation, Phase 2 of the review will then develop more detailed proposals for the targeting of improvements in performance and service delivery. The precise programme of work will be dependent on the findings of Phase 1, but it is currently expected that it will be completed by November 2001.
<P>

<a name="01215w01.html_para11">The review will be carried out by a small team of military officers and civilians within the MOD, but under the leadership of a senior health professional on loan from the Department of Health. The review will be overseen by a Steering Group chaired by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff.
<P>

<a name="01215w01.html_para12">There will be consultation with Stakeholders throughout this process, but the Ministry of Defence is also keen to hear the views of other interested parties including suggestions for improvement in the provision of services. Any comments, which should be sent by 30 April 2001, should be addressed to Rear Admiral C. D. Stanford, Chief of Staff to the Surgeon General, Room 7364, Ministry of Defence, Main Building, Whitehall, London SW1A 2HB (e-mail address: sgcos@surgeongeneral.co.uk).

<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Tucano recovery programme is proceeding to plan and full training capacity is expected to be available by the end of February 2001. Fifteen students are to complete their basic fast jet flying training in Australia with the Royal Australian Air Force, assisted by three RAF Qualified Flying Instructors. The first group of 10 students started flying training in Australia on 6 November and the arrangement is working well. The remaining five students will start their training on 29 January 2001.

 In March this year my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced plans to develop a brand new agency which will provide a single point of access for advice on looking for work and accessing benefits. The new agency will draw together the Employment Service and those parts of the Benefits Agency dealing with people of working age. This announcement effectively overtook the quinquennial review of the Employment Service which was planned to be undertaken this year in parallel with a review of the Benefits Agency. Following consultation, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Cabinet Office has formally agreed to cancel the requirement for a quinquennial review of the Employment Service. My right hon.

<P>
<a name="01215w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department is aware of the difficulties being experienced by bus operators in recruiting and retaining bus drivers in some areas. We have been in regular contact with the bus industry to consider the extent of this problem, which has also been a matter considered as part of the Department's research on trends in the industry.
<P>

<a name="01215w02.html_para1">The responsibility for ensuring that they have sufficient drivers is primarily a matter for individual bus companies. However, my Department and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and Driver Standards Agency (DSA) have been pursuing with the industry what steps can be taken to assist with the current problems. For example a pilot procedure has recently been introduced 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2000 : Column: 279W</I><P>
by DVLA with one nominated operator on a trial basis, with the aim of providing a high speed response to PSV driver licence applications.
<P>

<a name="01215w02.html_para2">In addition, I understand the Department for Education and Employment has provided &#163;145,000 to TRANSfED, the bus industry's National Training Organisation, to identify and address future skills needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A number of local authorities have bid for funding for home zones in the Local Transport Plan settlement. My Department is currently monitoring nine pilot home zone projects. However funding for home zones is not ring fenced and therefore comes out of the general local transport plans settlement announced yesterday, 14 December 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 202-03W, for the next five years.

<P>
<a name="01215w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Within its role as network operator the Highways Agency is resourced to meet its obligations under the Environment Act 1995.
<P>

<a name="01215w02.html_para3">Where local authorities decide to designate air quality management areas the Agency is ready to play its part in the preparation and implementation of local authorities' action plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has commissioned to assess the benefit of erecting physical barriers to disperse air pollution.  [141306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Physical barriers alongside roads are generally erected to reduce the noise impact on adjacent buildings or amenity areas. Noise radiates from a source and so can be effectively blocked by a solid barrier, screening locations behind it. In contrast, air pollution, over a period of time, will find its way over or around the barrier.
<P>

<a name="01215w02.html_para4">I understand that Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council are currently consulting on their stage 3 review and assessment of air pollution in their locality. If there are air pollution problems in the vicinity of a particular road, then the local authority will need to consider with the Highways Agency, where appropriate, the best means of reducing vehicle emissions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much of the money allocated for the national rail network in the 10-year transport plan will be spent on <i>(a)</i> new signalling, <i>(b)</i> station improvements and <i>(c)</i> new rolling stock; what schemes are planned; and what progress has been made with their implementation.  [141671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The 10-Year Plan for Transport includes &#163;15 billion of public rail investment over the 10 years 2001-02 to 2010-11. It is estimated that, over that period, a further &#163;34 billion of private investment can be levered in. The &#163;49 billion of total investment consists of <i>(a)</i> &#163;38 billion of enhancement and renewals investment for passenger services, <i>(b)</i> &#163;7 billion of investment in passenger rolling stock and <i>(c)</i> &#163;4 billion of investment in rail freight (including freight rolling stock).

 Expenditure data for each of the last six years for all these categories are not readily available.

Expenditure on park and ride schemes and priority bus routes is made via local transport settlements for which data are not available in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="01215w03.html_para0">Apart from level crossing grants of &#163;32 million and &#163;34 million in 1994-95 and 1995-96 respectively paid to Railtrack while it was still in the public sector, my Department has not spent any money directly on rail signal improvements or on the national rail network since 1 April 1994. Railtrack is responsible for maintaining, renewing and developing the national rail network, including signalling. Although my Department has made no payments direct to the company since it was privatised, its profitability is contingent on public money. Some 90 per cent. of Railtrack's income is paid to the company by train operating companies (TOCs) and freight operating companies (FOCs) in access charges, a substantial proportion of which are supported by public money.

<a name="01215w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The money allocated for strategic roads in the 10-year plan will allow the Highways Agency to complete the 41 schemes in its Targeted Programme of Improvements. Twenty of these schemes are bypasses, 12 are widening schemes, five are junction improvements and four are congestion schemes. All these schemes have been assessed using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) which includes measurement of their impact on safety and congestion levels. Taken together they will deliver significant journey time and safety benefits.
<P>

<a name="01215w03.html_para6">To ensure that it delivers these schemes, the Highways Agency has included 24 milestones for this year in its 2000-01 Business Plan. Following the provision of additional money in the 2000 Budget for accelerating scheme starts, 13 of these milestones are for award of contracts leading to start of construction works. Further milestones for 2001-02 will be published in the 2001-02 Business Plan.
<P>

<a name="01215w03.html_para7">Decisions about the use of the remainder of the money allocated for strategic roads will depend upon the outcome of the multi-modal studies and decisions taken in the context of Regional Planning Strategies. The Access to Hastings multi-modal study reported in December 2000 and we expect a further 12 multi-modal studies to be completed in 2001, with the remaining eight finished in 2003.

 Eight light rail schemes were specifically mentioned in paragraph 6.61 of Transport 2010: The Ten Year Plan. The current position on each of these projects is set out below. A number of proposals have also been made by other local authorities which are being developed for further consideration.

All pilots must be thoroughly evaluated and best practice identified for dissemination across the ambulance service before a final decision is made.

 National Health Service ambulance trusts have a good track record of managing winter pressures and assessment of NHS ambulance trusts' winter plans demonstrates that they are well prepared for the winter and have effective escalation and contingency plans in place.
<P>

<a name="01215w08.html_para0">We have set national ambulance response time targets for the ambulance service in England. By 31 March 2001, conditions which may be immediately life-threatening should be responded to within eight minutes irrespective of location in 75 per cent. of cases. Four NHS ambulance trusts are already meeting the 75 per cent. target and most NHS ambulance trusts are expected to reach the target early next year. We have invested an extra &#163;21 million in NHS ambulance trusts in England in 2000-01 to help them to continue making progress on their response times. This money has been invested in extra vehicles and extra front line staff. Evidence suggests that in achieving the 75 per cent. target, 1,800 lives each year will be saved in people under 75 years of age suffering acute heart attacks.

<a name="01215w09.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) sets the standard that all people with established cardiovascular disease or a past history of CHD should be identified and offered comprehensive advice and appropriate treatment to reduce their risks. Effective interventions include the prescription of statins and dietary advice to reduce the level of cholesterol.

<a name="01215w09.html_para4">At present the exact percentage of people with a history of CHD who are currently receiving statins is not known. However, the percentage of people in the priority groups for lipid-lowering drugs--those who have had a heart attack and those with angina--is estimated at 4.8 per cent. of the population aged 35 to 69. The NSF sets a milestone of April 2003 for primary care teams to keep clinical audit data which will enable them to provide data on the number and proportion of their patients with recognised CHD, or at high risk of developing it, and the advice offered about appropriate interventions to reduce risk.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to increase the capacity for detaining asylum seekers; what is the <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> planned capacity; what sites have been identified for new detention places; on what dates it is intended to open new detention facilities; and if he will make a statement.  [142632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We plan to increase the Immigration Detention estate from its current capacity of around 900 places to about 2,700 places. Work has already started to provide by next summer 900 places at the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (DERA) site near Bedford and 440 additional new places at Harmondsworth near Heathrow Airport. We are also finalising plans to deliver within the next six months up to a further 150 places at Dungavel Prison in Scotland. Our plans to provide 300 new detention places at Aldington, Kent, cannot be progressed as quickly because the public inquiry into the planning process has been adjourned pending the final outcome of litigation of another case before the courts in respect of a project at Alconbury.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if convictions for any of the offences created by <i>(a)</i> Schedule 2 and <i>(b)</i> Schedule 3 of the Hunting Bill would be disclosable on (i) the Criminal Conviction Certificate, (ii) the Criminal Record Certificate and (iii) the Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate.  [143003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 All three levels of certificate to be issued by the Criminal Records Bureau will show convictions and, in the case of the two highest levels of certificate, cautions, reprimands and warnings recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC). With certain exceptions, imprisonable offences only are recorded on the PNC. Since the offences in the Hunting Bill are not imprisonable, convictions would not presently be entered. An Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate (ECRC) would also contain information from local police records which the police considered relevant to the purpose for which the certificate was being sought. The purposes for which an ECRC may be relevant are set out in detail in sections 115 and 116 of the Police Act 1997. In the main, they relate to posts which involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children and young persons, or of vulnerable adults; to certain licensing matters in connection with gaming and lotteries; and to judicial appointments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what positions <i>(a)</i> in the judiciary, <i>(b)</i> in the police service and <i>(c)</i> elsewhere in the public service a person convicted of an offence created by (i) Schedule 2 and (ii) Schedule 3 of the Hunting Bill would be disqualified from holding either by statute or by policy because of such a conviction; and if he will make a statement.  [143023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There is no specific reference in the Hunting Bill to these posts. A criminal conviction per se would not disqualify a member of the judiciary from continuing to hold his or her office, nor would it preclude an appointment to the judiciary. It would be for the Lord Chancellor to consider in the light of the particular circumstances what action, if any, it would be appropriate to take in the event of such a conviction.
<P>

<a name="01215w10.html_para0">It is for individual chief officers of police to consider the disciplinary action to be taken as the result of a police officer's criminal conviction on a case by case basis. The level of disciplinary action taken against an officer can range from a caution to a dismissal. Similarly, it is for individual chief officers to decide whether a particular conviction should be a bar to the recruitment of an applicant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The proceeds of forfeiture orders made under the Hunting Bill will be treated as proceeds under existing forfeiture orders. The regulations governing this are the Police (Property) Regulations 1997. These require the proceeds of sales of forfeited property to be paid into the Police Property Act Fund. Money in the fund, including the interest on it, may be used to defray the costs of storage and handling such property, to pay reasonable compensation to persons by whom the property has been delivered, or for charitable purposes.

<P>
<a name="01215w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have no reason to believe that those who engage in hunting are not law-abiding members of the community. There should not therefore be increased levels of crime as a consequence of any of the options.
<P>

<a name="01215w10.html_para2">My officials have consulted the Association of Chief Officers of Police (ACPO) about the Bill. ACPO does not believe that any of the options will place demands on resources that will be significantly greater than those that police forces already face in policing anti-hunt activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The criteria to be applied to a mammal to define if it is wild are the definition of "wild mammal" contained in each schedule to the Bill and the ordinary and natural meaning of the word 'wild' in accord with the usual rules of judicial interpretation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes <i>(a)</i> have been made since May 1997 and <i>(b)</i> are planned to police pay and allowances; and if he will make a statement.  [142600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) makes recommendations to me on all matters concerning police pay and allowances. The major allowances for police officers are: housing emoluments, London Weighting and London Allowance, and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) allowance.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para0">Following the recommendation of the PNB, I have increased police pay in September each year since May 1997. The current pay scales for police officers are set out in the table.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para1">Housing emoluments have not increased during this period. London weighting has been increased each year since May 1997 and is now &#163;1,713. London allowance was frozen in 1981 and remained at &#163;1,011 until July 2000 when the London allowance of officers in the Metropolitan police service and City of London police who joined on or after 1 September 1994 and receive no housing allowance was increased by &#163;3,327 to &#163;4,338. The RUC allowance has increased annually and is now &#163;2,349.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para2">The PNB is currently looking at whether there should be an allowance for officers in any other forces and I await any recommendation it may make on this or any other issues in relation to police pay and allowances.

<a name="01215w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the planned expenditure on <i>(a)</i> new prisons and <i>(b)</i> prison places in (i) the current financial year and (ii) in each of the next two years; what proportion of expenditure is required for (A) reducing

<P>
<a name="01215w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 One new prison is expected to open at Rye Hill, Rugby in January 2001. A further new prison, Dovegate in Staffordshire is scheduled to open in July 



<P>

2001. These prisons are provided under the Private Finance Initiative. The costs in this current financial year are &#163;2 million, &#163;31 million in 2001-02 and &#163;39 million in 2002-03.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para3">Additional funding has been provided for a programme to increase prison capacity by 2,660 places by 2003-04 to meet the projected increase in prison population. No new prisons are planned using this funding. A mix of options is being considered to provide these places including rationalising existing accommodation, building new houseblocks, erecting new ready to use units (RTUs) and extending safe overcrowding. The expenditure on the programme in this current financial year is expected to be &#163;22 million, &#163;125 million in 2001-02 and an estimated &#163;97 million in 2002-03. There are no specific plans to reduce overcrowding.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made <i>(a)</i> on implementing the proposals on modernising the management of the Prison Service in the Laming report and <i>(b)</i> on producing an agreed set of standards for service level agreements between the Prison Service and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons; and if he will make a statement.  [142612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Good progress has been made. Recommendations 1-3 of Lord Laming's report relate to the management of the Prison Service. The principle of filling governor posts as quickly as possible has been fully accepted and, whenever it is possible to predict vacancies, successors will be identified at the earliest stage to avoid gaps. However it is not always possible to predict vacancies caused by unforeseen events such as resignation or ill health. A database containing the personal details and career experiences of operational governors is being created to provide appropriate information for succession planning and career development. The first "Suitable to be in Charge" job simulation centre was concluded on 28 September 2000. This has provided a pool of accredited governors who have been through rigorous selection procedures and will be available to fill anticipated in-charge vacancies during the next year.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para4">New first line manager training (including managing poor performance) is to be introduced in April 2001, and a new performance management system is being introduced in April 2002. The Service is working up a comprehensive package of measures to tackle poor attendance, including piloting the use of vaccinations against flu and a bonus scheme for staff with good attendance. I am monitoring the Service's performance closely. Further measures are under consideration. A major review of training is under way and is developing a new approach to leadership and management development.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para5">Lord Laming recommended separately that Service Delivery Agreements (SDAs) should be introduced for all prisons. SDAs are being piloted this financial year and the Service will move to three-year SDAs for all establishments from April 2001. He also recommended that the Prison Service and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons should work to produce an agreed set of standards against which the performance of prisons should be evaluated. Work is in hand to develop such a set of standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the use of sentence planning in the Prison Service.  [142614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01215w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Sentence planning applies to all adult prisoners sentenced to 12 months and over with at least six months left to serve, and all young offenders with at least four weeks left to serve. Life sentenced prisoners and juveniles (under 18s) have their own sentence planning system.
<P>

<a name="01215w11.html_para6">Sentence planning is used to help prepare prisoners for safe release and to make best use of the prisoner's time. It does this by encouraging them to address the reasons for their offending behaviour and by giving planned experience of work, training and education.
