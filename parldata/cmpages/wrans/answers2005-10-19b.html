 Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, digestive and/or nervous system of many species of birds. The general symptoms may include loss of appetite, diarrhoea, generalised weakness, swelling of the face and legs, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, blue discolouration of the skin or membranes, a drop in egg production, sneezing, coughing and laboured respiration. In disease caused by highly virulent types of virus, there may be no warning signs, with birds either being found dead or dying suddenly. The presenting clinical signs in different domestic species are influenced by husbandry conditions (e.g. whether birds are housed or not) and by the presence of intercurrent bacterial or other viral diseases.

 The Government encourage all local authorities to have in place a strategy for managing their municipal waste. However, it is for individual local authorities and not DEFRA to decide on the strategy that best suits their needs relating to waste and the particular waste management options (which may include generating energy from waste) employed within that strategy.

 The outbreak of Newcastle Disease in pheasants in Surrey in July 2005 was dealt with according to the published Defra Contingency Plan. A national disease control centre was established in London and a local disease control centre was set up in Reigate to manage the local response. The control policy was implemented quickly, the birds on the infected premises were culled, movement restrictions were imposed to limit the risk of disease spread and surveillance was carried out in the local area to detect any signs of disease. The outbreak was limited to one premises.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has asked chief officers and police authorities to submit proposals for restructuring by the end of the year.

He has also emphasised that he fully endorses HM inspectorate of constabulary&#039;s conclusion that the creation of strategic forces offers the best business solution.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research her Department has commissioned into employment rates of graduates; and if she will make a statement.  [15498]</p>




<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51019w16.html_spnew7"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Graduates have very high employment rates, reflecting the economy&#039;s strong demand for these higher level skills that are developed through participation in higher education. Graduates are significantly more likely than non-graduates to be in work, as well as enjoying greater pay and wider benefits like better health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51019w16.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_32">Data from the Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey measures first degree graduate activity at a point six months after graduation. The most recent information, covering students who graduated in 2003/04, shows that 64 per cent. were in employment, 15 per cent. were undertaking further study, 9 per cent. were combining work with further study, and just 7 per cent. were unemployed. The remainder were not available for employment for various reasons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51019w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_33">The survey data also shows early indication that students who have studied shorter, more vocationally oriented courses such as Foundation Degrees are less likely to be unemployed than other graduates. This is very encouraging as most of the future growth in student numbers will come through these courses. The data on Foundation Degree graduates show: 36 per cent. were in employment, 33 per cent. were in further study, 26 per cent. were in employment and study, and 3 per cent. were unemployed, six months after leaving their course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51019w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_34">However, the main drawback of using the DLHE survey is that it is only a snapshot of the activity of graduates six months after graduation, which is not necessarily representative of their long-term employability. A study of the early careers of a sample of 1995 graduates shows employment rates rising rapidly in the months and years shortly following graduation, as the new graduates integrate into the labour market. By seven years after graduation, the overwhelming majority of graduates are in paid work or study, while just 1&#150;2 per cent. of graduates remain unemployed <sup>1</sup> .
</p>


<p>
<a name="51019w16.html_para6">

 We have been clear about our priorities for public funding of a place in school, college or an apprenticeship for all young people, and a focus on adults without a solid foundation of employability skills. Prioritising public funding and ensuring adults can gain a Skills for Life or first full Level 2 qualification inevitably means less public funding being available for lower priority or non-qualification bearing provision.

LSDA&#039;s report suggested complete closure of the gap would cost around &#163;200 million. It also noted that the means of closing the gap should not be a large general increase in FE funding rates, but policy changes aimed at putting FE colleges and school sixth forms on a more equal footing. In light of this we are exploring the scope for addressing technical anomalies between school sixth form and further education systems and will be announcing decisions on the way forward shortly.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51019w20.html_spnew2"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The Government believes that current fixed opening hours encourage binge drinking before last orders and create flashpoints for conflict through late night queuing for transport and fast food. In addition, the current system only allows pubs, bars and clubs to have extended house if they provide music and dancing. This means that the late night economy is dominated by activities that carry greater risk of nuisance and are aimed primarily at the younger market. We anticipate that the Licensing Act 2003, which takes effect from 24 November, will enable a greater variety of premises to adopt flexible hours and also encourage a safer, more orderly and gradual dispersal of customers. The Act also provides the police with a raft of new powers for tackling disorderly and criminal behaviour and grants responsible authorities and interested parties, such as local residents, the right to challenge a licence application or to ask for a review of an existing licence. Recent feedback from local authorities confirms that local residents are already taking full advantage of their new rights. My Department will closely monitor and evaluate the impact of the Act on crime and disorder to ensure that the Act delivers on our promise to provide a more civilised late night society.

 Energy use and waste disposal and recycling related to the Parliamentary Estate are monitored monthly and trends are plotted in a monthly management report by the Serjeant at Arms. Energy efficiency is more complex to assess due to the difficulty of benchmarking similar buildings to the Palace of Westminster, a vast listed building used for long periods in the day: figures available do however demonstrate that energy consumption per square metre of floor area has reduced in recent years. An independent environmental survey of the parliamentary estate was completed by Urban Mines Ltd. last year, and a copy of the report was placed in the House of Commons Library.

<sup>(28)</sup> For the years 1997&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 291, 303, 305.0, 425.5, 571, E860. For the years from 2001 onwards the cause of deaths was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes F10, 142.6, K70, K73, K74, X45.<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

 As part of the wide range of VAT reliefs for charities, charities providing rescue or first aid services can purchase VAT free the specialised telecommunications, aural, visual, light enhancing or heat detecting equipment which they use.

In addition, charities like the RNLI which provide rescue or assistance at sea, do not pay VAT on the purchase of lifeboats and certain related equipment, or on the costs of having these lifeboats repaired or maintained.

In 2004, on the basis of a comprehensive review of the existing body of research to date, the HPA-RPD (previously the National Radiological Protection Board) recommended the adoption of new EMF exposure guidelines in this country. In addition, in view of the scientific uncertainties, the HPA recommended the Government &quot;consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency electromagnetic fields. They have also noted that the majority of elevated magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines.
