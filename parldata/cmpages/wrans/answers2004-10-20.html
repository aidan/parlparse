<a name="41020w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Parliamentary Questions (Agency Letters)</h3>


<p><a name="41020w01.html_wqn0"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 To ask the Leader of the House from which Government agencies letters in response to Parliamentary Questions are <i>(a)</i> published in <i>Hansard </i>and <i>(b)</i> placed in the Library; and what criteria are applied in deciding which answering mechanism should be used.  [190581]</p>




<p><a name="41020w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The responsibility for deciding answering mechanisms for all Parliamentary Questions rests with individual Ministers. Where a written Parliamentary Question is about a matter assigned to an Executive Agency under the terms of its Framework Documents, Ministers normally ask the Chief Executive to provide a substantive response to hon. Members. The text of the Chief Executive&#039;s letter is reproduced in the <i>Official Report</i> under the Minister&#039;s formal reply that he or she has commissioned such a response. Copies are also placed in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w01.html_para0">
Where a letter is confidential (for example, if it contains personal information about a constituent), or where it is excessive in length, the <i>Official Report</i> will make a decision on whether to print the letter or to place it in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w01.html_para1">
I would also like to refer the hon. Member to my Written Ministerial Statement of 21 July 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 35WS, on the new policy for handling &quot;I will write&quot; replies.

<p><a name="41020w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 To ask the Leader of the House what progress he has made in his assessment of options for representation of minority parties on departmental select committees; and if he will make a statement.  [192219]</p>




<p><a name="41020w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am aware that the minority parties have concerns about their representation on the departmental Select Committees, but believe that it would be inappropriate to seek to address these at this stage in the Parliament. Meanwhile, the Government are ensuring that the interests of the minority parties are accommodated in the nomination of Standing Committees and ad hoc Joint Committees.

<p><a name="41020w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what progress he has made in reducing the impact of traffic signs and street furniture in areas of high environmental value; and if he will make a statement.  [191144]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 682W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41020w01.html_spnew2"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The management of traffic signs and street furniture is mainly the responsibility of local authorities. The Department for Transport recognises that over-provision or poor design of signs can have an adverse effect on the street scene. Our published advice on the design and use of traffic signs is intended to help local authorities provide adequate information for road users while avoiding sign clutter and other adverse environmental impacts. In particular, Chapter 4 of the Traffic Signs Manual (TSM), published in June 2004, stresses the importance of using warning signs sparingly, not cluttering signposts with more information than drivers can assimilate, not using yellow backing boards unnecessarily, and removing signs when they are no longer needed. Chapter 7 of TSM gives advice on sign layouts to avoid wasted space and reduce the overall size of signs. The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges includes advice on limiting the number of destinations shown on directional signs to minimise environmental intrusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w01.html_para2">
The Department is also working with English Heritage to develop regional street design manuals, primarily for conservation areas, which are expected to be published later this year.

<p><a name="41020w01.html_spnew4"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 NATS has a close working relationship with the Ministry of Defence at Boscombe Down and the two organisations communicate on a daily basis. NATS is not aware of any incidents within airspace operated by Boscombe Down in the past year.

The figures for 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07 reflect different scenarios concerning the trend for customers to make their own travel arrangements rather than buy traditional package holidays. The Government are assessing the advice provided by the CAA on options for financial protection of air travellers. Officials are working closely with the CAA and the aviation industry to improve information on financial protection and advice on travel insurance to those booking flights via the internet and call centres. British embassies, high commissions and consulates are able to provide consular advice and assistance to UK citizens who find themselves in difficulties while abroad.

Although there is some variation the overall trend is 2.2 per cent. down. The 3.8 per cent. increase in 2003&#150;04 for energy use in the Department&#039;s headquarters building, Great Minster House, was primarily due to a rise in electricity consumption in the summer of 2003 for additional air conditioning to cope with the high temperatures during the period. It was necessary to provide comfortable working conditions for staff and protecting heat sensitive plant and equipment. Other increases were largely the result of better collection of data from additional sites (DVLA), the acquisition of additional accommodation (MAIB) and significant energy consuming refurbishment works outside normal working hours (MCA).
</p>


<p>

 The Secretary of State announced on 20 July 2004 that the current proposal for the proposed tram system in Leeds can no longer be approved, on the basis of cost escalation.

The public sector contribution was capped at &#163;355 million (present value), however the estimated costs increased to more than &#163;500 million.

 On the 30 September 2004 the northbound carriageway of the M1, between Junctions 24A and 25, was closed and the hard shoulder opened to traffic to enable essential maintenance works to be carried out to the River Trent bridge. The work required was extensive and took place from 27 September for five nights between the hours of 2200 and 0500, in order to avoid peak periods and minimise disruption to road users.

The bidding process is often iterative&#151;involving detailed project development between the Strategic Rail Authority and the project sponsors&#151;and it would therefore be difficult to be consistent about the exact date on which the submission of the scheme was formalised. Similarly it is difficult to provide final cost estimates for schemes as this would only be quantifiable when a project had reached the contractualisation stage.

<p><a name="41020w04.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 October 2004]:</i> Over &#163;1.5 million has been spent on research and development relating to fish-eating birds since the mid 1990s, covering population estimates, bird movements, feeding behaviour, impact studies and management techniques.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w04.html_para1">
The earlier research has contributed significantly to our understanding of the problem of fish-eating birds at inland fisheries and potential methods of resolving such conflicts. This research has demonstrated that cormorant conflicts at fisheries are site specific and this forms the basis for both the previous and new licensing strategies.

<p>
<a name="41020w04.html_para2">
The Department is continuing to research the potential of fish refuges. However, like all management tools&#151;refuges have some limitations and it is unlikely that they will be the answer to all cormorant predation problems.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cormorants will be licensed to be killed each of the first five years under the amendments to the licensing system for the control of the cormorant population announced by the Parliamentary Secretary for Nature Conservation and Fisheries on 16 September; what procedure will be used to judge what alternatives are available to the culling of cormorants; and what evidence will be used to authorise the culling of cormorants where damage to fish stocks has not occurred but is likely to occur.  [191472]</p>




<p><a name="41020w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 October 2004]:</i> The number of cormorants licensed to be killed will depend on the number of applications received. The objective of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 696W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the new licensing policy is not to reduce the cormorant population but to reduce damage caused by cormorants while protecting the conservation status of the cormorant population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para1">
Reports available on the Defra website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/Reports.htm have explored the limits within which the licensing system may operate without risking the conservation status of the cormorant population. They do not recommend levels of population reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para2">
These reports predict that restricting the maximum number of birds killed in the long-term to below 2,000 per annum would, at most, suppress the population to a level lower than currently observed, but that this would be stable and unlikely to lead to long-term declines. The full effects of such a policy would take around five years to be fully apparent. Raising this figure in the first two years of a new policy would have little effect on long-term cormorant numbers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para3">
The intention is to review the maximum permissible number of licences on an annual basis, based on monitoring of licence numbers and the cormorant population. This will ensure that the maximum number of licences issued does not lead to unexpected or serious reductions in cormorant numbers beyond those predicted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para4">
The licensed removal of cormorants will only be considered where the applicant can demonstrate that they have considered alternative management measures and, where appropriate, have tested them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para5">
They will need to provide information on deterrents and measures currently being used to protect the stock (e.g. scaring devices, proofing) and methods tried and found to be ineffective or which are impracticable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para6">
The applicant will also need to demonstrate that significant numbers of cormorants are present at a site, that these are actively feeding and not just loafing or roosting at a site and that the site contains a resource at risk of significant damage by them. If the applicant can demonstrate these points, the new licensing system will presume that serious damage is occurring or there is a risk of serious damage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w05.html_para7">
Where a site has recent past evidence that cormorant damage is likely to occur, for example, where they have previously been issued with a licence to remove cormorants to aid scaring under the previous system, their licence applications will be considered and assessed on the basis of protecting the site against the risk of cormorant numbers returning to the level that justified the previous licence.

The Skills Strategy is a cross-Government strategy, and not just a DfES one. A national Skills Alliance has been formed, bringing together the key Government Departments (DfES, DTI, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Treasury) with employer and union representatives in a new partnership, and linking the key delivery agencies in a concerted drive to raise skills. My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry jointly chair the Skills Alliance Social and Economic Partners Group which brings Government together with CBI, TUC and Small Business Council to drive forward delivery of the Skills Strategy. A key element of this delivery agenda is a joint strategy for engaging with industry sectors across DTI and DfES. This includes the joint sponsorship of the Skills for Business Network of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), to ensure that the network is the vehicle for both Departments to use in pursuing the sector skills agenda together. It will give a coherent employer voice into government and a coherent response back out again. For the first time the Skills Alliance brings together these key partners in terms of the customers of the skills and training systems&#151;employers and employees&#151;and all the key delivery agents.

The Skills Strategy is about improving the technological and skills base of our industry, and thereby supporting business success, employment and prosperity.

SSCs will work to increase opportunities to boost the skills and productivity of everyone in the sector&#039;s work force, including taking action on equal opportunities.

Since then, dialogue has continued at official level and has included a workshop with FSS trade union representatives to discuss the results of the Outline Business Case. More recently, I took the opportunity to meet with trade union and staff representatives during the course of a series of visits to FSS sites.

<i>[holding answer 16 September 2004]:</i> I meet regularly with the Justice Unions Parliamentary Group and have made it clear that the Government is committed to ongoing consultation and wants the implementation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) to be an inclusive process. I have had a number of additional meetings with trade unions, during which NOMS has been discussed. I have also attended the annual conference of the Prison Officers Association and the National Association of Probation Officers.

<p>
<a name="41020w14.html_para1">
While the trade unions will continue to negotiate and seek resolution to any dispute with their employing body, the Chief Executive of NOMS has indicated that he is happy to discuss with the recognised trade unions any NOMS related issues which fall outside existing arrangements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w14.html_para2">
Additionally, a Joint Consultative Council (JCC) has been proposed to the trade unions to enable them to meet Employers&#039; side representatives together with senior NOMS officials to discuss matters of common interest which relate to NOMS. The JCC is not a vehicle for negotiation or collective bargaining and will not replace or supersede existing agreements or arrangements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many of the responses to the consultation document &quot;Reducing Crime&#151;Changing Lives&quot; favoured a regional model for the National Offender Management Service.  [188537]</p>




<p><a name="41020w14.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Over 400 responses were received to the two written consultation exercises undertaken so far in respect of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). Over 100 of these responses commented on the regional structure which was the subject of the second consultation exercise. The majority of responses from both exercises indicated support for the new service and the concept of end-to-end offender management. However, after consideration of the responses, which specifically refereed to the regional model, I announced to the House on 20 July 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 17WS, that I have decided that the option of moving immediately to create new regional boards is unlikely at this stage to deliver better management of offenders which is my main objective.

<a name="41020w14.html_para3">
More detail of the helpful responses received to this and other issues can be read in our summary of responses to the two exercises, which will be published shortly and which will be placed in the Library of both Houses. At the same time it will be available to staff and other key stakeholders through the prisons, probation and Home Office websites.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much has been paid out in compensation in respect of injuries sustained during staff training sessions in physical restraint techniques at each of the secure training centres in the last five years.  [190223]</p>




<p><a name="41020w15.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Secure Training Centres are operated by private companies under contracts managed by the Youth Justice Board. Consequently, neither the Home Office nor the Youth Justice Board has direct responsibility for dealing with compensation claims by staff members. The operating companies have told us that they have not paid any compensation in respect of injuries sustained in the course of training in physical restraint techniques over the last five years.

<p><a name="41020w15.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 One of the factors the Sentencing Guidelines Council has to take into account when producing guidelines is cost-effectiveness. This will apply to all courts, in respect of all criminal offences and will lead to greater consistency of sentencing. The Government have made it clear the prison should only be used for the most serious, dangerous and persistent offenders, and that most others are better punished in the community.

[192555]</p>




<p><a name="41020w15.html_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The specifications for reliability of speed cameras are set out in the Speedmeter Handbook, which is published by the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB). The requirements for safety, in terms of flash output, are assessed in each individual case by initially requiring the manufacturer to demonstrate that equipment submitted is safe for use at the roadside, by providing evidence, or that the flash output and filters used are similar to that which has been demonstrated as safe, as determined by independent University studies. After this is completed to PSDB&#039;s satisfaction, the police also give their view as to safety during testing at the roadside. Other sources of flash while driving at night include vehicle headlamps and the warning lights and beacons of various types of road vehicles.

 With the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003, responsibility for liquor licensing in England and Wales will transfer from the licensing justices to licensing authorities, which are almost all local authorities. The transitional period will begin on 7 February 2005 and we expect it to be completed in November 2005.

The difference between the allocation up until 1998&#150;99 and that of 1999&#150;2000 and subsequent years is explained by a machinery of Government transfer from the Department for International Development (DfID), when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office took over DFID&#039;s grant in aid responsibility to the British Council.

 The Government believe that, as a friend of Israel and the Palestinians, we can best exert influence and encourage both sides to take the steps needed for progress through close engagement. However, both sides have so far failed to meet their Roadmap obligations. We do not believe that sanctions against one of the Parties, such as suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, would help bring Israel and the Palestinians nearer to a just and lasting negotiated settlement. We do not therefore intend to call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement in response to the International Court of Justice ruling of 6 July.

1. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

2. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

3. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant health authorities for both years, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts for 2003&#150;04.<br>

2. The total NHS expenditure cannot be identified by health authority area because the majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The 



majority of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

3. Figures for 1997&#150;98 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2003&#150;04 based on strategic health authority areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

 In March 2004, the Government&#039;s independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised that risperidone and olanzapine should not be used in the treatment of behavioural symptoms of dementia because of an increased risk of stroke. The high absolute risk of stroke associated with these products was considered to outweigh any benefits in treatment of behavioural symptoms of dementia. The advice was issued after careful consideration of all available data, possible clinical implications and advice from an expert working group, which included expertise in the management of behavioural problems in older patients with dementia.

The roll-out of core national applications will continue to come from this earmarked sum. Individual general practitioner practices will receive funding to upgrade to NPfIT systems through their primary care trusts (PCTs). In addition, the NPfIT will cover the cost of suppliers developing training material, including e-training services, and training the trainers in the use of new IT services. In all, over &#163;6 billion worth of contracts are now in place covering the whole lifetime of the NPfIT.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 798W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41020w34.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) aims to ensure that new systems integrate and interoperate with existing systems, and is providing the testing environment for existing systems suppliers to achieve compliance and integration with NPfIT systems. In most cases, existing electronic patient records will be able to interface with NPfIT systems and the nationally available national health service care records service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w34.html_para2">
The migration of data is not a novel process and occurs at local level every time there is a refresh or upgrade of existing systems. Standard IT protocols allow for data to be recovered if problems are encountered during transfer to ensure that data is not lost, and the NPflTs contracts with its suppliers require data back-ups to be taken regularly.
</p>





<p><a name="41020w34.html_wqn4"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advantages the National Programme for IT has that the current system is not providing.  [190171]</p>




<p><a name="41020w34.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Prior to the National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT), individual general practitioner practices or primary care trusts were able to procure IT support to their own specification and contractual arrangements This has resulted in a fragmented and disparate approach to specification, standards, interoperability, system availability and performance. A number of general practice surgeries and hospitals have some form of electronic patient record, some of which can share information within the practice or hospital. However, because of the wide variety of systems in use, information cannot easily be shared outside the location in which it originates. This inhibits the sharing of patient information and the development and implementation of care pathways. But many organisations are still largely paper-based, which creates a serious obstacle to the modernisation of care, including delivery of national service frameworks. The NPfIT will address this by creating a nationwide electronic system, allowing the transfer of patient records and images, electronic prescribing and the online booking of hospital appointments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w34.html_para3">
The NPfIT is providing powerful IT solutions to improve capacity and performance and deliver key national health service priorities. There are four key deliverables: electronic appointment booking, an integrated care records service, electronic prescribing and an underpinning IT infrastructure with sufficient connectivity and broadband capacity to support the critical national applications and local systems. Additional functions will include GP to GP messaging, which will cut the time needed to find essential information, notes and test results, instantaneous digital picture archiving, and clinical decision support tools. The result will be to relieve doctors of unnecessary administrative burdens, and free up their time to do what they do best&#151;deliver better, faster and safer care to more patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w34.html_para4">
However, the key focus of benefits from implementing NPfIT is on patients. For example, electronic booking of hospital appointments will bring patient choice and convenience as well as reducing non-attendance, which costs the NHS millions of pounds each year. Electronic storage and transmission of patient images will reduce the need for repeat X-rays 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 799W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and will reduce diagnostic waiting times. As a result, patients will experience a modern, IT-enabled NHS when they come into contact with the service.

<p><a name="41020w34.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Many of the components which the National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) will deliver across the national health service are already in use at a local level and many of the technologies are already well proven. There have also been a number of pilot projects to examine the operation of electronic booking which has been in existence in England in this form since 2002. These have demonstrated that where patients participate in the booking of their appointments and admissions, they are far more likely to attend. Electronic patient records and electronic prescribing are examples of existing systems already in use at a local level and the NPfIT has received feedback on the advantages of these systems from clinicians, managers and administrators.

[187116]</p>




<p><a name="41020w35.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national health service is expected to take full account of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. Clinicians have to make an independent clinical judgment, taking due account of NICE&#039;s advice and the strength of evidence which lies behind it. They may depart from the advice if, in their view, the circumstances of the individual patient justify doing so. But they will be held accountable, through clinical governance arrangements, for their clinical decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w35.html_para0">
When considering the funding of any treatment currently being appraised by NICE, or where no appraisal has been commissioned, funding authorities are expected to use their existing local arrangements and consider the evidence available to them on the clinical effectiveness of the treatment.

<p><a name="41020w35.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national health service has no contracts for orthotic footwear, but rather two national framework agreements. This allows the NHS the flexibility to purchase the best orthotic footwear without guarantees to any one supplier.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w35.html_para2">
The two agreements for orthotic footwear are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">for custom made orthoses, which covers made to measure footwear.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">for stock and modular footwear, which covers a range of manufacturers and designs for off-the-shelf shoes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w35.html_para3">
In addition, trusts may have their own local agreements for stock and modular footwear. However, the majority of the English NHS trusts have adopted the schedule numbers for custom-made orthotic footwear.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health when the NHS design specification for orthotic footwear was last updated.  [190896]</p>




<p><a name="41020w35.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The basic national health service design specification has been in place for a number of years and initially gave suppliers guidelines on the manufacture of patient appliances, including orthotic footwear. These guidelines were accompanied by generic schedule numbers/codes for each part of the manufacturing process and provided a standard structure for manufacture and costing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w35.html_para4">
The principle behind these schedule numbers still remains for the national framework agreement for orthoses but, over the years, the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency has worked in partnership with industry, clinicians and trusts to update these codes to ensure they reflect current practise.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans he has to introduce residential-only parking areas in Northern Ireland.  [192545]</p>




<p><a name="41020w39.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w39.html_para1">
<i>Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Roy Beggs, dated 20 October 2004:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what plans he has to introduce residents&#039; only parking areas in Northern Ireland. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As you may be aware, the Department took the necessary primary legislative power in the Road Traffic Regulation (NI) Order 1997 to enable it to introduce residents&#039; parking controls. A considerable amount of exploratory work was undertaken at that time in conjunction with the police in the expectation that a small number of pilot schemes would be introduced in Ballymena and Belfast. I am sure you will appreciate that, in order to be effective, such measures require meaningful enforcement. Regrettably, in March 2002 the PSNI wrote formally to Roads Service and advised that it would be unable to accept this responsibility and as such, we were not able to proceed with our proposals at that time.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Subsequently, Roads Service initiated a process to introduce the necessary primary legislative power to decriminalise on-street parking offences and assume responsibility for enforcement of parking restrictions. I must point out however, that the introduction of Decriminalised Parking Enforcement (DPE) is a complex procedure. It is anticipated that the new primary 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 814W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>legislation will be in place in 2005 and that the new enforcement arrangements will be fully operational by mid-2006, thus permitting the opportunity to introduce and enforce residents&#039; parking schemes. More recently, following the intervention of John Spellar MP, the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, wrote to Roads Service confirming that he had asked that District Commanders give consideration to assisting with the enforcement of residents&#039; parking schemes where it would fit in with policing priorities at a local level.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">My staff are currently liaising with PSNI to determine how best a small number of pilot schemes might be introduced and adequately enforced so as to fully inform the development of policy and from which to learn how best the concept might be rolled out in appropriate places. In parallel with this, we are liaising with Local Authorities in Great Britain to gather best practice to help inform this development of policy.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I can assure you that we are progressing this matter as expeditiously as possible however, the introduction of any pilot schemes at this time will depend on the PSNI ability to enforce. Should this enforcement not be forthcoming, it is unlikely that residents&#039; parking schemes will become an on-the- ground reality before parking offences are decriminalised in mid-2006, and responsibility for the enforcement of on-street waiting restrictions is transferred to this Department.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what further progress has been made towards the <i>(a)</i> preparation, <i>(b)</i> development and <i>(c)</i> publication of a Rural White Paper; and if he will make a statement.  [191864]</p>




<p><a name="41020w40.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 A review of rural development policy being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, in consultation with the Rural Stakeholder Forum, will be completed in early 2005. A major study by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers to inform this review will be completed very shortly. A decision on whether or not to produce a rural White Paper will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the review.

<a name="41020w40.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Water Charging</h3>


<p><a name="41020w40.html_wqn2"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what progress is being made in relation to the introduction of water charging in Northern Ireland.  [191973]</p>




<p><a name="41020w40.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The 2003 water reform consultation document was underpinned by the proposal to move water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland to a self-financing basis. These self-financing arrangements required the introduction of domestic water charging and my announcement of 13 September 2004 gave details of the preferred options for both domestic and non-domestic charges.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 817W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w40.html_para1">
It is proposed that only those households connected to mains water and/or the public sewer will pay charges for the services they receive. These charges will consist of a standing charge plus an element based on property value. The standing charge will broadly reflect costs associated with maintaining connections to the public water and sewerage networks. Charges will be phased in with customers paying one-third of the annual charge in the first year, and two-thirds of the annual charge in the second year following the commencement of these charges. The total charges payable by a domestic customer will be capped at around &#163;750 per annum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w40.html_para2">
In response to views expressed in the 2003 public consultation on water reform I decided that provision should be made for household metering when water charges are fully phased in. However, I also indicated that further consideration had to be given to how best to implement this arrangement and to consider the implications for other customers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w40.html_para3">
A central aspect of the new charging arrangements is that there will also be an assistance scheme for those households on low-income. A special hardship relief scheme, to provide temporary assistance for those householders who find themselves unable to meet the cost of their water or sewerage charges as a result of exceptional circumstances, will also be provided.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w40.html_para4">
Under the new arrangements, all non-domestic customers will be required to pay water and sewerage charges, and where appropriate, trade effluent charges. Water metering will continue to be the preferred basis for charging the non-domestic sector and the scope of metering will continue to be extended throughout this customer group. A larger number of non-domestic 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Oct 2004 : Column 818W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
customers will move to metered charges or assessed charges but an unmeasured regime will be introduced for the many small businesses and voluntary groups which have low water usage. This unmeasured regime will entail standing charges for water and sewerage services and a variable charge based on the rateable value of the business premises. The domestic allowance for water will be phased out over a three-year period with the result that all water consumed will be paid for. The total charges payable by any customer without a meter will be capped at around &#163;1,500 per annum. Existing non-domestic customers who currently have meters and who are also connected to the public sewer will incur a sewerage standing charge and a volumetric sewerage charge in addition to their existing metered water charges. Trade effluent charges will be calculated on the same basis as elsewhere in the UK, and the charging regime will apply to all businesses with a discharge consent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w40.html_para5">
The proposed domestic charging regime has been the subject of an Equality Impact Assessment and the non-domestic regime has been the subject of a Regulatory Impact Assessment. These assessments will form a major part of an Integrated Impact Assessment which will be the subject of a 12-week consultation on the impacts arising from the bases of charging and other water reform proposals. This consultation will commence later in the autumn. Responses on the Integrated Impact Assessment will be considered before draft legislation on water reform is issued for public consultation during the first half of 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41020w40.html_para6">
Despite the considerable amount of work to be done it is hoped to introduce the new charging arrangements in 2006&#150;07 or as soon as practicable thereafter.
