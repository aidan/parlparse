The Council stressed the importance of the continued transition process in the DRC, especially in the preparation of elections and in the implementation of the necessary reforms. It called upon all countries of the region to give the transition in the DRC all their support. The Government welcome the agreed conclusions.

The Council condemns attacks and other ceasefire violations by all parties in the Darfur conflict and urges them to respect the ceasefire agreements.

It welcomes the UN Workplan for 2005 for $1.5 billion for the whole of Sudan. The Government welcome any analysis on sanctions, should they become necessary.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many civilians have been killed as a result of paramilitary action by insurgents in Iraqi since April 2002.  [204230]</p>




<p><a name="50110w06.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We have no way of reliably estimating the total number of Iraqi civilians killed by military or terrorist action. Unlike the Multi-National Force, the insurgents continue to deliberately target the Iraqi civilian population and cause damage to the country&#039;s infrastructure. Reports show that some 35 people, many of them children, were killed in one attack alone on 30 September, when co-ordinated bombs were detonated near a water treatment plant in Baghdad. The key to improving the lives of the Iraqi people will be to put down the insurgency.

 Since the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) disbanded following NATO action in Kosovo in 1999, some of its former members have set up and joined new political parties.

British officials in Kosovo continue to engage with representatives of these parties, and all parties that are committed to taking forward progress on standards and working towards a multi-ethnic Kosovo.

 Data on residual mines and other unexploded ordnance in Kosovo is supplied to us by the United Nations interim administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). At present there are 37 individual dangerous areas left to clear. These areas are mostly in the Dulje Pass close to the Prizren area or along the border with Albania. However, more contaminated areas are likely to be discovered as the population returns to areas which have not been occupied since the conflict.

Following NATO intervention in Kosovo to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian disaster, the UK was the first country to have de-miners on the ground in Kosovo. The UK Government have spent over &#163;10 million on de-mining activities in the Balkans, over &#163;5 million of which was spent in 1999&#150;2000 on de-mining in Kosovo. Their de-mining activities have included clearance of unexploded munitions such as cluster bomb submunitions but also cover residual mines and other unexploded ordnance laid (both in set minefields and scattered randomly) during the Serbian-Albanian conflict.

[206325]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 53W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50110w14.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Current available data do not allow a complete answer to this question. Many donors, including DFID, provide a significant part of their support to humanitarian agencies either as un-earmarked contributions, or on an Africa-wide basis, which does not lend itself to being broken down by specific Central African countries. Additionally, agencies often target refugees as well as other vulnerable groups within one single operation, making it difficult to isolate the support to refugees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w14.html_para3">
DFID channels the majority of its monetary support to refugee operations through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Globally, (including Central Africa), from 1997 until 2004, DFID contributions to the UNHCR have totalled &#163;145 million. For the same period, US contributions have totalled &#163;1.2 billion, EC contributions have totalled &#163;350 million, and EU member state contributions combined (not including UK contributions) have amounted to &#163;1 billion. Of the &#163;26 million provided to the UNHCR in 2003, &#163;15 million (57 per cent.) was unearmarked but certainly contributed to the Central African operations, a further &#163;1 million (4 per cent.) was earmarked for general Africa operations, and an additional &#163;1.5 million (6 per cent.) was specifically earmarked for operations in Chad and the DRC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w14.html_para4">
From 1997 until 2003, DFID also channelled a further &#163;11 million of support to non-UN agencies operating in support of refugee programmes across the Central and Great Lakes Regions of Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w14.html_para5">
For food assistance to refugees, DFID channels the majority of its funding through the World Food Programme (WFP). Again, it is not possible to disaggregate this support accurately by specific countries. However, from 1998 until 2004, DFID support to the WFP globally has totalled &#163;300 million, and DFID is currently the WFP&#039;s fourth largest donor. For the same period, US support to the WFP has totalled &#163;3.8 billion, EC support has totalled &#163;650 million, and combined EU member-state contributions (not including the UK) have amounted to &#163;920 million. As a Central African example, 2004 contributions to the WFP&#039;s feeding programme for Sudanese refugees in Chad have seen the UK commit &#163;2.2 million compared to the US contribution of &#163;16 million, the EC contribution of &#163;1.4 million, and the non-UK EU member state contributions totalling &#163;4.3 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w14.html_para6">
Meeting the food and non-food requirements of refugee populations in Central Africa remains a humanitarian priority for DFID. In addition, DFID actively promotes local acceptance of refugees by channelling parallel support to host populations and refugee-affected areas. And ultimately, DFID supports the search for durable solutions for refugee populations, promoting and facilitating voluntary repatriation when conditions in the country-of-origin permit. At the same time, DFID also prioritises similar standards of assistance to Internally Displaced Persons.

<p><a name="50110w20.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Specific diseases, disorders, or medical conditions and medical syndromes each have common features such as a set of physical signs and/or symptoms that distinguish them from other medical conditions. Gulf veterans do not present with an identifiable and distinct pattern of symptoms or signs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w20.html_para5">
The consensus of the international scientific and medical community following extensive research on the matter is that there is insufficient evidence to enable the ill-health reported by 1990&#150;91 Gulf veterans to be characterised as a unique Gulf related illness or syndrome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w20.html_para6">
The Medical Research Council came to the same conclusion in their report published in May 2003 following their independent scientific review of all the UK research work carried out into Gulf veterans&#039; illnesses. We do not, therefore, refer to the symptoms reported as being &quot;Gulf war syndrome&quot;.

GCDA and its employees have no dispensation to break the law but parking restrictions within central London may make it impossible sometimes to deliver secure or sensitive documents to buildings or allow people with a high public profile to attend or leave buildings without putting themselves or secure documents at risk.

 Development of the Government&#039;s reforms to national health service dentistry was informed by experience of the personal dental services (PDS) scheme and Options for Change pilots. A key feature of these pilot schemes, which will also be carried forward to new contractual arrangements, is the replacement of the item-for-service method of remunerating dentists with local contracts. Primary care trusts will negotiate contracts with dental practices to meet patients&#039; overall oral health care needs. An evaluation of a sample of PDS schemes suggest that dentists may prescribe fewer intricate dental appliances under local commissioning, although this may only be a temporary effect whilst they adjust to new contractual and remuneration arrangements. Dentists should prescribe appliances for which there is a clinical need.

<p><a name="50110w30.html_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The Department provides a range of services to help homeless people find employment, from support from personal advisers based in Jobcentres to specific initiatives such as Progress2work-LinkUP and Action Teams for Jobs. Additionally, homeless people can have early access to the New Deals and other national programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w30.html_para5">
Progress2work-Link-Up is being piloted in 22 Jobcentre Plus districts. The initiative is designed to include those who may experience multiple barriers to employment for whom it provides support into employment and to find accommodation. Ex-offenders, the homeless and those who misuse alcohol are included in this wider client group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w30.html_para6">
Jobcentre Plus communicates its help for the homeless via its network of advisers for whom it provides guidance about the problems facing homeless customers. This explains the role of staff in helping and advising such customers as well as acting as a signposting service to organisations which offer specialist help to homeless people. There is also guidance about the British Action on Homelessness (BAOH) and how its &quot;Ready for Work&quot; programme work placements are accommodated within the Intensive Activity Period of New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 plus.

Jobcentre Plus also conducts joint work at a local level. A strand of most Local Strategic Partnerships centres on homelessness and employment and these partnerships provide the link between Jobcentre Plus and local authorities.

<i>Letter from David Anderson to Mr David Willetts dated 10 January 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the average amount of time spent on job search activities by people claiming Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance (JSA). This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Information about the average weekly time JSA claimants spend on job search activity is not available. However, people claiming JSA are required to actively seek work and undertake minimum levels of job search activity to maintain their entitlement to JSA. It may be helpful if I explain this, and how we monitor compliance, in a little more detail.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">People claiming JSA are usually required to undertake a minimum of three steps each week to look for work. These steps, which will vary depending on individual customer circumstances and the work they are seeking, are discussed and agreed at the new jobseeker interview, recorded in the Jobseeker&#039;s Agreement, and reviewed regularly. The Jobseeker&#039;s Agreement outlines the customer&#039;s job goal, the times and days they are available for work and those steps that, if taken, will offer the best chance of leading to a job. Having a Jobseeker&#039;s Agreement, signed by the customer and Adviser, is a requirement of entitlement to JSA.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">After the new jobseeker interview, people are usually required to attend the Jobcentre fortnightly and, if they remain unemployed, will be expected to attend more in-depth interviews with a Personal Adviser at key stages. These customer contacts provide a regular opportunity to ensure people are actively seeking work and to see what help, if any, is required. When someone does not appear to be actively seeking work or undertaking the required level of job search activity, payment of JSA is withheld and the case referred to an independent decision maker.</p>

 Mr Christopher Leslie: The Government is sympathetic to the principles of individual registration and appreciates the benefits it might bring, particularly with regard to supporting remote voting. However, there are concerns about the possible impact of individual registration on registration rates and by extension the ability of eligible electors to vote. As such we are therefore considering the options to support remote voting with an approach that preserves the completeness and integrity of electoral registers.

<a name="50110w33.html_para1">
The Government has made no assessment of the effects of such a system on the number of young people likely to vote, but research undertaken by the Electoral Commission following the introduction of individual registration in Northern Ireland (The Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002: An Assessment of its first year of operation) has suggested that young people are among the most under registered, with 29 per cent. of 18&#150;24 year olds not on the register.

 The European Union budget is financed by four resources, as explained in the Government&#039;s annual White Paper on European Community Finances (Cm 6134): customs duties, including those on agricultural products, sugar levies, a VAT-based resource, and a GNI-based resource . The VAT-based resource currently makes up about 14 per cent. of total EC Budget revenue. It is calculated on the basis of a notional harmonised rate and reflects finally taxed expenditure across the EU.

Departmental proposals for, and the overall level of, efficiencies in environmental services were informed by consultation with Sir Peter Gershon&#039;s Efficiency Review team, the Local Government Association and other key organisations involved in this area. Detailed analysis was based on Defra&#039;s development of a new quantitative model, designed to support a robust, carefully modelled case for on-going government expenditure on waste as part of the 2004 Spending Review.

The model&#039;s primary purpose is to predict local authorities&#039; waste management costs, flows of materials and the range of new facilities needed for waste treatment to meet the EU Landfill Directive targets and deliver increased rates of recycling and recovery. Analysis of the scope for greater efficiency in waste services identified the potential for delivering gains through: greater joint working between local authorities; encouragement and communication of best procurement practice; stimulating industry to ensure timely delivery of a wider, better designed range of facilities; improved operation of the land-use planning system; increased markets for recyclates and compost; and, shifting local authority planning from the short-term to the long-term in order to minimise overall costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w37.html_para2">
Defra&#039;s Waste Implementation Programme already supports a range of activities to help local authorities drive up and re-orientate their waste management performance. Most will help deliver the improvements sought in the Efficiency Review, such as the targeted support being provided to improve procurement, and to stimulate industry to offer a wider, better designed range of facilities.

 The Freedom of Information Act provides a range of exemptions to protect information provided to public authorities.

<p><a name="50110w40.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 13 December 2004]</i>: Our research suggests that the number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by a limited amount in 2004 and 2005&#151;perhaps by up to 200,000 vulnerable households in England over this period. This figure represents the combined effects of gas and electricity price increases countered by other measures that we have put in place on incomes and benefits. The assumptions behind this estimate are set out in two DTI publications which accompanied publication of the Fuel Poverty in England: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action on November 30. These internet publications are available to view at www. dti.gov.uk/energy/consumers/fuel poverty/index.shtml.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w40.html_para0">
Any potential increase in the numbers can be set against the very real progress that has been made: the number of households in fuel poverty in the UK has fallen by over three million since 1996, to 2.25 million in 2002 and further reductions are expected in the figure for 2003. In England, there has been a fall from the 1996 figure of 4.3 million households (three million vulnerable) to 1.4 million (1.2 million vulnerable) in 2002. The Government remains committed to achieving its target of seeking an end to the problem of fuel poverty in England in vulnerable households by 2010 as far as is reasonably practicable. .

<i>[holding answer 13 December 2004]</i>: As fuel poverty is devolved, therefore this answer covers England only.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w40.html_para2">
My Department has considered the impacts of gas and electricity prices on fuel poverty for England. The results of this analysis were published in the Government&#039;s Fuel Poverty Action Plan, and suggests that the number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by a limited amount in 2004 and 2005, perhaps by up to 200,000 vulnerable households in England over the period. We monitor the number of households in fuel poverty through the English House Condition Survey, with figures for 2003 becoming available in April 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w40.html_para3">
According to the 2001 English House Condition Survey, around 700,000 (3.3 per cent.) of dwellings in England used oil-fired central heating as their main form of space heating. Of these households, around 150,000 are likely to be vulnerable households in fuel poverty. Estimated heating oil prices for 2004 are around 20 per cent. higher than those in 2001. This will have increased the number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty, who use heating oil. There are a number of uncertainties about exactly how many households will be brought into fuel poverty by changes in the price of heating oil, but it is likely to be significantly less than 50,000 vulnerable households.

 The M40 passes through the Chilterns between junctions 4 and 5. This stretch of motorway was widened in 1990&#150;91.

<p><a name="50110w43.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The benefit of high occupancy vehicle lanes is that they facilitate the movement of more people per lane, reducing peak hour travel times while maintaining safety and reducing pollution. The introduction of the lanes should result in some drivers choosing to leave their cars at home or a convenient parking point and car share with others. This should result in a net decrease in traffic on the motorway, on the local network leading to the motorway and on the return journey home. This should help to reduce congestion associated with each of these journeys.

 I estimate that the total number of staff which will be employed in the new Rail Group of the Department for Transport after the transfer of responsibilities from the Strategic Rail Authority to the Secretary of State will be in the region of 250&#150;300. This compares with a total of about 530 people currently employed in the SRA and the Rail Directorates of the Department. The estimate is an indicative figure, based on the new approach to the strategic direction of the rail industry outlined in &quot;The Future of Rail&quot; and discussions with key figures in the Authority and other industry organisations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w44.html_para2">
The legislation does not require the replacement of existing documents until a reissue is requested, so that additional running costs would not have been incurred.

<p><a name="50110w44.html_spnew10"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The working time regulations provide workers with the protection of a limit of an average of 48 hours a week working time. This is not an absolute cap of 48 hours in any one week. This average is normally calculated over a 17-week reference period, although this can be longer in certain situations (26 weeks) and can be extended by agreement (up to 52 weeks). Workers may choose to work more than 48 hours per week over this reference period by signing an opt-out agreement, but employers cannot force a worker to sign an opt-out and workers cannot be subjected to detriment for refusing to sign an opt-out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w44.html_para5">
In the past year, a total of 26 individuals working in ministerial private offices have worked more than 48 hours in at least one week. This total reflects a number of staff changes during the course of the year. There are currently 11 staff working in ministerial private offices who have signed an opt-out. Given the changes of staff during the year, it is not meaningful to calculate this as a percentage of the total of 26.

<p><a name="50110w45.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Our proposals under the Animal Welfare Bill will improve significantly the welfare of all animals used in entertainment, including animals performing in circuses. The introduction of the welfare offence means that the owner or keeper of an animal is required to take reasonable steps to ensure its welfare. This will enable the courts to take action where an animal although not currently suffering is being kept in a way that will cause eventual suffering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w45.html_para0">
The contents of the Bill have been subject to public consultation and pre- legislative scrutiny. This has enabled a wide range of animal keepers, including the keepers of circus animals, to make their views known.

It is our intention, through regulations under the Bill, to license all performing animal trainers. We propose that inspectors will be given the right of entry to all premises where performing animals are kept or are performing, including winter holding quarters. The regulations would be backed up by a code of practice which would set out welfare standards. The regulations and code would be subject to public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.

The proportion of this figure relating to landings in inshore waters is not available. Although a report by Drew Associates, commissioned by Defra, and published in July 2004, provided information on the economic contribution of sea angling in England and Wales, this did not provide information relating solely to bass so recent data on the value of this activity is not available.

<p><a name="50110w45.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra-funded research identified a dolphin bycatch problem in the pair trawl fishery for bass and trials, which concluded in spring 2004, demonstrated that mitigation devices were not sufficiently developed to reduce this bycatch in the short-term. This was why I approached the European Commission for an emergency closure of this fishery and, in the light of the Commission&#039;s rejection of the UK case, announced my intention to prohibit pelagic pair trawling for bass within 12 miles of the south west coast.

When our request for an emergency closure was put to the Commission it was understood that the relevant population of common dolphins was approximately 120,000.

CCAs cover a wider range of emissions than does EU ETS, in particular indirect emissions through electricity use.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> reasons for and <i>(b)</i> consequences of rising emissions of (i) nitrogen dioxide and (ii) ammonia from the road transport sector between 1990 and 2002.  [206026]</p>




<p><a name="50110w50.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Most emissions of nitrogen oxides (nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide) at the point of release are nitric oxide. Under normal circumstances the emitted nitrogen monoxide rapidly reacts to form nitrogen dioxide. The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) does not report separately emissions of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w50.html_para0">
Emissions of nitrogen oxides from road transport decreased by 45 per cent. between 1990 and 2002 from 1,295 to 711 kte. This is mainly as a result of the increase in the proportion of the vehicle fleet fitted with catalysts and improvements in the emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel fuelled vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w50.html_para1">
The Air Quality Expert Group (AQEG) reported in 2004 that there may have been an increase in the proportion of nitrogen dioxide emitted directly from the tailpipe of diesel vehicles as a result of increased diesel activity and the fitting of specific types of particle matter traps. AQEG&#039;s report can be viewed at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/ageg/nitrogen- dioxide/index.htm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w50.html_para2">
Emissions of ammonia from road transport were only 4.2 per cent. of the national ammonia emission total in 2002. They had increased between 1990 and 2002 from 0.85 to 11.97 kte. The increase in ammonia releases from road transport is related to the growth in the number of vehicles fitted with three- way catalysts. These produce ammonia and nitrous oxide as a by-product of the catalytic process that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides. Improvements in catalyst technology and engine management systems has reduced ammonia emissions in recent years. The NAEI reports ammonia emissions from road transport peaked in 2000 and are now starting to fall as these new vehicles penetrate the fleet. The NAEI can be viewed at http://www.naei.org.uk.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 177W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w50.html_para3">
Reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides from road transport reduces the ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide. This decreases the areas where air quality objectives are exceeded and reduces the detrimental health effects associated with high ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide. Increased primary emissions of nitrogen dioxide may have a significant impact on roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations in areas where there is considerable diesel activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w50.html_para4">
The consequences of the rise in emissions of ammonia from road transport are thought to be relatively slight. While there may, on occasion, be a detectable odour from some catalyst equipped cars. Emission of ammonia from road transport tend to occur mostly in urban locations, whereas the main ecological effects of ammonia occur to rural ecosystems.

<p><a name="50110w51.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Budget 2003 announced that, as part of the reform of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme, approximately &#163;84/92/92 million had been allocated to the new Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) in England for the financial years 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. Currently, 80 people are employed by WIP, of which 55 work for the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which is a key delivery agent for significant elements of the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w51.html_para4">
WIP has been very successful in prioritising close engagement with local authorities and the waste industry to create a stronger understanding of the opportunities and challenges that sustainable waste management presents, and to stimulate the development of essential expertise. Data from the latest Municipal Waste Management Survey shows 14.5 per cent. of household waste was collected for recycling in 2002&#150;03, up from 12.5 per cent. in 2001&#150;02. Taking account of the growing contribution that WIP is making to improved performance by local authorities in meeting their statutory waste targets, the Government believes that the national 2003&#150;04 target of 17 per cent. recycling or composting will now be met.

<i>[holding answer 20 December 2004]:</i> Since its inception in 2001, the Department for Education and Skills has kept under review the support it provides for young people aged 13 to 19 with the aim of ensuring that that support meets young people&#039;s current and anticipated needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w53.html_para1">
Within its current areas of responsibility there have been a number of projects and initiatives intended to help young people which have begun since 1997 and which have become part of our mainstream provision. Quality Protects, launched in 1998 by the Department of Health as part of the Government&#039;s wider strategy for tackling social exclusion, focused on children and young people looked after by councils, in the child protection system, and other children in need. The programme transferred to the Department for Education and Skills as part of the machinery of Government changes in 2003. The original provision of three years had already been extended to five years, with the programme being mainstreamed from 2004. The Young Runaways Development Project, for which the Children and Young People&#039;s Unit provided funding in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, transferred to DfES and has now ended. Both programmes demonstrated effective ways of meeting the needs of children and young people which are enshrined in the Children Act 2004 and the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme, launched on 1 December, and which have introduced, among other provision, a statutory duty to promote the education and wellbeing of looked after children, a statutory duty on organisations working with children and young people to safeguard them and promote their welfare, and children&#039;s trust arrangements to focus integrated, multi-disciplinary support on the needs of children and young people. Similarly, Active Citizens in Schools, an award scheme that empowers young people to get involved in projects that benefit the school and wider community, ran as a pilot project from Spring 2002 until September 2004, and is now being made available to schools nationally through a Framework and Toolkit funded by DfES. Schools can then adapt the scheme to fit their needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w53.html_para2">
Other projects and initiatives have ended as they have been subsumed within other programmes: Connexions Summer Plus, which became part of the anti-crime Positive Activities for Young People programme; and New Start, which paved the way for Learning Gateway

<p><a name="50110w53.html_wqn4"><b> Peter Bottomley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reasons the Early Interventions project was changed to Family Resolutions; what the differences are between the two; and what the mechanisms for the change were.  [203940]</p>




<p><a name="50110w53.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Family Resolutions Pilot Project is designed to test the effectiveness of group work and information and parent planning measures in helping separating or separated parents reach agreement about contact and residence for their children, without needing formal family court proceedings. The Family Resolutions Pilot Project does not replace any other &quot;Early Interventions project&quot;. However, its development has been informed by a set of early intervention proposals that were received by the Government in autumn 2003, which had been drawn up by an ad hoc group, chaired by a judge. The Government-led Steering Group, set up to take forward the development and delivery of a pilot project, chose the name of the project, in recognition of the focus of the intervention and the late stage in the separation of the parents at which it would take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w53.html_para3">
The design of the Government&#039;s Family Resolutions Pilot Project drew on the experience of a range of similar approaches from other jurisdictions, in particular Florida, but also Scandinavia, California and Canada. However, the Florida early interventions approach differs from the Family Resolutions Pilot Project in that participation is compulsory in the Florida jurisdiction. Participation in the Family Resolutions Pilot Project could only have been made compulsory if there had first been a change in primary legislation. This would also have been necessary if we had wished to replicate the approach of other jurisdictions, in terms of any legal presumption of contact for parents and in terms of any expectation that parents must adhere to a prescribed pattern of contact, drawn from standard templates applied by the court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w53.html_para4">
Under the Children Act 1984 the welfare of the child is the court&#039;s paramount consideration when determining any question with respect to a child&#039;s upbringing. Case law decided under the Children Act 1989 has established that it is generally in a child&#039;s best interests to have contact with both of his parents but there is statutory presumption of contract nor does the Children Act provide standard patterns of contact to be prescribed to parents by the court. The Parenting Plans, which we are currently revising, will provide a set of templates which seek to show in practice the sort of contact arrangements that work well for children of different ages and circumstances. These will be available at all points throughout the system&#151;in solicitors&#039; offices as well as through advice and mediation services. They will make clear, in practical terms, arrangements that are generally beneficial for children. They are intended to be used as practical aids, both by parents themselves as well as by solicitors, conciliators and mediators, to assist parents to reach reasonable agreements. They will 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 191W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
seek to illustrate what the courts might well decide if the case went to a full hearing. The revised Plans will shortly be published in draft form and will be the subject of consultation. Once published in final form, they will be used in both in-court conciliation services and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project.

<p><a name="50110w56.html_spnew0"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 It is for schools to determine the content and structure of their physical education and sports provision. This includes deciding on the mix and balance between what is delivered within and outside of the curriculum. Guidance published by the Department for Education and Skills and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recommends that 75 minutes per week is required to deliver the physical education programme of study at Key Stages 1 and 2 effectively, and 90 minutes per week at Key Stage 3. At Key Stage 4 the focus is on health, fitness and wellbeing. Our ambition, by 2010, is that all children will be offered at least four hours of sport every week. This will comprise at least two hours of high quality physical education and sport at school and at least a further two-three hours of sport beyond the school day (delivered by a range of school, community and club providers). The expectation is that by 2010 schools will be delivering the two hours of high quality PE and sport at school entirely within the curriculum.

<i>[holding answer 16 December 2004]:</i> Science is part of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 4 (GCSE). This means that all students are required to study it unless the subject has been disapplied to enable extended work related learning. In the Government&#039;s 10 Year Science and Innovation Investment Framework, we outlined how we would increase the number of young people studying science at A level by improving science teaching, making additional incentives available to get more top quality graduates to train to be science teachers. These include increasing the value of the teacher training bursary for science graduates from &#163;6,000 to &#163;7,000 from September 2005 and raising the &#039;Golden Hello&#039; for new science teachers from &#163;4,000 to &#163;5,000 for trainees entering PGCE and equivalent courses from September 2005. It is generally for universities to decide whether to offer incentives for students to study particular subjects.

 The Government believe that children benefit from a continuing relationship with both parents following divorce or separation, where it is safe to do so. The Children Act 1989 makes the welfare of the child concerned, rather than the rights of the parent, the paramount consideration for family courts when considering matters relating to the upbringing of children. The assumption that both parents have equal status and value as parents is enshrined in current statute and case law.

They will make clear, in practical terms, arrangements that are generally beneficial for children.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many applications the Department received in 2003 from schools in England for specialist status; and how many of these were successful.  [206265]</p>




<p><a name="50110w58.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 787 secondary schools in England applied for specialist school status in 2003, and 484 of these were successful (61.5 per cent.). In the first applications round of 2004, 385 secondary schools applied and 284 (74 per cent.) were successful. 289 schools have applied in the most recent applications round. The results of this round will be announced in January. The total number of operational specialist schools is 1,955.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what entitlement schools in the Vale of York have to access Sure Start funding.  [206544]</p>




<p><a name="50110w58.html_spnew2"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The General Sure Start Grant includes all funds made available to local authorities from the Sure Start budget with the exception of those to support local Sure Start programmes. Local authorities are required to use General Sure Start Grant funds to meet specific objectives and targets set for them by the Sure Start Unit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w58.html_para0">
Although schools have no specific entitlement, it is open to local authorities to allocate Sure Start funds to local schools where they consider it meets objectives. Schools in the Vale of York could potentially have access to funding related to the development of extended schools (from 2005&#150;06) and revenue grant funding for the provision of breakfast and out of school clubs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w58.html_para1">
Local authorities are also encouraged to develop children&#039;s centres for families with children aged 0&#150;5 years on school sites and can allocate funds to schools to achieve that. However, such funding is only currently available in areas&#151;unlike the Vale of York&#151;which are considered to be disadvantaged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w58.html_para2">
In December 2004 the Government published &quot;Choice for parents, the best start for children: a ten year strategy for childcare&quot;. That set out our vision for the future, whereby all families&#151;in the Vale of York, as elsewhere&#151;with children aged up to 14 and who need it will have an affordable, flexible, high quality child care place between the hours of eight and six, all year round. We have also said that we intend all schools to become extended schools over time and funding will be made available to all local authorities to support that.

In the Teacher Supply Model&#151;used to inform decisions on the number of places to make available in Initial Teacher Training&#151;we take into account teachers leaving the profession through both general wastage and retirement. If we consider total wastage (including any form of retirement) of teachers aged 50 and over, as a percentage of the teacher workforce in maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools, then&#151;under the central scenario modelled&#151;this rate rises from 3.7 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 5.0 per cent. in 2007&#150;08, and then falls slightly to around 4 per cent. in 2012&#150;13. It should be noted that these figures become progressively more uncertain the further ahead they are modelled. The modelling assumptions are reviewed annually.

Proposed changes to the Teachers&#039; Pension Scheme that will apply to all scheme members by 2013 are aimed at giving teachers much more choice and flexibility about the ways in which they manage the transition from work to retirement. We expect that teachers will welcome a more flexible approach that will enable them to move more gradually from work to retirement than is possible under current arrangements.

Note:<br>

The scale of spending identified in 1997&#150;98 was due to a major injection of Nursery Education Grant funding to support the establishment of substantial free provision in the private and voluntary sectors.<br>

<p>
<a name="50110w59.html_para2">
In addition, from April 2003 all financial support for the delivery of free nursery education was consolidated within the under fives sub-block of each local authority&#039;s Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS)&#151;the main source of education funding. Prior to that, provision in

 For 2004&#150;05, Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Authority (FRA) received &#163;17.542 million in Formula Grant. For FRAs Formula Grant is equal to the sum of Redistributed Business Rates and Revenue Support Grant. Derbyshire FRA is a combined fire authority which gained major precepting status in

Formula Grant for these constituent authorities included provision for education, personal social services, highways maintenance and environmental, protective and cultural services as well as fire services and capital expenditure. As there are no restrictions on local authority decisions to spend Formula Grant it is not possible to say how much Formula Grant was made available for Derbyshire FRA in these years. For the purposes of calculating the 2004&#150;05 figure, an indicative amount was calculated to show what would have happened in 2003&#150;04 if Derbyshire FRA had been a major preceptor at that time. This amount was calculated to be &#163;16.706 million, however this is an indicative amount only.

 There has been no change in the way we calculate the personal social services formulae spending shares (PSS FSS) in 2005&#150;06. FSS is used to distribute formula grant to councils. The older peoples PSS FSS formulae directs extra resources to authorities with higher than average elderly populations in two ways. Firstly, the formulae allocates a basic amount per person aged 65 or over in each local council area. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 236W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Secondly, through its age top up, the formulae allocates extra resources to areas with higher proportions of very old people.

<p>
<a name="50110w65.html_para4">
There have been changes in the amounts distributed through two Department of Health specific grants, namely those for Preserved Rights and for Residential Allowances. We have listened to local authority concerns about the effect of transferring the majority of the Preserved Rights grant into FSS, originally announced as part of the SR2002 settlement. In co-operation with local authorities, we have agreed an alternative funding mechanism that minimises any adverse distributional impact, and which is based on the premise that a lower proportion of the Preserved Rights Grant will be transferred into the FSS.

In 2005&#150;06 the Preserved Rights Grant will be funded at &#163;348 million instead of the &#163;133 million announced in SR2002. The Residential Allowance grant will transfer into FSS more quickly. The method of allocating the Preserved Rights and Residential Allowance Grants to local authorities in 2005&#150;06 is unchanged. This will mean less turbulence for local authority funding. We have made corresponding adjustments to the base for allocations to councils of formula grant in 2005&#150;06.

 It is current policy to meter non-domestic customers and this will continue to be the preferred basis for charging this customer group.

Liaison meetings were held with the local Community Association which welcomed both the investment by Water Service in the area and the introduction of the traffic calming scheme. The Community Association was also appreciative of the efforts made to co-ordinate the work of both agencies and to minimise disruption.</p>

 The use of animals to test household products is to ensure environmental, workforce and consumer safety.

</p>

Justification and assessments of applications for licences to undertake such work are on a case-by case basis. Each application has to be approved locally by an ethical review process before being submitted to the Home Office for decision, the whole process being designed to ensure that any animal testing is licensed only after it is deemed to be justified and the related animal suffering minimised.

<a name="50110w74.html_para11">
A form of cost benefit assessment of each individual programme of work has to be undertaken before the Home Office can consider granting the necessary licence. This means that the likely benefits of the work&#151;in terms of generating data for the purposes of risk assessment&#151;must be balanced against the expected welfare costs to the animals involved. No animal testing is licensed without an expert judgment being made on that basis. More information about the statutory cost benefit assessment used in these and all other cases can be found at Appendix I of Guidance on the Operation of the 1986 Act (HC 321).

The 1986 Act additionally provides that animal testing can be licensed only if there are no non-animal alternatives and, where animals must be used, their numbers and suffering are to be minimised. This means that any animal testing judged to be necessary must involve the mildest available procedures for the purpose. Where more severe procedures are unavoidable&#151;and it is unlikely procedures of substantial severity would be needed to test household products&#151;they must be replaced by milder methods as soon as they are validated and then accepted by the regulatory bodies concerned. On the same basis, no animal testing can be authorised once non-animal replacements are developed and generally accepted. These constraints are reflected in a standard condition of project licences, compliance with which is monitored by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate.

For completeness, and to give a more accurate idea of the overall amount of licensed work conducted, I should therefore add that there were 3,309 project licences in force in Great Britain at the end of 2001, and 3,180 and 2,977 at the end of 2002 and 2003 respectively.

<p><a name="50110w75.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The contract with Anne&#039;s Gate Property plc (AGP) for the re-development and operation of 2 Marsham street runs from 26 March 2002 to 2 April 2031, a period of 29 years. Payment will commence when the Home Office takes possession of the building which is planned for 26 January 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w75.html_para0">
The first estimated full-yearly payment to AGP is at the rate of &#163;32.3 million provided full operational performance is delivered. This payment will be at a reduced rate until the building is fully occupied. It excludes costs of on demand services such as reprographics and official hospitality. The payment increases annually at about 76 per cent. of the rate of inflation. The annual charge was noted by the NAO Report (&quot;PFI the New Headquarters for the Home Office&quot;&#151;HC954 Session 2002&#150;2003 15 July 2003), to be if anything, a better deal then would have been secured through commercial rent and procurement of service.

<p>

The net present cost of the contract was modelled at &#163;311 million at financial close in March 2002. This has not been remodelled to take account of the various changes since then including the revised Treasury guidance on such calculations.

 The Facial Images National Database (FIND) project currently being undertaken by the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) is aiming to deliver a nationally available &quot;mugshot&quot; database of facial images, linked to the respective PNC records, in 2006. One key element of this project involves providing guidance to police forces on image capture standards in order to ensure that the database is populated with the best possible images.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w76.html_para4">
Face recognition systems, with current technology, are most effective when used for &quot;one to one&quot; matching, for example to help verify that an individual is who they claim to be. Despite significant advances in the last few years, the technology still has some way to go before it is capable of reliably performing &quot;face in the crowd&quot; type searches against either a large database or a smaller &quot;watch-list&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w76.html_para5">
Post-event analysis&#039; is an example of a promising area for the use for facial recognition technology. The facial recognition element of the victim-focused work with regards to child abuse images being undertaken by the National Crime Squad is proving very successful in identifying victims and perpetrators of child sexual abuse and in identifying links between cases.
</p>

A number of direct law enforcement applications have been implemented, including the London borough of Newham partnership with the Metropolitan Police to provide facial recognition as part of a town centre protection application.

 Under Section 6(1) (section 6(2) if married to a British citizen) of the British Nationality Act 1981 applicants for naturalisation must meet, among other things, a number of residence requirements which are detailed in Schedule 1, paragraph 1 (2) of the Act.

The residence requirements include five years residence in the UK immediately prior to application (three if married to a British citizen) and a mandatory requirement to have been physically in the UK on the actual date five years (three if married to a British citizen) prior to the date of application.

There is scope under the Act for Crown Service overseas, on the date of application for citizenship, to act as an alternative to the residence criteria outlined above, (Schedule 1 paragraph 1(3) of the Act). However the Home Office applies very strict criteria in such cases and very few applications are ever granted on this basis. Examples of cases we have approved include applicants who had more than 20 years Crown service with British embassies, at pro- and vice-consul level and their applications were supported by current and previous ambassadors.

<p>
<a name="50110w76.html_para11">
In line with the recent review into the Home Office immigration and naturalisation policy for Gurkhas, the policy for naturalisation for all servicemen has been changed. We will, generally, no longer naturalise a member of the armed forces while they are still in service. Once discharged, ex-servicemen who have served four or more years in the armed forces will be eligible to apply for settled status. Once settled they will be free to live and work in the UK indefinitely and will be able to apply for naturalisation, subject to meeting the usual residence requirements. The new policy takes account of the potential high levels of absences that ex-servicemen may have and will enable these to be waived in most cases.

Our policy on applications made under the Crown Service arrangements has not changed as a result of the review; we will continue to apply the same strict criteria in these cases.

 The judgement of the Administrative Court in R (on the application of the Howard League for Penal Reform) <i>v</i>.

The court ruled that local authorities continue to have responsibilities towards children who are detained in young offender institutions, subject to the requirements of custody. The Home Office, the Youth Justice Board and the Department for Education and Skills have taken a range of measures to implement that ruling and also to strengthen child protection and safeguarding generally for young people in custody. Most notably, the board is funding the provision of 25 new social worker posts in Young Offender Institutions.

<a name="50110w76.html_para13">
Although the judgment related specifically to children in young offender institutions, the Government accept that its general principles would apply in the context of children detained under Immigration Act powers. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate is meeting the broad principles set out in the judgment to the extent that it is possible for it to do so in the context of immigration detention and the removal of failed asylum seekers and others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w76.html_para14">
The Children Act 2004 places legal protections for young people in custody on a statutory footing. It places a duty on prison governors or directors, and governors or directors of secure training centres, to make arrangements for ensuring that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Governors or directors of juvenile young offender institutions and secure training centres also become board partners in Local Safeguarding Children&#039;s Boards, which will be established to co-ordinate, and ensure the effectiveness of, safeguarding in their children&#039;s services authority area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w76.html_para15">
The children of asylum seekers and refugees are not excluded from the arrangements in the 2004 Act. The arrangements under sections 10 (co-operation to improve well-being), 11 (arrangements to safeguard and promote welfare) and 13&#150;16 (Local Safeguarding Children Boards) of the Act are intended to cover all children. This includes those seeking asylum or refugees, when they come into contact with the agencies involved in the arrangements or, more generally, through the focus of the section 10 co-operation arrangements on all children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w76.html_para16">
Although the statutory duty to promote and safeguard the welfare of children was not placed on the Immigration Service, the IS takes its responsibilities towards children very seriously and fully appreciates the importance of identifying vulnerable children, including those who may be detained with their families. All removal centres that may hold families with children are required to have in place child protection policies and procedures based on a national template and to maintain close ties with local agencies involved in child protection and welfare matters. In addition, while the Immigration Service is not a core member under the duty to co-operate to improve well-being or the duty to establish Local Safeguarding Children Boards, where appropriate the Immigration Service will be involved in these arrangements. This would include those areas in which removal centres holding families with children are located.

<sup>(79)</sup> Staff sick in calendar year, sickness begins before end of year, ends after start.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Calendar to working day conversion has been given by applying the ratios found in the earliest available full breakdown (November 2002) to the earlier data. This provides an adjustment for part year workers, and part-time staff. However it assumes that years previous to 2002 had a similar ratio of such staff.<br>

2. Figures are lower than those for 2002 from archive, in part because of winter sickness November/December 2002 that will have not reached the system at the time this report was run in November.<br>

<p><a name="50110w78.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Home Office does not collect data on the reasons for failure to produce court reports.

 All organisations wishing to register with the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) must pay a &#163;300 registration fee. Additional Countersignatory applications cost &#163;5 each. There is currently no annual minimum requirement for the number of checks submitted by registered bodies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w78.html_para3">
I am unable to provide a definitive list of all national governing bodies of sport, county sports associations and sports clubs that are registered with the CRB. When applying to become registered bodies, all organisations are requested to identify their business sector from a list provided by the CRB. Sports associations are categorised under the leisure services business sector, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 287W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
but not all organisations who are involved in sports activities identify themselves under leisure services. The CRB is therefore unable to identify from the business sector whether registered bodies belong specifically to the groups in question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w78.html_para4">
Furthermore, the business sector information is not a mandatory part of the registration process and the CRB is aware that a number of registered bodies have not provided this detail. This also prevents the CRB from providing a complete analysis of the business sector for its registered bodies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w78.html_para5">
Many organisations also use the services of umbrella bodies to access the disclosure service and the sporting bodies about whom my hon. Friend is concerned may also be using this route, which again prevents a complete analysis.

Consequently, the CRB cannot provide the total number of disclosures issued to the sports bodies in question. It is estimated that the leisure industry accounts for about seven per cent of all disclosures issued.

<p><a name="50110w78.html_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 already empowers the Court of Appeal, if it considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, to order the production of any document, exhibit or other thing which appears necessary for the determination of the appeal. This includes any evidence which was not presented at the trial from which the appeal lies. When considering whether to receive any evidence the Court of Appeal must have regard to various factors: whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief; whether the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; whether the evidence would have been admissible in the trial; and whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence at the trial.

 The Drug Interventions Programme (formerly CJIP) provides an opportunity for all criminal justice agencies and drug treatment organisations to work together in addressing drug related crime and the associated treatment needs of offenders.

 Precise estimates of the impact of the Drug Interventions Programme on drug-related and persistent crime are not yet available. However, the key aim of the Programme is to get drug-using offenders into treatment as there is a wealth of research evidence to show that treatment reduces both drug use and offending. For example the National Treatment Outcomes Research Study found significant reductions in offending among those entering treatment. Early figures show that around 1,500 offenders a month are now entering treatment as a result of the Programme.

<p><a name="50110w79.html_spnew8"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Television advertisements are generally produced to be used on both terrestrial and satellite channels. Advertising space is purchased on the basis of which media will be most effective at reaching the target audience. In virtually all cases this will involve a mix of satellite and terrestrial channels. For this reason it is not possible to differentiate the spend between terrestrial and satellite advertising.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of drink spiking detection and prevention devices; and if he will make a statement.  [199968]</p>




<p><a name="50110w80.html_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 December 2004]:</i> The Home Office is aware of a number of products, both in development and on the market, that claim to provide a partial or whole solution to the problem of drink-spiking. The list of substances that can be used to spike drinks is almost endless, with any substance that may have a sedative effect being a possible candidate. While drugs like Rohypnol and GHB (Gammahydroxybutyrate) have received wide publicity, they are rarely found in samples. As a result, products which allow the user to test drinks for certain illicit substances, may provide a potentially dangerous false reassurance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w80.html_para7">
While bottle caps and drinks holders may reduce the potential for drink spiking, they too can provide a false reassurance of safety, given evidence that it is the consumption of alcohol, rather than drink spiking, which more commonly increases vulnerability to sexual crime (please refer to answer given to questions 199964/6/7 regarding FSS research on this). The Government therefore urge the public to treat such products with caution. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has in the past commissioned research to look at the viability of a potential drug detecting device, such as a swizzle stick, that could be unobtrusively used by people in pubs and clubs to detect drugs in drinks. Due to the difficulty of producing a satisfactory device, the project is not being continued.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w80.html_para8">
A message of safer and more responsible drinking, alongside increased awareness and vigilance upon the part of friends and staff, will be most effective in increasing the safety of people who feel they are vulnerable to drink-spiking.

<p><a name="50110w80.html_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Drug Interventions Programme (formerly Criminal Justice Interventions Programme) is a critical part of the Government&#039;s national strategy for tackling drugs. The programme aims to make the most of opportunities provided by the criminal justice system to get drug misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w80.html_para9">
The &quot;intensive&quot; elements of the Drug Interventions Programme are currently operational in 66 police basic command units (47 DATs) with high levels of acquisitive crime. In 2005&#150;06 we will expand the intensive elements of the programme to a further 32 basic command units. These elements include testing for Class A drugs following charge for certain offences and in a number of areas restriction on court bail for those who have tested positive.

The Prison Service does not keep records of reunions of mothers and children in the community. All pregnant prisoners who give birth to a baby while serving a prison sentence do so in a local hospital. Some of those mothers will be able to keep the baby with them in a Prison Service Mother and Baby Unit, while others will choose to leave their infant in the care of relatives or other carers, which is likely to result in a reunification of mother and baby. In other cases, babies may be taken into the care of foster carers and Social Services on a temporary basis.

 The reasons why people self-injure is complex, and it is difficult to distinguish between acts of self-harm that were attempts at ending life, and those which occurred for other reasons. It is not possible, therefore, for the Prison Service to determine from recorded incidents of self-harm those acts that could be described as attempts at suicide. The following figures for self-harm include all acts of self-harm, however serious.

<sup>(83)</sup> The Prison Service employs the term &quot;self-inflicted death&#039; rather than suicide. This includes all those deaths where it appears the person acted intentionally to take his/her own life.<br>

<sup>(84)</sup> These figures record the number of incidents of self-harm, not the number of individuals. Some individuals repeatedly self-harm.<br>

<sup>(85)</sup> In December 2002, a new form for reporting self-injury (the F213SH) was introduced across the prisons estate in England and Wales, which is known to have improved reporting practices. Please note therefore that much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from the change in reporting procedures rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm.<br>

The table gives a breakdown of the number of prisoners who have been recalled to prison while subject to the Home Detention Curfew scheme over the past five years and a monthly breakdown for the past 12 months.

The increase in the number of recalls is an expected consequence of expanding the Home Detention Curfew scheme. Of the 100,345 prisoners placed on the scheme since January 1999, a total of 8,698 have had their licences revoked, which represents 8.7 per cent. of the total.

<p><a name="50110w83.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 December 2004]:</i> The Identity Cards Bill introduced into Parliament on 29 November includes powers to set different levels of fees for identity cards for different circumstances. The Government has said that groups which may benefit from this flexibility include 16 year olds, those on reduced incomes or those who have been in retirement for some time. The final decision on the fee structure and levels of fees will be for Parliament under the powers in clause 37 of the Bill.

<i>[holding answer 2 December 2004]:</i> Clause 37 of the Identity Cards Bill introduced to Parliament on 29 November 2004 includes powers to set fees to recover the costs of the scheme. Some of these fees would apply to individual card holders and some to organisations using the verification service. The Government&#039;s intention is that the total fee income from all these sources will cover the running costs of the scheme, though clause 37 does not make this a legal requirement.

fees for identity cards issued alongside designated documents (such as a passport) and for identity cards issued on their own. The Government believes that most people will obtain an identity card in conjunction with a passport and an estimate of this charge was published in the Regulatory Impact Assessment which was published alongside the Bill. Much of this cost would also be incurred in issuing an identity card on its own to a person who did not hold a biometric passport.

<p><a name="50110w83.html_wqn6"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the identity card will replace the Application Registration Card.  [203483]</p>




<p><a name="50110w83.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 There are no plans to replace the Application Registration Card (ARC) with the identity card. The ARC and its associated database provides a secure record of a person&#039;s claim for asylum and because of the use of biometric information this means that a person cannot make multiple applications using different identities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w83.html_para0">
The ARC does not prove identity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w83.html_para1">
When the identity cards scheme is operational, a person whose asylum application was approved&#151;and whose identity had therefore been validated&#151;could then be issued with a new biometric residence permit card linked to a record on the National Identity Register. The use of biometric information would ensure that a person could not create one &quot;identity&quot; via the asylum system and another via the identity cards scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w83.html_para2">
Although there are no plans for the ARC to be a designated document within the terms of the Identity Cards legislation, this would not rule out the possibility that the ARC scheme and the Identity Cards programme might share some common infrastructure.

<p><a name="50110w83.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Both quantitative and qualitative research on the public&#039;s views on identity cards has been conducted since the start of the first consultation exercise in July 2002. This also included specific research on the views of people from minority ethnic groups. The findings of all research completed to date have been published at www.identitycards.gov.uk
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w83.html_para3">
Research which is currently not ready for publication consists of qualitative research on the public&#039;s views on the process of how ID cards will be issued and used and qualitative research to identify the special needs of particular groups which need to be incorporated into the design of the scheme, for example ensuring that the enrolment facilities can be used by people with disabilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w83.html_para4">
Research which is planned but not yet commissioned will also be undertaken in early 2005 on how passport holders&#039; will react to the new processes for issuing more secure passports and later ID cards, for example will this encourage them to renew their passport earlier than planned. Quantitative research will also be undertaken as part of regular surveys on broader Home Office issues.

<p><a name="50110w84.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Although the judgment found that Immigration Officers operating pre-clearance at Prague airport in 2001 had discriminated against Roma people, it also found that they were not in breach of international law in refusing passengers entry to claim asylum. The scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to a high level of immigration abuse by passengers travelling from Prague. It was always intended that the pre-clearance arrangements would be operated in a non- discriminatory manner in relation to ethnic or national origin.

 Prison officers were formerly ineligible for jury service, but ceased to be so on 5 April 2004. It is open to them, as it is to anyone who feels they should not be expected to serve as a juror, to apply to the Jury Central Summoning Bureau, which administers a jury summoning service for the whole of England and Wales.

<a name="50110w90.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Offenders (Reports)</h3>


<p><a name="50110w90.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many reports his Department has commissioned regarding <i>(a)</i> sentencing and <i>(b)</i> the management of offenders since 1997; on what dates these reports were commissioned; who carried out the reviews; at what cost; and when his Department received each report. [199525]</p>




<p><a name="50110w90.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 29 November 2004]:</i> Since 1997, the Home Office has commissioned two major reports on sentencing and the management of offenders. The first of these was the Halliday Report (&quot;Making Punishments Work&quot;), which was launched in May 2000 and reported in July 2001. The author was John Halliday. The total cost of the report was &#163;56,301.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w90.html_para0">
The second was the Carter Report (&quot;Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime&quot;) commissioned by the PM, Treasury and Home Secretary on 17 March 2003. The author was Patrick Carter (now Lord Carter of Coles). The report was received on 11 December 2003 and published on 6 January 2004. The cost of Patrick Carter&#039;s review was met by the three commissioning Departments. The Home Office contributed staff resources via seconded staff, and contributed &#163;55,997 to the costs of expenses, research support and publication. The total cost of the Carter report is not readily available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w90.html_para1">
In addition to these two major projects, the Home Office has either commissioned or published an estimated 143 projects relating to more specific issues within the area of sentencing or offender management since 1997. These mostly comprise one-off research projects, and exclude the Home Office&#039;s series of statistical publications in those areas. Some of these projects have already been completed and published, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 334W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
others are still in progress. These projects have been carried out by a variety of external research teams (usually from universities or commercial research organisations) and in some cases by research development and statistics staff. It would be disproportionately costly to provide information on their total costs or the dates on which they reported.

<p><a name="50110w90.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers have been used to <i>(a)</i> X-ray and <i>(b)</i> stop and search individuals suspected of carrying knives at Hammersmith bus station as part of &quot;Operation Blunt&quot;; and how many individuals have been arrested for knife crimes as a result.  [206615]</p>




<p><a name="50110w90.html_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police informs me that a metal detecting scanner was used at Hammersmith bus station as part of &quot;Operation Blunt&quot;. Individuals were only searched if the officer had grounds to do so under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Three individuals were arrested as a result of the operation for offences connected to the possession of knives.

The Prison Service has taken a number of steps to increase the profile of the Service among BME communities. An outreach support team based in Prison Service Headquarters provides guidance and advice to local recruiters and has put in place a series of supporting tools, including:

<a name="50110w91.html_para2">
Over the last two months the Prison Service has run a national awareness advertising campaign targeting under-represented groups. The campaign is aimed at raising awareness of the diverse range of career opportunities available within the service . While it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative, there has been a significant increase in interest in the Prison Service website (over 120 per cent.). The Prison Service has made it clear to the advertising agencies it uses, that they must consider advertising strategies that attract applications from under-represented groups.

Each prison is able to set their own pay rates over and above the national minimum.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners in 2003 began training, education or offender behaviour programmes but were unable to complete these courses due <i>(a)</i> to transfer to another establishment and <i>(b)</i> release from custody. [201037]</p>




<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 In 2003&#150;04 there were approximately 9,600 commencements of accredited offending behaviour programmes excluding drug programmes. Of the 8,034 commencements of general offending behaviour programmes&#151;Enhanced Thinking Skills and Reasoning and Rehabilitation&#151;106 prisoners (1.3 per cent.) did not complete because they were transferred and 12 (0.1 per cent.) did not complete because they were released. The percentage of prisoners not completing other accredited offending behaviour programmes for these reasons would have been similar or lower.

<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Democratic Therapeutic Community (TC) Core Model was developed by a working group drawn from across public and private sector prisons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w92.html_para3">
The Therapeutic Community Policy Manager in Prison Service Headquarters facilitated this development work and managed a central annual budget of &#163;129,000 which was used to support the accreditation process. This included the provision of training and resources for staff, the commissioning of a consultant to undertake a literature review to underpin the core model, the provision of additional psychometric materials to TCs and other related costs.

<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Two deaths in 2001, eight in 2002 and six in 2003 appeared to be drug-related.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners were held <i>(a)</i> two to a cell designed for one and <i>(b)</i> three to a cell designed for two at the latest date for which figures are available; and how many category C and D prisoners are being housed in dormitory accommodation.  [202996]</p>




<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 At the end of October 2004 16,889 prisoners were held two to a cell designed for one, while 1,034 prisoners were held three to a cell designed for two. The data in this answer are provisional and subject to validation by prisons.

<p>

The Prison Service does not collect centrally the details of the number of category C and D prisoners who are placed in dormitory accommodation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether penalties are imposed on contracted out prisons for exceeding overcrowding limits.  [202997]</p>




<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Each of the nine contracts for prisons managed by the private sector under the private finance initiative contain provision for penalising the contractor financially if the agreed overcrowding limit is exceeded. The contracts for two further prisons, HMP Doncaster and HMP Wolds, which are operated by the private sector following a market test, do not contain this provision.

[203893]</p>




<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The &quot;Prison Catering&#039; magazine was a partnership arrangement between the Prison Service and Cost Sector Catering magazine published by 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 349W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Dewberry Boyes. The magazine was published and distributed in support of the Prison Services national catering workshop. The aim was to promote, to a wider public sector audience, some of the work and challenges being taken forward and tackled within Prison Service catering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w92.html_para6">
The criteria for advertisements set by the Prison Service required all advertisers to either hold a government contract or deliver to a government contract. Publication of the magazine was at no cost to the public purse and no income was generated for the Prison Service. The cost of the publication was borne by the publishers who also received the revenue raised from advertising. In addition to the publication Dewberry Boyes also organised the workshop venue.

 Supervised child care facilities are provided in the main visits area at Belmarsh, Holloway, Pentonville and Wormwood Scrubs.

<i>[holding answer 13 December 2004]:</i> From the information held centrally by the Prison Service, no member of staff has been suspended for dishonestly claiming an allowance.

In the Metropolitan Police, and from information available, one member of staff has been dismissed and has not been reinstated. Additionally one has also been reprimanded in relation to dishonestly claiming non police allowances.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) why the Prison Service did not accept the recommendation of the review of the installation of sprinklers that sprinklers should be installed in all prisons and detention centres;  [199794]
</p>



<p>(2) what criteria are used to decide whether sprinkler equipment should be installed in prisons and detention centres; [199791]

<p><a name="50110w92.html_spnew13"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The only formal review that the Prison Service is aware of relating to sprinklers was in respect of Immigration Centres. In the light of this review the Prison Service undertook technical assessments and testing of non-ligature secure sprinkler heads, as part of a continuing review of fire safety in the prison estate. No conclusions have yet been reached.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w92.html_para8">
An independent Fire Safety Survey and Review is currently being undertaken on behalf of the Prison Service by the Building Research Establishment (Fire) across the prison estate (public and private) which will include an assessment of the suitability, or otherwise, of sprinkler systems and other appropriate fire detection/management systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w92.html_para9">
The cost and time to install sprinklers is dependent upon the availability of the cell areas in which sprinklers would be installed. An initial Prison Service estimate of the cost to provide sprinklers is in excess of &#163;125 million, Owing to population pressures and the need for major decanting and relocation of prisoners to facilitate a national installation programme installation would take many years, possibly several decades.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w92.html_para10">
The Weare (a floating facility with shore facilities) is the only prison establishment fitted with sprinklers in accommodation areas. Many other establishments have sprinkler systems installed in high-risk areas, which include parts of kitchens and parts of workshops.

 Section 174 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 places a duty on the court when passing sentence to state in open court, in ordinary language and in general terms, its reasons for deciding on the sentence passed. Where the Sentencing Guidelines Council has issued definitive guidelines relevant to the sentence and the court departs from them it must give reasons for doing so. In the case of a custodial sentence or a community sentence, the court must explain why it regards the offence as being sufficiently serious to warrant such a sentence.

<p><a name="50110w95.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the courts alone, taking into account all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Prison sentences should be reserved for those who are serious, dangerous or seriously persistent offenders. Equally, offenders cannot be allowed to flout the order of the court and to default on their obligations to abide by the terms of a community sentence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w95.html_para1">
The Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, Schedule 3, contains the provisions relating to breach of community orders. Where an offender aged 18 or over and subject to a community order has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with any of the requirements of the relevant order, the magistrates court dealing with the offender must impose a sentence of imprisonment, unless either the court is of the opinion that the offender is likely to comply with the requirements of the order during the period for which it remains in force or that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify the court&#039;s not imposing such a sentence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50110w95.html_para2">
If the court does not impose a sentence of imprisonment, or if the obligation to do so does not apply, it may alternatively deal with the offender by making a curfew order, a community punishment order, or an attendance centre order, or (where it has the power to do so) by revoking the order and dealing with the offender as though he had just been convicted of the offence.

<i>[holding answer 13 December 2004]:</i> Assistance is provided through the Assisted Prison Visits Scheme, which is funded and operated by Her Majesty&#039;s Prison Service. The purpose of the scheme is to provide help with travel costs and accommodation, where necessary, to prisoners&#039; close relatives and partners, who are on a low income as specified in the rules of the scheme. Help may also be available to someone who is the prisoner&#039;s only visitor.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jan 2005 : Column 372W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
suspension of removals for failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe was taken; and whether this represents a change in the Government&#039;s assessment of the human rights situation in that country.  [204030]</p>




<p><a name="50110w97.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement on 16 November 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 78WS, announcing the end of the temporary suspension of enforced removals of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe. That statement explains the reason for the change in policy and stresses the fact that it does not reflect any change in the Government&#039;s condemnation of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.
