<P>
<a name="10503w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I refer to the review of the Treasury Solicitor's Department that I announced to this House on 8 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 336W.

<a name="10503w01.html_para0">I am pleased to announce the publication of the report on the first stage of the review.

 In response to both the earthquakes in Turkey, in August and November 1999, my Department contributed a total of nearly &#163;2 million to support the emergency relief effort, co-ordinated by the Turkish Government.
<P>

<a name="10503w01.html_para3">We provided immediate support to the search and rescue effort with specialist personnel from the UK fire service as well as other independent UK-based rescue organisations. In addition, we transported numerous relief items to the region (on behalf of the Red Cross and UNICEF), including medical supplies and tents.

<a name="10503w01.html_para4">We also channelled funds through the UN and the Red Cross for the provision of essential relief items such as shelter materials, medical supplies, food, water and sanitation equipment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In May last year, the Government announced the allocation of &#163;4.5 million to combat the trade in stolen goods by planting small identity microchips in consumer products at risk from theft. In partnership with a range of commercial companies, we are developing a series of pilot demonstrator projects to show how property crime can be reduced throughout the supply chain. These pilot projects aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of radio frequency identification technology (RFID) in combating property crime by providing proof of ownership of goods and confirming that they are not stolen or counterfeit.
<P>

<a name="10503w01.html_para5">The initiative aims to make it more difficult for offenders to steal and sell stolen property, easier for the police to recover it when they do, and to accelerate the adoption of this technology by business. The response from industry to the scheme has been excellent and details of the first pilot projects will be announced very shortly. In view of the high level of interest generated, I am 



<P>

pleased to announce that the Government have allocated an additional &#163;1 million to this initiative to allow the number and scope of pilot projects to be increased.

 The chief asylum support adjudicator's remuneration will be equivalent to grade 6.1 of the SSRB judicial scale, which for 2001-02 will be &#163;99,420.
<P>

<a name="10503w01.html_para6">The asylum support adjudicators remuneration (and daily fees) will be increased by 3.7 per cent. in line with the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body report No. 46, the twenty-third report on senior salaries (Cm 4995), which was presented to Parliament in February 2001.

 Recruitment for the post of Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons has been run under Commissioner for Public Appointments guidelines following advertisements in the national press. The choice of candidates has been guided by an advisory panel including two independent assessors. As we announced on 6 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 357W, these were Baroness Stern, former director of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and now senior research fellow at the international centre for prison studies, and Lord Laming, former chief

<P>

<a name="10503w02.html_para0">From the candidates selected by the advisory panel, I have recommended that Her Majesty the Queen should appoint Ms Anne Owers CBE, the director of the non-governmental organisation JUSTICE, as the next Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons. Her Majesty has consented to this appointment.
<P>

<a name="10503w02.html_para1">I am delighted that Ms Owers has accepted the appointment, which takes effect from 1 August this year. I am confident she will uphold the high standards of integrity, rigour and independence we expect from the inspection of this key public service.

 In working towards our goal of encouraging and supporting new mentors, I am today pleased to be able to announce the launch of a mentoring fund grants programme.

<P>

<a name="10503w02.html_para7">This Government also recognise the need for a national infrastructure to promote, develop and celebrate mentoring and to establish a framework of national quality standards for local mentoring schemes. I am therefore pleased to announce that we will be awarding the national mentoring network a grant of &#163;1.05 million over three years to develop the infrastructure of mentoring. I am also pleased to announce that to team up new mentors with mentoring opportunities, we are investing a further &#163;1.4 million into mentor points.
<P>

<a name="10503w02.html_para8">We also want to make it easier for people in community groups to apply for Government funds. So we are happy to announce the publication today of a consultation document on funding community groups. This sets out a number of proposals that aim to ensure that in future Government small grants programmes will be more integrated, and that application processes will be simpler and more accessible to local community groups. The document also explains how the Government plan to establish and operate the new neighbourhood renewal community chests, announced in the national strategy action plan in January 2001.

 I am sorry that there was such a serious delay in transferring my hon. Friend's letter of 24 July. Within two days of receipt of the letter my Private Office correspondence section identified that responsibility for the subject matter fell outside my Department. A number of attempts were made immediately and over the next few months to transfer the correspondence to the most appropriate Department. The Department of Trade and Industry accepted the letter on 8 February. I recognise fully that this is a quite unacceptable level of service and apologise to my hon. Friend and her constituents for this. My Department has now initiated measures to ensure that transfers of correspondence are effected within a reasonable period and in accordance with central guidance.

 Police operational experience and various research studies show that Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) has considerable crime reduction and detection potential, particularly when used as part of a wider strategy.
<P>

<a name="10503w03.html_para0">No formal independent evaluation of CCTV in Bolton has yet been undertaken. However, the Bolton Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership consider that CCTV has contributed to the 7 per cent. fall in recorded crime in Bolton last year.
<P>

<a name="10503w03.html_para1">The value of the Bolton town centre and car parks CCTV scheme in helping the police control and direct resources was demonstrated during a concerted effort to reduce crime in the town centre during Christmas 2000 shopping period. Reductions of 10 per cent. in street crime and 80 per cent. in vehicle crime were achieved in crime hot-spots compared with the previous Christmas.
<P>

<a name="10503w03.html_para2">During the past year, incidents of anti-social behaviour reported in the residential areas of Bolton covered by CCTV reduced by 75 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10503w03.html_para3">Under the current CCTV Initiative, coverage in Bolton is being enhanced. The Partnership is close to implementing two schemes providing coverage in residential areas and has been invited to prepare final proposals for two further residential schemes. Potential awards could reach nearly &#163;420,000. The schemes will need to have been in place for at least 12 months before their impact can be fully evaluated. Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships will also be evaluating schemes locally.

 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> The Health and Safety Executive have conducted an independent assessment, commissioned by the Lancashire Police Federation, of the potential health risks associated with the Airwave service. The report concludes that, on the basis of available information and on calculations

<a name="10503w03.html_para13">The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) have begun preparatory work for their investigation. DERA will report on progress every quarter. The final report should be available in early May 2002 after the main study has been concluded. The work allows further research to be carried out in light of the results from the main study. The report from this additional study, if it is required, should be available by August 2002.
<P>

<a name="10503w03.html_para14">The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has commissioned a review from their Advisory Group on Non-ionising radiation (AGNIR). The AGNIR are well advanced in the process of preparing material for their report. The AGNIR report will require clearance by the NRPB board before it is released. It is anticipated that the report will be available for the NRPB's board meeting in July if not sooner.
<P>

<a name="10503w03.html_para15">If, during the course of the DERA and NRPB studies, commissioned by the Home Office, any issue arises which suggests a risk to health, it will be made public without awaiting the publication of final reports. However, the Stewart Report said that:

Alongside the wider studies into afloat support, we are currently evaluating whether further AOs would be a cost-effective solution to our future capability needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on investigations into illness suffered by British troops who received the meningitis vaccine in preparation for service during the Gulf war; if the meningitis vaccine contained the Pertussis vaccine; and which company manufactured this vaccine.  [159872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w05.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Up to around 5,000 Service personnel who deployed to the Gulf in 1990-91 may have received immunisation against meningococcal meningitis A and C. Initially, in August 1990, immunisation was recommended for all personnel who were to serve in the Gulf. However, by 15 September 1990, the immunisation was no longer recommended except for medical personnel and some other categories of personnel who may have been at risk.
<P>

<a name="10503w05.html_para6">Research sponsored by the Ministry of Defence has not specifically investigated a link between the meningitis vaccine and the subsequent ill health of Gulf veterans, and the Ministry of Defence is unaware of any reported association between the vaccine and subsequent ill health (with the exception of the known side effects). The meningitis vaccine did not contain the pertussis (whopping cough) vaccine.
<P>

<a name="10503w05.html_para7">The pertussis vaccine was used separately as part of the anti Biological Warfare immunisation programme as an adjuvant to accelerate the immunisation effect of the anthrax vaccine. There were two main suppliers of the meningitis vaccine. One supplier, Pasteur Merieux MSD, was the manufacturer of the product supplied. The other supplier was SmithKline Beecham; however we have yet to confirm the manufacturer. When we have done so, I will write to my hon. Friend and place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proportion of the beef consumed by the armed forces since May 1997 has originated from UK sources; and if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on the sourcing of all beef for the armed forces.  [159828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Unfortunately, there are no data available prior to October 1997. However, from that date to April 2001, 60 per cent. of the beef consumed by UK based armed forces has been UK sourced.
<P>

<a name="10503w06.html_para0">Since October 1997 the task of buying food for the armed forces has been contracted to 3663 (formerly known as Booker Foodservice) and it is the Ministry of Defence's policy to require them to seek the best price in the open market. Our contractor is required specifically to give full consideration to British products, which we look to them to buy wherever they are competitive. We have 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 720W</I><P>
given particular attention to meat procurement and over the last two years have worked closely with our contractor; the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; the Meat and Livestock Commission; and farmers' representatives to explore ways to increase the proportion of British meat we can buy competitively.
<P>

<a name="10503w06.html_para1">This has been a successful co-operation. In the case of beef we had, since the autumn of 1998, been supplying 100 per cent. British beef to our UK based service personnel, following the agreement we secured from the EC to release British intervention beef at competitive prices. However as was announced to the House on 24 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 555W, these stocks have now run out and market prices have dictated that a mix of British and imported beef will be required for future supplies. We are, however, working closely with those concerned to ensure that we can maximise the amount of British product that can be supplied competitively. In the case of beef they have identified opportunities to sources some 150 tonnes of prime British cuts which, when added to the 800 tonnes of British beef already secured, would mean that over 50 per cent. of the Ministry of Defence's requirement in the UK would be British.

 The Education Funding Strategy Group has been set up to take forward work on the proposals for education funding set out in "Modernising Local Government Finance: A Green Paper" and is supported in that work by a technical sub-group. The groups include key stakeholders with an interest in local education authority and school funding and details of the membership of both groups are outlined in the tables. Members of both groups are not appointed on the basis of their grade or qualifications but have been nominated by the organisations they represent. Representatives have been selected for their knowledge of the wide range of circumstances local education authorities and schools face and local government members represent a balance of different authority types, regions and expertise. The Education Funding Strategy Group's papers are available on the DfEE's website (www.dfee.gov.uk/efsg/). Separate papers are not prepared for the sub-group, as its role is to consider papers before they are submitted to the Education Funding Strategy Group. The Government expect to publish their proposals on the future arrangements for education funding later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much was received by local education authorities as <i>(a)</i> special and <i>(b)</i> specific grants in each financial year since 1997-98; and if he will make a statement on the distribution by LEAs.  [159578]<P>

 Listed are the Department's funding allocations for special and specific grants to local education authorities for each year since 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="10503w07.html_para0">Individual special and specific grants are distributed to local education authorities according to objective criteria, tailored to target geographical areas, or groups of schools, pupils, teachers or others, depending on the particular objectives of the grants and the relative need to spend to achieve those objectives.
<P>

<a name="10503w07.html_para1">Between 1992-93 and 1997-98, average recurrent funding per pupil fell by &#163;120 in real terms from &#163;2,830 to &#163;2,710. Since then, it has risen by an average of &#163;540 in real terms, to &#163;3,250 this year. By 2003-04, it will have increased by around &#163;750 in real terms since 1997-98.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Standards Fund/GEST figures are DfEE contribution only, and exclude Capital.<P>

2. In April 1999 the Ethnical Minority Achievement Grant became part of the Standards Fund; before this it was a Home Office funded section 11 grant.<P>

3. In 1997-98 approximately &#163;500 million were taken from the Nursery sub-block of the SSA to fund the Nursery Voucher scheme. This has been treated as Grant rather than SSA funding. Funding for Nursery Vouchers was returned to local government from 1998-99.<P>

4. Education Action Zone funding is paid to the Zone not directly to the LEA.<P>

5. Figures for 2000-01 are not yet finalised and may be subject to change. <P>

<a name="10503w07.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to introduce a Sure Start programme in Dartford to complement the recent allocation of money from the Children's Fund for new projects in Dartford to tackle social exclusion among children aged five to 13 years.  [159915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w07.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Districts are invited to submit plans for Sure Start programmes because collectively they have high levels of need and disadvantage and give a good spread between different types of area around the country. The DETR index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) has been used to identify areas where there are high levels of need. By April 2004, there will be 500 Sure Start programmes in disadvantaged areas reaching a third of under-4s. Although so far Dartford has not been invited to submit plans for a Sure Start programme, it is possible that it will be included in a future wave of programmes.

<a name="10503w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what steps he has taken to promote and encourage the teaching of swimming in schools;  [159932]
<P>
<UL>(2) what proportion of pupils in England undertake swimming lessons as part of the national curriculum.  [159933]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w07.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We do not hold specific figures on the proportion of pupils in England who take swimming lessons, as swimming is a compulsory part of the PE activities only at Key Stage 2 of the National Curriculum, unless pupils have met the full Key Stage 2 requirements during Key Stage 1. After Key Stage 2, it remains one of six physical activity areas. The Ofsted report on swimming at Key Stage 2, published in November 2000, showed that well over four out of five of the schools inspected provided adequate time for swimming. It also reported that four out of five children are able to swim 25 metres at the end of Key Stage 2. This was good news, but we acknowledge that we need to work with schools 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 726W</I><P>
to make even more opportunities available for more children to be able to swim 25 metres by the time they reach secondary school.
<P>

<a name="10503w07.html_para2">Swimming and water safety are important life skills, and we are investing heavily in school sport, and swimming will benefit. The Government's commitment includes &#163;580 million in England (out of a total of &#163;750 million in the UK) from the New Opportunities Fund for sport in and around schools and up to &#163;130 million to create multi-purpose sports and arts facilities in around 300 primary schools.
<P>

<a name="10503w07.html_para3">We have also established a Swimming Advisory Group, involving representatives of the swimming associations, Ofsted, QCA and DCMS, to discuss what more can be done to create even more opportunities for children to swim. We hope to announce proposals that will increase the numbers of children who can swim by the end of Key Stage 2, before the end of the year.

 The table sets out the number of candidates on the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH) who were recruited during the last two application rounds and began their training in the spring term of 2000 (cohort 7, old model NPQH) and the spring term of 2001 (cohort 1, new model NPQH). The figures

are broken down into the categories requested by NPQH region. The NPQH regions are similar to but do not precisely mirror Government Office boundaries.
<P>

<a name="10503w07.html_para4">The Government collect data on the ethnic background of NPQH applicants through the NPQH application form. Applicants are not bound to provide these data and, as a result, current analysis is not statistically meaningful.




<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 728W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10503w07.html_para5">The Government are concerned to ensure that all groups have an equal opportunity to prepare for headship and have improved the way that data are collected. They have asked the National College for School Leadership to develop strategies to ensure that currently under- represented groups increasingly apply for and progress through the NPQH.

 I am placing in the Libraries of the House today the latest graphs produced for the Chief Scientific Adviser's Group on the course of the disease. These demonstrate that in the seven day period ending Wednesday 2 May there was an average of approximately eight new confirmed cases each day compared with 16 in the seven day period ending 22 April and with a weekly average of 43 at the peak in late March. We can therefore be optimistic about the future course of the disease, although the Chief Scientific Adviser has warned that cases will continue to occur for some time yet.
<P>

<a name="10503w10.html_para1">It is clear that our policy to bear down on the outbreak swiftly and prevent spread of the disease through slaughtering of animals in infected premises within 24 hours of the case being reported, tracing dangerous contacts and tackling the disease on contiguous premises within 48 hours, has been effective.

[156374]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w10.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Ministry, National Assembly for Wales and the Environment Agency have agreed joint working arrangements and principles for disposal activities associated with foot and mouth disease. Ministry officials have held, and continue to hold, discussions with representatives of the Environment Agency and other Government Departments. These have included discussions on the merits of different options for the disposal of animal carcases.
<P>

<a name="10503w10.html_para2">At a local level the Ministry, (including the Divisional Veterinary Manager) Environment Agency, health authority, environmental health departments of local authorities and others are involved in assessing risk to human health and the environment and the options for disposal, taking account of the location, type and quantity of material for disposal.
<P>

<a name="10503w10.html_para3">Following a Risk Assessment, carried out by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), the Government decided to provide the option of burial for cattle born after 1 August 1996, as these younger cattle were born after animal feed controls were fully enforced and therefore pose the lowest risk of BSE infectivity of any cattle in the national herd. Older cattle will continue to be burnt or rendered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w10.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> There are two forms of napalm available, which both produce very toxic compounds when they burn. We therefore cannot use them because of the public and environmental health risks.
<P>

<a name="10503w10.html_para5">We recognise that burning at higher temperatures is more efficient and cleaner, and so there is a need to increase the temperature of pyres, particularly at the beginning of the burn while the water in carcases is being driven off. We have therefore commissioned urgent studies, in collaboration with MOD, on the possible use of gelled fuel mixtures to increase the temperature.

 <i>[holding answer 30 April 2001]:</i> The Strategic Rail Authority sent the report on their extensive study into the issues relating to rail travel on an east-west axis across London to the Secretary of State on 20 December 2000.
<P>

<a name="10503w10.html_para11">Following additional appraisal work within the High-Level Group (the Minister for Transport, the Mayor and the Chairman, Strategic Rail Authority), which was set up to develop a co-ordinated approach to London rail projects, we have agreed next steps. Work will start immediately on project definition and design development of a central, cross-London rail link, the tunnel section of which could follow the alignment of the CrossRail scheme. The work will look at alternative service patterns and access to Heathrow. This will lead to a recommendation on the option to be taken forward. At the same time, work will start on a feasibility study of a south-west to north-east London rail link, the tunnel section of which could follow the alignment of the Chelsea-Hackney scheme.

<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 743W</I><P>
force on 13 April. The main purpose of the Regulations is to enable the Secretary of State to issue directions under section 57(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requiring the holders of waste management licences for specified landfill sites to accept and dispose of specified kinds of agricultural waste.
<P>

<a name="10503w11.html_para9">It is necessary to ensure that waste arising from the foot and mouth disease outbreak is disposed of effectively and in ways which protect the environment and human health. The Regulations will ensure that suitable landfill sites can be used where necessary to dispose of specified kinds of animal waste. However, the powers of direction under section 57(1) of the 1990 Act will be used only where the Government consider that their use in relation to each individual site is essential; and to date no such directions have been issued. Unless and until a decision to issue a direction is taken, it is not possible to say how many working days will have elapsed between the termination of the consultation exercise and the implementation of that direction.

<a name="10503w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much central Government spent on <i>(a)</i> housing and <i>(b)</i> social housing in (i) actual terms and (ii) real terms (A) in each year since 1979 and (B) as projected to the end of the current funding review period.  [159689]<P>

<P>
<a name="10503w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 April 2001]:</i> The available information on the Department's allocations, or outturns, for its main programmes of housing capital investment and revenue expenditure since 1979-80 in England is set out in the table, with forecasts for 2002-03 and 2003-04. A revised local authority finance regime was introduced from 1990-91, and so the detail of prior years' figures is not directly comparable. Some of the resources allocated through the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund and City Challenge are applied to housing, but this element is not distinguished in the allocations and is therefore not included.
<P>

<a name="10503w11.html_para10">The tables do not reflect indirect support for housing by central Government through, for example, mortgage interest tax relief and housing related personal benefits such as rent allowances and rate/council tax rebates.
<P>

<a name="10503w11.html_para11">All expenditure by the Housing Corporation, and through Housing Revenue Account subsidy, Estate Action and Estate Renewal Challenge Fund allocations is wholly attributable to social housing. The Department's ACG, CRI and other allocations are not prescribed and authorities are free to apply these resources in support of both social and private housing in accordance with their own strategies and priorities. Private Sector Renewal Support Grant is applied exclusively to private housing, as is the majority of Disabled Facilities Grant expenditure.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

<i>ADP Gross Expenditure</i>:<P>

Excludes ADP funding of City Challenge, Rough Sleepers Initiative and ERCF. Data prior to 1981-82 is unavailable as corporation expenditure was not cash limited in this period. 1992-93 figures includes &#163;591 million under Housing Market Package. 2000-01 figure is forecast.<P>

<i>LA Housing Annual Capital Guidelines (ACGs)</i>:<P>

From 2000-01 the ACG incorporates allocations for private sector renewal and the Capital Receipts Initiative which were previously made separately. The introduction of Major Repairs Allowance (MRA) from 2001-02 caused a switch of resources from LA Housing ACGs into Housing Revenue Account Subsidy. Figures for 2002-03 and 2003-04 exclude the component of housing ACGs covering 'Receipts taken into Account' (RTAs); this amounted to &#163;199 million in 2001-02.<P>

Estate Action--Figures up to 1994-95 represent supplementary credit approval (SCA) and continuation scheme allocations; thereafter, direct grant payment outturns within the Single Regeneration Budget. There is no revenue expenditure attributable to Estate Action.<P>

<i>Capital Receipts Initiative</i>:<P>

Initial allocations<P>

<i>Private Sector Renewal Support Grant:</i><P>

Distributed via Specified Capital Grant Allowances 1990-91 to 1992-93; SCG-dependent SCAs 1993-94 to 1996-97.<P>

<i>Disabled Facilities Grant</i>:<P>

Initial allocations. DFG was included within SCG and SCG-dependent SCAs prior to 1997-98.<P>

<i>Estate Renewal Challenge Fund</i>:<P>

From 2001-02, ERCF baseline expenditure is included in ADP settlements.<P>

<i>Housing Action Trusts</i>:<P>

HATs figures include all revenue expenditure, except for 2002-03 and 2003-04. Figures for 2001-02 are allocations.<P>





<i>Housing Revenue Account Subsidy</i>:<P>

Includes the rent rebate subsidy element. Prior to 1990-91 rent rebates were part of the Department of Social Services programmes; outturn figures provided by DSS for the period 1984-85 to 1989-90 include those for Welsh authorities, but comparable data for earlier years are not available. A substantially revised HRA subsidy system was introduced from 1990, which includes MRA from 2001-02 (see note above).<P>

<i>Housing Corporation Revenue Allocations:</i><P>

Information as published in the Housing Corporation's Annual Accounts; figures for 2001-02 onwards include revenue spend on the Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund.<P>

 On 7 December 2000, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions announced the Housing Improvement Programme (HIP) figures. The unitary authority of Slough's allocation figure for the HIP programme 2001-02 totalled &#163;1,872,000. This is made up with the Annual Capital Guideline &#163;1,722,000 and the Disabled Facilities Grant (a specified capital grant) of &#163;150,000. The Major Repairs Allowance (MRA) 2001-02 for the unitary authority of Slough of &#163;4,731,300 was announced on 7 December 2000. The MRA covers repairs to local authority property. Funding towards repairs to regulated social landlord property is minimal. There is no funding for the local authority to build new properties. The Housing Corporation has published the allocation statement for the unitary authority of Slough on 17 April 2001 for new registered social landlord property totalling &#163;2,946,292. This is made up of &#163;2,714,576 for Mixed Funded Rent and &#163;231,716 for Mixed Funded Sale.

[160133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Minimum international requirements for the carriage of medical equipment on board aircraft are laid down in Joint Aviation Requirements. Decisions on the provision of equipment to deal with emergencies which go beyond these requirements are primarily a matter for airlines. I understand that many UK carriers already exceed existing requirements through the provision of items such as external automatic defibrillators, and are at the forefront of developing such initiatives as ground to air medical advice centres.
<P>

<a name="10503w12.html_para0">The Government are keen to ensure the widest possible use of best practice in this area, and is pursuing the matter through the recently established Aviation Health Working Group.

 The motorcycle training industry has played a positive role in the Government's Advisory Group on Motorcycling through the Motorcycle Rider Training Association, and in regular meetings with the Driving Standards Agency. Their participation helped us to frame the reforms to rider training, testing and licensing which were implemented in February. They have also assisted the independent inter-agency task group set up to prevent work-related road accidents for those who ride powered two-wheelers as part of their job. We welcome their involvement and look forward to carrying on the productive working relationship in the future. In particular, we shall look to the industry for assistance as we develop the statutory register of all those engaged in professional motorcycle training, which was announced in our Road Safety Strategy.

 A "Bellwin" scheme of emergency financial assistance may be activated to help a local authority with uninsurable clear-up costs following a disaster or emergency that involves destruction of, or danger to, life or property. Grant is normally paid at a rate of 85 per cent. of an authority's qualifying expenditure above a threshold. The threshold is the provision that a prudent authority might reasonably be expected to make for contingencies and emergencies (approximately 0.2 per cent. of its revenue budget).

A scheme will, therefore, be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant will be paid to cover 85 per cent. of the eligible costs above a threshold, which the Authority has incurred in dealing with the air crash.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Good Practice Guidance on Quality Bus Partnerships is being issued today by the TAS Partnership, on behalf of the Department. The guidance, which has 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 752W</I><P>
been prepared in consultation with bus industry and local government representatives, discusses the broad principles of partnership working, the factors to be taken into account in developing a scheme and the processes of consultation and review. It draws on case studies from among over 100 existing voluntary quality partnerships around the country. There will be scope to extend the guidance in due course to cover statutory QP schemes under the Transport Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para0">In fulfilment of undertakings given during the passage of the Transport Bill, the guidance includes a chapter devoted to competition issues, prepared in consultation with the Office of Fair Trading. This explains the application of competition law and seeks to offer reassurance on the scope for co-operation over such matters as joint branding and publicity, joint ticketing and voluntary agreements on minimum service frequencies.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para1">The guidance will be available in electronic form through the Department's website (www.detr.gov.uk) or in hard copy on application to TAS Publications and Events, Ross Holme, West End, Long Preston, Skipton BD23 4QL. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ivan Henderson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made in implementing measures to improve the safety of merchant shipping and safety at ports and harbours; and if he will make a statement.  [160479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Queen's Speech on 6 December outlined the Government's intention to draft a Safety Bill. We shall use this opportunity to introduce three groups of measures to improve the safety of merchant shipping in the UK and safety at ports and harbours.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para2">The first group would improve the way we deal with maritime safety incidents. The number of parties who are liable in the event of a marine pollution incident would be increased to improve access to compensation for claimants. We are also considering raising the limit of liability for compensation arising from the death of or injury to passengers on board foreign registered ships in UK waters from &#163;37,000 to &#163;250,000. The existing power of the Secretary of State to issue direction would be widened to equate power to secure the safety of a ship with those to prevent pollution. Fire authorities would be allowed to recover the cost of fighting fires at sea.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para3">The second group would improve the enforcement of shipping safety law. The Secretary of State has a power to make orders to apply merchant shipping legislation to things used at sea which are not currently regarded as ships. This power will be extended to waters which are not sea. It will be made easier to prosecute non-UK vessels for breaches of safety legislation. The penalties for safety offences will be increased so that they are on a par with those for pollution offences and health and safety offences on land.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para4">The third group make some improvements to the powers harbour authorities have to regulate marine safety so as to help them to implement the Port Marine Safety Code, which was developed after the grounding of the Sea Empress in Milford Haven in 1996. We are also including new procedures enabling a harbour authority to be 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 753W</I><P>
wound-up on safety grounds or to relinquish pilotage powers, both of which would save having to promote private legislation.

 I have today appointed Celia Cameron and Peter Chalke to the board.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many local authorities in England have completed their reviews and assessments of air quality; and which authorities in England have so far failed to do so.  [160598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In England, the statutory responsibility to carry out reviews and assessments of air quality applies to all London local authorities, all metropolitan and non-metropolitan district councils, and to all unitary county and unitary district councils. According to the records held by my Department, as of 2 May 2001 all of the London local authorities and some 89 per cent. of the remaining English local authorities had completed their reviews and assessments of air quality. A website providing further information on the progress made by individual authorities, and giving some indication of their findings, is available at www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/ airqual/aqma.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para6">As of 2 May 2001, the following 32 English authorities had not completed all stages of the review and assessment process. Each of these authorities has now committed itself to completing the process by a firm deadline in the near future, and my Department will continue to oversee this process closely.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Countryside Agency maintains a website: http://www.countryside.gov.uk/footandmouth/ giving general information about the opening of rights of way in each local authority's area. The website includes links to local authorities' own websites, many of which include detailed information about open paths. The Local Government Association has published best practice guidance for local authorities which recommends that authorities should use their websites to keep not only the public, but also public and tourist information agencies, informed of developments. We announced details last week of a &#163;3.8 million grant scheme to be administered by the Countryside Agency which will provide funding for measures to promote the reopening of rights of way, including publicity programmes and improvements to websites. We look to all local authorities to take the lead in opening up as many rights of way as possible, consistent with the Chief Veterinary Officer's guidance.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> On 24 April I announced the activation of the Bellwin scheme to provide emergency financial assistance to local authorities to help them meet some of the costs of responding to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, <i>Official Report</i>, column 278W. This scheme is based on Section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 which permits only the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by local authorities on, or in

<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para12">On 22 March, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced an increase in the central government contribution to local authorities to fund rate relief from 75 per cent. to 95 per cent. for small businesses who are suffering hardship as a result of foot and mouth disease in 151 rural authorities in England. This will apply for an initial period of three months. Details of the arrangements were given in Special Grant Report No. 80 which was laid before the House of Commons and approved by Parliament on 2 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para13">In addition authorities covered by Special Grant Report No. 80 will benefit from a temporary reduction of 50 per cent. in contributions to the National Non Domestic Rate Pool between April and August.

 RDAs are supporting businesses affected by FMD in a variety of ways including marketing campaigns and other indirect support.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what amount of rate relief has been given to businesses in rural areas under the foot and mouth relief scheme by 26 April; and if he will make a statement.  [159937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Applications for hardship rate relief are dealt with by individual local authorities. The central Government contribution to the cost will be met through subsequent claims to my Department. No figures are yet available centrally for the amount of rate relief granted by local authorities to businesses by 26 April.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason part of funding for hardship relief payments is being met by local authorities; and if he will take steps to ensure that such funding is borne by the Government.  [159369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Local authorities are required to meet part of the cost of their decisions to grant rate relief to businesses suffering from hardship to reflect the benefit to the local community. Central Government normally funds 75 per cent. of the cost of granting such relief. We have increased central Government's contribution rate relief from 75 per cent. to 95 per cent. where relief is granted to small businesses who are suffering hardship as a result of foot and mouth disease. This increase applies to relief provided in these circumstances by 151 rural authorities in England, for an initial period of three months.
<P>

<a name="10503w13.html_para14">This remains a discretionary rate relief scheme and it is therefore right that local authorities have a stake in the decisions they make on the award of rate relief. I am 



<P>

keeping the scheme under review on the basis of evidence of how it is operating and waiting for across the board evidence on local authorities' position from the Local Government Association.

<P>
<a name="10503w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2001]:</i> The Environment Agency is working in close co-operation with MAFF to ensure the fulfilment of the environmental requirements of Article 3(2) of the Animal Waste Directive (90/667/EEC) on the burial of animal carcases. Under the Groundwater Regulations 1998, the Agency carries out an assessment of each proposed burial site and, subject to the risk, authorises the burial with the imposition of any necessary conditions to protect groundwater. The Agency keeps copies of all such authorisations, and information relating to its assessment of each application, on a public register. As this information is available locally for each burial site, we have no plans to place copies of it in the Library.

<a name="10503w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10503w14.html_para0">No loans had been notified to the Small Business Service (SBS) by 26 April, for businesses covered by the extension of the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme (SFLGS). All loan applications are made direct to one of the approved lenders who will undertake their commercial appraisal and consideration of commercial finance before the SFLGS becomes an option.
<P>

<a name="10503w14.html_para1">Since the details of the Scheme changes were announced on 6 April the SBS and the lenders have undertaken much work. The legal framework of the changes has had to be agreed with the lenders and the lenders have had to put in place, at branch level, the necessary administrative changes. Many inquiries have been received about the changes but it is likely to be a while before this interest translates into new loans.

<P>
<a name="10503w14.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 In October 2000, the Department issued comprehensive information packs inviting health authorities to bid to join the Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening (UNHS) pilot. A national survey of the readiness of National Health Service trusts to deliver the service was also carried out. This is being used to inform decisions on the first phase of implementation.
<P>

<a name="10503w14.html_para9">Close communication has been maintained with all health authorities and NHS trusts taking part in the pilot. In addition, the Institute of Hearing Research has been commissioned to maintain an open access website giving details of the pilot methodology, progress on site and plans for the next stage.
<P>

<a name="10503w14.html_para10">The time scale for the national roll out will depend on the evaluative data from the pilot.

 My Department has no powers to carry out formal audits of expenditure by the London borough of Hillingdon, although officials scrutinise both the authority's estimates and claims for reimbursement and ask for an explanation of any changes from previous patterns of expenditure. Audit of Hillingdon's expenditure is a matter for its own internal auditors and for the Audit Commission.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans the Government have to introduce legislation to ban the import of oral tobacco products; when he intends to introduce such legislation; and if he will make a statement.  [158218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w15.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 None. So long as oral tobacco from overseas sources does not fall within a banned category, complies with United Kingdom customs duty regulations and carries health warnings, their import in the UK is not illegal.
<P>

<a name="10503w15.html_para0">However, we wish to ensure that people have information about health risks. We are, therefore, seeking to develop greater awareness of the health risks associated with oral tobacco as part of our tobacco information strategy. We are working on a dedicated campaign, focused on high-risk ethnic minority populations, to address the health risks of smoking and the use of oral

 The National Blood Authority's accounts for 2001-01 show a total income of &#163;315,436 million against a total revenue expenditure of &#163;311,456 million. Of the &#163;4 million surplus of income over expenditure, &#163;3.8 million is accounted for primarily by an increase in stocks of United States plasma purchased by the authority's bio products laboratory. Only &#163;200,000 is unspent cash.

 <i>[holding answer sent 30 April 2001]:</i> Information on the number of isolation wards in hospitals is not collected centrally.

<a name="10503w16.html_para0">Different levels of isolation are required depending on the infectious (or suspected infectious) nature of a tuberculosis case. Each patient is considered on a case by case basis and therefore, the need for isolation facilities is made at local level.

<a name="10503w16.html_para1">The Department has published recommendations on isolation in two documents.

 The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) has received reports of 26 cases of group W135 meningococcal infection including nine deaths following this years pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Some of those affected attended the Hajj, but two thirds are contacts of pilgrims in the community.
<P>

<a name="10503w16.html_para3">Following an outbreak of meningococcal W135 infection at last year's Hajj, on the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the United Kingdom recommended that travellers to the Hajj this year be immunised with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine which covers this strain. This vaccine was launched by the manufacturers for general use in early January 2001. Information was sent to all immunisation co-ordinators on 26 January informing them of these immunisation requirements for pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia for Hajj. This information was also distributed to health professionals via a Chief Medical Officer letter.

<P>

<a name="10503w16.html_para5">The PHLS Meningococcal Forum considered the outbreak and decided that the best control measure for the outbreak was the prompt antibiotic treatment of suspected meningococcal disease by medical staff. On 12 April the Department wrote to all doctors reminding them of the signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease and alerting them to the possibility of cases in the Muslim community.

<P>

<a name="10503w18.html_para2">The generating margin in future will continue to be determined by supply and demand conditions in the wholesale electricity market, as generators make commercial decisions to open new plant or close existing plant.

<P>
<a name="10503w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Surveys have located 360 particles on the seabed up to a radius of 2 km from the Dounreay site, and 268 have been removed. A further three particles have been detected beyond that distance, up to a maximum of 2.3 km radius, and were all removed.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para0">On the foreshore, 221 particles have been detected to date, of which 15 were found on the neighbouring Sandside beach. Only those recovered from Sandside beach were more than 2 km radius from Dounreay. All the particles found on the foreshore and Sandside beach have been retrieved.

<a name="10503w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I understand that UKAEA has undertaken a comprehensive programme of research, at a cost of &#163;1 million per year since 1997, into the routes by which particles may have reached the wider environment. The results have been reported to my officials and to the independent Dounreay Particle Advisory Group. Progress reports are available publicly from UKAEA and I will arrange for them to be made available to the Library of the House. This research has concluded that there is very strong circumstantial evidence that particles were discharged through the now redundant old low level liquid effluent system and other site drains in the 1960s and perhaps into the 1970s. There is no evidence of particles leaving the site after this time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has received of the number of radioactive particles thought still to be on the seabed within <i>(a)</i> a 10-kilometre radius and <i>(b)</i> a two-kilometre radius of Dounreay.  [160210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I have received no estimate of the number of particles thought to be on the seabed within the vicinity of Dounreay. The programme of offshore surveys and research UKAEA has under way is designed to help address this question. This programme has been under way since 1997, and is expected to conclude in 2002. It is not possible to estimate the number of particles on the seabed until the survey programme is complete. I have asked UKAEA to ensure that the results are made publicly available as soon as possible thereafter as part of the public consultation exercise.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will introduce programmes to effect the speedier detection and complete removal of radioactive particles on the foreshore and seabed within a 10-kilometre radius of Dounreay; and if he will make a statement.  [160212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The independent regulator, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), specifies a schedule of local beaches to be monitored, the frequency of surveying and the criteria for the detection of particles. In the case of Sandside Bay the schedule reflects a request in 1998 from the then Secretary of State for Scotland that there is sufficient monitoring to ensure that any particles finding their way to the beach are promptly detected and removed. In March 2001 SEPA published the interim report of the independent Dounreay Particles Advisory Group (DPAG). It concluded that for all practical purposes the criteria set by SEPA in terms of detection limits are being met by the current monitoring programme. Surveys of the seabed continue and the results will be brought to DPAG in due course. Further details of DPAG's work are available on the SEPA website www.sepa.org.uk.

 Compulsory tying-in of mortgages with insurance was one of the practices criticised at DTI's mortgage summit in 1999.

Consumers should now find it much easier to find a mortgage deal that does not prevent them from shopping around for insurance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he will make an announcement on the measures the Government will take to support those individuals and communities affected by the restructuring and redundancies planned by Corus.  [160592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10503w19.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Corus has today confirmed its intention to proceed with the job cuts it announced earlier this year. The Government's priority must now be to help the individuals and communities affected. I am therefore announcing a package of measures to assist those who face losing their jobs and plans to promote economic regeneration and job creation in the areas affected. A 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 777W</I><P>
similar announcement is being made in the National Assembly of Wales. In total the two packages amount to around &#163;135 million.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para1">To help individuals to deal with the immediate financial difficulties created by redundancy, the Government intend to introduce a scheme to provide aid for workers affected by restructuring in the steel industry. The Government intend to apply to the Commission for funding available under Article 56 of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty. Article 56 provides for social aid to assist workers who have lost their jobs as a result of restructuring in companies which produce products covered by the ECSC Treaty. We intend to provide a lump sum payment of around &#163;2,500 to eligible individuals, of which the UK Government will contribute half. Those eligible will be workers involved in the production of products covered by the ECSC Treaty. We will also make similar provisions for steelworkers covered by the special framework of the Treaty of Rome for whom Article 56 makes no provision. The scheme will apply from 1 January 2000 and it is anticipated that 12,000 workers in England, Scotland and Wales will benefit from this at a total cost of about &#163;32 million. The ECSC Treaty expires in July 2002 and the scheme will apply to eligible workers up to that date.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment is announcing the extension of the new Job Transition Service to all sites affected by the Corus redundancies. The Government will spend over &#163;5 million in England and Wales to ensure that everyone who is affected by these redundancies has access to an equal level of support in getting a new job.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para3">The Employment Service has already opened jobshops at Redcar, Scunthorpe and in South Yorkshire. In Wales there are jobshops in Llanwern, Ebbw Vale, Bryngwyn and Shotton. ES are liaising with Corus to assess whether additional jobshops or other facilities are needed as a result of this announcement.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para4">The new Job Transition Service (JTS), which is already being piloted in South Yorkshire as a result of last summer's announcements by Corus, will now be extended to all the affected sites across the UK. The service offers a new approach to assisting those affected by redundancy to find new jobs.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para5">Through the JTS, audits of the local economies will be carried out where major redundancies are taking place, and the Employment Service will work with local employers who are looking for new staff to identify their recruitment needs and analyse their skill requirements. Companies such as Nissan in the north-east have already been identified as potentially offering opportunities for Corus workers.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para6">At the same time, the JTS will provide anybody affected either directly or indirectly by these redundancies with personal advice on careers, financial matters and general skills development. More specifically, it will direct people to suitable vacancies, identify the skills they need to develop, and discuss their training needs. Training will be funded, and--where appropriate--customised programmes will be developed.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para7">In order to help develop this new service and ensure it is tailored fully to the needs of individuals, the DfEE and the Employment Service are working in partnership with 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 778W</I><P>
the unions and with Corus itself on a similar package of support and training developed by the unions to be provided before workers leave the company. A joint bid to the European Social Fund for &#163;2.5 million for England will be made in the next few weeks, with a similar bid being made in Wales.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para8">An Employment Credit for the over-50s going back to work will also be available to individuals affected.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para9">The Government are committed to helping the communities affected, and so we are backing projects crucial for economic regeneration, to ensure the long-term prosperity of all these areas.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para10">In the north-east, Dr. John Bridge, the chairman of ONE North East, the Regional Development Agency in the area, has been asked to establish a small group drawn from the key regional partners, including the existing Tees Valley Partnership, to build on the work undertaken by the task group established in response to the previous round of Corus job cuts. The group will pave the way for the establishment of an Urban Regeneration Company involving the five local authorities in the Tees Valley, to take this work forward over the longer term.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para11">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is also announcing a package of measures to help regenerate the Tees Valley. This includes: a &#163;20 million public sector project in Stockton to develop a Durham University campus and business park and to make environmental improvements; and support for the next stage of Middlehaven, a regeneration project in the Middlesbrough Docks. The Government will also fund feasibility studies into a new Tees crossing and a light rapid transport (LRT) scheme in the Tees Valley and is encouraging local authorities on Teesside to work up plans to improve transport infrastructure in the East Middlesbrough transport corridor. This is in addition to the &#163;5 million scheme to improve access to Teesside airport which was announced on 28 March. Finally, as announced on Monday 30 April, we will be given the West Central Hartlepool New Deal for Communities scheme &#163;53.79 million over the next 10 years.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para12">The Government are working with the Tees Valley Partnership, local industries and further education bodies to consider new research and development facilities. In addition, British Trade International has been asked to work with John Bridge to identify potential sites for inward investors. The Department of Trade and Industry will also be providing &#163;500,000 for the establishment of broadband and digital communications networks in the area.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para13">The redundancies will also affect Scunthorpe and its surrounding area. Following discussions with the local council and the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber, Scunthorpe will become a Tier 3 area for the purposes of the Enterprise Grant Scheme. To do this, we are redrawing the Assisted Areas map to make this support available. It will enable grants to be provided to small- and medium-sized companies moving into the area or increasing their investment there. We are also increasing the budget available for Enterprise Grants in the area by &#163;0.5 million. This will act as a major incentive to the establishment and growth of small- and medium-sized companies in and around Scunthorpe.




<P>
<P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 779W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para14">I am also asking the North Lincolnshire Steel Task Force, which was set up following the previous round of Corus closures, to advise on additional measures which could be taken in the area. These will take forward the actions set out in the Metal Related Industries Impact study, funded by DTI, and is looking both at Scunthorpe and South Yorkshire. The first report of the study is already with the Task Force, and we are asking them to identify immediate action points from the report and to assess what more needs to be done as a result of this round of cuts.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para15">As in Tees Valley, we are announcing up to &#163;500,000 funding to be allocated to the RDA to help with the establishment of broadband infrastructure and related education and training in the area. This will encourage the establishment and growth of nw companies and the evolution of existing ones.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para16">The South Yorkshire Jobs Steel Task Force will also extend the programme of regeneration in Sheffield and Rotherham to ensure that the projects recently announced for new inward investment provide employment opportunities for those affected by the steel redundancies. The Task Force is also developing a longer term action plan based on a recent impact study on metals related industries in South Yorkshire. This identified the scope for developing growth in these industries over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para17">This morning in the National Assembly of Wales, a package of measures was also announced. The First Minister made the following statement to the Welsh Assembly:
<P>

<a name="10503w19.html_para18"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Mr. Presiding Officer, following the final meeting with the steel trade unions earlier this morning, there is now little doubt that Corus is going to press ahead with the job losses announced on 1 February. Since then, the Trade Unions and Corus have been in discussion to see if less drastic restructuring options where possible. The unions put forward constructive alternative proposals for each plant but these have been turned down by the Company.
<P>
<BR>
We have worked almost on a daily basis with the unions to press the Company to come to its senses and to think long term. I want to take this opportunity to commend the unions on their unstinting efforts to find a solution to this human tragedy. They come out of this with enormous credit.
<P>
<BR>
Sadly, this whole episode highlights the short-term thinking of Corus management and their disregard of the communities that will be devastated by their job cuts and closures.
<P>
<BR>
Attention must now focus on offering practical support to the individuals and communities involved. Today I am announcing a &#163;66 million programme of action designed to help the individuals and communities most affected.
<P>
<BR>
In a few moments time details of a regeneration package on a comparable scale for steel workers and their communities in England--will be given in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Secretary of State has worked closely with us on this whole issue and will then be briefing Welsh MP's from steel areas as my Ministers and I will be doing. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of Wales will be covering the UK Government employment and other packages.
<P>
<BR>
The top priority must be to help people deal with the immediate financial problems caused by redundancy. The UK Government will therefore introduce a scheme under Article 56 of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty to provide aid for those worker affected under this round of job cuts and those in previous rounds back to 1 January 2000.
<P>
<BR>
This is a modern version of ISERBS scheme with which steel AMs and unions will be familiar from twenty years ago and involves a number of elements including lump sums for each 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 780W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>worker of &#163;2,500. This has been a complex negotiation involving the unions and ourselves as well as the Secretary of State for Wale, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Chancellor. The estimated figure for that part of the scheme which applies to Wales is &#163;16 million. It is subject to technical approval from Europe and that approval would include refunding of almost half the gross cost.
<P>
<BR>
Allied to this, we understand that the unions and Corus will be jointly applying for ESF funds to support a training package for workers facing redundancy. The overall cost of this package is likely to be around &#163;5.7 million in Wales and Corus have agreed to make a significant financial contribution to this.
<P>
<BR>
&#163;7 million of the &#163;66 million programme for Wales, is for employment and training measures funded by the Assembly. This will pay for extra employment and training provision for workers made redundant by Corus and its contractors plus their families and those in the supply chain.
<P>
<BR>
Many of those who will lose their jobs have considerable skills and talents which will allow them to find good, new jobs without too much difficulty. Others will need top quality advice and guidance and first class training if they are to move on successfully to new employers.
<P>
<BR>
We have agreed with the UK Government that the UK-wide Employment Service will increase its job information work in Wales and offer a wide range of services tailored to the requirements of Corus workers. This service will include vigorous marketing to employers and to sectors such as aerospace, electronics and automotive--which are particularly strong in Wales. In areas such as Deeside, special efforts will be made to work closely with major employers such as Airbus to match Corus workers to new job opportunities arising. We have also had approaches form other employers, including those in the gas and construction industries.
<P>
<BR>
The Employment Service has set up on-site Job Shops at each of the Corus plants affected. Here people can make use of the whole range of employment services. Benefits Agency staff will also be on hand to offer advice.
<P>
<BR>
We are also giving an extra &#163;250,000 to Careers Companies so that they can offer specialist support for those who need it.
<P>
<BR>
&#163;5.75 million additional money is being allocated to ELWa to provide training tailored to the precise requirements of the individuals concerned. This strand of the programme of action will include:
<P>
<BR>
Immediate access to training in place of the normal qualifying period of 6 months unemployment.
<P>
<BR>
Help for those who are in a position to train while under notice of redundancy.
<P>
<BR>
Short up-skilling courses linked to the current demand.
<P>
<BR>
Customised training to help people move from the steel industry to jobs in other sectors.
<P>
<BR>
Incentives for some employers to recruit Corus workers.
<P>
<BR>
Training to help with business start-ups; and
<P>
<BR>
Special help to remove barriers to work such as travelling, the cost of child care and such like.
<P>
<BR>
We are also looking at how existing programmes such as Modern Apprenticeships and the Modern Skills Diploma for Adults could play their part. We are talking to the Wales TUC and the Steel Trade Unions to see how help could be provided through the Wales Union Learning Fund and other measures. Up to &#163;1 million will be made available for these measures.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In carrying out its work, the Employment Service will do all it can to balance the needs of those who are already out of work with those of people who are likely to become unemployed in the near future.
<P>
<BR>
I also welcome the positive response by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment our representations to extend the Heads of the Valleys and Caerphilly Employment Zone to cover Torfaen. This will make additional help available for long term unemployed adults in an area close to the Corus plants affected.

<P>
<BR>
The regeneration measures in our programme for action have been developed following detailed discussions with the local councils most closely involved and the WDA. We will invest &#163;43 million in these measures over a period of years.
<P>
<BR>
These measures, including the training and development package, will be funded from the Assembly's own resources. The same situation applies across the UK. This is not ideal but today our priority must be the future of the steel workers affected. There will be other opportunities to debate the broader issues that this highlights.
<P>
<BR>
The programme announced does constitute real, additional resourcing and must not be confused with spending committed to other programmes. The Finance Minister will be looking again at the total package in the budget round later this year, in particular the allocation for 2003-04.
<P>
<BR>
European Structural Funds will also have a role to play in helping those cast aside by Corus and in the regeneration of their communities. For example, we are helping to create a Credit Union for Blaenau Gwent with support from ERDF money. In doing so, we will not be re-directing funding at the expense of any other part of the Objective 1 area. Similar considerations apply to other Assembly programmes such as Communities First--though some priorities may be re-ordered.
<P>
<BR>
The first element of the regeneration programme will be a &#163;2 million business support package to help suppliers who will be badly hit by the Corus closures to find alternative customers. This will also be used to help workers who are considering setting up their own businesses.
<P>
<BR>
The WDA will also be making a special effort to highlight the inward investment opportunities presented by the early availability of a high quality workforce in the areas most affected by the Corus job losses.
<P>
<BR>
If we take in turn the 3 areas of Wales affected; Deeside in North Wales; the communities taking the brunt of the losses in South West Wales at Gorseinon and Port Talbot; and finally that part of South East Wales most affected by the rundown of the plants at Ebbw Vale and Llanwern--Gwent more or less:
<P>
<BR>
First the position at Deeside where the job losses at Shotton will be a bitter blow to the area. Fortunately, owing to the buoyancy of the local economy, Corus workers will find a wide range of alternative job opportunities open to them compared to their colleagues in the other parts of Wales, with Ebbw Vale at the other end of the scale.
<P>
<BR>
The focus on Deeside will be on training and employment and business support. It makes sense to concentrate on enabling the maximum number of people to take advantage of the 1,700 new jobs created by Airbus at Broughton with the financial backing of &#163;19.5 million from the Assembly. Those 1,700 jobs are already understood to be supplemented by a further 200 jobs from the recent UPS order for A300 Airbus planes. Furthermore another 150 civilian aerospace jobs have been announced at DARA Sealand. If more needs to be done, then the case for doing so will be given priority when we review the spending plans for 2002-03 onwards.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At Gorseinon, the local economy has suffered a double blow with the recent announcement of the closure of the Valeo plant. Also, Port Talbot has had its share of the pain with planned redundancies. We are therefore providing some &#163;4 million extra funding for the WDA's South West Division to tackle the regeneration needs of the area. This is in addition to the higher level of investment already planned by the Agency in projects such as the Baglan Energy Park. There are immediate priorities that we shall discuss with the WDA and the local authority.

Turning to the major job losses in prospect at Ebbw Vale and Llanwern amounting to 2,300 direct Corus job losses plus 1,000 or so contractors. This area of South East Wales--Blaenau Gwent in particular--will need significant help. We will therefore invest nearly &#163;32 million of the &#163;50 million available for the programme 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 May 2001 : Column: 782W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of action in this area. The lion's share of this is earmarked for tackling the huge problems created by the complete closure of the Ebbw Vale works.
<P>
<BR>
We will work with our partners to ensure that we get the very best return from it in terms of new, quality jobs and stronger, more diversified local economies. Improvements to North South transport links between Ebbw Vale and the M4 corridor are bound to figure large in any planning for the future. In addition, we need to see what can be done to improve the quality of life in the towns and communities most affected by the job losses.
<P>
<BR>
It would be a huge mistake to invest simply in a series of unconnected projects. We must get the strategic framework right. I have therefore decided that we should agree the accelerated development of a comprehensive economic, transport and special framework for that part of South East Wales most affected by the closures and job losses.
<P>
<BR>
I want the Assembly to work with its partners to complete this exercise by the late autumn. The framework will need to make clear what improvements are required in the area's economic and transport infrastructure. It will therefore help us to prioritise the projects so as to achieve maximum impact. Later today, the Deputy First Minister will be discussing the details of this exercise with the Executive Group of the All Wales Steel Task Force.
<P>
<BR>
We will also be consulting on the most appropriate structure to assist with this regeneration. Newport county borough council, for example, has suggested the creation of an Urban Regeneration Company. This would not be another quango. It would be a partnership in which the local authority would play a leading role. A URC would be well placed to take advantage of the wide-ranging package of incentives for regeneration announced in the Chancellor's recent budget. However, we will look to see whether other structures could allow us to capitalise on incentives of this kind, in Newport and elsewhere.
<P>
<BR>
We have asked the Council, together with other agencies, to come back to us as soon as possible on their preferred structure for the redevelopment of the areas most affected by the job losses at Llanwern. Some &#163;200,000 will be made available immediately in start-up costs should there be support for URC. I do not exclude the possibility of a similar solution in other areas, but the URC does appear particularly appropriate to the circumstances of Newport.
<P>
<BR>
&#163;5 million will remain unallocated within the package to allow us to move ahead with priority proposals which emerge from the consultation process.
<P>
<BR>
As regards the future use of redundant land and buildings, the company has committed itself not only to co-operate on drawing up redevelopment plans but also to meeting its obligations on site remediation and its environmental obligations so as to maximise the potential for land regeneration and therefore the benefit to local communities.
<P>
<BR>
The Assembly administration is working on the clear principle that the public sector should not pick up the tab for the cost of on site reclamation.
<P>
<BR>
Potentially, the various Corus sites offer enormous economic opportunities for the areas involved. Unlocking these opportunities will take a huge amount of work, time and resources. Short-term job creation will need to take place off-site--on new or existing sits in the steel closure areas.
<P>
<BR>
Corus has created the problems we are dealing with today. It must also be part of the solution. I am therefore pleased that the Company will use UK Steel Enterprise, its wholly owned job creation and regeneration subsidiary--the successor to British Steel Enterprise, to assist with the creation of new opportunities for its displaced employees.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>drawing on the advice of the partner organisations involved, including local government, the unions, the agencies and--indeed--Corus itself.
<P>
<BR>
The Deputy First Minister will Chair the Executive Group of the Task Force. This will meet regularly with senior officers from the various organisations involved to manage and co-ordinate the programme across Wales. This Group will meet later today.
<P>
<BR>
Existing local arrangements will be built on to manage the process locally. We have enough groups and task forces already without adding to them. But the WDA has agreed to appoint Graham Moore--a senior director--to work with the administration and its partners to help manage this process across Wales and ensure we get the best return from the resources announced today.
<P>
<BR>
Mr. Presiding Officer, we have worked tirelessly with the unions and our partners in Wales and in Whitehall to convince the Company that it should scrap the job cuts, or if not scrap them, then at the very least defer, suspend or reduce them. These arguments have fallen on deaf ears. Our earlier commitment to do everything in our power to deal effectively with the consequences of the job losses for the individuals and communities involved now comes into play. This programme demonstrates that we have the will to honour it.
<P>
<BR>
By working with our partners across Wales I am totally confident that the communities involved will ultimately come out of this is a better position than they are now on the basis of new skills, new jobs and a better quality of life. We will report progress on the programme at regular intervals to the Assembly and the relevant committees".

Whilst the above figures may include complaints about the administration of the Attendance Allowance, it should be noted that they also include general expressions of disagreement with the amount of benefit awarded. Disputes of this nature must be pursued through the decision making and appeals process.
<BR>
You will be aware from my reply of 10 April 2001 to your previous Parliamentary Question about Disability Living Allowance complaints that they were subject to a steady increase arising from a temporary backlog of work following the introduction of new decision making and appeals procedures. Attendance Allowance claims and subsequent complaints were similarly adversely affected but, as with Disability Living Allowance, the backlog of work has now been cleared and the overall level of complaints has reduced since August 2000.

 The full national New Deal for Lone Parents programme has been in operation since October 1998, after being piloted from July 1997. By the end of February 2001, 86,161 lone parents have obtained jobs through the programme and a further 24,104 have entered

<P>

<a name="10503w22.html_para1">To ensure that as many lone parents as possible are aware of the help and support available to help them move into work, compulsory personal adviser meetings have been introduced from 30 April for lone parents claiming Income Support whose youngest child is of school age. Personal adviser meetings will be extended to lone parents with a youngest child of below five years old in some areas from October 2001 and then nationally from April 2002.

<a name="10503w22.html_para2">Personal adviser meetings are a condition of claiming Income Support. If a lone parent fails, without good cause, to participate in a personal adviser meeting when making a claim to Income Support, then the claim will not be processed. If a lone parent making a claim has received payment of Income Support because the meeting was deferred, but then fails to participate without good cause, Income Support will be withdrawn. If a lone parent is already receiving Income Support and fails without good cause to participate in the meeting, their Income Support will be reduced by 20 per cent. of the amount applicable for a single person aged not less than 25 years old. We do not expect to have to apply these sanctions very often. Personal Advisers will make several attempts to ensure that lone parents fully understand how important these meetings are before taking any action that will affect benefits.

To ask the President of the Council, pursuant to her answer of 16 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 764W, on people's peerages, what estimate she has made of the cost of providing the answer sought.  [159421]<P>

 That it was likely to be in excess of the guidelines figure beyond which an answer stands to be refused. My hon. Friend will also recall from the second part of the answer that to release the information requested would have been in breach of the Appointments Commission's undertakings to treat all personal information in individual applications in strict confidence.
