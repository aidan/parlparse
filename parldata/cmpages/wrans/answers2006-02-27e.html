<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence published its Defence Industrial Strategy in December 2005. This gives greater transparency to future UK defence requirements and sets out the industrial capabilities which need to be retained in the UK to meet those requirements. In doing so, it recognises that both MOD and industry will need jointly to develop and change their acquisition behaviours to adopt a through life perspective.

 Between November 2003 and December 2005 the cross-Government Conflict Prevention Pools contributed over &#163;30 million towards the training and equipping of the Iraqi Security Forces. It is not possible to collate the cost of the UK forces programme of training the Iraqi army because MOD identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred, not the individual tasks associated with operations.

 I have written to all MPs announcing that a Veterans Day will take place on 27 June 2006 and we will be marking that date as Veterans Day in future years. It is important that the nation should have an opportunity each year to recognise the contribution that veterans have made and that they continue to make to our life in the UK today. It will be a day to focus on veterans of all ages, raising public awareness of their achievements and celebrating these. The day will also be an appropriate occasion to celebrate the service given by those currently serving in the armed forces.

<p><a name="qn_9"><a name="60227w01.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> legal regime and <i>(b)</i> rules of engagement govern the activities of United Kingdom armed forces in Afghanistan as part of (i) the international security assistance force and (ii) Operation Enduring Freedom; and whether these will change in respect of the forthcoming Allied Rapid Reaction Corps deployment.  [48772]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 British troops in Afghanistan are deployed primarily under the international security assistance force (ISAF). ISAF operates at the request of the Afghan Government and with the authorisation of the United Nations. The latest Security Council resolution on the ISAF (UNSCR 1623) was agreed on 13 September 2005, and will remain in force until October 2006. UK troops deployed under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) operate in Afghanistan with the consent of the Afghan Government.

<p>
<a name="60227w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">UK troops in Afghanistan, whether under ISAF or OEF, will continue to act under UK rules of engagement (ROE), which ensure that UK military actions are consistent with UK law. However, as has been the practice of successive Governments, I am unable to comment in detail on the ROE under which our armed forces operate.

<a name="60227w01.html_para4">

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The role of British troops deployed as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Helmand is to support the Afghan Government as it extends its authority across the entire country and to assist its national security forces to maintain security. Responsibility for protection of sites and artefacts of archaeological or historical value lies primarily with the Government of Afghanistan. However, UK troops will show the utmost respect for local people, customs and Afghanistan&#039;s culture.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 A key role of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan is to provide a stable security environment to facilitate development 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 4W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and reconstruction work done by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and others. The UK will deploy the HQ Group of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps to lead the ISAF for a period of nine months from May 2006. British troops deploying to Helmand will support a UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, which will help enable NGOs to operate in that province.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of the unrest in Afghanistan on 4 and 5 February on the security situation there; and if he will make a statement.  [50364]</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The unrest that occurred between 4 and 5 February in Helmand province will have little impact on the overall security situation in Afghanistan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The incident initially gave cause for concern due to the significant numbers of insurgents and tribesmen involved in what is assessed to be a well planned and executed operation. However, the response by Afghan Security Forces against a determined and well organised enemy, with minimal coalition support, clearly demonstrates the increasing capability of the ANA and ANP.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 6 February 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> column 817W on Afghanistan, how the expected breach of Harmony guidelines caused by the planned deployment to Afghanistan will be managed.  [50728]</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Harmony guidelines are measured by average Tour Intervals for units and personnel. Breaches are managed in a number of ways, including through tailoring of force packages to achieve objectives in the most efficient way possible, and sensitive posting and deployment of personnel. Pressure is further alleviated through contributions made by other Allies, which we continue to encourage through the NATO force generation process, and through eventual reductions in UK force commitments elsewhere. Over the longer-term, programmes such as the Future Army Structure will help to bring Tour Intervals in line with Harmony guidelines.

 I cannot comment on threat specific assessments for reasons of operational security.

<a name="stpa_7">However, I am not aware of any credible evidence to suggest that insurgents or their techniques and procedures have infiltrated Helmand Province from Iraq or Iran. Helmand does not share a border with either country, but the armed forces of Pakistan have made extensive efforts, at considerable loss of life, to improve the rule of law along their border with Afghanistan. Iran has stated that it supports the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan and the efforts of

[53831]</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew15"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Under the terms of NATO&#039;s Operational Plan, ISAF troops can support Afghan counter-narcotics forces and operations in a number of ways, including by training Afghan forces, sharing information on the opium trade, supporting the counter-narcotics information campaign, and providing enabling support for Afghan counter-narcotics efforts. ISAF will also help provide the security environment in which the rule of law can be applied, traffickers can be effectively targeted by Afghan forces and a diversified economy capable of providing sustainable legal rural livelihoods for the farmers can be developed.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster what the retirement age is for civil servants; and whether his Department plans to change it.  [51496]</p>

 Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff below the senior civil service subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_52">Against this background, over 80 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions.

<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para1">
The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, heads of departments and agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_53">Legislation which will come into force in October 2006 will result in the normal retirement age in the United Kingdom being 65. As a result employers will not have to justify the decision to retire an employee after that age. This will be subject to review after five years. To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of all its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants.

 DFID&#039;s only current bilateral support for alternative livelihoods (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production) is in Afghanistan. Here, DFID&#039;s alternative livelihoods programme was developed substantially after full-blown conflict ended in 2001, although terrorist violence continues in parts of the country where we are supporting the Government to promote alternatives to poppy production. DFID also supports a UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) project in Myanmar, which aims to support the local population in meeting their food security needs following the banning of opium production.

A further &#163;16 million was provided in the 1980s and 90s to broader agricultural research projects in non coca-growing areas of Bolivia of which some 10&#150;20 per cent. may have had an impact on coca-growing households in adjacent areas.

 Afghanistan is the only country where DFID has a bilateral alternative livelihoods programme (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production). The Afghan Government launched its updated National Drug Control Strategy at the London Conference in January which sets out the Afghan Governments policies and plans for tackling Afghanistan&#039;s narcotics trade for the coming three years and highlights four key priorities. These are (i) targeting the trafficker and trade, (ii) strengthening and diversifying legal livelihoods, (iii) developing effective counter-narcotics institutions and (iv) demand reduction. The UK has a three year plan to support this and DFID leads on UK support for alternative livelihoods.

<a name="stpa_91">Between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 DFID&#039;s spending on alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan has increased ten fold. The forecast spend for this year is in the region of &#163;45 million and we hope to maintain similar levels of funding in future years. The DFID livelihoods programme will support the Afghan Government&#039;s efforts to mitigate the impact of those who have lost their livelihoods, through the expansion of key Afghan Government National Programmes into priority poppy growing provinces; support programmes to improve farm and off-farm opportunities for poor Afghan farmers and labourers to access legal income from sustainable legal employment, credit productive assets such as infrastructure and social assets such as education and health services, and markets for legal goods; help generate an improved policy and planning environment for alternative livelihood programmes; and support greater financial and technical support from other donors, delivered in a more coherent manner in line with the Afghan Government&#039;s policies and plans.

<a name="stpa_92">The success criterion for alternative livelihoods is a 10 per cent. year-on-year increase in uptake of legal livelihood opportunities.

 The African Union Mission in Sudan covers the three states of Darfur (Western, Northern and Southern).

<a name="stpa_94">Darfur remains highly dependent on food aid. Although this year there is expected to be above average food production, the ability of Darfuris to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas.

The AU has performed well in very challenging circumstances but the deterioration in security in Darfur since the end of 2005 has been marked by an increase in violence and banditry. This change has underlined that a peace support mission will be required for quite some time.

While the final decision on transfer needs to come from the AU, I welcome their agreement in principle on 12 January and the UN&#039;s planning for such a contingency.

The role the AU plays in providing support to the humanitarian agencies and protecting civilians is critical to the people of Darfur and there cannot be any winding down of effectiveness in anticipation of the UN arriving. The UK, therefore, in addition to providing substantial funding, is encouraging our international partners to maintain and increase their levels of support to the AU. This includes taking forward the recommendations of the December 2005 Joint Assessment Mission which will assist in strengthening the AU&#039;s capabilities.

 There is considerable suffering in Tanzania owing to the present food insecurity. The Government of Tanzania has made effective use of its Strategic Grain Reserve to deliver grain to vulnerable households, although the continuing drought means this is now under pressure. A Rapid Vulnerability Assessment (RVA), conducted by the Government in response to the food and water situation was circulated on 13 February. The RVA found that 3.8 million Tanzanians need food assistance to the tune of 100,000 metric tonnes up to the next expected harvest in May. Of those, around 565,000 are considered destitute and need immediate food aid. DFID stands ready to help the Government respond to this situation. We are consulting with other agencies, notably the World Food Programme, to determine the robustness of the RVA and inform decisions on assistance. DFID&#039;s response will be based on a proposal received from the Government of Tanzania, outlining what additional resources it needs from donors, and how it would like them delivered. Other donors are also likely to respond to the Government&#039;s proposal.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what baseline figures he is using for assessing progress on his Department&#039;s targets to reduce <i>(a)</i> the number of posts in the National Offender Management Service and <i>(b)</i> the Immigration and Nationality Directorate Headquarters by 1,170; what progress has been made towards these targets to date; and what the total efficiency savings achieved to date are for these targets.  [52937]</p>




<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60227w21.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 My Department&#039;s target is to reduce the size of the headquarters by 2,700 full time-equivalent posts by 31 March 2008 (of which the Department estimates that around 1,170 posts would be derived from reduction in headquarters functions in the National Offender Management Service and Immigration and Nationality Directorate). That is from a baseline figure for the size of the headquarters of 9,900 full-time equivalent posts in March 2004 (reported in my Department&#039;s value for money technical note, available via http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/our-service-to-you/?view=Standard). Of the total baseline, the National Offender Management Service accounts for around one third of posts in the headquarters, and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate around one quarter.

<p>
<a name="60227w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_59">In my 2005 Autumn Performance Report to Parliament (Cm 6707), I reported that my Department had reduced the size of the headquarters by 917 full-time equivalent posts, including posts in the headquarters functions of the National Offender Management Service and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. This reduction contributed &#163;32 million per annum cashable gains to the increase in value for money worth &#163;845 million per annum that I reported in respect of the financial year 2004&#150;05.

 London locational allowances are normally reviewed as part of the annual pay award settlements and takes account of the Home Office business needs to recruit and retain staff, local employment markets and cost of living pressures. The last review of these allowances occurred in 2005. For the non-agency Home Office these allowances were increased by 12 per cent. with a further review timetabled for 2007. For the Prison Service there was no increase in the value of local pay allowances in London.

Ten local authorities applied to conduct early voting from alternative locations, of which seven of these have been approved. Early voting from alternative locations has also been piloted in 2000, 2002 and 2003. Work on some of these pilots will help explore the potential future use of the technology available to enable voters to vote from any polling station in their local authority area.

 Rolling registration allows names to be added to the electoral register at any time of the year and enables people who have moved home or otherwise been excluded from being registered to be included in respect of their current place of residence. The Office for National Statistics published on 23 February figures in respect of the size of the electorate as of 1 December 2005 following the annual registration canvass which revealed that for the second successive year there has been an increase in the number of electors included in the electoral registers in the United Kingdom.

 The process for becoming a magistrate in Lancashire is the same as in other parts of England and Wales. Magistrates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor on behalf of and in the name of HM the Queen. Candidates are recommended for appointment by local Advisory Committees (ACs) following a two-stage interview process in which they will be assessed against six key personal qualities: good character, understanding and communication, social awareness, maturity and sound temperament, sound judgment and commitment and reliability. The process requires applicants to complete an application form, which is checked for eligibility. Successful candidates are subject to background checks for any conflicts of interest and exceptional circumstances before being recommended for appointment.

The necessary primary legislation to implement it in the UK formed part of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003.

 Folding bicycles may be carried on all trains at all times, free of charge.

This arrangement is common to all operators, although the exact time restriction may vary by route. Operators are encouraged to provide cycle facilities at stations and since 2004&#150;05 the Department for Transport has funded around 2,900 additional new cycle parking spaces at stations across the rail network.

 Information on monthly sales of biofuels and all other transport fuels is available from the HM Revenue and Customs website at http://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=facthydro. The data for November and December 2005 are still provisional at this stage, but suggests that, across the year as a whole, sales of biofuels accounted for some 0.25 per cent. of total transport fuel sales. The Government&#039;s recently announced Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation is set to deliver a huge increase in UK biofuels over the next few years, and will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that, by 2010, biofuels account for 5 per cent. of their total sales.

Any change to the impact on the environment is therefore likely to be negligible and no Environmental Impact Assessment is planned.

We have already made regulations that will lift the exemption in relation to public transport-buses and coaches, trains and trams, taxis and private hire vehicles-as well as for vehicles used on leisure and tourism services, vehicle hire services and vehicle breakdown services.

The figures for 1997 to 2001 are based on a combination of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA) return, and the Housing Corporation&#039;s Regulatory Statistical Return (RSR). For the years 2002 to 2004 the figures are based on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Council Tax Base 1 (CTB1) return.<br>

These figures are for all vacant dwellings, including dwellings that have been empty for fewer than six months, some for less than 1 month. The Government are introducing new powers from April 2006 for local authorities to reduce the number of long-term empty homes in their area.<br>

 Funding for the Firefighters&#039; Pension Scheme was not separately identified within the grant distributed to Fire and Rescue Authorities for the years between 1997 and 2005. From the 1 April 2006 the new arrangements for financing firefighter pensions will ensure that funding allocated to support the cost of the Firefighters&#039; Pension Scheme is separately identified. This is designed to increase transparency in authorities&#039; budgets, in that they will more accurately reflect the ongoing accruing costs of providing the frontline service.

 It is not possible to calculate how much funding has been allocated to each authority with respect to concessionary fares, since this is funded through an unhypothecated formula grant.

<a name="stpa_241">Information is also collected on the number of people who sleep rough, that is, those with no fixed abode who are literally roofless. As at June 2005 there were an estimated 459 people sleeping rough in England on any one single night, the lowest ever recorded figure. In 2001, a survey estimated that 14 per cent. of rough sleepers had served in the forces at some point in their lives, although more recent analysis suggest this has fallen to 10 per cent.

 The Government&#039;s understanding of the causes of homelessness and the actions that can be taken to tackle it more effectively was summarised in 2005 in the strategy for tackling homelessness, &quot;Sustainable Communities: settled homes, changing lives&quot;. This endorsed the analysis in the 2002 report &quot;More than a roof&quot;. Homelessness is caused by a number of factors, some of which relate to the wider state of the economy and the housing market and others which are personal to the individual or family, or reflect social and demographic change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w49.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_243">The overall supply of affordable housing is a key structural factor and the Government are increasing investment to deliver 75,000 social rented homes and 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low cost home ownership by 2008. Options for making greater use of the private rented sector as a source of settled solutions for homeless households are also being developed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w49.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_244">Local authorities are asked to record the reasons when they accept a household as being unintentionally homeless and in priority need. The most recent statutory homelessness statistics for England (for the third quarter of 2005) are on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website. The most important recorded reasons are parents, relatives or friends no longer willing to accommodate the household, the breakdown of a relationship with a partner and the ending of an assured shorthold tenancy. Since 2002 the Government have promoted an increasing emphasis on developing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 180W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
innovative approaches to the prevention of homelessness. Successful approaches to homelessness prevention have been developed to address the presenting problems of households approaching local authorities, for example mediation to resolve family and relationship breakdown and rent deposit schemes to provide access to the private rented sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w49.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_245">It is recognised that the recorded reasons often obscure a complex chain of events that preceded the homelessness acceptance. At present relatively little is known about the personal, social and economic circumstances of homeless families and other vulnerable people accepted by local authorities, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is undertaking further research to improve understanding of the deeper social and personal issues involved. To address this gap in the evidence base the ODPM is currently conducting a major survey of households with children and of young people accepted as homeless by local authorities on the causes, impacts and costs of homelessness. This study will report in the summer of 2006 and results will be published later this year.

In September 2005, it was agreed that his remit should be extended to consider issues of role and function before the finalisation of conclusions on funding.

While they are generally operating satisfactorily, we are not complacent. There is still some room for further improvement, such as in complying with timetables for the production of proofs of evidence for inquiries and statements of common ground between the main parties and in providing realistic estimates of the time likely to be required to make submissions and the number of witnesses to be called. However, where a party fails to adhere to the timetables, there is power to disregard late representations. Moreover, if that failure is unreasonable and leads to another party incurring unnecessary expense, the power to award costs also provides an effective discipline in the case of hearings and inquiries. For its part, the Planning Inspectorate is actively managing improvements to its own performance in arranging hearing and inquiry dates in the face of a continuing high level and variety of casework which places conflicting demands on the available inspector resource.

NDPBs have all submitted efficiency delivery plans to the Department, which have been scrutinised to ensure that only genuine efficiencies have been included. Local authorities submit Annual Efficiency Statements that set out how they propose to make their efficiency gains.

Nevertheless, in recent years my Department has advocated strongly the cause of public libraries across both central and local Government. This has ranged from the publication of Framework for the Future, the first ever national public library strategy document in 2003 to, most recently, the letters I have sent to the Council Leaders of every library authority in England reminding them of the community value of public libraries and asking them to consider carefully what might be lost through closures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w59.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_12">We have introduced library standards to underpin core provision and, more recently, impact measures to highlight the contribution that libraries make to wider community agendas in the context of the shared priorities of central and local Government.

 The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 gives the Secretary of State a range of powers to intervene formally in a library authority but only where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the authority concerned is in breach of its own duty under that legislation.

<a name="60227w59.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_13">Although I regret any library closure, I do not believe that Lancashire County Council&#039;s decision to close 9 of the County&#039;s 85 static libraries puts them in breach of their statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service at this stage. However, I reserve my position to intervene, through the proper Government channels, at some future point and my officials will watch the emerging situation in Lancashire closely.

 Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, library authorities are required to provide a comprehensive and efficient service.

<p>
<a name="60227w59.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_16">On average, 7.6 staff per library authority are involved in some aspect of stock selection. There is a very wide range between authorities, anything from one to 37. This will be the result of a number of factors, such as size and location of library authority, systems for selection (e.g. any out-sourcing), whether done centrally or in individual branches and time spent per member of staff will vary considerably.

 It is not feasible to make deduction from earnings orders (DEO) automatically transferable to new employers.

<sup>(69)</sup> Projected Outturn<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Prior to 2000 the CSA did not have a dedicated Commercials team, the necessary expertise was provided by the Department for Work and Pensions.<br>

2. The CSA Commercials Team was built up gradually once the contract with EDS was signed in August 2000. It is important to note that this team are not solely responsible for IT procurement but are also heavily involved with other DWP contracts that CSA use.<br>

3. Specialist external commercial expertise was employed during 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05. Over an 18 month period this private sector expertise resulted in knowledge transfer to existing civil servants and is therefore not currently required.<br>

Figures reflect the average monthly payment (both regular maintenance and arrears) made to parents with care by the Agency for collection service cases. As such, this excludes maintenance received from non resident parents that went directly to the Secretary of State as the parent with care was on benefit, but includes child maintenance premium payments.<br>

Purpose:<br>

The programme will transform the way that the Pension Service delivers its business. This will bring significant improvements and convenience for pensioners as well as benefits to the taxpayer in terms of efficiencies. The original programme was planned to be delivered in five waves of change (learning lessons from other programmes of change) between 2002 and 2006. The first phase of the first wave of change involving new state pension claim processes was deployed in three pension centres between August and November 2005. The next phase involving all pension centres for new customer applications for state pension and pension credit will commence July 2006.<br>

Following re-planning of the delivery of the programme it was agreed that the three latter waves of change would be delivered more affordably over a longer period. The first two more significant waves will be completed by March 2008. The final waves 3&#150;5 will be completed by 2010.<br>

 No badgers were culled as part of the Road Traffic Accident Survey. Rather, it was designed to establish if the level of bovine TB infection in dead badgers, collected from road accidents, reflected disease prevalence in the wider badger population in an area. This has been done by comparing survey data with findings from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT).

<p>
<a name="60227w69.html_para1">
Post mortem examinations were carried out on 3,769 badgers during the course of the survey and results show that around one in seven of these animals had TB (based on 2002&#150;04 figures). The overall prevalence figures were 17 per cent. in 2002 (95 per cent. confidence interval (CI) 14&#150;21 per cent.), 13 per cent. in 2003 (95 per cent. CI 10&#150;15 per cent.) and 15 per cent. in 2003 (95 per cent. CI 13&#150;18 per cent.). Not enough badgers were collected, however, to allow parish-level prevalence estimates to be made.

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60227w69.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b>

<a name="stpa_121">However, a review undertaken for the consultation (http://defraweb/corporate/consult/badgers-tbcontrols/index.htm) identified sett-based fumigation, using carbon monoxide (CO) gas, as a possible feasible and humane technique. The main issue in relation to humaneness and effectiveness is that lethal concentrations of CO gas will be attained quickly throughout most parts of any sett. If that can be achieved then concerns .about sub-lethal dosing, either with CO or other contaminants in the exhaust gases, will be reduced because toxic concentrations of gas will kill quickly. Work is currently underway to assess this.

<a name="60227w69.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_122">While some early results from this work should be available by the end of March, the delivery of the full report, with any recommendations for future work, should be ready by May 2006. If the model is validated then this will allow us to predict the risks and effectiveness of different strategies. If the model proposed in the consultation is not validated then the data from the field trials will allow determination of whether using a suitable, de-tuned, vehicle petrol engine is a viable method of producing lethal concentrations under specific circumstances. If the trial work demonstrates that lethal concentrations can be achieved through most of a sett, then there may be confidence in gassing as a technique for killing badgers during 2006. However, further work is very likely to be needed to ensure, efficient and safe mechanisms for delivery of gas. Data supporting the use of CO will also need to be submitted for approval as a vertebrate control agent. The earliest it is foreseen that this further research work could be completed would be March to May 2007.

<sup>(71)</sup> TB reactors plus direct contacts.<br>

<sup>(72)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.<br>

<p><a name="qn_147"><a name="60227w70.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects to make a decision on whether compost material should be defined as a product rather than waste.  [50530]</p>




<p><a name="st_147"><a name="60227w70.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in article 1 <i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste, and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w70.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_129">The composting of waste is classified as a waste recovery operation under the WFD. This means that composting must be carried out under the terms of a waste management licence issued by, or a waste management licensing exemption registered with, the Environment Agency (England and Wales).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w70.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_130">The ECJ has ruled that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_177">&quot;Whether [a substance] is waste, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w70.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_131">In practice, this means that waste does not cease to be waste until it has undergone a complete recovery operation and has been fully recovered within the meaning of the WFD. A complete recovery operation is one which has the effect of transforming waste into a product which is wholly interchangeable with another product and requires no additional regulation or supervision beyond that applicable to the product which it is replacing. Waste has not undergone a complete recovery operation if, after the operation has been carried out, it continues to present a danger typical of waste (e.g. it continues to be contaminated).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w70.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_132">The Environment Agency considers that <i>(a)</i> source-segregated waste which, after composting meets the relevant tests, including the achievement of a recognised and suitable quality standard (e.g. BSI PAS 100), certainty of use and no risk of pollution of the environment or harm to human health, is likely to be fully recovered within the meaning of the WFD; and <i>(b)</i> mixed waste which is composted is likely to remain waste until it is used in a further recovery operation (e.g. land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement) subject to control by the Agency under a licence or registered licensing exemption. These considerations are being taken into 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 268W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
account in work currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on the development of a quality protocol for waste composting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w70.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">There is also now the prospect of similar work being undertaken at a European Union level following the publication, on 21 December 2005, of the European Commission&#039;s &quot;Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste&quot; together with a proposed revision of the WFD. The proposals are available on the Commission&#039;s website at http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/waste/strategv.htm and include, in the draft revised WFD, a provision which would enable the adoption of environmental and quality criteria for specified waste streams. Where these criteria are met, the effect would be to deem that the recovery of the specified waste had been completed and that it had ceased to be waste. The Commission&#039;s &quot;Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste&quot; proposes that the waste streams addressed by this system should include compost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w70.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">The Department supports the development of protocols at national level and advocates the development of similar work at a European Union level. A key objective of our doing so is to enable our competent authorities, and those engaged in the recovery of waste, to determine with a high degree of certainty the point at which waste has been fully recovered for the purposes of the WFD and has ceased to be waste.

Establishments and undertakings composting biodegradable waste should obtain either a waste management licence or can benefit from an exemption from waste management licensing providing they satisfy a number of general rules.

<a name="stpa_136">A taskforce has been established to consider the current exemption from waste management licensing for some composting operations.

<p><a name="st_177"><a name="60227w73.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) is a Defra programme designed to assist local authorities (LA&#039;s) achieve EC Landfill targets for Biodegradable Municipal Waste. The Programme offers LA&#039;s various toolkits and advice and aims to promote the Waste Hierarchy as set out in the Waste Strategy (Minimisation, Reuse, Recycle, Recovery, Landfill). Minimisation lies at the top of the tree with landfill at the bottom. Recycling plays an important part in the diversion process and as such LA&#039;s are encouraged to examine recycling possibilities, which enable them to meet their targets which in turn allows them to avoid penalties under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_157">WIP achieves this through a number of levers. For example WIP has recently run a series of Efficiency Roadshows designed to spread best practice (including in the recycling field) and to encourage LA&#039;s to consider the greater use of partnership working.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_158">From 2002&#150;03 to 2005&#150;06 the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund has distributed over &#163;275 million to local authorities across England to improve their waste minimisation, recycling and composting performance. This has been through a competitive process whereby bids have to be approved before the monies released. London authorities received &#163;45.45 million from the overall pot through a scheme administered by London Waste Action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_159">In 2005&#150;06 there has been further financial help available to local authorities through the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant. This is an un-ringfenced grant whereby the money can be spent on any service not just waste. &#163;40 million was available in 2005&#150;06 and this will rise to &#163;105 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;110 million in 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_160">PFI offers financial support to LA&#039;s for the development of long term waste processing infrastructure, such as Energy from Waste facilities. In the Spending Review (SR) 2002 (covering the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06) Defra was allocated &#163;355 million towards the funding of waste PFI projects. The SR 2004 (covering the period 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09) allocated an 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 278W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
additional &#163;275 million of PFI credits for waste PFI projects, over and above the &#163;355 million available from the 2002 Spending Review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_161">WIP also encourages LA&#039;s to consider collaborations with the Community and Voluntary sectors who have recognised expertise in the reuse and recycling fields.

<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_162">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) uses Defra funding to carry out a number of activities in the minimisation, reuse, and recycling sectors. One important area relates to Education and WRAP have run the very successful &quot;Recycle Now&quot; campaign which raises public awareness of the benefits of recycling. WRAP have also managed a Home Composting campaign which provides information on composting to LA&#039;s and the general public and offers LA&#039;s composting bins at reduced prices for distribution to householders.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the recycling and recovery capacity London requires for its municipal waste by 2020; what percentage increase on current capacity this represents; and what steps her Department is taking to ensure this new capacity is delivered.  [51827]</p>




<p><a name="st_178"><a name="60227w73.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra does not collect this information. However, the Greater London Authority estimate in their Alterations to the London Plan Policies on Waste Technical Report that in 2003&#150;04, London had the following capacity: 1.32 million tonnes (494,000 recycled, 826,000 tonnes per annum incinerated). The Greater London Authority estimate that by 2020, London needs 2.724 million tonnes of recycling and composting capacity and 2.892 million tonnes of recovery capacity; this is an estimated increase of 325 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w73.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_163">Decisions on waste management services and the provision of waste facilities in London are a matter for individual local authorities, joint waste disposal authorities and the Greater London Authority.

<p><a name="st_179"><a name="60227w73.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 In 2003&#150;04 eight London authorities met or exceeded their statutory performance standards for recycling and composting. The table outlines performance in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 and the statutory performance standards in 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 for each authority in London.

challenges doing so. Since it began work in 2001 the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has had a positive impact in working with business to remove barriers to developing recycling markets and products. WRAP engages with producers, purchasers and investors and has developed both advisory services and guidance to support business entering the field of the recycling industry. For example, WRAP&#039;S Business Development Service (BDS) is a free service for SME recycling businesses which provides a range of practical help and guidance, giving businesses the opportunity to maximise their chances of securing commercial finance. The BDS has a proven track record of success doing this; in the last four years it has helped raise over &#163;6 million for 15 businesses. Other support services which WRAP provides include the UK&#039;s first venture capital fund dedicated to the recycling sector,

equipment leasing guarantees, intellectual property rights awareness, and training and investment opportunities. These programmes offer companies support for growth, innovation and increased investment in the recycling industry.

 Due to the nature of a tradable allowances scheme, it is not possible to accurately assess whether any Waste Disposal Authority is likely to landfill biodegradable municipal waste in excess to that which it hold allowances for at the end of the scheme year. At the end of each scheme year on 31 March annually there will be a six-month reconciliation period. During this period Waste Disposal Authorities will have three months to submit their end of year data. During the following two months, the Monitoring Authority (the Environment Agency) will provide each authority with a draft reconciliation between the amount of biodegradable municipal waste the Waste Disposal Authority landfilled and the number of allowances it holds. Should any Waste Disposal Authority have landfilled more waste than it holds allowances for, it can then use the sixth month to trade or borrow allowances to balance the figures. Any Waste Disposal Authority which has landfilled biodegradable municipal waste in excess of the allowances it holds at the end of the reconciliation period will be liable to a financial penalty of &#163;150 per tonne (Section 9(2) of the WET Act).

Reforming the army and security sector is therefore a high priority. The UK is working on this bilaterally and through providing experts to the EU army and police reform missions in DRC. The UN mission in DRC, with strong UK support, plays a key role both in protecting civilians and through its robust military action, often supporting Congolese military efforts, to neutralise the armed groups operating on DRC territory.

 The number of UK based staff employed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) for each of the past 12 months are shown in the following table. Staff are deployed in a large number of locations overseas and, in the UK, in London and Hanslope Park, near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. It is difficult to quantify vacancies on a month-by-month basis in a meaningful way, or on a regional basis. Generally FCO staff change jobs on a two to four yearly basis, often involving moves between the UK and overseas. Not every job is therefore necessarily filled immediately but gaps do not necessarily represent jobs available to be filled from outside the FCO.

 It is a condition of employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have the legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore makes provision to help staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations in two circumstances:

<p>

<a name="stpa_191">Children who accompany their parents on postings overseas are expected to use free state schooling if it is available locally and is of a suitable standard.

<a name="stpa_192">With staff moving every 12&#150;48 months and education facilities at posts&#039; locations overseas varying, continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years.

Article 31 of the Convention grants immunity to a diplomatic agent from the criminal, civil and administrative jurisdiction of the receiving state, except in cases relating to property, succession, or professional and commercial activity in which the diplomat has acted in a private capacity. Article 29 provides that the person of a diplomat shall be inviolable, and that he shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention. Any request for extradition of a diplomat could only be given effect if a waiver of his/her immunity were granted. Any decision to request such a waiver would be made on the merits of the case.

The Rwanda National Police has assured us that it investigates all allegations of crimes against genocide survivors and witnesses involved in genocide related &quot;gacaca&quot; trials. The &quot;gacaca&quot; criminal justice system requires that witnesses should be able to come forward in safety. It is therefore in the Government of Rwanda&#039;s interest to investigate all allegations of witness intimidation.

 There is currently no UN mandate covering peacekeeping operations in Darfur, where operations are being conducted by African Union personnel (AMIS) on the basis of an Memorandum of Understanding between the African Union (AU) and the Government of Sudan. The UK and other international partners recently participated in a joint assessment mission with the AU. This concluded that AMIS&#039; current mandate is adequate, but is not clearly understood by commanders at all levels. We will continue to press the AU to interpret its mandate flexibly and robustly in order to provide the necessary degree of protection to civilians within its capabilities.

 Leaders agreed at the UN World Summit on 14&#150;16 September 2005 that a new UN Human Rights Council should be established as soon as possible during the current session of the General Assembly. We have worked hard to support the efforts of the president of the General Assembly to reconcile a range of different views on the mandate, function and modalities of the council, building on the existing Commission on Human Rights. We support his view that there is now a window of opportunity to agree on the council this month. We expect him to issue a final text on its establishment very shortly, with a view to its adoption by the General Assembly in the next two weeks. We are encouraging him to keep to this timetable, so long as it is not to the detriment of achieving an effective council. According to the latest draft text, the council would convene for the first time on 16 June 2006. We consider this realistic.

 The Financial Services Authority (FSA) leads the National Strategy for Financial Capability in partnership with Government, the financial services industry, employer organisations and trade unions, the media, consumer bodies and the voluntary sector. In May 2004 the FSA set out its plans in Building Financial Capability in the UK&quot;. A number of initiatives were piloted and last October the FSA decided to concentrate on seven key projects that were considered the most likely to result in a step change in financial capability.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_22">The FSA has conducted a baseline survey into levels of financial capability within the general UK population and the results are due to be published at the end of

March. The survey will be repeated every four to five years. In addition, the FSA will report annually, via its annual report, on progress on the National Strategy.

<a name="stpa_23">The Government fully support financial education. So the Chancellor announced in the 2005 pre Budget report that financial capability will be embedded more explicitly in the schools curriculum by including it in the new functional mathematics component of GCSE mathematics. The Government are also taking steps to strengthen adult financial capability. Building on the work of Skills for Life it will embed financial capability in functional maths aimed at adults and encourage local authorities to provide more financial education to parents through Sure Start children&#039;s centres and locally delivered family numeracy activities.

 In Promoting financial Inclusion&quot;, published alongside the 2004 pre-Budget report, the Government recognised that the majority of consumers manage their borrowing effectively, but that there are a minority for whom over-indebtedness can be a problem. For these vulnerable individuals, the supply of free face-to-face money advice falls far short of demand.

<p>
<a name="60227w89.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_24">In order to meet the Government&#039;s aims to see an increase in the capacity of money advice for financially excluded individuals, the Government have allocated &#163;45 million of the &#163;120 million Financial Inclusion Fund to the Department of Trade and Industry to support an increase in the provision of free face-to-face money advice. In addition, &#163;6 million of the Fund has been allocated to the Department of Constitutional Affairs to pilot methods of money advice outreach aimed at those who do not normally present themselves to debt advisers.

<sup>(82)</sup>Estimate is based on migrant inflows captured from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). All estimates are subject to margins or error since they are derived from a sample survey.<br>

<sup>(83)</sup>BOTs are included in All Commonwealth.<br>

<sup>(84)</sup>Figures for all years include Malta and Cyprus in the Commonwealth.<br>

<sup>(85)</sup>Reliable estimate is unavailable for individual year; data have been grouped to produce more reliable estimates for 1998&#150;2004.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.A small weighting adjustment has been applied to IPS data for 1998. This reflects the estimated effect of applying the weighting improvements made to IPS data from 1999 onwards.<br>

2.As a result of a change in our processing system there may be slight differences in our historical tables for 1999&#150;2003.<br>

 As set out in the consultation document published alongside the 2005 pre-Budget report, a planning-gain supplement (PGS) would capture a portion of the increase in land value created by the grant of planning permission to help finance the infrastructure needed to support new development. PGS would be used to ensure that land value uplifts benefit local communities and support efforts to expand housing supply.

This program of work included a series of local authority studies carried out in 2004 which were designed to improve the MYEs in the areas that proved hardest to count in the Census. The results of these studies showed that better estimates of the population could be made in 15 areas and an adjustment was made to the MYEs in these areas. For the rest of the country, including the eight local authorities in Staffordshire, it was found that the 2001 Census-based population estimate remains the best estimate of the population.

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 344W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">It should be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons. Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differentia impact from place to place.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme&#095;population/LAStudy&#095;FullReport.pdf</p>

This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. The calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>

The key aims of this project are to reduce the size of the difference between the 2011 Census results and the mid-year estimates and to better understand any difference that does remain. As part of this project, we are developing a data comparator tool to enable us to compare the annual mid-year estimates against a range of administrative sources. This work is ongoing and the results will inform our understanding of the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates. The tool was trialled in the mid-2004 population estimates, which were published in August 2005.</p>

They have identified one General Practitioner in Northern Ireland who was investigated and found guilty of inappropriate behaviour towards their patients in the last five years. The GP in question was erased from the GMC register in 2005. However, the registered address that doctors must maintain with the GMC is not necessarily their place of practice so, although it is unlikely that there have been other cases, the possibility exists.

 In order, to maximise the opportunities for reducing under-occupation the Common Selection Scheme (CSS) facilitates those tenants who are under-occupying to voluntarily apply for a transfer. Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) or Housing Association tenants choosing to move are awarded ten points for each bedroom in their existing property in excess of the tenant&#039;s needs, up to a maximum of 30 points.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w97.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_84">Additionally, the CSS allows NIHE or Housing Association tenants to be offered a transfer if the resulting vacancy can facilitate the best use of stock through the housing of an applicant (or other tenant) in greater need for that particular size of accommodation.

<a name="stpa_85">The need for action to address under occupation is most likely to be considered in circumstances where it is necessary to relieve housing stress and to be most effective in areas of low demand. Where social landlords feel that action is possible they will need to balance arrange of issues such as the availability of stock to match the needs of those tenants who do wish to move, polices aimed at helping people live in the community (Care in the Community and Lifetime homes), the effects on letability and the creation of sustainable communities.

 Current research evidence does not support screening for prostate cancer. The main reason is that the current tests have limited accuracy and so follow up procedures could cause harm to healthy men. Men with prostate cancer symptoms are encouraged to seek early advice from their GP. They may ask for a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test. However, to enable them to make an informed decision about the PSA test, they need to know about its limitations and the potential side effects which may occur following surgery, these include incontinence and impotence.

 The Police Service of Northern Ireland do not hold this information on a central record.

 I was advised by the employing authorities (that is, the Education and Library Boards, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and voluntary grammar, Irish medium, grant-maintained integrated and independent schools which employ their staff directly) in January 2006 that three persons, none of them teaching staff, with a conviction for a sexual offence were working in schools. In all cases the offences were committed over 15 years ago, in one case the offence was against a minor and involved a girl who was just under age; in the other two cases the offence was against an adult female. In each case the employing authority knew of the conviction through the pre-employment check and took professional advice. The advice was, in each case, that the person was not a risk to children, and so employment was offered. The employing authorities remain satisfied that these persons do not pose a risk to children and they are still in employment.

These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br>

3.Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4.Secondary diagnoses<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 



2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

5.Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HES identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

6.Grossing (finished consultant episodes)<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05, which is not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

Notes:<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

All diagnoses count of episodes<br>

These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnoses<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HES identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data is ungrossed.<br>

However, in 2002, to tackle the significantly higher incidence of road casualties in disadvantaged communities, the Government set a further target to reduce the number of casualties in deprived areas in England, faster than across England as a whole.

 Officials have discussed the potential costs and benefits of the proposed national health service card with a range of interested parties across government, taking account of developments in existing programmes such as the NHS Connecting for Health National Programme for IT and the Home Office-led ID Cards Programme.

1.SHAs were established in 2002&#150;03 therefore only three years&#039; data is available. Four years&#039; data has been provided for the NHS trust and for the primary care trust. 2004&#150;05 is the latest year for which we have audited data.<br>

2.The Department does not set budgets for NHS bodies. SHAs and PCTs are notified of their revenue resource limit each year and their performance against the resource limit is provided in tables one and three. NHS trusts receive income for the provision of services and the performance measure is the surplus or deficit as shown in table two.<br>

3.Not all expenditure lines were collected each year. A zero may mean there was no relevant expenditure or that the particular item was not collected.<br>

4.Revenue resource limits do not include non-discretionary expenditure.<br>

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="60227114.html_spnew0"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The provisions of Directive 2004/24/EC on traditional herbal medicinal products came into force in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2005. Unlicensed herbal remedies which were legally on the market under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 on 30 April 2004 are not required to comply with the directive until 30 April 2011. The decision as to whether a product (rather than an ingredient) falls within the definition of a medicinal product is made on a case by case basis using the definition of that term contained in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of herbal ingredients which are always medicinal or never medicinal. Directive 2004/24/EC does not affect the classification process.

<p>
<a name="60227114.html_para0">

Advice and information on the status of a product is available without charge from the medicines borderline section of the MHRA and no costs to industry have been identified on issues relating to product classification. The MHRA has held no recent meetings with industry to discuss difficulties of product classification in relation to Directive 2004/24/EC. However, the MHRA has held around 60 meetings with individual companies to discuss their initial plans for registering products under the directive. In these meetings where companies have expressed any doubt as to the status of their products they have been advised to seek further specific advice from the MHRA borderline section.

Costs arising from investment by national health service organisations in local systems and hardware, training, and ensuring compliance of local systems with programme-delivered systems will be met from reprioritising existing baseline spending on information technology and savings accrued from national purchasing agreements. These, and the cost of central expenditure on centrally-managed projects and services connected with the programme and on running NHS connecting for health, are dependent on the outcome of future spending reviews. Ongoing costs of maintaining and upgrading the assets delivered through the national programme will continue to accrue thereafter.

[53086]</p>




<p><a name="st_352"><a name="60227122.html_spnew3"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The first major hospital building programme in the national health service resulted from the 1962 Hospital Plan for England and Wales&quot; launched by Mr. Enoch Powell, the then Minister of Health. This advocated the network of large district general hospitals and the commitment to 90 new and 134 substantially modernised hospitals. The budget for this 10-year plan was set at just over &#163;500 million, equivalent to about &#163;4.7 billion in today&#039;s prices. Detailed records on the precise cost and milestone dates for each scheme are not immediately available centrally for schemes before 1980. The actual implementation ran into well documented difficulties resulting from an underestimation of the capital and revenue costs of this new generation of hospitals and the plan was subject to several revisions; for example in 1965 the number of major reconstructions was scaled down from 134 to 59. The date by which the plan&#039;s targets would be met were also repeatedly put back and further affected by the public spending cuts of the 1970&#039;s. Schemes originally proposed in 1962 were still being completed&#151;or 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 473W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
partially completed&#151;in the 1980s and 90s. In reality only a third were ever fully completed, a third partially so and the rest not started at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227122.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_268">From 1980, 10 schemes with values of &#163;50 million or more, in real terms, proceeded to construction. Since 1997, 19 hospital schemes worth over &#163;50 million given the go ahead after that date have become operational with a further 17 under construction, with a total capital value of over &#163;5 billion.

Notes:<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

All diagnoses count of episodes<br>

These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnoses<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HES identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data is ungrossed.<br>

 The Choosing Health&quot; White Paper contains a commitment that by 2008 everyone referred to genitor-urinary medicine services (GUM), including self-referral, should be able to have an appointment within 48 hours.

To support this, the Department is investing an extra &#163;145 million over three years for GUM services and infrastructure to enable clinics to expand their services and reduce waiting times. In addition, a further &#163;40 million has also been invested over the next two years through the White Paper to improve access to contraceptive services.

Applying this to the total number of pupils of compulsory school age in all schools gives the equivalent of an average of 55,000 pupils recorded as absent each day without authorisation.

The cost of a course for a learner will depend on the length of the course, the type of learning, the characteristics of the learner and the location of the provision.

 The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector, including adult education, to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC is responsible for the planning and funding of post-16 education and works through 47 local offices within a framework set by Government. The LSC has published information about the number of learners achieving skills for life, including literacy, target qualifications in local LSC areas including Essex, in its most recent annual report and accounts for 2004&#150;05. In the period 2001 to 2004, 17,648 people in Essex achieved a qualification.

 The Department commissioned the national adult learning survey (NALS) in 1997, 2001 and 2002 and reports of these studies are in the House of Commons Library. A further survey took place in 2005 and the report will be published later this year. These surveys provide data on participation in different types of adult learning by a range of demographic characteristics, socio-economic and educational background, and local deprivation factors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227131.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">The surveys show that participation in adult learning is highest amongst those in full-time employment and lowest among those who are retired or incapable of work. Participation is also positively related to qualification levels, to household income and to socio-economic group, being highest among professional and managerial workers and lowest amongst unskilled manual workers. There is an inverse relationship between levels of participation in learning and levels of local deprivation.

 In 2003/04 and 2004/05 adult learners in further education (FE) were assumed to contribute 25 per cent. of the basic course cost of their learning unless fees were remitted because the learner was receiving an income-based benefit or on a Skills for Life programme. This proportion increased to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06, and will rise again in 2006/07 to 32.5 per cent. and to 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. In average terms, this means a rise from an hourly rate of &#163;1.42 to &#163;1.94 by 2007/08. The fees collected by FE colleges and other providers cannot be broken down by the source of funder and may be paid by the individual learner or their employer.

Clearly, with the increase in the fee assumption, it will be important that FE providers recover as much money as possible from learners and employers.

The Practitioner&#039;s Group on behaviour and discipline, which was composed of heads and practitioners expert in the field of school discipline, published its report, &quot;Learning Behaviour&quot;, in October 2005 outlining best practice in schools, as well as future recommendations.

Pupils should however be taught about &quot;how scientific controversies can arise from different ways of interpreting empirical evidence&quot;. Also, the biblical view of creation can be taught in RE lessons, where pupils are taught to consider opposing theories and come to their own, reasoned conclusions.

 In the year commencing 2006&#150;07, devolved capital funding which is allocated to schools as Devolved Formula Capital (DFC) will be made more flexible in two ways. DFC will be increased to incorporate ICT capital funding, formerly paid as a separate funding stream, and schools will be able to determine which proportion of their larger DFC allocation will be spent on ICT. Also, in certain circumstances, schools will be able to save up their DFC for a period in excess of three years where they wish to finance a large capital project. Guidance will be issued shortly.

 My Department has not calculated education productivity, but has&#151;as part of the Atkinson Review&#151;worked with the Office for National Statistics to improve measures of inputs and outputs, which ONS has used to calculate their own estimates of productivity in the compulsory education system. These estimates are, in broad terms, calculated by dividing outputs (measured by pupil numbers adjusted for school absence and the quality of education output) by inputs (measured by deflated education spending). Since there are various ways of measuring quality, ONS has published several estimates of education productivity&#151;and the underlying methodology&#151;in &quot;Public Service Productivity: Education&quot;, in October 2005.

<p>
<a name="60227137.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_71">The link between education inputs and outputs is complex, especially because there are time lags between changes in inputs being fully reflected in outputs.

<ul>their human resource strategies, and in particular on their taking steps to move towards market supplements or other means of recruiting and retaining staff of the right calibre; and committing themselves to rewarding good performance. I am particularly concerned that good teaching should be identified and rewarded. The Council should also make clear that postdoctoral and other researchers should be included in these strategies. Therefore the Council should ask each institution to revise its human resource strategy to focus on these points, and reiterate the need for improvements in equal opportunities for higher education staff. Where the Council is satisfied that the strategy is sound and is being implemented properly, I look to the Council to add the additional funding to that institution&#039;s baseline. Where the Council has doubts, the additional funding should remain earmarked until the revised human resources strategy and its implementation satisfy the Council.&quot;</p>

 Funding is available from three sources: local authority allocations of Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG); the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG); and Unaccompanied Asylum Seekers Carers (UASC) Grant. The formula used to calculate Schools Formula Spending Share for 2005&#150;06 and previous years took account of the extra spending needed by those authorities with populations of children for whom English is an additional language, and from low performing ethnic groups. Approximately &#163;435 million of the &#163;24.6 billion Schools FSS for 2005&#150;06 was distributed on the basis of numbers of children in these two categories. Since the formula for Dedicated Schools Grant starts from local authorities&#039; spending on schools for 2005&#150;06, that will also take account of the extra spending needed by authorities with such children. There will be increases in allocations of Dedicated Schools Grant per pupil of 6.8 per cent. and 6.7 per cent. for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. The formula for distributing Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant also uses the proportion of children for whom English is an additional language, and from low performing ethnic groups. The total amount of funding for EMAG was: for 2005&#150;06, &#163;168 million; for 2006&#150;07, &#163;174 million and for 2007&#150;08, &#163;179 million. The figure for 2005&#150;06 includes local authority matched funding; the figures for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 are DfES grant, and reflect the transfer of matched funding from Dedicated Schools Grant for those years. We made available &#163;11 million of UASC Grant in 2005&#150;06, and plan to make available &#163;12 million in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. The grant is paid retrospectively in line with the number of UASC care leavers supported by each local authority.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the projected allocations are for each local authority for music service provision from the music standards fund for <i>(a)</i> 2006&#150;07 and <i>(b)</i> 2007&#150;08; and what the totals were for each local authority.  [53305]</p>




<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60227144.html_spnew5"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The projected allocations for music services from the music standards fund over the next two financial years are set out in the following table.

<a name="60227144.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">The higher levels in 2006&#150;07 reflect an increase of &#163;1.5 million over the baseline to support instrumental and vocal tuition at KS2.

<p>
<a name="60227144.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">In addition to music standards fund allocations for music services, local authorities will receive a further &#163;26 million over the next two years for instrumental and vocal tuition at KS2. This money will be devolved to primary and special schools and we would expect a significant proportion to be spent by schools on buying back music service provision.

 The same statutory safeguards for looked-after children apply regardless of where the child is living. All looked-after children, including those placed out-of-authority, are required under the Children Act 1989 to have an individual care plan, which is subject to a regular statutory review overseen by an independent reviewing officer. In addition, an authority responsible for looking after a child which places the child in another area is required to inform the local authority and the primary care trust (or if there is no PCT, the health authority) for the area in which the child is now living. The placing authority is also required to notify the PCT where the child has been living that the child is leaving their area.

 We recognise that we ask a lot of primary school leaders.

The initiative has helped HEIs and the sector to be better prepared to address forthcoming HE-wide challenges. It has enabled HEIs to address staff shortages more effectively, provide a substantial investment in staff development and training, and raise the profile of equality and diversity issues through policy development, awareness-raising and training, and job evaluation (the latter leading to the re-grading posts to new pay structures).

<i>[holding answer 9 February 2006]:</i> Trust schools will be responsible for managing their own estate and assets and will be able to dispose of surplus land in the same way as foundation and voluntary schools can now. At present foundation and voluntary schools require the Secretary of State&#039;s consent before they can dispose of any land or buildings provided at public expense. We are proposing to strengthen local decision making by removing this requirement. Instead schools, including trust schools, will be expected to inform their local authority of any proposals to dispose of non-playing field land. Any disputes arising from the sale of such land will be determined by the schools adjudicator. Trust schools disposing of non-playing field land will be required to use any sale proceeds for capital purposes connected with education. Local authorities will potentially be able to claim a share of any excess sale proceeds either by agreement with the school or determined by the adjudicator.

 While many local authorities undoubtedly do a good job in managing their school assets, we see considerable advantages to all sides in our proposals in &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot; to encourage more school to own their assets directly.

This is an important strand in developing a strong school ethos.

<a name="stpa_171">Local authorities will benefit from having a new role of commissioning rather than providing education.

For instance, they will develop the educational vision and investment plans for their Building Schools for the Future projects.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what weight has been given to the <i>(a)</i> sparsity and <i>(b)</i> deprivation factors in the school funding settlement in (i) 2006&#150;07 and (ii) 2007&#150;08.  [51572]</p>




<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60227150.html_spnew2"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Weights for deprivation and sparsity are not separately identified with the distribution method for Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. That method starts from each authority&#039;s budgeted spend for schools in 2005&#150;06, which largely reflects the historical allocation of resources through the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) formula, which had separate weightings for deprivation, sparsity, and area costs. Given the importance the Government attaches to deprivation funding, the summary of indicative allocations of DSG (which can be found on the Teachernet website at www.teachernet.gov.uk/DSG200608/), includes an estimate of funding for deprivation contained within each authority&#039;s allocation of DSG. The national average is 10.5 per cent. for 2007&#150;08 and 10.6 per cent. for 2007&#150;08. The overall proportion of funding distributed on the basis of sparsity within Schools FSS&#151;the predecessor to DSG&#151;was 0.7 per cent. That proportion was based on research into the additional costs to sparsely populated authorities of keeping open small primary schools, and larger numbers of under fives settings, carried out during the formula review which led to the introduction of the Schools FSS formula. Almost half of all local authorities received no funding for sparsity through the schools FSS formula and the maximum proportion of funding for sparsity across all authorities was 3.6 per cent. The formula for the LEA FSS recognised the increased costs of home to school transport in sparse authorities.

The Department has agreed a series of process improvements with both HMRC and the SLC to ensure loan accounts can be linked more effectively to national insurance numbers and there are performance measures for both organisations aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the repayment system.

The figure is expressed as a proportion of the 17 to 30-year-old population of England. HEIPR cannot be disaggregated by smaller areas, and it cannot be calculated for earlier years than 1999/2000. The latest figures available for England are shown in the following table.

We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including making content cheaper. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department&#039;s Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April 2006.

<i>[holding answer 13 February 2006]:</i> We are concerned that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils are among the lowest achieving in our schools. In 2003 the Government launched a national strategy to tackle the underachievement of minority ethnic pupils. This included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting Gypsy, Roma and Traveller young people, including a national pilot project testing strategies to improve attendance and raise attainment.

 National truancy sweeps in England have been co-ordinated by the Department since December 2002. The sweeps usually take place during the autumn and spring terms.

Since nationally co-ordinated sweeps began in 2002 some 92,000 pupils have been stopped: 37,000 (nearly 40 per cent.) of them were out of school without a valid reason and 42 per cent.

 The Department and its partners undertake regular analysis to forecast future higher education student numbers and have done so for a number of years. For example, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) produced a report on future supply and demand in higher education in 2001 (2001/62) and subsequent publications by the Higher Education Policy Institute (e.g. Bekhradnia, 2005 &quot;Demand for Higher Education to 2015&#150;16&quot;, HEPI) have updated on this analysis since.

<a name="stpa_227">Meanwhile, the Department and its partners continue to monitor actual levels of participation drawing on a number of sources (including UCAS data and Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) records) and have for example, also undertaken research to explore better ways of monitoring participation and conducted evaluation of the impact of policies designed to increase aspiration and attainment to secure future HE participation among under-represented groups (see for example DfES research publication references RR676 and RR649). HEFCE&#039;s report on &quot;Young Participation in Higher Education&quot; (2005/03) which considers the period 1994&#150;2000 and monitors changes in overall participation rates year on year, is also worthy of highlighting in this context.

<p>
<a name="60227158.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_228">There have of course also been a number of independent reviews which have informed Government policy in this area over the last 15 years. These have variously explored actual patterns and anticipated future demand for HE. Of relevance here for example is the year long National Committee of Inquiry chaired by Sir Ron (now Lord) Bearing which in 1997 published the report &quot;Higher Education in the Learning Society&quot;. More recently, Professor Steven Schwartz, ex-Vice Chancellor of Brunei university, led an independent review of admissions practices and published a set of recommendations in 2004 for good practice in fair admissions to higher education.

Students from poorer backgrounds will be entitled to non-repayable maintenance grants and other forms of support, such as bursaries, are available from individual universities via their access agreements. The Department conducted a review of the international evidence to explore the likely implications of these reforms on future HE participation. This review (&quot;Variable fees&#151;the international evidence&quot;, 2004) showed that higher differential fees can be introduced without adversely affecting the participation of students

<a name="stpa_230">We have reformed the student finance arrangements so that, in England, from 2006, no full-time student will have to pay fees up-front, nor will they repay anything until they leave higher education (HE) and are earning a reasonable wage. We are introducing a new up-front maintenance grant of up to &#163;2,700 a year, targeted at lower income households, and a bigger maintenance loan to meet average basic living costs. The steady state costs of these arrangements will be &#163;600 million each year for fee loans, &#163;860 million for the new maintenance grant, and &#163;510 million for maintenance loans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227158.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_231">Alongside our reforms to student finance, we have established the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). To date, OFFA has approved some 180 access agreements from institutions wishing to charge higher level fees from 2006. These will make available over &#163;300 million in financial support to students from low income backgrounds and an additional &#163;35 million in outreach.

<p>
<a name="60227158.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_232">In addition, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has allocated &#163;282 million to higher education institutions in 2005&#150;06 to help offset the costs associated with recruiting and retaining students from groups under-represented in HE. HEFCE is currently working with the sector to assess the impact of the allocation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227158.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_233">The Aimhigher programme seeks to raise aspirations and attainment levels among those currently under-represented in HE. Aimhigher is subject to a comprehensive evaluation strategy, organised in partnership with HEFCE and the Learning and Skills Council. It includes surveys of young people, educational providers and Aimhigher partnerships, conducted by independent research organisations. The evaluation seeks to identify what works, and to use this to inform further policy development and delivery. Evidence to date is mainly from the first years of Excellence Challenge, a predecessor programme. It shows that the type of activities now supported by Aimhigher have made an impact on aspirations and attainment. The budget for Aimhigher for the 2005&#150;06 academic year is &#163;102 million.
