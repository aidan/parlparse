We are discussing a number of proposals with potential partners. Previous experience has shown that twinning agreements and capacity-building arrangements in the sector can often be ineffective.

 The Multistakeholder Forestry Programme (MFP) has worked with civil society and government organisations to broker new relationships between citizens and the state in relation to forest policy-making. DFID has contributed &#163;25 million to this work since 2000.

 No debt is owed directly by any government to CDC Group plc, which only lends to commercial organisations.

The bulk of these loans were to Low Income Countries. Debts held by Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) are cancelled in full when they reach HIPC Completion Point, with any payments made to the UK since 2000 returned to them. The UK is not currently able to provide debt relief on our share of the loans to non-HIPC Low Income Countries as this requires the agreement of all eight creditors. We are continuing discussions and hope to be able to offer debt relief on these loans soon.</p>

 The UK is a major supporter of the World Food Programme (WFP) globally and in Somalia. WFP plans to distribute 114,000mt (metric tonnes) of food aid in Somalia this year, and a significant proportion of this will be in the worst affected areas in southern and central Somalia, such as Middle and Lower Juba. The UK is the second largest contributor after the US to the World Food Programme's protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 10191, which runs to 31 March 2007, with US$11.4 million.</p>

A distribution in Middle Shabelle was planned just before the recent fighting, but it remains stalled because of lack of clarity over the security situation in that region. In Middle and Lower Juba there has been some limited food aid distribution in Bualle. There are 1000mt on trucks at Afmadow in Lower Juba, which it is planned will be distributed soon. WFP also has teams in Wajid on standby for a return to Kismayo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="70115w0002.htm_para3"><a name="07011510000729">The recent conflict caused restrictions on access to Somalia for relief workers and supplies. However, for most agencies, including WFP, it is proving possible to resume operations, although there have been some problems related to the re-emergence of local militias. The UK continues to take all opportunities to press the authorities on the ground to allow for the re-establishment of humanitarian relief operations in all areas, including the deliveries of WFP food aid and the use of helicopters and aircraft. Much of this operation is funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund to which the UK is the largest single contributor. WFP has adequate supplies for the next five to six months for Somalia.</p>

 The Department consulted a range of groups and individuals, including local authorities, in July 2006 about draft regulations and statutory guidance to implement the parking provisions in part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004. The responses to that consultation are under consideration and we plan to lay the regulations in Parliament early this year and bring them into force in late 2007. The regulations and guidance will make clear to local authorities the information that their parking documents must contain and the information that the Secretary of State recommends they contain.</p>

There has been record investment in tackling this problem, including the establishment of the Drug Interventions Programme, the provision of drug interventions in prisons and the expansion of drug treatment services.</p>

 Plans to establish new models for conditional cautioning were announced in the Respect Action Plan launched in January 2006. These new models involve the offender undertaking unpaid (reparative) work&#151;to make good the damage they have caused to the local community that has suffered. In this way, offenders give something back to the community to repair the harm they have caused. The pilots are now starting in Durham, Lancashire, Merseyside, North Wales, South Yorkshire, Thames Valley and West Mercia, and will run until December 2007. A decision on whether to expand the scheme will be taken early next year.</p>

 I announced in October 2006 the withdrawal of automatic fee remission from courses in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) from August 2007. This move follows significant growth in spend on ESOL, which tripled between 2001 and 2005. At the same time, however, learners from priority groups who need to improve their English skills for employability and integration are finding it increasingly difficult to access the help they need quickly. The change to fee remission policy will help us to focus limited resources on those learners who most need our support.</p>

However, the Government will continue to support the cost of learning for those who are asked for a contribution and will fund around 77 per cent. of the overall cost of learning. It is reasonable that where employers are benefiting from the opportunity to recruit in large numbers from outside the UK we should ask them to fund the full cost of English language learning and where employers seek training provision through programmes such as Train to Gain, ESOL costs will be considered as part of the overall package.</p>

Within our wider discussions with the funding councils about the future development of higher level skills and learning, we are considering whether there is a more effective way of organising responsibilities for funding the provision of non-prescribed higher education.

For example Modec has been awarded a Selective Finance for Investment in England grant of up to &#163;1.39 million to support the production of an electric delivery van with drivetrain developed by Zytek, a UK automotive technology company, using up to 85 per cent. UK components. Cenex, the UK's low carbon and fuel cell centre of excellence, is also supporting Zytek to convert up to 200 Daimler Chrysler Smart cars to all-electric operation.</p>

 Ofgem, the independent regulator, is responsible for regulation of the UK gas market, operating within a framework set by Government. We welcome the fact that Ofgem is calling for the recent reductions in the wholesale price of gas to be passed on to consumers. Ofgem indicates, however, that there can be a time lag. Within this competitive market, individual pricing decisions are a matter for each of the energy companies, and the Government cannot direct Ofgem as to its approach on prices.</p>

 Opium poppy eradication policy and implementation is the responsibility of the Afghan government.

The Afghan government has yet to make a final decision on whether ground based spraying of poppy will be conducted in 2007. The UK supports the well-explained piloting of ground based spraying in areas of Afghanistan where the security situation permits, and if the Afghan government agrees, in order to assess its relative effectiveness compared to current eradication approaches. We judge that the risks of ground based spraying in Afghanistan to health and the environment are within acceptable levels. We continue to oppose aerial spraying, as does President Karzai.</p>

The &#147;phase 2&#148; report on the UK was published in March 2005. It commended a number of aspects of our anti-bribery framework, such as employee whistleblower protection, the ability of the tax authorities to make spontaneous disclosures of suspicious information to law enforcement agencies and the wide scope of the &#147;regulated sector&#148; in our anti-money-laundering reporting regime. The report also noted the Government's support provided to a range of private sector and civil society anti-corruption initiatives. In addition, the report made a number of recommendations for further action, for example in our awareness-raising efforts, on investigation and prosecution and on working with the Crown dependencies and overseas territories. In line with the standard procedure, the UK gave an oral progress report to the WGB in March 2006 and we will be submitting a written report in March this year.

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70115w0017.htm_para10"><a name="07011616000507">The UK is also able to process ad hoc extradition requests from non-treaty partners under section 194 of the 2003 Act.</p>

16528/06 (Com(2006)743)), on the operation of private pleasure craft, confirmed that the Commission would not be submitting a proposal to the council for renewal of the derogation permitting the use of red diesel. The question of a vote on the issue did not therefore arise. The UK&#146;s position, including its assessment of the implications for regional policy, is set out in its application to the Commission for renewal of the derogation, and the Government&#146;s estimate of compliance and other costs is set out in the partial RIA published in March 2006. Both documents have been deposited in the Library of the House of Commons. Officials are in discussions with concerned and affected organisations to discuss how the new arrangements can be administered so as to minimise the compliance costs to businesses and individuals.</p>

 Central Government began receiving housing receipts in 2004-05. Before then, with-debt local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. The receipts set-aside could only be used for the repayment of the authority&#146;s debt. From 2004-05 set-aside no longer applied to Right to Buy (RTB) receipts as the &#147;pooling&#148; regime was introduced to ensure fair distribution of receipts and investment across the country, whereby local authorities paid over or &#147;pooled&#148; a proportion of their housing receipts to the Secretary of State to support wider housing investment.</p>

 Central Government only began receiving housing receipts in 2004-05. Before then, with-debt local authorities were required instead to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. The receipts set aside could only be used for the repayment of the authority's debt. From 2004-05 set-aside no longer applied to most housing receipts as the &#147;pooling&#148; regime was introduced, whereby local authorities paid over or &#147;pooled&#148; a proportion of those receipts to the Secretary of State to support housing investment across the country.</p>

1. The administration costs for previous years have been adjusted to take into account the restructuring of the Department.<br>
2. It is important to note that the analysis of the administration budget for children, working age, pensioners and disabled people in Table 5 excludes the cost of corporate and shared services, these are shown separately in the same table. All figures provided for years prior to the formation of The Department for Work and Pensions were determined on the basis of the expenditure incurred by each of the various business areas brought together by the machinery of Government changes in 2001. Analysis of administration data in this format is not available prior to 1998-99.<br>
3. Table 5 from the Departmental report for 2005 (Cm 6539) contains the most recent analysis of administration costs for the year 1999-2000, and Table 5 from the departmental report for 2004 (Cm 6221) contains the most recent analysis of administration costs for 1998-99. As these analyses will only have been adjusted for the structure of the Department that existed at the time the relevant departmental report was issued, they will not be directly comparable with Table 5 in the departmental report for 2006.<br>

The aim is to allow people with property, but without income and other assets sufficient to meet their assessed financial contribution to the cost of residential care, to have a legal  charge placed on their property to meet any shortfall. This gives people more options for meeting care  home fees.</p>

1. Expenditure on carers has been interpreted to include the following: a. total carer's allowance expenditure; b. total income support expenditure who are entitled to income support by virtue of being a carer. People who are unemployed, lone parents or disabled and who also receive a carer premium are counted in column d. The figures quoted include people who were unemployed and entitled to income support prior to the introduction of income based jobseeker's allowance in October 1996; c. carer premium entitlement for people in receipt of income support (for people over 60 years of age) and pension credit; d. expenditure on the carer premium for carers who are on income support by virtue of being unemployed, lone parents or disabled.  2. Income support carer expenditure [(b) in the tables] has been estimated using caseload and average weekly amount data.  3. Pension credit and income support expenditure [(c) and (d) in the tables] has been estimated using caseloads and carer premium rates.  4. Carer premium expenditure has been quoted in full. It has not been reduced, or offset, by any income received by the beneficiary of the benefit.  5. The income support carer premium was introduced in October 1990. The first caseload information was collected in May 1991, so the income support expenditure quoted in the tables has been estimated using administration data for 1991-92.  6. All figures have been rounded to the nearest million pounds.  7. Expenditure is consistent with the 2006 pre-Budget report.  8. Carer's allowance replaced invalid care allowance on 1 April 2003.  9. Pension credit replaced income support, for people over 60 years of age, on 5 October 2003.  10. DWP expenditure tables, which will soon be updated to be consistent with the 2006 pre-Budget report, can be viewed at the following web address: http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp 11. Totals may not sum due to rounding.  <i> Source:</i>  DWP expenditure tables, departmental accounting systems, 5 per cent. samples of departmental administrative records and the Department's expenditure forecasting models.<br>

applications that have not yet been cleared can be regarded as outstanding. The amount of work required to achieve clearance and the elapsed time it involves varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the agency.</p>

The agency therefore has a 2006-07 target to ensure that, by march 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25 per cent. and our challenge, as set down in our operational improvement plan, is that the agency should not have a backlog in this area by March 2009.

This rule has a positive impact on the level of child maintenance in consent orders as it ensures maintenance is generally set at a substantial level that broadly reflects the child maintenance formula. It also ensures that parents will avoid being locked into the Court system indefinitely however their circumstances change. However the removal of the requirement for parents with care to be treated as applying to the Child Support Agency if they make a claim for benefit will ensure that fewer maintenance agreements are unnecessarily overturned against the wishes of both parents.</p>

Hence, figures are not consistent with any previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. In circumstances such as a change in trend, moving averages will show less variation than single-year estimates.<br>
2. The Great Britain figure is for a single year.<br>
3. The table shows number of pensioners in millions, rounded to nearest 10,000.<br>
4. In this answer low income is determined for pensioners as living in households with incomes below 60 per cent. of the GB median.<br>

1. Numbers, for the west midlands region, are presented using a three-year moving average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year-on-year changes. Hence, figures are not consistent with any previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. In circumstances such as a change in trend, moving averages will show less variation than single-year estimates.<br>
2. The Great Britain figure is for a single year.<br>
3. The table shows number of children in millions, rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>
4. In this answer low income is determined for pensioners as living in households with incomes below 60 per cent. of the GB median.<br>

 A key part of the Government&#146;s package of proposed reforms is to make the state pension fairer and available to more people as soon as is practicable. This means addressing women&#146;s lower state pension outcomes as soon as possible and is why we are planning to introduce the reduction in qualifying years for all those reaching state pension age from 2010. The effect of this is to ensure around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 would achieve a full basic state pension, compared to just 30 per cent. today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="70115w0033.htm_para1"><a name="07011676001107">This approach does however mean that two people with similar contribution histories reaching state pension age either side of 6 April 2010 will have their state pension entitlement calculated differently and this could produce different outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="70115w0033.htm_para2"><a name="07011676001108">Changes could be made more gradually to avoid this situation, for example, by phasing in the reduction in years needed for a full basic state pension and we have explored different way to do this.</p>

Phasing the reduction in qualifying years before 2010 would give some women the advantage of both a lower state pension age of 60 and the benefit of these reforms. However the reforms are introduced there will be some people who reach state pension age on the wrong side of the chosen date or the series of dates chosen to phase in the reduction of qualifying years.</p>

1. Main operation<br>
The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg time waited, but the figures for &#147;all operations count of episodes&#148; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>
2. OPCS codes:<br>
C71 Extracapsular extraction of lens<br>
C72 Intracapsular extraction of lens<br>
C74 Other extraction of lens<br>
C75 Prosthesis of lens<br>
Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
3. Finished in-year admissions<br>
A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

 North Bristol NHS Trust first reported a cumulative deficit of &#163;4.2 million in 2001-02, which increased to &#163;48.8 million in 2002-03. In the subsequent three financial years the trust has recovered &#163;3.9 million, and therefore the cumulative deficit remaining to be recovered at the end of 2005-06 is &#163;44.9 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70115w0037.htm_para0"><a name="07011686000568">The timescale for the recovery of deficits by NHS trusts is determined by the statutory breakeven duty, which states that a cumulative deficit must be recovered in the subsequent two years following the first year in which a cumulative deficit position is reported. It is the responsibility of the strategic health authorities (SHA) to work with NHS organisations in their local health economies and agree a recovery plan that phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. By exception, the SHA can agree an extension to the recovery period to four years in line with an agreed recovery plan. At the end of 2005-06 North Bristol NHS Trust had been in a cumulative deficit position for five years and is therefore in breach of its statutory duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="70115w0037.htm_para1"><a name="07011686000569">The Department cannot simply write off historical deficits. The Department, and, consequently, the NHS, have to live within an agreed level of resources in each financial year. This level is set by HM Treasury and voted by Parliament. In order for the system as a whole to balance, a deficit in one organisation has to be matched by a surplus elsewhere. Deficits therefore must be repaid so that the resources can be returned to the organisations that generated the offsetting surpluses.</p>

 In Northern Ireland section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires public authorities to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity and regard to the desirability of promoting good relations. These duties ensure that equality issues, including gender, are integral to the whole range of public policy decision making. Public authorities, such as the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), are required to submit Equality Schemes to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and to carry out impact assessments of their policies in certain circumstances.</p>

In 2006 the NIO conducted a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme during its first five years and this report was submitted to the Equality Commission in July 2006.</p>
