To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions during October <i>(a)</i> Greek and <i>(b)</i> Greek Cypriot military aircraft flew over United Kingdom sovereign base territory on the island of Cyprus; what representations were made; and if he will make a statement. [12872]

<a name="71030w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Two Hellenic Air Force F-16 fighter aircraft which were participating in a joint military exercise with the Republic of Cyprus overflew the Akrotiri sovereign base area at low altitude on Tuesday 14 October. The British high commission in Nicosia wrote to the Government of the Republic on 16 October reminding them of the existence of sovereign airspace over the SBAs and of the safety requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will review the procedures whereby individuals with dual nationality, with security clearance to access MOD and NATO protectively marked material, are precluded from access to internal caveat information. [12800]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence recently revised policy on access by dual nationals to national caveat information. Under the new policy there is no general ban on access by dual nationals to national caveat information. Decisions on access are made on a case-by-case basis. In the case of contractors' employees, the Department is required to seek the permission of the originator of the material before granting access.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what factors he takes into account when considering appeals against the non-release of documents from the Public Record Office. [13214]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Neither the Lord Chancellor nor I have considered any such appeals. The Advisory Council on Public Records advises on requests for the release of records made by historians and other members of the public which Departments reject, but the final responsibility for the release or otherwise of withheld records rests with the Ministers of the Departments concerned.

<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 All Departments are required to pay all their bills within agreed contract terms, or 30 days from receipt of the goods or service or a valid invoice, whichever is later, where no such terms exist. Such detailed information on payment performance for the current financial year could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Treasury will shortly be publishing a league table of departmental payment performance for 1996-97.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 30 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>263</i>, to the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), on the review of delay in the criminal justice system, which recommendations for procedural changes in the youth court will be contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill. [12730]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Bill will introduce wide-ranging reform of the youth justice system. The measures in the Bill, including the new final warning scheme and a range of new sentencing options, will improve the effectiveness of the youth justice system and the speed with which cases can be concluded.
<P>

<a name="71030w01.html_para0">The Bill will include the legislative provisions necessary to implement the following recommendations from the review of delay in the criminal justice system for procedural reform in the youth court:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recommendation 31: stipendiary magistrates should be able to sit alone in the youth court and should specialise in the management of particularly complex cases;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recommendation 32: when the Crown Court deals with a grave offence it should also deal with other related charges;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recommendation 33: the requirement that there should be an hour's interval between sittings of the magistrates' court and the youth court in a courtroom should be abolished.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71030w01.html_para1">The Government also intend to give the youth court discretion to remit a case to the adult court where a juvenile, aged under 18 at the outset of his case, is likely to turn 18 during the course of the proceedings. This is a modification of recommendation 26 from the review of delay in the youth justice system. The necessary legislative changes will be included in the Crime and Disorder Bill.




<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 1997 : Column: 838</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71030w01.html_para2">In addition to these measures, the Crime and Disorder Bill will include legislative provision to give effect to a number of other recommendations from the review of delay in the criminal justice system which apply to both youth and adult proceedings. The Government's response to all the recommendations of the review is set out in a document which has been placed in the Library.

<a name="71030w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Electronic Tagging</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the average cost per case of electronic tagging and <i>(b)</i> the costs to the police of dealing with an offender who breaks the terms of the tagging. [12732]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Based on the experience of the first year of the trials of curfew orders with electronic monitoring, the estimated cost per order for a national roll-out was estimated to be about &#163;2,300. Better estimates based on the second year of the trials will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="71030w01.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> An offender who breaches the terms of the order is returned to court by the electronic monitoring contractors and the police are not involved. However, if an offender then fails to appear in court, a warrant for arrest is issued. Too few such cases have arisen during the current trials of electronic monitoring to enable a meaningful estimate of police costs to be made.

<a name="71030w01.html_sbhd9"><H4><center>Chief Constables</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list, by constabulary, the length of service at Association of Chief Police Officers rank prior to their current appointment of each <i>(a)</i> chief constable and <i>(b)</i> assistant chief constable designated as deputy, indicating for each the date of appointment to their present position. [12354]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B>

<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Twenty-one out of 197 doctors employed by the Prison Service are either members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists or holders of the diploma in psychiatric medicine. In addition, visiting specialists from the national health service provide the Prison Service with specialist psychiatric services.
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para0">The Prison Service, in conjunction with Nottingham university, introduced the diploma in prison medicine in October 1996. The aim of the diploma is to support the professional development of prison doctors. It has a significant psychiatric component which should be helpful to those doctors who are not specifically qualified in psychiatry.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners in England and Wales are currently awaiting transfer to NHS psychiatric hospitals; and what is the average waiting time for such a transfer. [13195]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 On 28 October 1997, 49 prisoners--25 sentenced and 24 unsentenced--were awaiting transfer to a national health service psychiatric hospital. The average time taken in 1996 between receipt in the Home Office of an application for transfer, which includes the two medical reports required under the Mental Health Act 1983, and the issue of a warrant authorising transfer to hospital, was eight days in the case of unsentenced prisoners and 16 days for sentenced prisoners.
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para1">Only in very exceptional circumstances would transfer not take place within 14 days of the issue of a warrant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We are considering the options but have yet to decide whether identity cards should be introduced in the United Kingdom. The issues go far wider than proof of age for purchases. However, the fact that an identity card scheme could help to prevent the sale of age-restricted goods such as tobacco, alcohol and solvents to youngsters is one of the potential benefits which will be taken into account.

 We do not propose any initiative relating to fire safety specifically as a result of the United Kingdom presidency of the European Union. However, on the domestic front, as I announced in a reply to a question from the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) on 23 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>360</i>, we are developing proposals to consolidate and rationalise our fire safety legislation. We hope shortly to publish a consultative document setting out our proposals.

<a name="71030w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I have received representations from the London fire and civil defence authority about expected future funding difficulties. The revenue provision for the authority in 1998-99 will be announced in the coming weeks as part of the provisional local government settlement for England. I understand that the authority is making a number of proposals for reductions in firefighting resources. Before these could be implemented, they would require the approval of my right hon. Friend under the provisions of section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947.

(3) what action is taken if a fire service in a C risk category area does not meet its eight to 10 minute attendance time standard. [13487]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Statutory responsibility for the provision of a fire service to meet efficiently all normal requirements rests locally with the fire authority. In performance of their duties, fire authorities have regard to the national standards of fire cover, which have been endorsed by the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council and are recommended by the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para2">The national standards set out for fires in each category of fire risk the recommended minimum number of firefighting appliances which should attend within predetermined times. The recommended response is the same whatever time of day an incident takes place. In conducting reviews of fire risk, brigades carry out timed runs, making assumptions about the time it will take for a fire appliance to reach a given point in accordance with local traffic conditions. Such evidence will also be supported by an examination of actual attendance times. 
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para3">The national standards are not statutory and they do allow for the possibility of brigades not meeting the recommended response time for every fire call, for example in circumstances where a number of simultaneous incidents occur. For each response to a fire call, brigades record the time from the despatch of the applicant to arrival at the incident and it is the practice to investigate the reasons if in the case the national recommended response times have not been met. 
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para4">Each brigade is inspected annually by Her Majesty's inspectorate of fire services to monitor, among other things, whether the national recommended standards are in general being maintained.
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para5">The overall performance of brigades in meeting the recommended response times is also monitored by the Audit Commission, which publishes the results of its findings. The Audit Commission said earlier this year that the fire service was one of the most consistently high performing services in local government.
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para6">A fire authority may not change the staffing of a fire station from whole-time to day-crewed or retained without the approval of the Home Secretary under section 19(4) of the Fire Services Act 1947. He will approve only if he is satisfied that the fire authority has consulted about its proposals and, on the advice of Her Majesty's inspectorate, that the national standards will continue to be maintained.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Horam: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will set out the pension arrangements for firemen in the London area. [13486]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Regular firefighters in London, as elsewhere in England and Wales, are members of the firemen's pension scheme, the current provisions of which are set out in the Firemen's Pension Scheme Order 1992, as amended.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Horam: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimates he had made of the forward cost of pensions for firemen retiring in the London area; and what assessment he has made of the impact of that cost on the provision of fire services. [13480]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 In reaching its decisions on the provisional local government settlement for 1998-99, the Government will have regard to the pressures on the fire 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 1997 : Column: 844</I><P>
service, as on other local authority services. These pressures include the increasing pension commitments of fire authorities.
<P>

<a name="71030w02.html_para7">The Government take into account both estimates of future pensions expenditure provided by the Local Government Association and detailed projections of net pensions expenditure provided by the Government Actuary's Department. For London, they also have estimates of future pensions expenditure provided by the London fire and civil defence authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in relation to the concessionary arrangements outside the immigration rules of 13 October; if he will define a relationship akin to marriage with a person of either sex, and specify the criteria to be used to establish such a relationship. [13348]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 A relationship akin to marriage is one which is similar in its nature to a marriage in that it involves a committed relationship which can be demonstrated by evidence such as joint commitments, financial or otherwise. In order to benefit under the new concession, an unmarried couple will need to demonstrate, among other matters, that they are legally unable to marry; that they have been living together for four years or more; that they intend to live together permanently; that any previous marriage or similar relationship has permanently broken down and that they will be able to maintain and accommodate themselves without recourse to public funds.

<P>
<a name="71030w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Licensing law already provides for extensions of licensing hours as an ancillary to live music. We are considering representations received from the restaurant and entertainments industries to relax some of the restrictions on the grant of such extensions.

 Figures on the total number of authorisations of intrusive surveillance operations are not collected centrally but a review undertaken to inform parliamentary debate of part III of the Police Act 1997 estimated that there were around 2,550 chief officer authorisations by police and Customs in the United Kingdom in 1996.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Interception of Communications Act 1985 applies to the intentional interception of communications in the course of their transmission by means of a public telecommunications system however the interception is effected. It is not therefore necessary to consider an amendment of the kind proposed by my hon. Friend.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The age of 60 is not of itself significant. Each case is considered on its individual merits. This means that all relevant factors, including the age of the person, will be taken into account when deciding whether deportation is appropriate. The general policy of the previous Government was not to remove those aged 65 or more. I am examining all aspects of this issue as part of our general review of immigration and asylum policy.

 The Government broadly support the European Commission's proposals on chocolate and are opposed to a number of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament, particularly those which would have the effect of discriminating against chocolate containing small additions of vegetable fat and against high-quality UK "milk chocolate". As my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced on 23 October, the Government will continue to press strongly for a new directive which protects names traditionally used in the UK and resist measures which would mislead consumers and unfairly penalise our chocolate industry.

 The process of risk analysis, which comprises risk assessment, risk management and the third component of risk communication, is, in the case of food safety, the joint responsibility of my Ministry and the Department of Health. In general we seek to ensure that risk assessment and risk management are considered separately, although they do also have a measure of interdependence, as has been made clear in recent expert FAO/WHO consultations on risk analysis and risk management. Officials in the joint MAFF/DH food safety and standards group are, however, studying current procedures in the light of recent developments in thinking to ensure that best practice is being followed.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has recommended approval of an export licence for this item, which has been issued by the Department of Trade and Industry. UN Security Council resolution 1011 prohibits the export of military goods to non-governmental agents in Rwanda. However, the UN secretariat has confirmed that this embargo does not cover the export of equipment destined for UN operations. This export follows similar exemptions made for UNHCR in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.

 We recently approved the export of 340 riot shields of UK manufacture to the US Army for use in Bosnia to protect US SFOR troops. Given the tension in Bosnia around the time of the municipal elections on 13 to 14 September, we were glad to be able to approve this export as an exception to the EU common position on arms exports to the former Yugoslavia. This decision does not affect the Government's continued support of the EU common position.

 The committee's report was published today. It provides valuable insight into the interaction of the various funding streams in supported housing. It is vital that such an important document is in the public domain to feed into the group's discussions on long-term funding arrangements.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para0">The inter-departmental group is seeking to implement a sustainable long-term funding arrangement for this valuable social provision. The work of the inter-departmental group is unlikely to conclude this year. We inherited a situation whereby many people relied on a benefit designed to meet housing costs to meet charges for services which bear little relation to the provision of accommodation. A recent divisional court ruling has confirmed that this is clearly an unsatisfactory arrangement. We have introduced interim measures to

protect the many thousands of vulnerable people living in supported accommodation and stabilise the position of existing supported housing provision until such time as we can implement a sustainable long-term funding arrangement. We shall shortly announce our objectives for these arrangements and we shall be seeking the views of stakeholders on how best to translate them into a modern, practical and sustainable funding mechanism.

<P>
<a name="71030w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Entitlement to cold weather payments is based on either the recorded or forecast temperature data at one of 72 weather stations throughout Great Britain. Each weather station is considered to reflect fairly the temperatures of the area it covers. Postcode districts are linked to weather stations, taking into account expert advice from the Meteorological Office.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para1">The list of weather stations to be used this winter and their respective linked postcode districts are contained within the amending regulations which were laid on 9 October, S.I. 1997 No. 2311. The weather stations at Bingley and Ringway--Manchester airport--will continue to be used for postcode districts in the High Peak constituency.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para2">After the end of each winter, representations made regarding the suitability of individual weather stations or their respective links with individual postcode districts are reviewed. Expert advice is sought from the Meteorological Office.

 The annual review has taken place against a backdrop of successful Government moves to cut fuel costs and a wide-ranging programme to make homes easier to heat. The Government are determined to tackle the problems associated with vulnerable people keeping warm during cold weather. Action will go well beyond the scope of cold weather payments.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para3">Fuel costs for many of the poorest claimants are falling. The annual fuel bills for people eligible for CWPs are estimated to be &#163;60 million less this year than last. This fall itself is equivalent to nearly three CWPs. Last year eligible people received an average of two payments.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para4">This winter, fuel bills will fall due to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's reduction in VAT on fuel bills from eight to 5 per cent., removal of the gas levy, and recent reductions in the cost of fuel and light.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para5">Help with energy efficiency grants will continue for householders on low income benefits, disability allowances, or who are aged 60 or over. A further 400,000 vulnerable households will receive help this year. The grants have been extended to cover two new main measures--cavity wall insulation and upgrading of heating system controls.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para6">The environmental task force element of the Government's welfare-to-work new deal is now taking shape. It is expected to include a programme of energy efficiency improvements in homes of the elderly.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para7">This year's review also concluded that two further changes could not be implemented without increasing the complexity and uncertainty of the scheme and would not have provided a guaranteed improvement in the perceived fairness of the scheme.




<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 1997 : Column: 856</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para8">The first proposed change made use of a new product from the Meteorological Office, which would have removed the need for an annual review of post code to weather station links, but would have lead to the number of post code groups within Great Britain increasing from the present 70 to over 600. Increasing the number of areas would have created far more occasions when people in neighbouring streets received a different number of payments and made the scheme far more difficult to understand. Therefore, we decided not to introduce this change, but to keep the current arrangements under review.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para9">We also considered a new report commissioned from the Building Research Establishment into the effect of wind speed on domestic heating needs during very cold weather. Copies of the BRE report have been placed in the Library. The report was considered alongside the action the Government have already taken to cut fuel bills and promote energy efficiency. We were also mindful of our manifesto commitment to live within inherited expenditure plans.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para10">Allowing for the effects of wind speed would increase the complexity and uncertainty of the scheme without ensuring that the payments went to those with the greatest need for additional heating. The amount of additional heating required depends on a number of varying factors, including the house type, insulation standard, method of heating used and its efficiency.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para11">If the current level of expenditure was maintained, but the scheme was changed to take into account wind speed, it is highly likely that many people in less windy areas would lose payments which they could expect to receive under the current arrangements.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para12">Taking into account all the relevant considerations we have decided not to amend the scheme to take account of wind speed.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para13">The annual review of the CWP scheme has now been completed. The review involved consideration of representations made during last winter regarding the suitability of individual weather stations or their respective links with post code districts. Amending regulations were laid on 9 October.
<P>

<a name="71030w05.html_para14">In line with the Meterological Office expert advice, we have increased the number of weather stations used in the scheme from 70--the number used last winter--to 72. The two additional weather stations will improve the fairness with which payments are made in the affected areas. The two additional weather stations will be in Scotland. One at Waterstein head will represent most of the Isle of Skye and the other at Salsburgh will represent some inland areas in the south of Scotland.

 A study, jointly funded by the Department of Health, the Department of Trade and Industry and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Agency entitled "Variations in the concentration of plutonium, strontium-90 and total alpha-emitters in human teeth collected within the British Isles" was published in "The Science of the Total Environment 201 (1997) 235-243". Copies of the study have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71030w07.html_para2">The results of the study suggest that the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant may contribute to the plutonium found in teeth in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. However the levels of plutonium measured were 1,000 times less than other radioactive substances also present in teeth from natural sources. The authors have acknowledged that the levels of plutonium were so low that they present an insignificant risk to health.

 In the current round of appointments to national health service trusts in the North Thames region, there are vacancies for 24 chairmen and 91 non-executive directors. All these appointments are made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health on the advice of the regional chairman. Given the time constraints for this year's trust exercise, it has not always been possible to involve new chairmen in shortlisting candidates for non-executive directors for their trusts. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote on 30 October inviting a candidate to accept the post of chairman of Basildon and Thurrock General Hospitals NHS trust. The new chairman's views will be taken into account on who should fill the two non-executive posts at the trust which fall vacant on 1 December.

<a name="71030w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 National health service trusts make over 3 million payments per quarter to a very large number of suppliers. The details are not therefore collected by the Department. In the first quarter of 1997-98, approximately 80 per cent. of payments were made on time.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1997]:</i> The information available on numbers of transplants has been placed in the Library. These show the numbers of transplants carried out for the last 10 years broken down by region. Many hospitals do not perform kidney transplants, and there are just eight designated cardiothoracic transplant units and six designated liver units in England. This is the main reason for the considerable variation in the numbers of transplants performed in different regions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the Transport costs incurred by jobseeker's allowance claimants in rural areas in meeting the requirement regularly to sign on at their local jobcentre by virtue of their residence within four hours' travelling distance; and if he will make a statement. [13218]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 We want as many jobseekers as possible to have regular access to jobcentre advice and services, to help them return to work as quickly possible. The great majority therefore attend each fortnight. However, a small minority sign by post instead, because of the distance they live from the jobcentre. Postal signing is normally agreed for anyone whose normal door-to-door journey to the jobcentre using public transport using public transport would take more than an hour in either direction, or would have to be away from home for more than four hours in total.
<P>

<a name="71030w08.html_para1">We have made no estimate of the costs incurred in fortnightly attendance at the jobcentre. Most people incur some costs, and it has never been the practice to refund them. Jobcentres can of course consider accommodating jobseekers' normal day of attendance to any weekday on which they may regularly travel to the town concerned.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 La Sainte Union college of higher education merged with university of Southampton on 1 September 1997. The congregation of La Sainte Union des Sacres Coeurs owns the land and buildings used by the college. The congregation has agreed to sell the academic and associated buildings to the university and to grant the university an option to purchase the student residence at a later date. The estate has been partly financed by public funds and Government have an interest in ensuring that any disposals or transfers comply with requirements for propriety, regularity and value for money.

<a name="71030w08.html_para2">The Government have agreed that the Higher Education Funding Council for England may waive the standard condition in its financial memorandum with the college requiring it to repay the Government interest in the estate to the Exchequer when it is transferred to the university. In return, the university has agreed that the estate will continue to be used for higher education, and has accepted responsibility to repay the Government interest in the estate to the Exchequer if it is disposed of in the future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the total additional budget allocation for grant-maintained schools in England, in addition to that which they received through their local management of schools funding allocation, for <i>(a)</i> 1989-90, <i>(b)</i> 1990-91, <i>(c)</i> 1991-92, <i>(d)</i> 1992-93 and <i>(e)</i> 1993-94. [13176]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 For the years in question, the annual maintenance grant for grant-maintained schools consisted of three principal elements. The first--direct AMG--is what the GM school would have received under the local management of schools scheme of its former maintaining LEA. The second--meals AMG--consisted of an amount for school meals reflecting subsidy levels in the relevant LEA for net expenditure on school meals. The third--central AMG--is an amount for services which LEA schools received free of charge but for which GM schools assumed direct responsibility, and was a simple percentage of the first sum. The central percentage is determined by the Secretary of State and under current arrangements is calculated for individual local education authorities by reference to the financial returns that they make.




<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 1997 : Column: 867</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71030w08.html_para5">We recognise that the current arrangements for funding GM schools treat them differently from LEA schools, and can lead to unwarranted financial advantage to some GM schools. We are proposing in 1998-99 to move to a fairer funding system and we are presently considering the responses to consultation on our proposals. These proposals include transitional arrangements, where necessary, to minimise disruption to individual GM school budgets.

<a name="71030w08.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Universities and colleges will be responsible for collecting tuition fees from their students and for deciding what should happen in the case of students who fail to pay their fees, bearing in mind that their grants from the Higher Education Funding Council for England will assume this new source of income.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if all university students from throughout the United Kingdom will be charged a flat rate tuition fee of &#163;3,000 for a degree level course. [13361]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Full-time undergraduate students will be required to contribute up to &#163;1,000 a year towards tuition fees, depending on the assessment of parental or spouse's income. It will be possible for full-time undergraduate students from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to undertake a degree course for a maximum contribution of &#163;3,000 to tuition fees, but students may opt for degree courses lasting longer than three years. In that case, the total level of contribution, depending on assessment of parental or spouse's income, will be higher, subject to the special arrangements which will apply to students on medical and dental courses in year five and beyond and to Scottish students taking four-year honours degrees, in recognition of the fact that many Scottish students will have spent only one year in the sixth form. No contributions will be required from students from low-income families.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w08.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 We have asked the Scottish Office to encourage Scottish universities, where they do not do so already, to admit English and Welsh students with appropriate A-levels into the second year of their four-year honours degree courses, so that English and Welsh students will be able to obtain a Scottish honours degree for the same maximum contribution--&#163;3,000--towards tuition fees as Scottish students. Students from low-income families will not, however, be required to contribute to fees.

 The timeshare industry in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Timeshare Act 1992, as amended by the Timeshare Regulations 1997, which implemented the EU timeshare directive.

 In line with other Government Departments, the DTI is responsible for payments relating to the goods and services it procures. There are well-established procedures aimed at promoting efficient and effective procurement and prompt payment. In general, each management unit within the Department is responsible for purchases in relation to its own needs. The Department's central procurement standards unit formulates overall policy and disseminates best practice. Payments of invoices are contracted out to CSL Managed Services, which provides the Department's accounts services and similar services to a range of other public

 1. It has been normal practice for statistics relating to decisions on applications for standard individual export licences for strategic goods to be placed periodically in the Library. However, a number of problems have been identified with the export control licence information processing system, ECLIPS, which came into operation in March 1995, on which details of such applications are recorded.
<P>

<a name="71030w09.html_para0">2. It should be made clear that the problems identified relate to the accuracy of recording and subsequent retrieval of information from the databases; they have not affected the processing of, and decision-making on, individual export licence applications. They fall into three main categories:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) In general, over the last few years, where a single application has involved a range of goods, only the major item of goods on the application has been recorded on ECLIPS, together with the entry in the legislation under which this item is controlled (known as the 'rating'). Any other goods on the application have been considered in the licensing process, but not recorded on the computer system.
<P>
<BR>
(ii) Conversion and input errors have been found in data transferred to ECLIPS from earlier computer systems.
<P>
<BR>
(iii) Errors and omissions have been found in the entry and updating of information on ECLIPS since it came into operation.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71030w09.html_para1">The House will be aware that it has been necessary in the past to correct a number of answers to questions, for example the question asked by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), <i>Official Report</i>, 13 June 1996 column <i>263</i>.
<P>

<a name="71030w09.html_para2">3. Data integrity problems also arise with the separately recorded data on applications for open individual export licences, on which information has not been included in the statistics placed in the Library.

<P>

<a name="71030w09.html_para4">While these can be searched by rating, comparison with a generic or specific description may be possible only in some cases by examining the original paper records.
<P>

<a name="71030w09.html_para5">5. As a result of checking answers given to parliamentary questions since this Government took office, three errors have now been identified affecting the answer to five separate questions; four asked by the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Mrs. Clwyd) and one by the hon. Member for Westbury (Mr. Faber). Both have been informed by letter, copies of which have been placed in the Library of both Houses. Apart from this, however, as it is now clear that the databases do not provide a fully accurate record, some previous answers, using information obtained from the databases, could be proved wrong if recourse were made to the original paper records, of which there are some 280,000. In the light of this, all information given by this and previous Administrations--either in answer to parliamentary questions, or in correspondence, or elsewhere--relying on data obtained from these databases, should be read in conjunction with the following caveat:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This information is based on data retrieved from computer databases that have been found not to be fully comprehensive. It should therefore be treated as indicative only. For any single application involving a range of goods, all of the entries in the legislation under which all of these goods were controlled may not have been recorded. Additionally, there may have been errors and omissions in recording some information. The information could only be verified by undertaking a complete search of all paper records, which would entail excessive cost".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71030w09.html_para6">6. However, while it would not be cost-effective to seek to correct all the data available in the Library, the data for the second half of 1996 is being corrected by examination of the paper records. This work will be completed as soon as possible and the aim is to place in the Library before the end of the year statistics covering this period, albeit subject to the above caveat.
<P>

<a name="71030w09.html_para7">For the first time, these will include statistics on open individual export licences granted; copies of all current open general export licences will also be provided.

 On 18 July I invited authorities that have been or are to be reorganised on or before 1 April 1998 to submit estimates of the amount of expenditure they expect to incur on transitional costs of reorganisation in 1997-98. On the basis, inter alia, of the information provided by the authorities, I have decided the revised maximum amounts that it would be appropriate to allocate towards such costs in 1997-98. In the initial round, priority was given to authorities that were reorganised on 1 April 1997 and will be reorganising on 1 April 1998; I have adopted the same priorities for the mid-year stage of the scheme. The majority of the authorities to be reorganised in 1998 requested at the beginning of the scheme that allocations in respect of redundancy be deferred until this round. Accordingly, the allocations listed below for authorities reorganising in 1998 are intended to cover redundancy costs.

<P>

<a name="71030w11.html_para0">The group comprises senior officials from the Scottish Office and the Forestry Commission; and Professor John Bryden of Aberdeen university, who has long experience of land tenure issues, will act as external assessor. Over the next year the group will assess carefully the range of available options and I expect is report to provide a sound basis for early action by the new Scottish Parliament. Along with two related reports from the Scottish Law Commission on the abolition of feudal tenure and on reform of the law on real burdens, this should pave the way for early land reform legislation for the new millennium.

 The Inland Revenue will take appropriate action to secure payment of unpaid pay-as-you-earn and associated national insurance contributions, commensurate with the amount outstanding and the period during which it remains unpaid. The decision on what enforcement action is appropriate is made in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.
<P>

<a name="71030w12.html_para2">The Inland Revenue publishes a code of practice on collection of amounts due from employers--code of practice 7--which is available from tax offices and explains the recovery action it will take and taxpayer's rights and obligations.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71030w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 Implementation of the Bates review of the private finance initiative is streamlining the initiative, reducing costs to the public and private sectors and making such investment a much more attractive proposition. Recent major contracts, such as Dartford and Gravesham hospital and Clarendon school, provide real evidence of the benefits to be gained from public-private partnerships.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Bill that was published on 28 October will put on a statutory footing the important reforms to the Bank of England, which we announced in May. These reforms have been widely welcomed and will be a significant step towards reducing short-termism and putting decision making on the right basis to deliver the long-term growth and employment that is a major objective of our economic policy. The Bill also represents a major move toward creating the single regulator that will deliver more effective and efficient regulation for financial services.

 The Government want a stable competitive pound over the medium term, consistent with the objective of price stability. Industry is best helped by Government preventing any return to the cycle of boom and bust, and to pursue sound, long-term macroeconomic policies.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will assess the advantages of reducing or removing VAT on crime prevention devices when these are purchased by local crime prevention panels for fitting in the homes of pensioners at no cost to those pensioners.[12686]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w13.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government are committed to reducing crime and creating safer communities through a wide range of strategies. EC law does not allow the introduction of new VAT zero rates, nor does the directive provide for a reduced rate to be introduced for purchases of crime prevention devices.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the public expenditure implications of the withdrawal of tax relief for private health insurance for pensioners. [12687]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w13.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 No firm estimate is available of the public expenditure costs arising from the withdrawal of tax relief for private medical insurance for those aged over 60. This depends on the number of those affected who give up their policies. In the light of past experience, we believe that no more than a small proportion will give up their policies so that the public expenditure cost will be significantly lower than the full-year saving of &#163;140 million. Details of the public expenditure element of that saving are given at paragraph 2A.6 of the "Financial Statement and Budget Report 1997".

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71030w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Five further reviews have been set up. They are departmental spending reviews of the Crown Office (Scotland) and the Northern Ireland criminal justice system and cross-departmental reviews of the intelligence agencies, provision for young children and illegal drugs. The terms of reference have been placed in the Library today.
<P>

<a name="71030w13.html_para2">The collected set of terms of reference also includes a correct copy of those for the review of the criminal justice system. I regret that an incorrect early draft of the terms of reference was mistakenly included in the set deposited in the Library on 24 July. The changes are highlighted in italics.
<P>

<a name="71030w13.html_para3">These additional reviews underline the commitment of the Government to look at all items of public spending and produce spending plans for the long term. In particular, the cross-departmental reviews announced today further reinforce the commitment to a truly comprehensive review throughout all parts of government and across traditional departmental boundaries.
