<a name="80423w01.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Various technical reports are being prepared which will be relevant in the operation of local authorities' planning and building regulation functions, as well as in their future operation of the regulatory regime for contaminated land under the Environment Act 1995. These reports cover issues including guideline values for the assessment of the potential threats to human health posed by contaminants and model procedures for the management of contaminated land, from identification of the problem through the selection of the remediation option to assurance that the problem has been successfully dealt with. The Department expects these reports to be ready for publication in the autumn.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the progressive lifting of the broadcast entertainment restrictions affecting BT and other public telecommunications operators; and if she will make a statement.  [39839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80423w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Government have considered the options for fulfilling their commitment carefully, and I am today publishing our conclusions. A copy of the document setting out the Government's approach has been placed in the Library of the House. In summary, we have concluded that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Public Telecommunications Operators (PTOs) along with all other operators should immediately have the option to compete in the provision of broadcast entertainment to the 17% of UK homes currently outside cable franchise areas;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) PTOs and others should be allowed to compete in the provision of broadcast services, if they so wish, throughout the whole country from 1 January 2001.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80423w01.html_para5">We are following through on our commitment. We need to remove the uncertainty, created by the previous Government, over when and how the restrictions they placed on BT and other PTOs might be lifted. It has become increasingly damaging for all operators--including cable. All operators need greater certainty and clarity about the regulatory position as they plan long-term investments for advanced digital services.

<P>
<a name="80423w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information is not held in the form requested and could be obtained only by means of a survey at disproportionate cost. The Hydrographic Unit of the Ministry of Defence has, however, supplied the following information. The approximate area of sea between the low water line and the 12 mile limit is 49,473 square nautical miles. From the low water line to the 200 mile limit covers an area of approximately 211,130 square nautical miles. Both figures include areas of water inside the baselines.

[37565]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80423w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A scheme aimed at compulsorily purchasing vessels and licence entitlements owned by non-UK interests would not be permissible under Community law. Nor would it be permissible to prevent any non-UK interests who have previously left the industry from re-investing in the UK fleet. Such a scheme could not therefore be used to help achieve the UK's outstanding fishing fleet reduction targets which, along with levels of non-UK ownership, vary considerably from segment to segment of the fleet. All UK registered fishing vessels have been eligible to apply for decommissioning, regardless of ownership.

 Since 1 January 1993, 3.31 acres in total of the Stormont Estate have been used for the sites of new temporary buildings (2.782 acres) or paving (.526 acres). The requirement for additional accommodation was brought about as a consequence of the fire in Parliament Buildings, the need to relieve overcrowding in other buildings in the Estate and to make provision for the political negotiations at Block B, Castle Buildings, which also required the creation of new car parking facilities elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="80423w03.html_para0">While the Crown is not bound by planning legislation, there is a procedure by which the Planning Service is consulted before Crown development proceeds.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the rate of maternal mortality from <i>(a)</i> acute respiratory infection, <i>(b)</i> diarrhoeal disease and <i>(c)</i> measles, as a proportion of total mortality in those refugee camps to which her Department provides assistance.

 Maternal mortality is defined by the World Health Organisation as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy from causes related to or aggravated by pregnancy. The leading global causes of maternal mortality are severe bleeding, infection, unsafe abortion, eclampsia and obstructed labour. It is estimated that there are 585,000 such deaths throughout the world per year. However, the death of a

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what aspects of the support her Department gives under the <i>(a)</i> Tacis, <i>(b)</i> Phare and <i>(c)</i> other assistance programmes to Eastern European and former states of the Soviet Union, are aimed at combating the smuggling of nuclear materials from these countries to (i) the United Kingdom and (ii) the EU.

expenditure of 1,750 mecu in 1997) contain nuclear safety programmes which have been used to provide advice to countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia on the safe handling and storage of nuclear materials, including specific provision of a nuclear materials accountancy system in the region. Assistance from Phare and Tacis has also helped to improve border controls in the region, and should have had an indirect effect on smuggling of nuclear materials into the EU. Other multilateral institutions, such as the EBRD, to whom we contribute, have some activities in the nuclear safety sector; details are not immediately available to us. Assistance in this sector is not a priority for my Department's bilateral programme of technical assistance.

 Government support for education spending is provided mainly through the education SSA system but these are not recommended levels of expenditure. Essex's education SSA for 1998-99 is some &#163;497 million--an increase of some &#163;27 million or 5.8 per cent. I understand that Essex budgeted to spend some &#163;475 million on education in 1997-98, &#163;5 million more than the SSA for education (allowing for local government reorganisation) and has budgeted to spend some &#163;494 million in 1998-99 which is &#163;3 million less than its education SSA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to amend the Social Security (Students) Regulations 1998 to allow students who for bona fide reasons take time out from their studies to have access to state benefits.  [39021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80423w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Financial support is already available for higher education students who take time out from their studies owing to illness. In England and Wales, the Mandatory Awards Regulations provide that when a student is ill, the Local Education Authority (LEA) must continue to make payments under the award for 28 days. If a student remains ill after 28 days, the LEA has discretion to continue payments. Where a student has been absent from the course through illness for 28 weeks, he or she may apply for Income Support. At this point, the LEA support would be expected to cease. In England and Wales, the LEA also has discretion to continue support for other bona fide reasons.
<P>

<a name="80423w04.html_para1">In Scotland, students who are necessarily absent from their course owing to illness, but who intend to resume as soon as circumstances permit, may continue to receive maintenance from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) so long as they remain enrolled on the course.

<a name="80423w04.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The maximum amount that a student can borrow will depend on the place of study, as well as the student's and his or her parents' or spouse's income. Under the Government's proposals, a student completing a three-year course outside London which began in 1998 and who took out the full loan available each year might expect to have borrowed a total of &#163;9,355 in 1998 prices. The comparable figure under the Dearing Committee's proposals would be &#163;8,083, assuming full implementation in 1998/99. Repayments under our proposed system will be made only when a graduate's income exceeds &#163;10,000 a year and the level of repayments will then be linked directly to the individual's income above that amount. A graduate with an income of &#163;17,000 per annum, for example, would make weekly repayments of about &#163;12 a week.
<P>

<a name="80423w04.html_para3">Students and their families will be expected to contribute no more up front to the costs of their higher education under our proposals than they would under the current arrangements. Our proposals will ensure that students have access to the funds which they need while they are studying while generating substantial additional resources for investment in higher and further education.

 The first meeting of the Commonwealth Business Council took place in London on 20 and 21 April under the chairmanship of Lord Cairns, with Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa as Vice-Chairman. It was attended by a number of leading business persons from throughout the Commonwealth. As agreed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, its objective is to promote greater private sector involvement in the promotion of trade and investment, and thus prosperity, throughout the Commonwealth. The British Government were pleased to provide &#163;250,000 towards the Council's start-up costs. We hope that other Commonwealth Governments and the private sector will also want to contribute to this most valuable initiative.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80423w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The Chief Medical Officer's 1996 Annual Report examined the links between Health, Work and the Economy (Chapter 5). Overall, the report concluded that the excess of people who are economically inactive in Wales is due, firstly to a higher prevalence of limiting long-term illness, and secondly to a higher proportion of the long-term ill not working. There is evidence to suggest a correlation between poor living and working conditions and illness and disease. For example, the Welsh Health Survey (1995) found that people doing unskilled work have higher than average levels of heart disease, respiratory disease, mental illness, arthritis and pain.

 The deep repair and overhaul of aviation equipment are currently provided in the Ministry of Defence facilities (known as Third Line) and by Industry (known as Fourth line). Third Line work is currently undertaken by two separate Defence Agencies, the Naval Aircraft Repair Organisation (NARO) for helicopters and the RAF Maintenance Group Defence Agency (RAF MGDA) for fixed wing aircraft.

<a name="80423w07.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 During the passage of the Armed Forces Act 1996 it was suggested that the death penalty, in the Service context, should be abolished. As a result the previous administration undertook to carry out a fundamental review of the need to retain the death penalty as a maximum punishment for certain offences under Service law. This work is in progress. I will advise the House of the outcome as soon as possible.

 The Government are fully committed to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative that was launched by the IMF and World Bank in September 1996. In his speech to Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Mauritius last year, the Chancellor called on the international community to commit itself to dealing with the problem of unsustainable debt burdens faced by the world's poorest countries once and for all. He urged creditors and debtors to undertake action in order to ensure that at least three-quarters of the twenty countries, initially identified by the World Bank and IMF as probably needing debt relief under the HIPC initiative, have had decisions on the size and timing of their relief by the year 2000.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80423w07.html_spnew14"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The personal sector saving ratio was 11 per cent. in 1997. A modest cyclical fall in the saving ratio is expected over the next three years. But over the longer term the introduction of ISAs and policies to promote economic growth and stability will increase the incentive to save for investment.

 I have received a number of representations from companies located throughout the United Kingdom about the abolition of intra-European union duty free sales in June 1999. However, no records are held which would readily identify the geographical locations of those companies. Obtaining the information cannot be undertaken except at disproportionate cost.
