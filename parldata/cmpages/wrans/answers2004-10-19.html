<a name="41019w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Animal By-Products Regulation</h3>


<p><a name="41019w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Gray: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the Hove district council vehicles, which removed the carcases from the recent Labour Party Conference, met the vehicle specifications laid down in the Animal By-Products Regulation.  [190794]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is the Department&#039;s understanding that the vehicles used met with the vehicle specifications laid down in the Animal By-Products Regulations. This was achieved through the use of tarpaulins to cover and contain the carcases and the use of absorbent granules to soak up any leakage.
</p>




<a name="41019w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Animal Welfare</h3>


<p><a name="41019w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr Battle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has made to other EU member states concerning animal welfare standards in live animal transport; and if she will make a statement.  [190005]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Government will raise specific issues with EU member states and candidate member states whenever necessary. The UK&#039;s concern for high enforcement standards was made very clear earlier this year during discussion of proposals for a new regulation on animal welfare during transport. We welcome the news that the Dutch Presidency has brought the EU proposals on welfare on transport back to member states for discussion.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what protection is afforded to sites of archaeological interest from being <i>(a)</i> built on and <i>(b)</i> farmed inappropriately.  [191150]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w01.html_para0">
Protection for such activities is afforded under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. In addition potential developers are required to follow guidelines issued in the Planning Policy Guidance Note 16.

<p><a name="41019w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to bring forward legislation to improve the welfare of broiler chickens, with particular regard to <i>(a)</i> lower

stocking densities, <i>(b)</i> longer periods of darkness to allow for rest and <i>(c)</i> environmental enrichment to allow for natural behaviour; and if she will make a statement.  [190485]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 General standards for the welfare of all farm animals are laid down on an EU basis and apply to broiler chickens. Additional standards of best practice are set out in the Code of Recommendations for Meat Chickens. Any legislation setting standards for the welfare of meat chickens should be applied on an EU basis to ensure a level playing field. The European Commission expects to issue proposals for such standards in the near future.

<a name="41019w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Drainage Regulations</h3>


<p><a name="41019w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Gray: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what definition her Department uses of the phrase floors laid to facilitate the drainage of liquids, used in Regulation 1774/2002 and SI 2003 No.1482.  [190724]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 To comply with this requirement, we would expect floors to be constructed from an impervious material with proper falls to drains to ensure that washing water and effluent do not form puddles in the area.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Animal By-Products Regulation with respect to the collection of fallen stock.  [190721]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 In all cases, animal by-products (including fallen stock) must be collected/transported in accordance with Annex II of Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002, the &#039;Animal By-Products Regulation&#039;. This requires animal by-products to be transported either in sealed, new packaging or in covered, leak-proof containers or vehicles. The vehicle, container or packaging must also be labelled in accordance with Annex II and accompanied by the required documentation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many establishments, which previously received and processed fallen stock, are no longer able to do so because of her Department&#039;s enforcement of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation.  [190723]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b>

<p><a name="41019w01.html_wqn8"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what financial or other assistance will be offered by the Government to the owners of greyhounds affected by an immediate ban on hare coursing in England and Wales under the Hunting Bill.  [189748]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew8"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government is not providing financial compensation to accompany this Bill because nobody is being deprived of their property as a result of it. Dogs and other property currently used for hare coursing events can continue to be used for other legal purposes. However, the Government recognises that the Bill will affect the owners of dogs that currently engage in hunting and coursing and is ready to explore ways in which they might be assisted to avoid the unnecessary destruction of healthy animals. The Government is very grateful for the RSPCA&#039;s offer to help re-home dogs no longer wanted as a result of this Bill. The RSPCA has considerable previous experience in successfully re-homing retired racing greyhounds.

<p><a name="41019w01.html_wqn10"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs why she has sought a derogation from the EU directive on the size of flocks for the production of organic chicken and eggs.  [191096]</p>




<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The derogation to which you are referring to is the provision within Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 which permits stocking densities and flock sizes higher than normally permitted, in respect of livestock producing holdings, for buildings constructed before 24 August 1999, until 31 December 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w01.html_para4">
The Compendium of UK Standards, however, only permitted the derogation until 25 August 2005, which would mean UK poultry producers would be disadvantaged compared with their counterparts in other member states. My Department reviewed the effect of maintaining the date at 2005 for the UK and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Oct 2004 : Column 558W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
sought the views of the organic sector, retailers and ACOS, Defra&#039;s Advisory Committee on Organic Standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w01.html_para5">
After careful consideration of all the representations received and taking account of the interests of the organic poultry sector as a whole, I decided that organic poultry producers should be allowed to continue to benefit from the derogation until 31 December 2010, which puts UK producers on an even footing with those in the rest of the European Union.

<p><a name="41019w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The report &quot;Action plan to develop organic food and farming in England&#151;Two Years On, which I launched on 2 August this year, contains an analysis of the market for organic food. The document expects continued growth in sales of organic food. It notes that the area farmed organically in the UK has grown from 30,000 ha in 1993 to 696,000 in 2004. This is an expansion of over 23 times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w01.html_para8">
The level of UK demand for organic food met by UK producers has increased over the last two years from 30 per cent. to 44 per cent., but the report recognises a target of 70 per cent. to be met from UK production by 2010. Our support for organic farming includes enhancements introduced last year to the English Organic Farming scheme to allow farmers who have completed organic conversion to receive payments in return for observing environmental conditions and a new rate of aid for conversion for organic top fruit production (apples, pears etc). For the longer term support for organic farming will be through a specific strand in the Agri&#151;Environment Scheme.

 We do not have a budget specifically for the generic promotion of organic food and crops. However, the Rural Enterprise Scheme, which forms part of the England Rural Development Programme, can provide assistance towards good value and sustainable projects that help market organic and other quality agricultural products. Since the launch of the scheme in October 2000, the scheme&#039;s marketing measure has provided the funding for promoting organic produce as shown in the following table.

<p><a name="41019w03.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Simmonds: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps his Department is taking to discourage deforestation in poor countries prone to flooding; and if he will make a statement.  [192054]</p>




<p><a name="41019w03.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID&#039;s support to forestry in poor countries aims to help them manage and conserve their forests to provide the goods and services that people need. Protection of watersheds is one of these services. DFID spends about &#163;20 million a year on forestry through country programmes and centrally funded research. DFID currently supports forestry work in Brazil, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para0">
In addition, DFID invests about &#163;29 million a year in the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a significant share of which is spent on forest conservation. To date the GEF has invested $770 million in 150 forestry projects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para1">
DFID also contributes funds to a number of international organisations that have significant programmes of support to forestry, such as the World Bank, the UN&#039;s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the European Commission.
</p>




<a name="41019w03.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Know How Fund</h3>


<p><a name="41019w03.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list projects financed through the Know How Fund in the past 12 months, broken down by type of project.  [192218]</p>




<p><a name="41019w03.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Assistance provided through the Know How Fund concluded in 1997. DFID&#039;s work in the Accession Countries, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and the Western Balkans since 1997 is set out in Country and Regional Strategy Papers. A review of DFID/ODA&#039;s programmes in the Accession Countries (Evaluation Report EV650) is available on DFID&#039;s website. www.dfid.gov.uk

<p><a name="41019w03.html_wqn2"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations he has received on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Darfur.  [191548]</p>




<p><a name="41019w03.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I am gravely concerned about the situation in Darfur, Sudan. The UN estimates that 2 million are people are in need of assistance in Darfur, including 1.45 million displaced. The World Food Programme estimated that in September over 1.3 million received food aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para2">
However, delivery of assistance is still inadequate. The World Health Organisation estimates that between 6,000&#150;10,000 people are dying each month in Darfur. Insecurity and logistical difficulties continue to hamper the delivery of assistance. DFID is pressing all parties to the conflict to abide by the ceasefire and improve security. In addition, we have provided over &#163;4 million to the World Food Programme for their logistical operations in Darfur and over &#163;1 million to the UN for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Oct 2004 : Column 566W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission if he will make a statement on progress made by the House of Commons Commission in considering matters within its responsibility.  [193008]</p>




<p><a name="41019w03.html_spnew3"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </b> 
 At its meeting on 18 October, the House of Commons Commission considered the report on security on the parliamentary estate commissioned, together with the House of Lords authorities, from the Metropolitan Police and security service. This report has already been subject to detailed consideration by the informal joint committee on security which advises the presiding officers of both Houses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para3">
The Commission does not propose to publish any details of the proposals in the report, which is for obvious reasons a classified document. Some recent enhancements of security arrangements have already been announced to Members. Work is already under way in a number of other areas, including planning for the permanent screen to be erected in the Chamber in 2005. The Commission has also agreed in principle to the appointment of a Parliamentary Security Co-ordinator. Many of the proposals will of course also require the agreement of the authorities in the House of Lords.

 To ask the Solicitor-General what the result was of the internal complaints procedure investigation into the conduct by the Crown Prosecution Service of its decision to prosecute Linda Watson for the murder of her husband; and if she will make a statement.  [190588]</p>




<p><a name="41019w03.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 There has been no internal complaints procedure investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service staff who dealt with the case are not aware of any complaint having been made in relation to the conduct of the case, either at the time or subsequently.

<p><a name="41019w03.html_wqn5"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent submissions he has received on the effect on building standards of the introduction of competition into building control; and if he will make a statement.  [192289]</p>




<p><a name="41019w03.html_spnew4"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Private sector competition in building control is regulated through the Approved Inspectors (AIs) Regulations 2000. Building owners have the option of employing AIs as an alternative to traditional

local authority building control services. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has designated the Construction Industry Council (CIC) as the vetting authority for AIs. Any submission concerning a reduction in building standards involving AIs would be dealt with seriously by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in conjunction with the CIC. There are no recent examples of such an occurrence.

<p><a name="41019w03.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s approach to devolving decision-making was set out in the Devolved Decision Making Review, issued alongside Budget 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para4">
At regional level the White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice&quot; set out proposals for directly elected regional assemblies in those regions that wish to have them. On 4 November 2004, regional and local referendums will take place to decide whether an elected assembly is established in the North East.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para5">
The Government is working with the RDAs to develop a new framework for setting their objectives. This will simplify and strengthen the current arrangements and make sure performance is measured against real regional and national priorities. In the Spending Review 2004 the Government announced:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Increased Regional Development Agency (RDA) funding from &#163;1.85 billion in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;2.3 billion by 2007&#150;08. Since 2002, each RDA&#039;s funding has been in a single pot, giving them substantial flexibility to use their resources to respond to regional priorities;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">RDAs will take on responsibility for the delivery of Business Link services, R and D grants and promoting enterprise in disadvantaged areas from April 2005;</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In those regions where the RDA and Learning and Skills Council (LSC) want it, the Government will consider favourably a &#039;dual key&#039; approach to the management of adult skills budgets operated by the RDA Chief Executive and the Regional LSC Director;</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">RDAs will have an enhanced role in supporting business-university collaboration, as part of the response to the Lambert Review;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Government is examining new ways to integrate regional economic strategies with regional transport and spatial development strategies, within a framework of indicative long term funding guidelines. The first guideline budgets for the English regions will be published alongside the Chancellor&#039;s 2005 Budget statement.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para6">
At local level, the Government published &#039;The future of local government: Developing a 10 year vision&#039;, which sets out how the Government is taking the Devolving Decision Making review forward in the context of a longer term strategy for local government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w03.html_para7">
As part of this work, the Government recently announced proposals to pilot Local Area Agreements (LAAs) in 21 local authorities. LAAs are intended to simplify funding streams, join up public services and give councils and other local delivery partners more flexibility. They will build on the package of freedoms and flexibilities already given to local authorities.

 The Overarching Evaluation of the Local Government Modernisation Agenda (LGMA) commenced in January 2002 and is due to be completed in December 2007.

The evaluation aims to draw together the lessons learned from evaluations of the 20 or more individual policy elements of the LGMA, such as the Best Value Regime, Local Public Service Agreements, New Council Constitutions and Local Strategic Partnerships. It seeks to provide an overview of the impacts of the LGMA as a whole in the key areas of service improvement, accountability, community leadership, stakeholder engagement and public confidence. It also seeks to provide an understanding of how these policies interact and key drivers of change to inform current delivery of policies and future policy development.

The evaluation is designed to produce a series of annual reports, conference presentations, seminars, and specific thematic and policy papers throughout the lifetime of the study.

The project is overseen by a Steering Group, administered and chaired by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with the Audit Commission, IDeA, LGA, Employers Organisation and SOLACE as members. The Steering Group has developed a dissemination strategy, drawing on the resources available to each organisation, to ensure the lessons learned from this work reach local government as effectively as possible.

 Local authorities have been producing capital strategies and asset management plans since 2000.

<p><a name="41019w06.html_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I understand from the Department for Work and Pensions that the earliest date for which figures below country level are available for the number of children for whom child benefit was paid is August 1999. At that date there were 1,130 thousand such children in Yorkshire and Humberside and 21,000 in the City of York constituency. The latest available figures, for November 2003, appear on the Inland Revenue website, at http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/child benefit/menu.htm
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w06.html_para1">
When comparing these figures, note that between each August and November, the number of such children drops by around 2 per cent. This is because from early September each year awards no longer cover young people aged 16 to 18 unless they remain in full-time non-advanced education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w06.html_para2">
In 1997&#150;98 the weekly rate of child benefit was &#163;11.05 for the first child and &#163;9.00 for the second and subsequent children. The current rates are &#163;16.50, and &#163;11.05, respectively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the Future Rapid Effects System requirement includes a requirement for a multi-feed processing system and a real time intelligence capability similar to that envisaged as part of the US FCS programme.  [190059]</p>




<p><a name="41019w09.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Rapid Effect System requirement is for a family of fighting platforms (including a range of Ground Manoeuvre Reconnaissance roles), which only when integrated with a variety of other capabilities produces a complete system of systems. It will seek to make full use of any intelligence-gathering capabilities that are, or become, available. However, the project is still in the early stages of its Assessment Phase and therefore the precise nature of the interface with other capabilities is not yet determined. The Assessment Phase will consider any relevant comparisons with the US PCS programme, along with other similar programmes.

 In 1993 the then Government decided, as part of its Strategic Defence Review, to withdraw the four Upholder Submarines from service. The vessels were actively marketed to overseas Governments and in 1998 the United Kingdom agreed a lease-to-buy arrangement with the Canadian Government.

The submarines were refurbished to meet all Royal Navy operational standards before handover to the Canadians. The submarines also received minor equipment updates and modifications to meet Canadian requirements.

<p>
<a name="41019w10.html_para1">
The fourth submarine, HMS Upholder, was accepted by, and handed over to Canada on 2 October 2004, when she became HMCS Chicoutimi. She began her transit to Halifax, Nova Scotia from the Faslane Submarine Base in Scotland on 4 October. A fire broke out onboard HMCS Chicoutimi when she was some 120 miles west of the Irish coast. A full rescue and recovery was initiated and coordinated by the UKMOD&#039;s Fleet Operations at Northwood. HMS Montrose, who sailed from Faslane, was the first maritime unit on the scene. There were nine casualties from smoke inhalation. Three of these gave cause for concern and were evacuated to Sligo Hospital; sadly one of the casualties, Lt(N) Chris Saunders, died while the evacuation was under way.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what mechanism his Department uses to regulate comments by <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials on cases subject to ongoing legal proceedings.  [183215]</p>




<p><a name="41019w12.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 12 July 2004]:</i> All Ministers are bound by the Ministerial Code which sets out their overarching duty&#151;and that of Departments&#151;to comply with the law and to uphold the administration of justice. Ministers and officials are therefore well aware of the need to avoid any prejudice to legal proceedings.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures have been taken to correct the errors made by the Metropolitan police identified in the Macpherson Report; and what measures have been taken to achieve change needed to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  [157529]</p>




<p><a name="41019w12.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The report of the Inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence was published in February 1999 and made 70 recommendations, mainly relating to the police service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w12.html_para0">
At the time of publication the then Home Secretary gave a commitment to publish an action plan setting out how the recommendations of the report would be taken forward. This was published in March 1999 and annual updates have been published since, the latest being published in August 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w12.html_para1">
The Lawrence Steering Group (LSG) was established in 1999 to oversee progress on the implementation of the recommendations. The LSG is chaired by the Home Secretary and continues to meet on a regular basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w12.html_para2">
The majority of the SLIR recommendations have been either partially or fully implemented and work remains ongoing to fully implement those that have not and to monitor the effect implementation has had.

Copies of the latest Annual Report on progress have been placed in the Library of the House. The report contains a summary of progress against the recommendations.

<p><a name="41019w12.html_wqn2"><b> Peter Bottomley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when and how the transcripts of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry of 1999 will be made available to <i>(a)</i> Sir William Macpherson, Bishop John Sentanu and Dr Richard Stone, <i>(b)</i> the National Archive and <i>(c)</i> the general public; and if he will make a statement.  [184151]</p>




<p><a name="41019w12.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The papers emanating from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry amount to more than 80,000 pages not all of which have so far been published as part of the official report. There is a comprehensive review exercise underway to prepare material for transfer to The National Archives (TNA). Where it is possible to make the transferred material open for public inspection that will be my preferred approach. However the Inquiry examined a wide range of contributions and evidence that may not all be suitable for immediate release. The review exercise is planned to be completed by the middle of next year. My intention will be to release as much of the Inquiry&#039;s papers as possible, at the soonest date, without creating any adverse impact on necessary further investigations. It is essential that all the material is thoroughly reviewed and subjected to a detailed sensitivity appraisal before being made available for public inspection.

Factors such as quality of land, geology, drainage, environmental mitigation, traffic management and restricted access can all have a significant bearing on costs.

The associated Supporting pupils with medical needs:&quot; a good practice guide provides advice and information to schools on managing medication and pupils&#039; health needs including anaphylaxis (e.g. peanut allergy). We have also issued advice to schools and local education authorities on community use and health and safety responsibilities in Extended Schools: &quot;providing opportunities and services for all.&quot; It advises that when offering additional activities and services that may affect the health and safety of staff and others, new risk assessments should be carried out to assess the likely risk to staff, pupils, visitors and users of the premises.

<i>[holding answer 18 October 2004]</i>: There are no plans for the Local Network Fund for Children and Young People to close. The Fund is now in its fourth year and has developed an effective national network of development and funding support for local voluntary organisations working with and for children and young people. The 2004 Budget committed to an extension of the Local Network Fund until March 2008.

<p>
<a name="41019w17.html_para7">
Voluntary organisations, some of which are community foundations, have played a key role in establishing the Local Network Fund and in administering local funds across the country. They have a delivery contract with the Department to March 2006. We have established a steering group of Local Network Fund administrators to help plan the delivery arrangements for the Fund beyond 2006. The steering group will consider how the Local Network Fund should relate to Children&#039;s trusts arrangements locally, and how best to ensure that the successes achieved by local administrators in supporting community groups working with disadvantaged children and young people are maintained.

 I have already done so. The Government have agreed with the LSC a budget of &#163;207.4 million in 2004&#150;05 for adult education secured through Local Education Authorities, an increase of 43 per cent. compared with funding in 2000&#150;01 of &#163;145 million. In addition the LSC is currently consulting on reforming the planning and funding of non-qualification provision to meet our commitments to safeguard learning opportunities for personal and community development and to secure a coherent range of &#039;first steps&#039; learning opportunities in every area.

<p><a name="41019w18.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The plumbing sector withdrew from the scope of the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) in 1990 and set up its own training arrangements. Those arrangements are now the responsibility of SummitSkills&#151;the licensed Sector Skills Council for the sector. The CITB does not therefore provide direct support for plumbing courses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w18.html_para0">
However, some plumbing trainees are employed by construction firms who are in scope to the CITB. Employers can claim grant support from the CITB for these trainees. Information provided by the Learning and Skills Council shows that in 2003/04 plumbing courses were offered by 238 training providers of which 136 were colleges with nearly 36,000 enrolments.

spelling with imagery as a method for improving the teaching of spelling in schools.  [191360]</p>




<p><a name="41019w19.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 Developing good literacy skills, including the ability to spell with accuracy and confidence, is crucial to raising standards in English and other subjects, and for equipping pupils with the skills and knowledge they need for life beyond school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w19.html_para1">
The National Literacy Strategy&#039;s Framework for Teaching sets out detailed guidelines for what pupils should be taught in each year of primary school, including key principles and activities for the teaching and learning of spelling appropriate to individual year groups.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w19.html_para2">
The Framework supports a balanced approach to teaching spelling which includes both the development of phonological awareness as well as the use of visual skills to support pupils in their learning. The use of visual skills might include recognising common letter strings and checking critical features of the word in terms of shape and length.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w19.html_para3">
Through the Primary Strategy schools can access a wealth of materials to support the teaching of literacy. For example the Planning Exemplification and Spelling programme for years 2 and 3 provides teachers with a range of structured activities to support pupils&#039; spelling. These include a variety of highly visual activities such as labelling pictures and diagrams or &quot;spotting the difference&quot; between pairs of similar words.

 Data on the incidence of suicide where bullying was cited as a cause is not collected centrally and we do not hold this information.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w19.html_para4">
The Department is deeply concerned about the distress bullying causes and the effect it has on lives and we are determined to help schools to tackle the problem. Our guidance pack &#039;Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&#039; and the anti-bullying charter and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w19.html_para5">
In November 2003 the Department launched our anti-bullying charter for schools at the first of a series of nine regional conferences. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. July 2004 saw the launch of the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), a grouping of voluntary sector organisations, including Childline and the NSPCC. The Department has provided funding of &#163;570,000 for the ABA to sustain the momentum for change. As part of this the ABA will launch the first ever national Anti Bullying week in November. A variety of events are planned, both nationally and locally, involving the Department, the ABA and schools. We shall continue to maintain our wholehearted commitment to combating bullying.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 16 September 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1749W, on benefits, how many appointees for the receipt of benefits in each of the last five years <i>(a)</i> had their appointment revoked and <i>(b)</i> were subjected to further action by the Secretary of State.  [190611]</p>




<p><a name="41019w20.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The information is not collated centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.
</p>




<a name="41019w20.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Benefits</h3>


<p><a name="41019w20.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Cousins: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the linking rules are for the return on unchanged terms to each category of benefit; and on what date those linking rules were introduced.  [188721]</p>




<p><a name="41019w20.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 There are currently two main linking periods of eight weeks or twelve weeks allowing a customer to return to Income Support on unchanged terms after a break in claim. These periods are defined in regulation 3A of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 which came into force on 11 April 1988. (Specific linking periods exist for housing costs on Income Support. Housing Cost linking periods are defined in Schedule 3 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 which was revised in October 1995 when major changes were introduced to the rules for the payment of housing costs by Income Support.)
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para0">
The main linking periods are referred to in legislation as the &quot;Permitted Period&quot;. A customer whose entitlement to Income Support ceases because he or his partner becomes engaged in remunerative work has a maximum &quot;permitted period&quot; of 12 weeks in which he can reclaim with no impact on certain elements of his Income Support. A customer whose entitlement to Income Support ceases because of any other reason has a maximum &quot;permitted period&quot; of eight weeks in which he can reclaim with no impact on certain elements of his Income Support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para1">
It must be stressed that reclaiming within the eight week or 12 week period does not guarantee the customer will receive exactly the same amount of Income Support he was receiving previously. The &quot;permitted period&quot; is linked to specific elements of the Income Support and the overall total of Income Support will be affected by changes in the customer&#039;s circumstances that have occurred within the eight or 12 week period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para2">
The elements of Income Support that are affected by the permitted periods are Applicable amounts, Mortgage interest, Protected sums and Earnings to be disregarded. There are no rules which allow Pension Credit to be reinstated on unchanged terms following a break in the claim. Currently, for example, where a Pension Credit customer&#039;s entitlement ends for any reason they will need to make another claim. There is no 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Oct 2004 : Column 635W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
guarantee that the benefit will be reinstated at the same rate as before, as there could have been a change in circumstances since the previous award. This would happen if there was a break in entitlement for any reason. There would be no linking provision for a short break in the claim.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para3">
There is one linking rule in Pension Credit which allows the retention of an element of benefit. Pension Credit customers may be awarded a transitional extra amount if, on a previous Income Support or JSA (IB) award, they received a transitional addition. Where an award of Pension Credit, which included a transitional extra amount ends, and a repeat Pension Credit application is made within eight weeks of the earlier award, the applications &quot;link&quot;, and the transitional extra amount from the previous application is retained. It must be stressed that reclaiming within eight weeks does not guarantee the customer exactly the same Pension Credit as previously, as changes in circumstances may have occurred within the eight week period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para4">
There are no linking rules when a new claim is made that prescribe that the claim be treated in the same manner as a previous application. The general rule is that a claim is assessed with reference to the legislation that is in force at the time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para5">
There is a &quot;rapid reclaim&quot; procedure which is a streamlined reclaiming process for those who reclaim IS/JSA and HB/CTB within 12 weeks of their previous entitlement ending. This is only an administrative easement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para6">
Where a claimant is benefiting from transitional protection under the rent officer referral arrangements which existed prior to January 1996, there can be a break in entitlement of up to four weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para7">
Linking rules may apply in the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Claimants discharged and readmitted to hospital within 28 days. When a patient is discharged from hospital, and subsequently readmitted within 28 days, the total time spent in hospital is counted when calculating the day when benefit is to be downrated. If the break is 29 days or longer, a new period starts. This linking rule does not apply when working out whether the claimant has been absent from home for more than 52 weeks.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Linking periods of incapacity: To qualify for the Disability Premium (DP) under the 364 day rule, the claimant must be sick and submitting evidence of incapacity for work. Periods of sickness link together if separated by 56 days or less, or 52 weeks for Welfare to Work beneficiaries (see point 3 below). Any period spent in hospital counts towards the 364 day qualifying period. If, after a claimant has qualified for DP, there is a break in incapacity of eight benefit weeks or less, the claimant does not have to meet the 364 day qualifying period again.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Fifty two week benefit protection: This benefit protection period is a period of 52 weeks following return to work (or training for work) in which periods of incapacity can be linked, or during which the right to certain transitional protections may be preserved. A Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance customer may return to benefit at their pre-existing rate if they re-claim within a certain number of weeks of leaving. The standard period for JSA is 12 weeks.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para8">
The effect of this &quot;linking rule&quot; is that the two claims for JSA with a gap of less than 12 weeks between them are counted as one. This means that when the customer 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Oct 2004 : Column 636W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
makes a further claim for JSA, for example after a spell of temporary work, they do not have to serve a further set of waiting days before JSA starts to be paid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w20.html_para9">
In addition, if they were previously receiving help with mortgage interest, they will not have to serve a further qualifying period before this help resumes. Their benefit position will be the same as when they moved off JSA. These rules have been in place since JSA was introduced in October 1996.

Notes:<br>

1. &#039;Other reasons&#039; categories include customers who have: deceased; gone abroad; claimed another benefit; entered full-time education; ceased to claim; failed to attend; reached retirement age; claimed incapacity benefit or income support; started training; started on an Employment Zone; had an unfavourable decision on their claim; gone to prison; attended court; started an Employment Zone work placement.<br>

2. Figures are given for those who were previously receiving JSA, and therefore exclude claimants who were signing for national insurance credits only.<br>

3. Figures are claim-based. If an individual claims then terminates a claim on more than one occasion in the period, then they will be counted more than once.<br>

4. Parliamentary constituencies are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant ONS postcode directory, and are based on constituency boundaries at May 1997.<br>

5. The &quot;found work&quot; category includes claims terminating on finding work, working on average 16 hours or more a week, and New Deal Employers option.<br>

6. Figures are based on a 5 per cent. sample and will be subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

7. Numbers of claims are rounded to the nearest hundred and are expressed in thousands.<br>

8. Average provided is the median claim length of claims that have terminated in the period. It is not possible to produce a mean duration for JSA claims, as reliable start dates are not available for all claims starting before 1992. A mean would therefore be biased upwards by a small number of long durations.<br>





9. Data for part (b) of the question are given for the rest of Great Britain rather than the United Kingdom, as our sample only includes Great Britain cases.<br>

[192562]</p>




<p><a name="41019w21.html_spnew4"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Subject to the entitlement rules, the maximum percentage of a state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) pension that may now be passed on to a surviving spouse depends on when the person who paid into SERPS reached or would have reached State Pension age. This applies equally to men and women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w21.html_para0">
Where the late spouse is under State Pension age when they die different rules on inheriting a SERPS pension apply to men and women. A widower in this situation can not currently inherit any of his late wife&#039;s SERPS pension whereas a widow can. From 6 April 2010, the rules will be equalised so that a man will be able to inherit a proportion of his late spouse&#039;s SERPS pension in the same way as a woman can.

<p><a name="41019w21.html_spnew5"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Widows and widowers whose spouse was contracted-out of SERPS already inherit the same proportion of SERPS as those whose spouse did not. However, where the spouse had been contracted-out, the survivor also inherits a proportion of the contracted-out rights&#151;the Guaranteed Minimum Pension. In order to avoid double provision from public funds the amount of SERPS paid to those whose spouse was contracted-out is reduced by the inherited Guaranteed Minimum Pension.

 One of the key points in the 7-point action plan I announced in June 2003 was that fines will no longer be written off. They will be chased until they are paid. The new policy to deliver this was introduced on 5 January and from that date fines can no longer be written off, though there are limited circumstances where they can be administratively cancelled, for example, where the defaulter is deceased, has been sent to a mental health institution for 12 months or more, has emigrated or is a limited company which has been wound up with no goods on which to levy distress. Figures relating to the number of fines imposed written off prior to 5 January 2004 are not held centrally and could be collected only at disproportionate cost.

<p><a name="41019w24.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 Wholesale gas prices have risen recently due to a number of factors: high oil prices driving higher gas prices on the Continent, which feed into UK prices via the gas interconnector; the anticipated decline in gas production from fields on the UK Continental Shelf; and tighter gas markets as the UK moves towards becoming a net importer of gas. The recent Ofgem price probe also attributed these reasons for the current price movements, and the concurrent Financial Services Authority investigation into gas prices in October/November 2003 found no evidence of market abuse.

 Responsibility for the provision of mobile telephones for official purposes and for payment of associated call charges was devolved to individual directorates, agencies and NDPBs at the end of March 1993. Since August 1997, the DTI has increasingly made use of the central Mobile Telecommunications contract managed by the Office of Government Commerce. This contract allows DTI users access to mobile telephone services and products at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money. Due to the devolved responsibility for mobile telephone management the only information that can be provided at non-disproportionate cost is the total expenditure with DTI&#039;s main suppliers of mobile telephones and the number of handsets supplied through the central OGC contract since 2002.

On the basis that 1 per cent. of electricity supplied from renewable energy sources will supply the equivalent of the power to some 700,000 households, supplying power to the 3.27 million households in the UK&#039;s 10 largest cities would require just under 5 per cent. of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. At present all renewable energy sources supply only 2.7 per cent. of our electricity but in the light of the new wind projects, both onshore and offshore coming forward, renewables should be able to contribute well over 5 per cent. of our electricity in five years time.

But ISAF and coalition forces (including British forces) were available to support and assist the ANA and ANP if required. Despite fears of disruption by Taliban. al-Qaeda and other insurgents, the day went remarkably smoothly, with little violence. This was a credit to the ANA and ANP, and also to ISAF and Coalition forces.

 There are four freedoms associated with the EU; free movement of goods, services, capital and labour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w26.html_para3">
With regard to the free movement of goods, services and capital, the impact of enlarging the single market will be felt for many years to come; through increasing trade, job creation and economic growth. There has not been any in depth assessment made as yet. But based on previous enlargements, we expect prosperity to grow both in the new and old member states alike. When Spain and Sweden joined, our exports to them went up by a quarter. When Finland joined, they went up by a third. We estimate that this current enlargement will create 300,000 new jobs across the present EU and give UK GDP a boost of &#163;1.75 billion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w26.html_para4">
With regard to free movement of labour, the initial monitoring results from the Workers Registration Scheme show a positive impact on the UK economy. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made clear when addressing the House on 26 April, we kept the commitments we made during the passage of the Accession Bill, namely not to take up the derogation restricting the free movement of workers in the Accession Treaty, on the basis of previous enlargement experiences and a sound economic analysis of the needs of the UK economy. The last few months have suggested that this decision was right, with applicants to the Worker Registration Scheme meeting recruitment difficulties in agriculture, hospitality and catering as well as providing a range of much needed skills across many sectors. The Worker Registration Figures show that during May and June, 24,198 Central and Eastern European migrants applied to register; of these 14,422 were in the country before 1 May and 8,172 were new arrivals. Accession nationals who were working here illegally have been able to regularise their status, affording their rights better protection and generating tax revenue. We estimate that since 1 May, registered workers are contributing over &#163;4 million a week to the UK economy and paying over &#163;0.5 million a week in tax. There is no evidence that accession workers are exploiting the benefits system.

The chair and non-executive directors are appointed for the remainder of their term on the NHS trust board or 12 months, whichever is the longer. Subject to minimum legal requirements, the size and shape of the board of directors is locally determined.

Notes:<br>

1. n/a indicates that the PCT had not been established.<br>

2. Mental health expenditure is the expenditure of the PCTs on the commissioning of mental illness services. However, it relates only to the expenditure on secondary healthcare in this area; we have no figures for primary healthcare.<br>

3. The figures are not comparable between PCTs and between years. There are a number of factors distorting the figures, including PCTs commissioning on behalf of others and devolution of mental illness budgets by health authorities and strategic health authorities.<br>

 Seroxat (paroxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, was contraindicated for the treatment of depressive illness in children and adolescents under the age of 18 in the United Kingdom in June 2003 because of an increased risk of the age of 18 in the United Kingdom in June 2003 because of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and a lack of efficacy in this population.

This is being addressed as part of the second phase of the Community Care Review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019w30.html_para9">
Intermediate Care has been accepted as a means of supporting timely discharge from hospital. In recognition of this, the Department has commissioned a report from the Independent Health and Care Providers to provide an accurate picture of the current level and type of intermediate care provision available in the independent sector in Northern Ireland. This will help to gauge the feasibility of expanding this type of provision, and inform policy in this area.

The circumstances surrounding events at this home have, moreover, been investigated by PSNI. In addition to the recent convictions obtained in respect of two former staff, I am also conscious that police inquiries are still on-going in respect of other former staff employed at Macedon.

<p><a name="41019w32.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 Administrative arrangements in Northern Ireland are different from those in GB in that the Department of Education controls the disposal of school playing fields and therefore the current arrangements are considered to be adequate i.e.:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1. Under the provisions of Article 106 of the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 1986 the approval of the Department of Education is required to the disposal of any land (including school playing fields) which is declared surplus to requirements by an Education and Libraries Board.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">2. In the voluntary schools sector, where schools and playing fields are owned by the Trustees of the school, the Department has to issue a deed of surrender before any playing fields vested for educational purposes can be sold.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">3. The Sports Council for NI would be consulted on any planning proposals involving the discontinued use of school playing fields.</p>
