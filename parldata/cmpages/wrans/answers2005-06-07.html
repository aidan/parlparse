<p><a name="50607w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mrs. Dean: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has for the post-mortem testing of badgers killed in road accidents in Staffordshire; and if she will make a statement.  [1349]</p>




<p><a name="50607w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will <i>(a)</i> instruct the State Veterinary Service to carry out post-mortem tests on badgers killed on roads in Staffordshire and <i>(b)</i> ensure that the service is adequately funded to carry out such tests.  [1321]</p>




<p><a name="50607w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Post-mortem testing of badgers killed in road accidents is carried out under the Road Traffic Accident (RTA) survey. This was established on the advice of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) and is conducted in seven English counties (Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Dorset). The objective is to determine whether the RTA can provide an accurate indication of the prevalence of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in badgers by comparing it with the data from the randomised badger culling trial.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w01.html_para0">
We are awaiting the results of the validation of the survey in the badger culling trial areas before taking any decisions about extending the survey area further. There are also logistical and budgetary problems in extending the RTA survey.

 Guidance on the Waste Management Licensing (England and Wales) (Amendment and Related Provisions) Regulations 2005 (the 2005 regulations) will be published before the end of June.

<p>
<a name="50607w01.html_para1">
Changes to the composting exemption from waste management licensing made in the 2005 regulations do not apply to the storage of manure. They apply to composting, that is, the active mixing of manure with other biodegradable waste to make compost.

<p><a name="50607w01.html_wqn4"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what changes she plans to make to the <i>(a)</i> role and <i>(b)</i> jurisdictions of Sea Fisheries Committees, with particular reference to the proposed Marine Bill.  [1491]</p>




<p><a name="50607w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Government have undertaken an extensive engagement process with stakeholders on recommendations on inshore fisheries management made by both the Strategy Unit report on the UK fishing industry (&quot;Net benefits&quot;) and the Bradley review of fisheries and environmental management. The English Inshore Fisheries Working Group which met as part of that process reached agreement on an updated set of responsibilities and powers which would be needed to operate a modern, efficient system of inshore management and have submitted their report on this to me. Views in the working group were divided on the best structure to deliver inshore fisheries management.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w01.html_para2">
The response of the four UK Fisheries Departments to the &quot;Net Benefits&quot; response will be published shortly, but we are currently further evaluating the options for the future structure of inshore fisheries management in England. Whatever the outcome of that consideration, there will be a need for legislation, at the minimum to update the current legislative framework for Sea Fisheries Committees. The proposed Marine Bill is likely to be the vehicle for introducing such changes.

<p><a name="50607w02.html_spnew0"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 The establishment of the cross party working party on Parliament and Development in Africa last year reflects the strong interest which exists on both sides of this House in international development, and the role which parliamentarians can play. I welcome this.

<p><a name="50607w02.html_spnew2"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 The Government are committed to pre-legislative scrutiny, and have substantially increased the number of Bills published in draft. But it is not realistic to expect that all Bills should be published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny: Parliament must be able to legislate quickly where there is a clear need, and constraints on drafting capacity place a limit on the number of Bills that can be produced in draft in any particular Session.

<p><a name="50607w02.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s policy on tackling aviation emissions is set out in chapter 3 of the Air Transport White Paper, published in December 2003. The Government have also introduced national objectives for air quality, set out in the National Air Quality Strategy and prescribed in the Air Quality Regulations 2000.

</p>



<p>(2) what the maximum number of Crossrail trains per hour is for which priority powers are being sought in the Crossrail Bill;  [2105]
</p>



<p>(3) how much capacity, in terms of trains per hour, will remain for passenger and freight trains, other than Crossrail trains, if the maximum permitted number of Crossrail trains are operated; and what estimate he has made of changes to journey times for other passenger and freight trains on these routes if the maximum number of Crossrail trains are operated.

The capacity for non-Crossrail passenger services (other than existing suburban services subsumed by Crossrail or complementary services) and freight trains is largely unaffected for the following reasons.

<a name="50607w02.html_para3">
For the Greater Western route Crossrail services will share use of two of the four tracks and will not displace services on to the other two tracks. So apart from periods of maintenance and disruption when services on all four tracks may need to be looked at together, there will be no impact from the operation of Crossrail on the two tracks that currently, and will continue to, carry all of the passenger services not subsumed into Crossrail and complementary services.

For the Great Eastern route the position is similar with Crossrail trains normally operating on the tracks currently carrying the local services subsumed into Crossrail services and not normally affecting the other two tracks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w02.html_para5">
In relation to freight, Crossrail service planning assumes that the current level of planned freight paths will continue. This allows for some growth in services run, since not all of the planned paths for freight are currently used on any given day. The Crossrail project includes a number of local infrastructure works specifically to facilitate continued freight operation.

This Bill does not specify a maximum number of principal Crossrail passenger service trains to which the use of powers in the Bill could apply. The Bill enables the Secretary of State to specify a minimum number of principal Crossrail passenger service trains. If the Secretary of State exercised this power he would do so taking account of all of his relevant rail and other policies, not simply the interests of Crossrail services in isolation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many complaints he has received regarding poor consultation procedures for aircraft flight path changes.  [2304]</p>




<p><a name="50607w02.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer of 25 May 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 123W, where I indicated that the Department does not maintain a noise complaints database. It does however regularly receive representations about aircraft flight paths. Most concerns relate to the effect of noise on correspondents. As part of this, some comment adversely on the way in which they became aware of changes. I am aware of a judicial review case on airspace changes affecting Suffolk.

<a name="50607w02.html_para7">
Airspace changes are primarily the responsibility of the Directorate of Airspace Policy at the Civil Aviation Authority in the light of Guidance and Directions from the Secretary of State for Transport under section 66(1) of the Transport Act 2000. These are designed to ensure that changes are only made where it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue, or where airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative.

The major responsibilities for overall energy policy affecting Scotland are reserved to UK Ministers. Scottish Executive Ministers have devolved responsibilities for promotion of renewables and encouraging energy efficiency which are central to security of supply.

This applies to proven technologies for onshore wind and to developing technologies to capture Scotland&#039;s abundant marine energy resources.

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reviews all cases in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Crown prosecutors consider whether there is sufficient evidence to provide ca realistic prospect of conviction&#039; and if such evidence exists, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute the accused. A prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution, which clearly outweigh those tending in favour, or it appears more appropriate to divert the person from prosecution. The public interest decision will depend upon all the circumstances of the offence and the background of the offender.

In respect of adults, diversionary options include informal warnings, cautions, and, in some places, conditional warnings. A caution will only be appropriate when the public interest accords with the Home Office&#039;s guidelines on cautioning.

In respect of youths, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established a diversion scheme to prevent re-offending by children and young people, who are issued with reprimands or final warnings aimed at diverting them from crime before they enter the formal court system.

Since the introduction of this scheme, the Home Office has issued detailed guidance to the police forces in England and Wales on the application of the legislation to ensure national consistency. It provides a number of options enabling a reprimand or final warning to be administered to a youth, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The police are guided to the appropriate resolution by the identification of a number of gravity factors in the case. A caution or final warning may be an appropriate disposal where a youth without previous convictions or cautions commits an offence, fully admits it and shows appropriate remorse. A very large percentage of young people who are the subject of the diversion scheme do not re-offend.

There are limited statistics on the number of air-conditioning systems in UK homes, but the figure is believed to be of the order of 500,000. These are much smaller systems than would be found in larger buildings. Many of them are portable units sold &quot;over the counter&quot;. The annual usage of the systems is also uncertain.

<p><a name="50607w06.html_spnew4"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 June 2005]:</i> When the letter (Ref: CNW/REG/VWF) was first brought to its attention in December 1999 the Department sought legal advice from its external lawyers advising in relation to the VWF Scheme. The advice received was that further inquiries should be made before a decision as to what action to take was made. Having received that advice further inquiries were undertaken of the UDM. The UDM assured the Department that the letter related to a very limited number of Claimants who were part of a pilot group who had, for operational reasons and with the agreement of the DTI, undertaken the VWF MAP report process twice. The UDM acknowledged that it had been wrong to issue the letter and gave the Department assurances both as to its limited use and its unconditional withdrawal. The Department also made inquiries of its Claims Handlers at the time in relation to the cases affected having received the UDM&#039;s explanation and having reconsidered the advice from its legal advisers in the light of the information received from its Claims Handlers the Department chose to take no immediate action either against the UDM or any individual Claimant, but to keep under very close review the potential for the coaching of claimants.

<i>[holding answer 6 June 2005]:</i> The Department was passed a copy of the letter in December 1999. Subsequently we wrote to the UDM who assured the Department that only 41 claimants had received copies of the letter. This cohort of claimants had undergone a Medical Assessment Process (MAP) examination for Vibration White Finger but because the UDM had raised concerns about a particular consultant they asked for 41 claimants seen by this consultant to undergo a second MAP examination. It was in between these two examinations that the letter was sent. The Department&#039;s claims handlers reviewed all 41 claims and they considered that the letter had had no impact on the results of the examinations.

<p><a name="50607w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I can confirm that since 1 March 2003: there have been no Territorial Army (TA) soldiers mobilised under Section 52 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996; some 500 TA soldiers have been mobilized under Section 56; and some 9,820 TA soldiers have been mobilised under Section 54. Of the soldiers mobilized under Section 54, some 290 personnel have not deployed to operational theatres and these include: enablers at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre; unit and welfare support staff, who provide a vital liaison role in the home bases of TA units, whose members have been mobilized and deployed; movement control specialists at the Air and Sea Ports of embarkation; Intelligence Analysts; staff officers working in direct support of operations but based in the United Kingdom, and Royal Engineers providing Explosive Ordnance Disposal support in the UK. In addition, it is possible for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2005 : Column 466W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
individuals to be mobilised to fill posts left vacant by members of the regular army serving on operations. However, in general it is our policy to use Reservists contracted on Full Time Reserve Service terms to fill such posts.

 Funding to provide for the education of disabled children and adults is made available to statutory bodies within general budgets and is not broken down by individual type of disability.

It is for statutory bodies to use the funding available to them to improve educational provision for disabled children and adults.

Statistically significant positive changes were reported in parenting skills and competencies by the time parents left their programmes.

 None. Acceptable behaviour contracts are general measures used by the police to improve the behaviour of young people. They can be used in a school setting but they are not exclusive to schools. Schools have a range of measures to help them manage pupil behaviour including Pastoral Support Programmes which identify precise and realistic behavioural outcomes for the child to work towards and Parenting Contracts where the LEA or school governing body considers that parenting is a factor in the truancy or behaviour of the child and where the parent appears to be in need of (and willing to accept) support.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w11.html_para0">
For the majority of young people who run away from home it will be in their interests to be provided with support that maintains them in their family network. Given the variety of ways in which children who run away come to official attention, for example outside normal working hours or in emergencies, some young people may require immediate access to overnight accommodation. Usually, the local authority&#039;s children&#039;s services will be best placed to provide this. However, the Social Exclusion Unit, in its report &quot;Young Runaways&quot; (2002) found that runaways may have difficulty accessing emergency overnight accommodation at the point of need.

The qualification should be in place and available for people to start on courses this autumn term. It is intended to give school cooks and caterers the knowledge and skills to deliver a healthier meals service. It has been specifically designed for staff involved in the preparation and service of school meals and it will enable school caterers to improve pupil nutritional intake from all food provided by the school meals service. It will ensure that everyone in the school kitchen aspires to the same high standards.

DfES does not collect data on the proportion of schools that provide drinking water to pupils. However, regulations require all local authority maintained schools in England to have a wholesome supply of water for domestic purposes, including drinking water. However, it is for local education authorities, governors and schools to decide how and when drinking water should be made available to pupils.

Guidance produced by this Department advises caterers on meeting the requirements of the Government&#039;s nutritional standards for school lunches and recommends that drinking water should be made available to all pupils every day, free of charge. In addition, the Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools document suggests that all pupils should have access to drinking water at all times at a number of points around the school, preferably not from taps in toilets. The guidance also suggests that pupils should be permitted to carry water with them and consumption encouraged both in class and during break and lunchtime.
</p>


<p>

DfES does not routinely collect data on schools adherence to statutory school lunch nutritional standards. The responsibility for ensuring that the standards are met rests with local education authorities or, where the budget for school lunches is delegated to them, a school&#039;s governing body.

<p><a name="50607w12.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of links between social exclusion and the behavioural problems of children and young people.  [2204]</p>




<p><a name="50607w12.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Research conducted by and for the Department shows there is a link between social exclusion and behaviour and that there is a complex interaction between risk and protective factors that can lead to the development of antisocial behaviour among children and young people and to later social exclusion. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2005 : Column 481W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
In addition, research suggests that this could be a two-way relationship, with behavioural problems both leading to, and resulting from, social exclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w12.html_para1">
The Department has commissioned a number of pieces of research to explore these issues in more detail as well as looking at what interventions are effective in reducing the risk of these negative outcomes. Some key examples of this are: &quot;Support from the Start: working with young children and their families to reduce the risks of crime and antisocial behaviour&quot;, &quot;Preventing Children&#039;s Involvement in Crime and Anti-social Behaviour: a literature review&quot;; and &quot;Offenders of the Future? Assessing the Risk of Children and Young People Becoming Involved in Criminal or Antisocial Behaviour&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w12.html_para2">
In addition, the Youth Cohort Study shows that pupils&#039; poor behaviour and poor attendance at school are associated with a greater likelihood of not being involved in education, employment or training at ages 16&#150;18 and lower attainment at GCSE. The Social Exclusion Unit&#039;s &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; report showed that these factors increase the risk of social exclusion. The report also concluded that related risk factors for non-participation in education, employment or training include mental health problems, educational disaffection, use of drugs or alcohol and involvement in criminal/antisocial behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w12.html_para3">
These issues are acknowledged in the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; and in the development of the Change for Children Programme, signalling the Department&#039;s commitment to improving children and young people&#039;s outcomes. The Government&#039;s aim is for every child, whatever their background or their circumstances, to have the support they need to: be healthy, stay safe, enjoy and achieve through learning, make a positive contribution to society and achieve economic well-being. As part of this the Department is committed to improving behaviour in schools, and has implemented a range of policies (such as the Behaviour Improvement Programme) aimed at tackling the issues of poor behaviour and poor attendance in order to reduce the risk of negative outcomes in later life for young people.

<p><a name="50607w12.html_spnew4"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Research evidence, such as my Department&#039;s Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) study, shows a link between social deprivation and the risk of poor social and behavioural development in the early years. It is also known from research that good quality pre-school education and child care can have clear positive effects on children&#039;s social and emotional development in the early years and into primary school.

In recognition of the importance of young children starting to develop good social skills in their earliest years of life the Department has a PSA target to <i>(a)</i> improve children&#039;s communication, social and emotional development so that, by 2008, 50 per cent. <sup>1</sup>  of children reach a good level of development at the end of the Foundation Stage; and <i>(b)</i> to reduce inequalities

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w14.html_para2">
In England and Wales local land charges are matters of a public nature affecting land. They are recorded in registers maintained by local registering authorities. The fees payable for local land charge services are set by the Lord Chancellor, with the concurrence of HM Treasury, under the Local Land Charges Act 1975 as amended. The fees do not vary according to the identity of the person to whom the service is provided. There are no plans to change this policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w14.html_para3">
The fees are set at levels that take into account the cost of delivering the relevant services. For example, the fee for an official search of the local land charges register is &#163;6 or, if conducted electronically, &#163;4, and the fee for a personal search is &#163;11. However, as the present nationally set fees can only approximately reflect the costs of each individual registering authority, the Government has amended the 1975 Act (see schedule 4 paragraphs 82&#150;85 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005) to devolve the power to set local land charge fees, other than personal search fees, to registering authorities in England. They will be permitted to set fees, which taking one year with another, recover an amount up to, but not exceeding, the costs they incur in providing local land charge services. In setting fees, registering authorities will have to have regard to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2005 : Column 497W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
guidance issued by the Lord Chancellor. These arrangements are to be brought into force on a date to be fixed. The Lord Chancellor&#039;s fee-setting power for all local land charges in Wales was devolved to the Welsh Assembly on 31 December 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w14.html_para4">
There are currently no plans to change the fee payable for personal searches. Any change would have to be supported by sound evidence and public consultation would be required before making any substantial increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w14.html_para5">
The Office of Fair Trading&#039;s market study on the provision of property information includes consideration of the charges for local land charge services (including personal searches of the local land charges register). Any recommendations made by OFT will be taken into account in the setting of fees for personal searches of the local land charges register and in the preparation of any guidance to be issued in relation to other local land charge fees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w14.html_para6">
In relation to the provision of property information, other than local land charges, local authorities can already set fees under the Local Authorities (Charges for Land Searches) Regulations 1994. In setting such fees a local authority is required to have regard to its costs in providing the information. Local authorities may also impose a charge for the provision of information in response to an enquiry under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. No changes are currently proposed to these arrangements.

<p><a name="50607w14.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The Local Authorities (Conduct of Referendums) (England) Regulations 2001 specify an expenses limit for mayoral referendums of &#163;2,000, plus 5p per elector on the relevant register of local government electors. That limit applies to any expenses incurred by or on behalf of an individual or body during the referendum period for the purpose of promoting or securing a particular result in the referendum. In addition, local authorities must have regard to the Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity, which states that an authority must not incur spending designed to influence the outcome of a mayoral election.

The Local Government Act 2003 provides for local authorities to hold advisory referendums on local issues. There is no provision setting a limit on campaign spending for this purpose.

 The gap funding arrangements for housing transfer were announced on 21 March. There have been no subsequent changes to the performance requirements for registered social landlords (RSL). The suggestion that the RSL achieve two star performance was in a working draft on which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consulted. It was not included arrangements as during consultation it became clear that it would be unreasonable to link payment of gap funding, on which the viability of the RSL business plan is dependent, to a decision from a third party, the Housing Inspectorate, who gives the performance ratings.

The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has had its homelessness strategy in place since late in 2002. The impact of the strategy is starting to be reflected in the homelessness figures, which showed a small but welcome reduction in 2004&#150;05 compared to the previous two years. An analysis of the figures shows a reduction in the number of cases of homelessness caused by intimidation. During the past year the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has met its target of eliminating the use of bed and breakfast type of accommodation for families, except in emergency cases. It has also provided approximately &#163;1.5 million of funding to a range of voluntary bodies for special projects to tackle and prevent homelessness. These projects included rent guarantee schemes, mediation services, youth homelessness prevention schemes, street outreach services for rough sleepers and specialist advice workers.

The performance of the CDRPs and DAT is managed by the Home Office team in the Government Office for the East of England (GO East), whose role is to support and challenge the partnerships&#039; performance in the region. The director of this team is held accountable by the Crime Reduction Director and Drug Strategy Director in the Home Office through quarterly meetings, supplemented by performance review meetings with the Home Office performance support managers in the intervening months. The Home Office funds the ten partnerships in Hertfordshire with &#163;1,490,102 from the Building Safer Communities Fund and &#163;559,354 from the Basic Command Unit fund. The Government will shortly introduce the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will target gun and knife crime and alcohol-related crime and disorder. It will toughen the laws on replica firearms, create restrictions on the sale of primers and specialist equipment for making ammunitions and it will tighten laws on airguns, powers to require certain pubs and clubs to search for guns and knives on entry, powers for the police to impose 48-hour bans on pubs and clubs persistently selling alcohol to under-18s, and the establishment of alcohol disorder zones. The CDRPs and Drug Action Team (DAT) and their constituent members in Hertfordshire are taking the following actions to tackle street crime, binge-drinking and drug-related crime in Hertfordshire.

strategies. The CDRPs have each negotiated a three-year crime reduction target with GO-East. The progress towards the target will be measured by performance on ten crime types, two of which cover street crime. While Hertfordshire was not one of the l0 areas involved in the Street Crime Initiative, best practice is being spread between police forces through the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office&#039;s Police Standards Unit. This is to ensure that the lessons that have been learnt from the Street Crime Initiative can benefit all forces. Several of the Hertfordshire CDRPs have identified specific strategic priorities around street crime. These include Broxbourne and North and East Herts, aiming to make town centres safer, Stevenage, aiming to reduce alcohol-related crime in the town centre and leisure park, and Watford, aiming to make the town safer at night.

Among individual initiatives by Hertfordshire CDRPs, Stevenage have planned a number of actions including a requirement that all public entertainment licensed premises should have a drugs policy by April 2006; regular joint licensee inspection visits from the police and the council; a ban on irresponsible drink promotions and support for the licensed industry&#039;s voluntary code on low priced promotions; and encouraging licensed premises to participate in the Club/Pub Watch scheme that contains a banning/exclusion order facility.

<i>(c)</i> Tackling Drug-Related Crime During 2004&#150;05&#151;Hertfordshire DAT has introduced the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) within the area. The aim of DIP is to reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs by substantially increasing the number of drug-misusing offenders entering treatment through the criminal justice system. Government funding for DIP in Hertfordshire in 2005&#150;06 is &#163;1,038,586 (this includes &#163;530,842 arrest referral grant). Hertfordshire has set a target of 600 DIP clients for 2005&#150;06, of which 450 will be &#039;generic&#039; DIP clients and 150 specifically Prolific and Priority Offender (PPO) DIP clients. More recently the PPO project has also been introduced in the area. The project has already engaged a large number of people in hard-to-reach target groups in structured treatment. This project is now ready to be rolled out to the whole of Hertfordshire. GO East and the CDRPs are also funding MIDAS, a web-based database for crime, disorder, drugs, alcohol and community safety information, for the use of all partners involved in Community Safety.

<p><a name="50607w18.html_spnew0"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The Europol Convention provides for Europol to establish and maintain relations with third states where this is necessary for Europol to perform its functions as described in the Convention. The rules governing these relations provide for Europol to conclude agreements to, in particular, exchange liaison officers and share information. Any agreement to share personal data would be subject to an opinion of the independent Joint Supervisory Body established by the Convention. This Council Decision, of 24 February 2005, adds Israel to the list of states with which the Director of Europol may enter into negotiations.

<p><a name="50607w18.html_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 There are a number of offences which cover the practice of &quot;happy slapping&quot;. These include common assault and battery where one person recklessly or intentionally causes another person to fear immediate violence or to sustain unlawful personal violence, plus a range of offences where actual injury is caused. Maximum penalties range from six months&#039; imprisonment for common assault up to life for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The Government takes the issue of violent crime and its impact on people&#039;s lives very seriously. Even though the British Crime Survey shows that violent crime has fallen by 26 per cent. since 1997, it fully recognises public concern and is taking forward several initiatives to tackle violent crime in all its forms and make the country as safe as possible for law-abiding citizens. In particular, the Government will shortly introduce the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will target irresponsible drinking, imitation firearms and knives.

 Dialogue has been ongoing with the security services in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed identity card. The security services have said that an ID card will help in tackling terrorism. The Security Service have stated that a card scheme would disrupt the use of false identities by terrorist organisations, for example in money laundering and organised crime. We know that at least one-third of terrorist suspects make use of false identities. An ID card will reduce the opportunity for those facilitating terrorist and organised criminals to operate using multiple identities. The scheme would also be a useful tool in helping to monitor and disrupt the support activities of terrorist networks.

These teams will provide a visible, accessible and responsive police presence in rural and urban areas. By the end of 2005, every force in England and Wales will have a pathfinder area (in what are known as Basic Command Units). Forces will be able to develop local approaches to neighbourhood policing which are tailored to their local needs, including those for rural areas.

This is a record figure and represents a steady increase since March 2002. Since 2000 we have provided money for additional recruits under the Crime Fighting Fund, which in Hertfordshire&#039;s case stands at 113 officers. Any further increases are a matter for the Chief Constable and the police authority.

 Records of the average cost to local police forces of employing neighbourhood wardens, community support officers (CSOs) and police constables are not kept centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, information available to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister indicates that neighbourhood warden salaries in 2003 ranged, on average, between about &#163;13,900 and &#163;15,600. The interim report of the National Evaluation of Community Support Officers published in December 2004 (available at www.policereform.gov.uk) found that, of the forces surveyed, the minimum pay point, excluding allowances, for CSOs ranged nationally from &#163;14,094 to &#163;19,626 and the maximum ranged from &#163;15,408 to &#163;25,356. The pay scales for police constables range from &#163;19,803 for a newly recruited officer, rising to &#163;31,092 for a constable with 11 years service.

The Government produced the UK &quot;Antimicrobial Strategy and Action Plan&quot; in June 2000.

We have built on this by establishing the specialist advisory committee on antimicrobial resistance (SACAR) in 2001 to provide scientific advice.

 A study of childhood cancer in relation to distance from high voltage power lines in England and Wales was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 4 June. The work was led by Dr. Draper at the Oxford childhood cancer research group and was funded under the Department&#039;s radiation protection research programme. The results found an association between an increased incidence of leukaemia for children whose home address at birth was near power lines. There was no association for other childhood cancers. Magnetic field exposures were not included in the publication, but will be included in the next phase of the study. A response statement has been posted on the Health Protection Agency (HPA) website at www.hpa.org.uk/radiation.

There have been a number of population studies in the past that have linked magnetic field exposure with a raised incidence of childhood leukaemia.

The World Health Organization and the HPA in this country have recommended additional research and the need for further precautionary measures to be considered. Government officials have already started detailed discussions with industry, regulators, professional bodies and interest groups about how to respond and a stakeholder group has been set up with the intention of making recommendations in the interests of society as a whole.

 A supplementary explanatory memorandum 11646/03 was lodged in the Library in March 2004 covering a regulatory impact assessment (RIA).

The RIA has since been revised to reflect changes to the text of the proposal following negotiation. These have included lengthening the transitional periods, removing proposed bans on types of health claim and clarifying the ways in which health claims would be authorised. The areas where industry may be subject to additional costs are re-labelling, possible reformulation, scientific substantiation of the effect claimed, and where the loss of a claim makes it uneconomic to market the product.
</p>

 The Department is currently on track to meet its target to increase each year the proportion of drug users successfully sustaining or completing treatment programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w23.html_para0">
It is estimated that the total number of individuals successfully completing or being retained in treatment in 2003&#150;04 was 90,511.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w23.html_para1">
This is an increase from the 80,600 problem drug misusers who successfully completed or were retained in treatment in 2002&#150;03, the first year for which these figures were available.

<p>(2) what steps the Government are taking to encourage smoke-free working environments.  [48]</p>




<p><a name="50607w23.html_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The most recent estimate of the number of workplace deaths caused by second-hand smoke was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 2 March 2005 in a report by Professor Konrad Jamrozik. This gave an estimate of 617 deaths a year in the United Kingdom. The author acknowledges that the results are &quot;distinctly sensitive&quot; to some of the underlying assumptions. A copy of the paper is available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w23.html_para2">
In the Queen&#039;s speech, the Department has set out plans for legislation to make the vast majority of enclosed public places and workplaces smoke-free within the next four years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w23.html_para3">
A partial impact regulatory assessment (RIA) has been published alongside the Choosing Health White Paper, which gives initial estimates of the possible impact on smoking prevalence. This estimates that the proposal outlined in the White Paper might reduce smoking rates by between 0.7 and 1.7 percentage points. The RIA contains estimates of costs and benefits of a ban on smoking in the workplace. A copy is available in the Library.

The list includes 22 sites that are due to transfer to English Partnerships (EP) as part of a wider agreement with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and in support of the Government&#039;s sustainable communities plan. 67 surplus NHS sites have already been transferred to EP this year, as part of the same programme. It will be for EP to decide how to take forward all these sites subject to the normal planning process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50607w23.html_para5">
The list also includes other larger sites which are surplus to the requirements of the NHS but which are not being transferred to EP. Arrangements for the disposal of these sites are at various stages and it is not clear in every case exactly what the future use will be. It is likely that most will be redeveloped for residential purposes; the manner of development will be the subject of local consultation and the planning process.

A final decision on the most suitable way forward, including whether a pilot scheme might be appropriate, will be made in the light of the comments received. However, the LSC considers that the market in London, with almost 500 solicitors&#039; firms contracted to provide criminal legal aid services would be well suited to PCT, and would also be consistent with its statutory obligation to optimise value for money.

 There is no central register of UK legislation wholly or partly implementing EU legislation.

EU legislation may be directly applicable, implemented by administrative means, or introduced when domestic legislation is amended for other purposes. Where EU legislation does require transposition into national law, it may be implemented either by primary legislation, or by secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972 (the ECA). The majority of EU legislation is enacted under section 2(2) of the ECA. House of Commons Standard Note SN/IA/2888 gives further information, including on the number of Statutory Instruments enacted under the ECA in each parliamentary session.

Transposition notes, available in the Library of the House, show how all the main elements of individual EU directives have been or will be transposed into UK law. We aim to ensure that UK implementation of EU legislation minimises administrative burdens.
