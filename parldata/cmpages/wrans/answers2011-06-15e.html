 There are already established processes and protocols to identify and manage any risks or threats to sports betting integrity in Great Britain. Our present assessment, based on the experience of previous Olympic events, is that there is a relatively low risk of a major sports betting integrity issue occurring at the London 2012 games. The impact of any such incident could be significant so we do need to ensure that the UK is well prepared to respond to any concerns that arise. Officials from the department are already working with the Gambling Commission, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic games, licensed betting operators and the police to ensure effective preparations are made in advance of the 2012 games. I will be attending the IOC's meeting on betting integrity on 15 June having attended an initial meeting on this issue on 1 March 2011.</p>

 The welfare of farmed rabbits is protected by the general provisions in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007, which have a specific schedule relating to rabbit welfare. Additionally, DEFRA has a welfare code for rabbits which provides good husbandry advice and which producers are required by law to have access to and be familiar with. Failure to comply with this code may be relied upon in prosecution cases.</p>

Separate estimates are provided for basic rate, higher rate and additional rate taxpayers. This theoretical calculation assumes no increases above indexation (RPI and CPI) of the personal allowance from 2012-13. The estimates therefore do not consider the Budget 2011 announcement that the personal allowance will increase by £630 in 2012-13. Calculations assume income refers to employment income only.</p>

The UK is UNRWA's second largest bilateral donor and is considered a model donor for providing long term support through our five year £110 million funding agreement.

 The Terms of Reference for the Independent Fuel Poverty Review being carried out by Professor John Hills stipulate that the review will consider fuel poverty from first principles; to determine the nature of the issues at its core, including the extent to which fuel poverty is distinct from poverty, and the detriment it causes. It will also, as appropriate, develop possible formulations for a future definition and any associated form of target which would best contribute, among other things, to developing practical solutions, particularly around identification and targeting of households, and measuring progress resulting from Government action.</p>

 The spending review allocated over £200 million to support low carbon technologies, of which up to £60 million will fund offshore wind manufacturing investment at port sites. In order to target the remaining resource, a series of technology innovation needs assessments (TINAs) has been undertaken (and more are planned) to provide a robust evidence base on the innovation needs of the technology families most likely to be important in achieving our climate targets and delivering benefits to the UK’s economy.</p>

 The Microgeneration Certification scheme already requires installers to predict, using common methodologies, the likely performance of the installation. The prediction relates to annual performance, from which energy and carbon savings and years to breakeven can be calculated. More complex information could be mandated, but in considering any future development of the requirements, we would need to strike the right balance between quality assurance for consumers and placing additional requirements on industry.</p>

 The Nuclear Installations Act 1965 imposes third party liabilities on nuclear operators, and also requires operators to cover these liabilities “by insurance or by some other means”. There is no legal responsibility on the Government to act as an insurer for the operators' nuclear third party liabilities.</p>

Although it appears that commercial insurance will be available to cover most of the new liabilities, there is doubt about whether such insurance (or other commercial cover) will be able to cover all of the liabilities. In the circumstances, the Government also set out its proposal to make provision to enable it to provide cover in return for a charge where cover is not available on the commercial market. The alternative would be not to impose on the operator the liabilities for which commercial cover is not available and for these liabilities to remain with the taxpayer.</p>

 The UK is a signatory to the Paris convention on nuclear third party liability and the Brussels supplementary convention. Under the conventions third party liability for operators is capped and in the UK, under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, is currently £140 million. If compensation claims exceed £140 million, the Government would be obliged to top-up the total amount available for compensation to 300 million Special Drawing Rights (about £300 million) (although it would be able to claim back contributions from the other countries that are party to the Brussels convention) . Above this, Government and Parliament have statutory discretion to pay compensation to meet outstanding claims. In a recent consultation the Government proposed increasing the operator liability level from £140 million to €1.2 billion, which is €500 million more than the minimum required by the Paris convention. If compensation claims exceed €1.2 billion, a further €300 million must be made available by the Government although, as now, it will be able to claim back contributions from the other countries that are party to the Brussels convention. Above €1.5 billion Government and Parliament have statutory discretion to meet any third party claims.</p>

 The Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for welfare and employment issues and we have developed a coherent strategy to address poverty and to support the most vulnerable, helping people break the cycle of benefit dependency. A crucial part of this is to ensure that people are not written off to a lifetime on benefits because they have a health condition or disability. Many people with health conditions are able to sustain and progress in employment. The Department therefore needs to ensure that people currently receiving incapacity benefits are supported in preparing for a return to work where some form of employment is a possibility.</p>

 Atos healthcare professionals provide advice to Jobcentre Plus decision makers on when a customer is likely to be able to return to work. Treatment, including any medication that the customer is taking is one of the factors that the healthcare professional takes into account when providing this advice. Decision makers use the advice from the healthcare professional, in addition to all the other available evidence, when deciding when to refer the customer back to Atos for reassessment.</p>

 The North East Interim Regional Transport Board (NEIRTB) was a non-statutory body which agreed the regional funding advice provided to Government in 2006 and 2009 on the prioritisation of transport major schemes in the North East. The NEIRTB currently has no functions, but it is possible that such a non-statutory body could have a role in future in prioritising local authority major transport schemes.</p>

 An impact assessment for part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 was published in December 2008 and summarised the full costs and benefits of implementing the coroners provisions in the Act, including those relating to appeals. This estimated overall set up costs of £10.9 million and running costs of £6.6 million per annum. I placed a further, more detailed, breakdown of those figures in the Library of the House on 20 May. This estimated that approximately £2.2 million of the running costs would be needed to fund appeals to the chief coroner. No further analysis has been conducted.</p>

The decision to transfer Chief Coroner functions without fully implementing Part One of the Act means that the estimated £10.9 million set-up costs, and £6.6 million running costs per annum would no longer be incurred by the public purse.</p>

Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 Six ‘competition lots' have been constructed to cover England and Wales. This reflects the decision to compete Community Payback at a national level rather than at the level of the 35 trusts to maximise economies of scale and promote innovative delivery models. A number of different options for the design of the lots were considered. The final design has achieved balanced lots in terms of volumes, they do not cut across existing probation trust boundaries and do not give advantage to any provider.</p>

 Penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) are available to the police to deal quickly and effectively with low-level, antisocial and nuisance offending, including minor instances of retail theft. The scheme allows the police to spend more time on frontline duties and provides an alternative to prosecution in appropriate cases.</p>

 The Department for Education has not made its own assessment. However I am pleased that as part of the Department's Voluntary and Community Sector grant announced on 25 February, the Department is awarding around £10 million over the two years 2011-12 and 2012-13 to help 17 voluntary organisations tackle the child protection and safeguarding needs of children and young people. This grant is one of a range of funding streams from the Department to the voluntary sector, including a new grant agreement announced on 15 February 2011 to support NSPCC with £11.2 million between 2011-15 for continued investment in ChildLine and the NSPCC HelpLine.</p>

 It is for local authorities to determine the allocation of their resources and I am sure that in doing so they will be taking into account both their statutory responsibilities and the needs of the most vulnerable children and young people. The Department for Education has not made its own assessment, but I am aware of the research that has been carried out by other organisations.

<sup>(1)</sup> Pupils at the end of key stage 4 in each academic year.
<sup>(2)</sup> In 2010 iGCSEs, accredited at time of publication, have been counted as GCSE equivalents and also as English and mathematics GCSEs.
<sup>(3)</sup> Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards were created for 2001 Census outputs. The Department reports using the CAS Wards because they allow us to report ward level data on a consistent geographic basis. One of the weaknesses associated with reporting data using administrative wards is that the boundaries for administrative wards can change on a frequent basis. This makes it difficult to compare data at ward level over time.
<sup>(4)</sup> School figures include all schools, whilst ward figures include maintained schools (including CTCs and academies) only. For this reason, data for some schools is not included in the ward table, and also pupil numbers in schools do not always sum up to the total number of pupils in the ward.

               <i>[holding answer 9 June 2011]:</i>The Department for Education does not collect data on this issue. It is for local authorities to determine whether a pupil should have home tuition and, if so, the number of hours that is appropriate for that pupil. Department for Education guidance sets out that pupils who cannot attend school because of ill-health should receive a minimum of five hours home tuition each week but that they should be offered as many hours as they can cope with, up to full-time education.</p>

Until now, only permanently excluded pupils have had an entitlement to full-time provision.</p>

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 Whether the governors of a maintained school have the power to increase its intake will depend on the category of the school concerned. School admission arrangements are set and applied locally by the relevant admission authority. For community and voluntary controlled schools the admission authority is usually the local authority (LA), for foundation and voluntary aided schools it is the governing body and for Academies it is the Academy Trust.</p>

               <a name="11061561002655"> Under the Code currently in force, all schools must have a published admission number (PAN) for each ‘relevant age group’ in which pupils are, or would normally be, admitted to the school. The PAN forms part of the admission arrangements for the school and, as such, must be consulted on with their local community. Admission authorities of maintained schools must set admission numbers with regard to the capacity assessment for the school. Once an admission number has been set by the admission authority, maintained schools should not admit children above the PAN without the agreement of the local authority.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. It is not possible to split Workforce Census figures between hospital and non-hospital based staff. It is generally assumed that those staff based in NHS Trusts are engaged in more hospital based work.
2. It is not possible to isolate art therapy staff from the art, music, drama therapy area of work. 2010 headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components.
3. Staff may work in both a PCT and a trust, therefore they will be counted once in a trust and once in a PCT, however for the headcount figure for England they will only be counted once.
4. The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication at:
 www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/010_Workforce/nhsstaff0010/Census_Bulletin_March_2011_Final.pdf.

In 2007-08 the guidance regarding the definitions of ‘short term residential—not respite’ was restated to ensure that respite was not included in this column, this may have impacted on the data for this category.
