 The Malaysian Federal Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, Muslims are subject to Shari'a law with respect to family matters which includes apostasy. Muslims can only change their religion with the permission of a Shari'a Court who will often not allow this, and may order periods of rehabilitation and other penalties for those who attempt to do it. In addition, the application of Shari'a is a state, rather than federal matter and so varies around the country&#151;the State of Negeri Sembilan allows apostasy. This complicated issue impacts on a minority of people who wish to leave Islam&#151;a recent survey by an academic found that there were only 100 applications to the Shari'a Courts to apostatise between 1994-2003. The majority of applicants are from people who had previously converted to Islam for the purpose of marriage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para2"><a name="0701097000060">There are no anti-conversion laws in Indonesian civil law. The constitution of Indonesia guarantees freedom of religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para4"><a name="0701097000062">There is no anti-conversion legislation in Pakistan, although converts from Islam to other religions are subject to various social pressures and harassment and the blasphemy laws are often abused in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para5"><a name="0701097000063">The Government, along with our EU partners, follow closely developments in states where anti-conversion laws exist. We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We urge all states to pursue laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect and to protect religious minorities from discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para6"><a name="0701097000064">The Malaysian Federal Constitution was amended in 2001 to provide against discrimination on grounds of gender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para7"><a name="0701097000065">The Malaysian Government ratified Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995 and presented their first report to the CEDAW committee earlier this year. There are concerns that the rights of women in divorce and inheritance are not equal to those of men in the Shari'a Courts. There are also concerns that the proposed new Islamic Family Law Act will do little to alleviate this, with a widespread perception that it is even more detrimental to the status of Muslim women than existing laws, including making polygamy easier. However, the Government are re-examining the bill following concerns by non-governmental organisations and are consulting women's groups on the revision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para8"><a name="0701097000066">The Indonesian Government, through the Ministry of Women's Affairs, are actively working to increase the participation of women. In general, women play a significant and growing role in Indonesian society.</p>

 We want to encourage China to act as a responsible member of the international community and support its closer integration into the international system, including through multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). To that end, Ministers raise WTO issues regularly in bilaterals with their Chinese counterparts, as indeed I did in July in my visit to China. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State  for Trade and Industry visited China from 26 to  30 November. He emphasised the need for China to play an active role in the current WTO round and  to continue opening up its markets.</p>

The Commission documents stress the mutual benefits of enhanced trade and economic relations between the EU and China, and the importance of China fully implementing its WTO obligations. The UK worked with other member states to ensure that the Conclusions reflect our position.</p>

 The number of patients removed from waiting lists rose steadily throughout the 1990s, peaking in 1999 then falling and stabilising. The waiting list rules are clear that patients should be removed from lists if they are no longer waiting or are unavailable for treatment.

 Carisoprodol, brand name Carisoma, is a muscle relaxant authorised as an add-on therapy to the symptomatic treatment of acute musculoskeletal disorders associated with muscle spasm. Clinical trials carried out by the marketing authorisation holder for carisoprodol were evaluated at the time of licensing to ensure that it met appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to justify its use as a muscle relaxant. Full guidance on prescribing and the use of carisoprodol, including possible side- effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers, the Summary of Product Characteristics, and the patient information leaflet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="70108w0004.htm_para12"><a name="07010915000191">Since the marketing of carisoprodol, although no formal research has been commissioned, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have kept under review its safety in routine clinical practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="70108w0004.htm_para13"><a name="07010915000192">Up to 29 November 2005, a total of 31 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been received in association with carisoprodol. The majority of these (28 out of 31 reports) were received prior to 1982. Of the 31 reports, a total of 20 reports describe suspected side-effects from using carisoprodol that are not listed in the patient information leaflet. Urticaria, three reports, and chills, two reports, are the only unlisted suspected side-effects associated with carisoprodol reported in more than one patient. It is important to note that a report of a suspected ADR does not necessarily mean that the drug caused it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="70108w0004.htm_para14"><a name="07010915000193">In June 2005 the MHRA was alerted to concerns about the effect that an individual&#146;s genetic makeup may have on how they metabolise carisoprodol and that this may have implications for the likelihood of experiencing potential side-effects associated with its use. Following a review of the available data, the Summary of Product Characteristics and the patient Information leaflet have been updated to reflect these new data and to add a warning that patients who are so called &#147;poor metabolisers&#148; for a specific enzyme, Cytochrome 2C19, involved in the metabolism of carisoprodol may be at an increased risk of certain side-effects such as drowsiness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70108w0004.htm_para15"><a name="07010915000194">In parallel with this action, the overall balance of risks and benefits of carisoprodol has been raised at European level. The MHRA in conjunction with its European counterparts is currently re-evaluating the risk and benefits of carisoprodol and considering what implications this may have for its clinical use. As soon as the European review is completed the results will be made publicly available.</p>

 The Child Health Interim Application (CHIA) is currently live in 10 primary care trusts (PCTs) in the London area. Supporting manual systems continue to operate for some aspects of the system's functionality, which remain under development. Software to enable PCTs to generate COVER reports from the live system is expected to be deployed into the live system in April 2007. Meanwhile, COVER reports for each PCT, using live CHIA data, are being produced centrally on a quarterly basis in line with Health Protection Agency submission requirements. However, due to a backlog of data, which have not yet been loaded on to the CHIA system, some PCTs have requested their data are not published until local data quality queries have been addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70108w0004.htm_para18"><a name="07010915000201">Successful deployments of child health systems by the national programme for information technology have already taken place in 48 PCTs across the programme's north-east and eastern cluster areas. The system enables production of the required statutory reports, and a robust data migration and checking procedure is in place, ensuring successful migrations of demographic and clinical data to the new system, which provides a fully integrated patient record across primary care. Experience has shown that the key variable around successful implementation and operation is the quality of local record keeping standards and processes.</p>

 The Government commissioned a full review of the research arrangements at North Staffordshire hospital in 1999, in response to concerns about how research had been conducted there by  Dr. David Southall, among others. The review, chaired by Professor Rod Griffiths, reported in May 2000 and the Government accepted all the recommendations of the &#147;Report of a review of the research framework in North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust&#148;, The Griffiths Report. The report recommended a substantial audit of the use of continuous negative extrathoracic pressure, a research intervention, to see if claims of significant benefit or damage could be substantiated.

The Department and the new opportunities fund have provided funding of &#163;125 million to build 90 new or replacement catheterisation laboratories in England, increasing the capacity previously available by more than 50 per cent. The emerging findings from our national study of primary angioplasty show that the best times are achieved by ambulance paramedic triage and taking patients direct to the catheterisation laboratory without going via the A and E department.</p>

Early analysis of best evidence provides an estimate that to provide immediate scanning for all stroke patients and increase uptake of thrombolysis to 4 per cent., currently being achieved by the centre with the highest thrombolysis rate in England, will cost &#163;6.7 million to &#163;8.7 million. To increase uptake to 10 per cent. (currently being achieved by leading centres around the world) the estimated cost is &#163;10.9 million to &#163;12.9 million. However, analysis also demonstrates that this investment will result in considerable long-term savings, and allow a significant number of stroke patients not only to survive, but to live fully independent lives.</p>

 The most recent estimate of the burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the United Kingdom comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside, suggested that ADRs account for 6 per cent. of hospital admissions. This is a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures from the United States. The study did not differentiate between prescribed and unprescribed medicines; however the majority of ADRs were associated with prescribed medicines. The projected annual cost of such admissions to the national health service (NHS) is &#163;466 million.</p>

 Working alongside the Government of Afghanistan and our partners from the United Nations and NATO, our strategic aim is a secure and stable Afghanistan, with a self-sustaining economy, strong institutions and broad-based representative government committed to eradicating terrorism, eliminating opium production, reducing poverty, and respecting human rights. We assess progress is being made against these objectives, especially in areas such as the development of democracy, the fostering of minority rights (87 women sit in the Afghan Parliament) and the development of a legitimate economy: for example, the International Monetary Fund estimated Afghanistan&#146;s economic growth averaged around 22 per cent. between 2002 and 2004,  8 per cent. in 2004-05 and up to 14 per cent. in 2005-06.

 Devonport Royal Dockyard is a strategic asset that plays a direct role in maintaining the UK's nuclear deterrent. The Government require assurance that any prospective change of ownership of Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd. (DRDL) or any new influence or control should not adversely affect the essential security interests of the UK. On this basis the Government need to assess whether the planned separation of KBR from Halliburton would be acceptable. MOD is now in active discussion with KBR to ensure that the UK's essential security interests are protected. The ability for Devonport Management Ltd. to bid freely for defence contracts is a key element of these interests.</p>

 MOD has applied no abatement to the pay of HM Service personnel either prior to, or since, 31 March 1975, for the purpose of funding pension entitlements. The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75 (AFPS 75) is, and always has been, non-contributory and unfunded. The military salary was introduced in 1970 and from 1971 the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) began to make recommendations regarding military salary following consideration of civilian comparators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="70108w0020.htm_para6"><a name="07010921000717">In 1981 the AFRPB recommended, following a Government Actuary's report, that the value of the AFPS 75 pension should be taken into consideration as part of overall earnings for service personnel during the process of remuneration comparison and in judging the appropriate levels of military salaries. As a result an adjustment was introduced by the AFPRB in making their overall pay recommendations to reflect the non-contributory value of AFPS 75 benefits as compared with the contributory pension benefits of comparator employees.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 December 2006]: </i>A free packet scheme was first introduced on 17 April 2003, as a temporary measure unique to Iraq, at a time when Service personnel did not have access to the welfare facilities that are now available in both Iraq and Afghanistan. When the provision of goods and services in Iraq reached the required standard, the decision was taken to end the scheme on 8 April 2004. It was later re-introduced for a period of one month before Christmas 2004, and subsequently confirmed by the then Secretary of State for Defence, prior to Christmas 2005, that the pre-Christmas free packet scheme was to become a standard element of the Operational Welfare Package.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence has undertaken a number of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) in connection with the Trident nuclear weapons system. During the deployment of Vanguard Class submarines, EIAs are conducted whenever there is a requirement to do so, for example prior to the discharge of bilge water. Such EIAs are not published as to do so could enable deductions to be made on the operational location of the submarines and would, or would be likely to, prejudice the security of the United Kingdom.</p>

This was published in May 1984. The MOD also lodged an EIA in support of the D154 Project in Devonport with Plymouth City Council in 1994.

 The Department aims to ensure that it has sufficient expert personnel to meet current and future nuclear programme demands through external recruitment, internal staff development and close involvement with industry. This includes those personnel required for the project management and nuclear decommissioning disciplines. The assessment of the likely demand for nuclear experts is undertaken in conjunction with the Nuclear Sector Skills Council who maintain an oversight of the issues surrounding the national requirement for staff with key nuclear skills, both civil and military. In addition, the MOD is represented at the Nuclear Employers Steering Group, which monitors trends at a national level to scope the likely future demand for staff.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 7 December 2006]: </i>In October, I received from Jack Lemley his views on the progress of the Olympic delivery programme, drawing attention to the discussion at the Olympic Delivery Authority&#146;s (ODA) board meeting on 28 September of land remediation on the Olympic Park site. I was already aware of the ODA board discussions and the progress of ongoing site investigations within the park.</p>

This was known from the very start of the bid process. For that reason, the London Development Agency (LDA) have had an expert team carrying out soil investigation work over recent months.</p>

This presentation set out for the board the site investigations undertaken to date. These investigations have identified a variety of contaminants, such as metals and hydrocarbons, which are common on sites that have this kind of former industrial use. The expert team indicated that the levels of contamination assessed to date were in line with expectations and that the time allowed for remediation appears to be adequate.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 December 2006]:</i> Before engaging KPMG the Department had already opened discussions within Government, in autumn 2005, on the VAT status of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). Our expectation was that ODA would be able to recover its VAT, in common with a number of other bodies which have functions akin to those of local authorities. As part of their work KPMG estimated the amount of VAT to be recovered. DCMS received KPMG's initial assessment of ODA's potential VAT costs in December 2005 and received revised estimates in March, May and August 2006. The Government are continuing to discuss the VAT status of the ODA.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 December 2006]:</i> Arrangements introduced by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 will ensure that all persons working with children or vulnerable adults in either a paid or voluntary capacity will be required to apply to a new Vetting and Barring Scheme. This will be introduced in 2008 and will be phased in, covering new employees first, and those moving posts.</p>

Data provided by the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) from the PNC indicate that at the end of November 2006 there were 86,385 persons with a DNA profile on the NDNAD taken by Essex Police who also had a record retained on the PNC.

 It is not necessarily straightforward to say that an arrest is made on the basis of DNA evidence, as police investigations will often involve looking at several different types of evidence including DNA, and an arrest may be made on the basis of the whole package of evidence.

<i> [holding answer 19 December 2006]:</i> The National Identity Scheme is the result of a process of continuing development and consultation, beginning several years before the Identity Cards Act received Royal Assent in March 2006. The consultation paper, &#147;Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud&#148;, was published in July 2002 and invited views on whether a scheme should be implemented and if so, how. As a result of responses received during the six month consultation period, the Government announced their decision to introduce a scheme in &#147;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&#148;, published in November 2003. A draft Bill was then published and consulted on before the first Identity Cards Bill was introduced to Parliament in November 2004. The scheme has continued to develop as the legislation has undergone parliamentary scrutiny and following Royal Assent.</p>

The National Identity Scheme is not intended to be the sole method of solving any of these problems and other initiatives will continue alongside the scheme which will complement these other initiatives, not replace them.</p>

These include some 20 disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually, unable to walk and are currently receiving the disability living allowance higher-rate mobility component following the Government&#146;s decision in 2001 to reduce the lower age limit for entitlement from five to three years of age<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

1. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit.<br>
2. Care should be taken when interpreting these projections as they are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The projections are based on long run simulations of the incomes of individuals under a set of assumptions including life expectancy, partnership formation, earnings growth, employment rates, state and private pension accumulation.<br>
3. Projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.<br>
4. Estimates cover all those aged above women&#146;s state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.<br>
5. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women&#146;s state pension age.<br>
6. Projections under the White Paper proposals assume: continued earnings uprooting of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the White Paper. Figures exclude the effect of Personal Accounts.<br>
7. Projections under the current system with guarantee credit earnings uprated assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard minimum guarantee; continued price uprating of the savings credit threshold and the basic state pension.<br>

2. All data represent a snapshot in time of claimants on the computer system, and will therefore exclude a very small number of cases that are held clerically.<br>
3. Data represent children dependent on a parent or guardian claiming one or more of the following benefits: incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance, jobseeker&#146;s allowance, income support or pension credit.<br>
4. Due to the introduction of child tax credits in April 2003, information on child dependents are not reliably completed on the benefit computer system. Therefore children have been merged onto IS/JSA/IB/SDA/PC claims from child benefit with permission of HMRC.<br>
5. Partner status refers to cases with a partner recorded on the system only and is not a definitive measure of singles/couples.<br>

<i> [holding answer 14 December 2006]: </i>38 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with Employment Zone (EZ) advisers in Great Britain and 36 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with EZ advisers in London have moved  into work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="70108w0042.htm_para0"><a name="07010951000526">Nine reports on EZs<sup>(1)</sup> and 23 reports on NDLP<sup>(2)</sup> have been published and are available in the Library. A list of the most recent reports is reproduced in the list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="70108w0042.htm_para1"><a name="07010951000527">Latest available data indicate that the cost of helping lone parents into work is around &#163;1,900 per person through EZs and around &#163;600 per person through NDLP. Direct comparisons cannot be drawn between the costs of helping someone into work through EZs and NDLP. EZs operate in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country while the New Deals operate nationally. In London EZ areas, employment support is provided to lone parents through EZs rather than through NDLP. Outside London, lone parents in EZ areas are offered help through NDLP at their first work-focused interview (WFI), but can choose between EZ and NDLP support if they continue to claim income support and have a second WFI. This increases the likelihood of such EZ participants requiring additional, and thus more costly, support to help them into work.</p>

These, together with other investments that secure modal shift, could be eligible for grant support from the Department&#146;s freight grants programme, the purpose of which is to secure the environmental benefits of moving goods by water or rail instead of by road. As well as the grants scheme we also look to the Sea and Water organisation, which is partly funded by the Government, to take a lead in promoting coastal shipping services.</p>

 Funding for schools is a shared responsibility between central and local government. The majority of funding is provided by central government, with local authorities (LAs) providing the rest. In 2006-07, for the first time, schools received their funding from a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) rather than as part of the local government settlement. The DSG is a ring-fenced grant and must be used for schools&#146; budgets. It is for each LA to distribute funding using a locally agreed formula, and for schools&#146; governing bodies to decide how to spend the available resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="70108w0045.htm_para13"><a name="07010984000046">Support for children with special educational needs (SEN) accounts for a high proportion of all education expenditure. We do not hold information centrally about expenditure on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but information collected from LAs shows planned expenditure on the education of children with SEN of &#163;4.5 billion in 2006-07. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="70108w0045.htm_para14"><a name="07010984000047">In addition, schools and LEAs can use their School Development Grant to support SEN. SDG is allocated to schools and LAs to spend on teaching and learning according to their own needs and priorities. Total SDG for 2006-07 is almost &#163;2 billion and schools will see an increase over their 2005-06 SDG allocations of at least 3.4 per cent. per pupil in 2006-07 and 3.7 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 December 2006]:</i> Building Schools for the Future aims to renew all secondary schools in England in 15 waves of investment which started in 2005-06. It includes special schools, and pupil referral and other educational units for pupils of secondary school age. It is prioritised on educational and social needs of geographical groups of schools proposed by local authorities. Projects including hospital schools or units are eligible where locally proposed. Such units are already eligible for devolved formula capital allocations.</p>

Of these, 3,000 children who were taken into care aged under one subsequently returned home between 2001 and 2006 to live with parents, relatives or other person with parental responsibility (excluding residence orders and special guardianship orders).

 People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism industries) recently undertook a comprehensive Skill Needs Assessment as part of their &#145;Sector Skills Agreement&#146; (SSA) process. This is a major DfES policy area designed to create a demand led system of education and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="70108w0054.htm_para5"><a name="07010988000600">The Sector Skills Agreement has five stages, the first of which is the Skills Needs Assessment. This Assessment, undertaken between May and November 2005, looked at the current and future skill needs of the sector through extensive consultation with employers regionally, by industry and across the four UK nations. The research identified management and leadership, customer service and chefs skills as the priority skill areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="70108w0054.htm_para6"><a name="07010988000601">Linked to this, retention was also identified as a priority. The industry has high staff turnover rates, which cost the sector nearly &#163;1 billion each year. The full report and a summary can be found at www.people1st.co.uk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="70108w0054.htm_para7"><a name="07010988000602">The second stage is an assessment of the supply of learning, which People 1st undertook between January and June 2006 (consulting with both employers and learning providers). The research revealed the sector employs a high percentage of students and international workers, has weak progression routes, and the majority of employers are confused about both what support is available and how to access it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="70108w0054.htm_para8"><a name="07010988000603">The third stage looked at the gap between supply and demand, and is being used to inform the final two stages which involve working with employers and delivery partners to finalise the agreement. Further details will be available when these discussions have concluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_517"><a name="70108w0054.htm_para9"><a name="07010988000604">This research has underpinned the series of Skills Summits that DCMS held with People 1st. These summits are overseeing the development of a National Skills Strategy for the sector (the England arm of the Sector Skills Agreement), which is due for completion in March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_518"><a name="70108w0054.htm_para10"><a name="07010988000605">I recently chaired the third summit in this series and launched the UK Skills Passport. The Passport will benefit both employers and employees by providing an entire system of career development and training, and signposting industry to qualifications and funding that meet their needs. A fourth Skills Summit will take place later this spring.</p>

 No specific steps have been taken to ensure that owners of dogs with naturally bobbed tails are not prosecuted. The number of breeds with natural bobs is small and I think it extremely unlikely that an owner of such a dog would be prosecuted under the tail docking ban. Should such a case be brought before the courts, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to prove that an offence has been committed, and evidence from a veterinary surgeon or breed society is likely to establish the necessary facts.</p>

 For the Great Britain routine herd testing programme for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), the Government uses the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (commonly known as the &#147;skin test&#148;).

This is known as the test&#146;s false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is  to say that the skin test has a specificity in excess of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in a herd.</p>

In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye and, owing to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case.

<i> [holding answer 19 December 2006]: </i>There is no provision for routine inspection of gamebird farms at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="70108w0056.htm_para10"><a name="0701107000197">There have been no prosecutions of intensive gamebird farms by DEFRA in the last five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="70108w0056.htm_para11"><a name="0701107000198">The Animal Welfare Act 2006, which will come into force in April 2007, introduces a duty on people responsible for an animal to take such steps as are reasonable to ensure its welfare. This new power will apply to gamebirds reared for sporting shooting prior to their release, and to gamebirds reared for meat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="70108w0056.htm_para12"><a name="0701107000199">We have no plans to introduce regulations for the rearing of gamebirds. We do, however, propose to use powers under the Animal Welfare Act to produce a Code of Practice, which will provide guidance on accommodation and management methods, including aggression reduction. Specifically on the issue of raised laying units, before considering regulation or a ban on the system, I believe that it is important I obtain an independent view on this method of housing gamebirds. To that end, the Farm Animal Welfare Council&#146;s study of the system and its report will be fundamental in informing my decision on their future. As you are aware, I have particular concerns surrounding the use of raised laying units and will not hesitate to take appropriate action if, following the report, I believe that the bird&#146;s welfare is compromised. Any code would be subject to public consultation and endorsement by Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="70108w0056.htm_para13"><a name="0701107000200">At present, all animals, including gamebirds reared for sporting purposes, are covered by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. Under this Act it is an offence to ill-treat or cause unnecessary suffering to any captive or domestic animal. In addition, gamebirds reared for slaughter for food would be covered by the Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations.</p>

 The Recycling Credits scheme was reformed through section 49 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (CNEA). Changes to the Scheme increase the flexibility of payments from waste disposal authorities (WDAs) to waste collection authorities (WCAs) in two-tier areas by giving them the option to jointly agree alternative arrangements. These changes have been in effect since April 2006. The CNEA also clarified that recycling credits can be paid for reuse activity and that reuse should be treated in the same way as recycling for the purposes of the scheme.</p>

These payments are at the discretion of individual LAs so that they can take account of local circumstances. The Government introduced updated guidance in April this year, which gives greater encouragement to LAs to adopt good practice. The guidance strengthens the existing presumption that LAs will consider applications for credits from third parties which meet certain criteria and consider the social, environmental and economic benefits associated with community recycling.</p>

 ASEAN's project to create a free trade area (AFTA) is a long-term goal. The 10 member countries of ASEAN<sup>(1)</sup> aim to achieve a single market by 2020. A key milestone is the achievement of a zero-tariff regime for all members by 2015.

 The Department tried to negotiate a settlement through a schemed approach based on the Claims Handling Agreement (CHA). The Department agreed with the Claimants Group (CG) on taking mixed workers&#151;those who had worked both underground and on the surface&#151;into the scheme. The Department offered that any surface worker in a dusty job&#151;with agreement on what these were&#151;could go through the medical assessment for chronic bronchitis and temporary exacerbation of asthma which provides for low levels of compensation (on the lines of the tariffs now operating in the fast track scheme). And any surface worker with a pneumoconiosis reading (which the Department's claims handlers, Capita, took as a proxy for a marker of exposure to dust) could go through the full medical assessment and have access to higher levels of compensation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</p>

 The Department used the medical advice submitted in the original trial in deciding the liability owed to surface workers.

 It is likely that complaints regarding so called &#147;phoenix companies&#148; will be recorded as a complaint under section 216 of the Insolvency  Act 1986 (reuse of a prohibited name after a certain type of insolvency). It is possible that section 216 may also apply to new businesses run by directors of other insolvent companies which have no connection with the activities of the previous businesses and consequently would not be considered to be &#147;phoenix&#148; companies. Section 216 applies to any director of an insolvent company, independently of any wrongdoing.

 The safe and expeditious recovery of our forces returning from operational theatres is a high priority. Troop movement is generally working well and between April and December 2006, 80 per cent. of RAF operational passenger air transport flights were on time or delayed by less than three hours. For Iraq this figure was 86 per cent. and for Afghanistan it was 75 per cent. Recent improvements to the Afghanistan air-bridge include refurbishment of the runway at Kandahar Airfield, which was completed in November 2006. This now allows troops to fly from an airport closer to the majority of deployed locations, reducing in-theatre journeys by up to 24 hours.</p>

 I have no plans to change legal aid eligibility in this respect at present. The assessment for eligibility already takes account both of the claimant&#146;s means and of his prospects of success in his claim, including the likelihood of the defendant being able to satisfy an order for damages. The existence or otherwise of a public liability insurance policy can affect these prospects.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2<i> . Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
3. <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
4. <i> Primary Care Trust (PCT) and Strategic Health Authority (SHA) Data Quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97,1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
5. <i> Data Quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The &#147;Health and Social Care Information Centre&#148; liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

Relative risk reductions in CHD events in the statin trials appear similar regardless of baseline risk and baseline cholesterol except where baseline cholesterol is less than 5.0 mmol/l when the relative risk reduction is less. This implies that the best way to target patients for cholesterol control and statin therapy to reduce CHD risk is to calculate absolute risk.</p>

 The General Dental Services and Personal Dental Services Transitional Provisions Order 2005 (SI No. 2005/3435) required primary care trusts (PCTs) to calculate the units of dental activity to be provided by the contractor under a general dental services (CDS) contract by analysing the data held in respect of care and treatment provided by the contractor during the year 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2005, categorising that care and treatment in accordance with Schedules 1 to 4 of the National Health Service Dental Charges Regulations and converting into units of dental activity by reference to the criteria specified in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the GDS Contracts Regulations. The primary care trust (PCT) was then required to reduce the number of units of dental activity so calculated by 5 per cent.

 The National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness (NICE) published a health technology appraisal (HTA) on statins in January 2006. This took account of all available evidence and concluded that it was both clinically-effective and cost-effective to intervene with statin therapy in patients who scored a 20 per cent. or greater 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), regardless of the starting cholesterol. This updates the national service framework for coronary heart disease (CHD) which had set the threshold for intervention at a 30 per cent. 10-year risk of CHD, both by lowering the intervention threshold and by including the range of vascular conditions&#151;including cerebrovascular disease&#151;which are together termed CVD.</p>

Most recently, on 8 December our ambassador in Jakarta met the Indonesian Minister of Forestry to discuss the Stern Review and reinforce the importance that the UK places on the issue of climate change and the forestry land use changes which contribute to climate change. We are also in contact with the local office of the Association of South East Asian Nations on this issue, to discuss how we can help with their work on developing a Transboundary Haze Agreement.</p>

Our high commission in Freetown is also working with the full range of political and civil society to support free and credible elections.</p>

Our high commission and the DFID office in Freetown have also discussed election monitoring with the main political parties, the NEC, local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international partners, in order to assure adequate coverage before and during the polls.</p>

DFID will also be funding international election observers through the National Democratic Institute (NDI), an international NGO with expertise in election issues. NDI will host two observer missions prior to elections, one during the voter registration period and another during the campaign period, and one mission of 34 observers on election day. UK Government election observers will also be deployed for the critical phases of the electoral process and for the elections themselves. We have also called, in the EU Africa Working Group, for the deployment of an Election Observation Mission. Additionally, we are also engaging wider partners, including the UN, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Carter Centre, to push for international support for the election monitoring effort.</p>

These people, who number at least two million, now live marginal lives without income, access to proper shelter, food or medicine. We fear that many of these people have died.

Beyond 1 April 2008, members who are 60 and would have satisfied the rule of 85 by 31 March 2016, will be fully protected. Between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2020, actuarial reductions on rights accruing from 1 April 2007 will be phased in to overcome the cliff edge effect for members born either side of a cut off date.

There was also an additional &#163;10.5 million of private sector funding invested within the Liverpool pathfinder area, of which &#163;4.2 million went specifically into HMR projects.</p>

 We welcome any serious attempt at getting AIDS drugs more accessible and affordable for those who need them. Partnerships between employers, unions and manufacturers are an integral part of what is needed to see progress in tackling HIV and AIDS in developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_747"><a name="70108w0077.htm_para1"><a name="07011054001075">We have not made a detailed assessment of the impact of the outcome of the International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers&#146; Unions talks with pharmaceutical companies on the availability of affordable HIV/AIDS treatments. We would certainly encourage the pharmaceutical sector to do all it can to make essential drugs more easily available and affordable to poor countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_748"><a name="70108w0077.htm_para2"><a name="07011054001076">This is why in 2005, the Department for International Development (DFID) published a framework for good practice in the pharmaceutical industry to help increase access to essential medicines that treat diseases of poverty including HIV/AIDS in all developing countries. DFID continues to subscribe to the framework&#146;s principles and welcomes all efforts to improve both access and affordability, including through differential pricing and negotiating agreements to lower the price of HIV/AIDS treatments. Our support to UNITAID, the new drug purchase facility, is helping to do this, most recently with the assistance of the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_749"><a name="70108w0077.htm_para3"><a name="07011054001077">We hope that it will be possible for both parties to reopen negotiations at some stage in the future, given the potential benefits overall. Trade Unions as well as companies play a vital role in efforts to tackle AIDS. Working with employees in large, small and medium sized companies, in the formal and informal sectors&#151;and in the public and private sectors&#151;Trade Unions can support the implementation of effective company work place policies. In turn this will ultimately reduce the impact of AIDS on employees and businesses.</p>

St. Helena (including Tristan da Cunha) and Pitcairn. Following completion of Gerald&#146;s airport in 2005, the next priority for improving transport links to Montserrat will be the improvement of the port at Little Bay. The project is currently at the design stage. It is expected to be jointly funded by DFID and the European Union (EU), and may include an extension to the existing jetty and construction of a breakwater. The cost will depend on the options selected, but could be up to &#163;10 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_751"><a name="70108w0078.htm_para1"><a name="07011054001147">In March 2005, I announced the development of air access for St. Helena, through construction of an airport on Prosperous Bay Plain, and introduction of scheduled flights. The new airport will both meet our commitment to maintaining access, and contribute to economic regeneration through tourism. The project includes significant funding for tourism marketing. The project budget cannot be divulged in order not to prejudice the current procurement competition for the construction works. We also plan, with joint funding from the EU, to develop Jamestown Wharf. Currently the Wharf is the single point of entry to the island for all cargo and passengers. The proposed project addresses the need to improve cargo operations and to develop safe landing facilities for St. Helenians, business visitors and tourists. Costs will be about &#163;11.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_752"><a name="70108w0078.htm_para2"><a name="07011054001148">In Tristan da Cunha, DFID, with joint EU funding, is currently rehabilitating Calshot harbour. Repairs to Tristan&#146;s harbour and breakwater were last carried out over 10 years ago and continuous wave action and storm damage now threaten to cause permanent damage to the island&#146;s only point of entry. Total project cost is about &#163;3 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_753"><a name="70108w0078.htm_para3"><a name="07011054001149">Plans for the construction of a breakwater on Pitcairn, again with joint EU funding, are well advanced. Consultants have been appointed to prepare a detailed design and costing, estimated to be about &#163;6 million. A breakwater would provide more predictable and safer access to Pitcairn Island through Bounty Bay. This in turn will promote tourism on the island by increasing the opportunities for cruise ships, yachts and other ships to disembark passengers.</p>

 Projects funded by DFID by themselves have a very small effect on global emissions. They are part of a much wider development effort. We are therefore supporting developing countries to develop energy strategies to improve access to services while taking climate change into account. DFID&#146;s work with the World Bank and other development agencies allows us to influence these processes to the sustainable benefit of the poorest people in developing countries.</p>

 DFID has substantial programmes of co-operation with China in support of achievement of the millennium development goals in three areas: health (TB and HIV and AIDS), basic education, and water resource management, water supply and sanitation. The environmental impact on development is a strong theme throughout, but particularly in the water area.</p>

This is led by DEFRA, but with strong support from DFID. The four priority themes agreed with the Chinese for the next two years are natural resource management (especially forests, water and soils); sustainable consumption and production; capacity building for sustainable development; and sustainable urban communities. All of these themes address the environmental impacts of development, and involve collaboration and technical exchanges between different departments in the UK and China, as well as a range of small projects involving government, NGOs and the private sector.</p>

 DFID does not maintain an agreed list of &#145;states affected by conflict&#146;. We do have a list of &#145;fragile states&#146; which we are currently reviewing, as countries frequently move in and out of fragility and conflict, and political circumstances in a country can rapidly change. This list will include countries that are generally recognised to be conflict-affected. Detail on DFID&#146;s current definition and list of fragile states can be found in DFID&#146;s policy paper, &#147;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&#148;, page 7 and Annex 1, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

Examples include a joint programme for HIV/AIDS in Burma. This has attracted increased funding and made possible a larger-scale national response. In Afghanistan, a multi-donor trust fund, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) is helping to build government systems while at the same time raising additional finance for basic services such as health, education and water and sanitation that are focused on the poor.</p>

 Aid is classified as poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) if it is merged with other domestic resources and accounted for alongside the rest of the partner Government's expenditure through their reporting and accounting systems and reports of the Auditor General. Sector budget support is aid that is earmarked for expenditure either in a particular sector, sub sector, programme, or set of expenditure lines. The general principle is that this is aid which is spent using national or sub-national financial management, procurement and accountability systems. Before deciding to provide sector budget support a fiduciary risk assessment is undertaken to assess the partner Government Public Financial Management Administration systems for the effective use of and accounting for the funds.</p>

 The most recent reliable unemployment data available for Iraq comes from the Iraq Living Conditions Survey carried out in 2004 by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation/United Nations Development Programme. There is no other more recent comparable survey. The 2004 survey found that the core unemployment rate in Iraq was just over 10 per cent. (using the International Labour Organisation definition i.e. looking for but unable to find employment). In 2004, Iraq had a working age population of 16.4 million, but only 6.7 million (41 per cent.) were working or actively seeking work. 6 million of these were employed, leaving 700,000 (around 10 per cent.) unemployed. Unemployment was highest in Baghdad at 13.5 per cent., then the South at 10.8 per cent.; then 9.1 per cent. in the North and the lowest in the centre at 8.2 per cent. The survey also notes that workforce participation is higher in rural areas than urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_781"><a name="70108w0081.htm_para0"><a name="07011054001698">Available data show that Iraq has always had a very low workforce participation rate, in line with other countries in the region. This can be attributed to low participation rates among women (common to other countries in the region) and young men. Young men constitute 15 per cent. of the economically inactive (i.e. above 15-years-old but not seeking employment). The majority of young economically inactive men (68 per cent.) claim they are studying and thus not available to work. 20 per cent. claim that there are no jobs available and have therefore given up looking for work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_782"><a name="70108w0081.htm_para1"><a name="07011054001699">Ongoing violence in Iraq makes job creation difficult, and in particular discourages private investment which could boost employment.

 A review took place in 2004 of the DFID-funded Self-Build Materials Grant project, designed to help people to construct their own houses in Montserrat in the aftermath of the volcano crisis. The review concluded that, whilst the project appeared to have benefited those people who received support, it was poorly managed locally and inadequately monitored by DFID.</p>

Given that infrastructure has not yet been set up, the conditions at these sites are extremely basic. As an interim measure, the GON has provided funds directly to the Maoists to enable them to purchase food and basic plastic sheeting shelter for their combatants. Due to Maoist sensitivities and the desire of GON to lead this process, donor projects cannot go to sites and make unilateral assessments.</p>

 The World Bank is recognised as a leader in the field of measuring and managing for results. It was charged under the Marrakech Action Plan with developing a global good practice guide, and has developed an approach which aims to (i) strengthen countries' capacity to manage for results; (ii) enhance the Bank's own effectiveness in results management and (iii) coordinate various efforts at establishing a more results-based approach. The International Development Association (IDA), the Bank's concessional lending arm, was the first international financial institution to introduce a results measurement system (RMS). It tracks both country outcomes and the Bank's contribution to those outcomes. At the country level 14 indicators have been identified for monitoring, covering economic growth and poverty reduction, public financial management, investment climate, infrastructure, and human development. Within the Bank, a steering group has been established to promote broader awareness of the agenda and to identify specific systemic improvements that will enable the results-based system to be effective.</p>

It is also one of the performance criteria which DFID is monitoring to assess progress against DFID's 2005-08 public service agreement target for improving the effectiveness of multilateral agencies. We will continue to use every opportunity to promote this and encourage further progress by the Bank. These include discussions in Washington and in our work with the Bank in poor countries. The latest major discussion on the results-based approach was in Washington at the IDA 14 Mid-Term Review meeting in November 2006. The Bank produced a paper on experience to date, noting areas where good progress had been made, and areas were this had been more limited&#151;particularly in respect of developing the capacity of poor countries. The UK, and many other countries, recognised the Bank's commitment to results and acknowledged progress. We also noted that there was still much to do, and that sustained efforts would be required, in a range of areas, to make the results-based approach effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_823"><a name="70108w0083.htm_para12"><a name="07011054001939">The UK has been committed to the strengthening of developing country say in the governance of the IMF and World Bank for a number of years. The Government have reiterated that commitment in the White Paper on International Development published in July 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_824"><a name="70108w0083.htm_para13"><a name="07011054001940">Within the IMF, the UK welcomes the first steps towards reform and the timetable for further reform set out in the resolution agreed by Governors of the IMF in September 2006, to be completed, at the latest, by the autumn of 2008. The UK has given strong support and equal weight to both objectives of IMF reform: realigning member country shares to reflect global economic changes and strengthening the voice and participation of low income countries. The UK has been clear that reform must increase the voting share of low income countries as well as that of underweighted emerging market economies and we continue to emphasise this. In particular, the UK believes a stronger voice for low income countries requires a substantial increase in the share of basic votes which are assigned equally to all IMF members. These necessary governance reforms should be complemented by continued modernisation of the IMF&#146;s instruments to ensure its continued effectiveness with the entire membership. To this end, the UK also supports proposals to reinforce the IMF&#146;s crisis prevention role through a new framework for surveillance, with an emphasis on multilateral surveillance, and by expanding the IMF&#146;s range of instruments for crisis prevention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_825"><a name="70108w0083.htm_para14"><a name="07011054001941">The 2006 White Paper on International Development acknowledges the critical role which the World Bank plays in providing development assistance to developing countries. It also makes clear that the World Bank must reform if it is to remain relevant in a changing world. Four priorities are identified for the Bank:</p>
<a name="70108w0083.htm_brev10"><a name="07011054002390"><ul><p class="tabletext">play a leading role in providing more long-term, predictable funding for developing countries;</p>
</ul><a name="70108w0083.htm_brev11"><a name="07011054002391"><ul><p class="tabletext">find new ways to work with middle income countries as they still face major development changes and are shaping the wider world;</p>
</ul><a name="70108w0083.htm_brev12"><a name="07011054002392"><ul><p class="tabletext">help tackle the global challenges facing developing countries&#151;focusing urgently on a financing framework for clean energy and adaptation to climate change, and forging a new international framework to help developing countries tackle corruption and improve their governance;</p>
</ul><a name="70108w0083.htm_brev13"><a name="07011054002393"><ul><p class="tabletext">help developing countries obtain more influence in the World Bank, where they are weakly represented on the boards, with voting rights decided by financial contributions. This balance must change. The Bank must do more to support developing country priorities and not impose policy conditions in areas like privatisation and trade liberalisation. And if their members demand it, the Bank should be ready to change how members are represented, and how decisions are made&#151;for example through greater voting rights for poor countries. There also needs to be greater transparency in the way that the World Bank and IMF operate. More World Bank analysis should be disclosed. I am pleased that in the recent discussions on conditionally, the Bank agreed to improve its practice in this area. And the practice of picking the heads of both institutions based on nationality should end&#151;presidents should be chosen on merit.</p>

Along with others in the international community, we have made clear our deep concern about the policies of the Government of Zimbabwe which shows no interest in discussions about the fundamental policy reforms which are needed.
