<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51117w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There has been a lot of research into the benefits of biodiesel. We announced last week that 5 per cent. of all UK road transport fuel will have to come from a renewable source by 2010. The benefits of biodiesel in power generation are less obvious because it is more efficient to use biomass.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will ban the <i>(a)</i> sale, <i>(b)</i> manufacture and <i>(c)</i> use of animal snares; and if she will make a statement.  [27651]</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51117w01.html_spnew5"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Government considers that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical. In these circumstances snares restrain rather than kill and may prove to be more humane than other methods. If snares were to be banned entirely it may encourage the use of more dangerous and illegal alternatives such as poisons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Government is also committed to working to improve the legal use of snares. Following an informal consultation on snares and traps and their use carried out in 2003 Defra convened an independent snares working group chaired by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare. The working group was given a remit of producing a good practice guide and advising Defra on next steps on improving the use of snares. On 18 October we published the working group&#039;s report together with the Defra Snares Action Plan and the Defra Code of Good Practice on the use of Snares in Fox and Rabbit Control in England. These documents can be found at: http://www.Defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/snares/index.htm

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51117w01.html_spnew7"><b> Jim Knight </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 November 2005]:</i> The most recent assessment of the economic value of beekeeping in England was undertaken by ADAS Consulting Ltd in 2001. The report can be found on the bee health pages of the Defra website at www.defra.gov.uk/hort/bees/econ-eval.htm. It estimated the value of pollination by bees of commercial crops at around &#163;118 million p.a., with agricultural crops (oilseed rape) accounting for &#163;11 million and horticulture (beans, top and soft fruit) for &#163;107 million of this total respectively. The researchers excluded protected cropping, such as glasshouse-grown tomatoes, as honey bees are rarely used for pollination of these crops.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on cattle passport fraud.  [25308]</p>




<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51117w02.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The evidence we have on the incidence of serious offences committed under the Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 (as amended) concerning cattle passports is that it is low.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_4">In order to ensure a high level of compliance with the Regulations, 10 per cent. of cattle farms are inspected annually by the Rural Payments Agency. In England, around 6,000 farms and around 960,000 animals are examined for their compliance with tagging, passport, database registration and record-keeping rules. The results show a continuing improvement in compliance with the rules-there were 4 per cent. fewer errors made in 2004&#150;05 than in the previous year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_5">Local Authorities also undertake enforcement activities covering cattle, including unannounced inspections on farms, at livestock markets and during transport (by undertaking spot roadside stops). At slaughterhouses, the Meat Hygiene Service undertake checks on identification of cattle to ensure that only properly identified and traceable cattle enter the human food chain.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1373W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para3">
Inspections are carried out on the basis of risk, with higher risk activities being inspected most. When non-compliance with the cattle identification rules is found, appropriate enforcement action is taken. This can range from advice, warning letters and restrictions on movements through to full prosecution resulting in prison sentences or fines. So far in 2005, 19 convictions have been obtained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_6">Education is as important as enforcement, and this year the Rural Payments Agency has sent two statements to all registered cattle keepers of their Cattle Tracing System (CTS) database records to encourage them to keep their records accurate and up-to-date. In April 2005, they issued clear and comprehensive guidance to all keepers in their &quot;Cattle Keeper&#039;s Handbook&quot;. The response to the CTS statements has been encouragingly high, all the more so for being voluntary, and taken together with the improvements shown in inspections, indicates to us that the cattle industry is keen overall to ensure that their animals are fully traceable and that compliance is good.

 Ministers and Rural Payments Agency (RPA) officials are in regular contact with all stakeholder groups, farmers and agents.

The majority of these requests have now been processed, and RPA has recently outsourced 85 per cent. of the outstanding mapping requests to a trusted third party. This has significantly increased resources, enabling RPA to remain on course to commence payment under the Single Payment Scheme in February 2006, in line with announcements made at the start of the year.

 The term &quot;wildfowl&quot; relates to all species of ducks and geese, and also swans (three species in England in winter). Only certain ducks and geese may be hunted. There are no specific regulations governing the release of native wildfowl into the wild. Only Mallard are released for the purposes of wildfowling. Mallard are native to England and they would not be covered by the provisions of section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which prohibits releases of species of birds not ordinarily resident in or a visitor to the European territory of any member state.

 The World Food Programme&#039;s (WFP) early intervention in tsunami-affected countries is considered to have contributed significantly to the improvement of the humanitarian situation. The scale of the disaster posed particular challenges in terms of assessment of food needs. In the early stages of the response, the WFP adopted an appropriately broad approach to food distribution.

Early inefficiencies with the UNHAS operation were eventually ironed out, and the UNJLC is considered to have performed adequately in a complex operating environment. On behalf of the Government of Indonesia, other agencies and non-government organisations (NGO)s, the WFP launched an unprecedented non-food logistical operation to deliver 600,000 metric tonnes of reconstruction supplies to Aceh and Nias, being funded from the multi-donor trust fund for Aceh and North Sumatra.

 I have not made any specific assessment of the implications of the gender pay gap for levels of female employment. The employment rate for women in the UK currently stands at 70 per cent. I am pleased to see that the gender pay gap has now fallen to 13.2 per cent. from 14.5 per cent. last year.

 Tour ticket costs during the summer are designed to cover costs and not to make a surplus. This year, due to the impact of the works on the Chamber Screen and in Westminster Hall, they were held to 2004 levels and as a result a small deficit of around &#163;39,000 was expected. However following the 7 July terrorist attacks in London, visitor numbers slumped from an anticipated 103,000 to a final total of 77,873. This, together with the increased cost of security resulting from the attacks, produced a deficit of &#163;320,000.

 Three requests for information (RFI) from different applicants have been made relating to HMS Sheffield under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. One RFI was made in January, and the other two in February. Full replies have been deferred pending the outcome of the departmental review that I commissioned in April 2005 to consider what information can be made available publicly concerning the investigation into the loss of HMS Sheffield during the Falklands conflict. My letter of 7 April (D/MSU/2/5/1) refers, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.

 As at 30 June (the latest date for which figures are available), there were approximately 50 veterans in receipt of a war disablement pension whose service included operations in the Gulf Conflict with addresses in Northern Ireland. Others with a lower level of disablement may have received a gratuity award, but we do not have available figures for these. Not all the injuries or medical conditions claimed relate to service in the Gulf but our statistics do not enable us to distinguish the origin of the disablement. Veterans may also qualify for financial assistance through armed forces occupational pension schemes in addition to the

Approximately 25 per cent. of the 53,462 veterans who deployed to the Gulf in 1990&#150;91 are still serving and their medical care is the responsibility of the Defence Medical Services. The Department may under the provisions of the War Pension Scheme defray expenses in respect of medical treatment that is not provided free of charge under other United Kingdom legislation.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for UK regular forces, both trained and untrained, located in the UK. They therefore exclude Ghurkhas, full-time reserve service personnel, the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists.<br>

2. Figures show the UK regular forces posted location. Posted location is where an individual is permanently based.<br>

3. Naval service personnel on sea service are included against the region containing the home port of their ship.<br>

4. Naval service personnel serving in flights at sea are included against the region containing the base airfield of their flight.<br>

5. The detailed figures in this publication have been compiled from unit statistics related to unit postcodes. For some units postcode information is either unavailable or inappropriate.<br>

6. Location statistics are not available for FTRS, the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists.<br>

7. Due to the rounding methods used, figures may not always equal the sum of the parts. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in five have been rounded to the nearest 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

8. Comparisons should not be made between data before July 2002 and data after July 2004 due to the different methodologies used to collate the data.<br>

 In August 2005, the Learning and Skills Council took responsibility in three development regions (the North West, North East and South West) for planning and funding an integrated learning and skills service for offenders in custody and the community, linking it much more explicitly with mainstream provision for post-16 learners.

 Prisoner suicide prevention operates by embedding suicide prevention through every area of prison life-including detoxification, decency, health care, staff training, and the built environment. The key intervention currently being introduced across public and private prisons is the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners: ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork). ACCT aims to improve the quality of care by introducing flexible care understanding at-risk prisoners.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many times the powers under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 have been used to prevent an individual from contacting a spouse or partner in each year since the Act came into force; what standard of proof is required before such powers are exercised; and if he will make a statement; [24524]

(The number is estimated because there is no specific reference to section three of the Act within the dataset.) It is not possible to identify those orders or injunctions that were intended to prevent contact with a partner or spouse, as information about the purpose of such orders and injunctions is not centrally collected. Both restraining orders made under section 5 of the Act and civil injunctions granted under section three are civil orders.

<p>
<a name="51117w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_151">Both orders are preventative rather than punitive and are intended to give protection to victims. In determining whether a restraining order is necessary, the criminal court will apply a civil standard of proof. If a civil court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that harassment has taken place or is anticipated, then it may grant an injunction.
