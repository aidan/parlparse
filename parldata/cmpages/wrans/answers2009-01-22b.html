 DCMS officials have discussed the Central Council of Physical Recreation's (CCPRs) &#145;Subs for Clubs&#146; proposal to allow community amateur sports clubs (CASC) to claim gift aid on junior subscriptions with HMT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="90122w0003.htm_para8"><a name="09012265000326">A decision was made against implementing this proposal at the current time. DCMS officials are in discussion with CCPR to identify ways of encouraging more clubs to register for the CASC scheme and to maximize the use of the existing benefits that CASCs enjoy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="90122w0003.htm_para9"><a name="09012265000327">To date the CASC scheme has now registered over 5,000 clubs receiving rate relief and other benefits. As of December 2009 Deloittes estimate that it has saved grassroots sports more than &#163;48 million since its inception. This money has gone back into sport and has enabled clubs to spend it on everything from facilities to kit. Additionally, all community sports clubs will benefit over the next year from the reduction in VAT from 17.5 per cent. to 15 per cent. which will help to increase the funds available to clubs, and moreover provide more money in the pockets of potential donors.</p>

 The number of foreign registered fishing vessels operating in the UK 200 mile fishery limit is very fluid and constantly changing in response to fishing opportunities. Their presence is recorded through a combination of obligatory satellite monitoring systems and through sightings of vessels made during aerial and naval reconnaissance activity carried out by, or on behalf of, UK fisheries administrations.</p>

 For some time, the Government have been concerned that the Hague Preference mechanism does not provide the necessary support to coastal communities in the UK and Ireland that it was intended to do. We have, therefore, sought to open discussions with the Irish on suitable replacement arrangements. To date, they have been reluctant to engage. We will, however, continue to press them on this, and plan to explore options with the Commission and other member states in due course.</p>

However, in the December 2007 EU Fisheries Council, we also invoked on both North Sea haddock and whiting, in recognition of the particular importance of these stocks to UK fishermen, and the concerns expressed within the industry that the scientific advice (on which the quotas were based) was somewhat at odds with fishermen's experience on the ground. For the same reasons, we repeated these invocations last December. In both years however, we restricted the scale of our invocations, recognising the concerns of other member states who lose out as a result of our actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="90122w0007.htm_para6"><a name="09012265000873">The Department remains committed to living within its budget as set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007. We are currently looking hard at the services we provide in order to find new ways to improve how we deliver them, while ensuring that we focus on our frontline services. We aim to drive out inefficiencies, overlap and duplication and to reduce our overheads, especially in our headquarters areas. This work should help the Department to ensure that we are able to redeploy staff to the frontline as and where appropriate.</p>

 Planning work has been underway since September 2008 to determine how the Ministry of Justice will live within its spending review settlement, secure &#163;1 billion of savings by 2010-11. Regular meetings have been held with the unions throughout this period, with the next planned meeting at the corporate level provisionally scheduled for 22 January 2009. Regular engagement has also been maintained at the business group and business area levels, where business area specific issues have been consulted, including HM Courts Services (HMCS).</p>

Going forward consultation will take place with the unions at a local level or, when appropriate, at a corporate level. For example the chief executive of HMCS plans to discuss budgetary allocations with the unions on 17 February.</p>

Decisions have yet to be made as to how those savings will be allocated between Departments but once this is clear we will need to consider the implications for us. This means it will be a little while before we can publish figures for that year. Once they have settled, we will share again details of the allocations with union colleagues.</p>

 There has been an 18.7 per cent. reduction in the frequency rate of youth reoffending between 2000 and 2006. The Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008 details the cross-Government approach to reducing youth crime, including youth reoffending. It sets out a &#145;triple track&#146; approach of enforcement and punishment where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge where it is most needed, and better and earlier prevention. The Youth Justice Board leads on the target of a 10 per cent. reduction by 2011 of the frequency rate of youth reoffending against the 2005 baseline, and is working with Departments, to influence the key services to ensure young people have access to mainstream and specialist services before, during and after justice.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="6"><i> Notes:</i><br>
Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Small numbers</i><br>
To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) &#147;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&#148;.<br>
Figures for under-16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under-16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&#151;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing&#146;s syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9).<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

The NHS Business Services Authority is enhancing the role of the dental reference service to ensure that primary care trusts (PCTs) have the tools to check that dental care provided is appropriate to patients&#146; needs. Patients who have concerns about any aspect of their dental care should in the first instance raise this with the practice and then if not satisfied, with the PCT.</p>

In the case of illness or injury, with the individuals' permission, we can inform family and friends and keep them up to date with developments.

<i>  [holding answer 20 January 2009]:</i> The security situation in south central Somalia remains extremely challenging following the withdrawal of the Ethiopian troops. It is difficult to verify the divergent reports emerging from Mogadishu. However, on 16 January, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) released a press statement saying that, contrary to some press reporting, areas vacated by the Ethiopian troops have now been occupied by Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) forces, who are working together under the Djibouti peace process. Ethiopia's withdrawal presents a security challenge, but it also offers an opportunity for progress towards a Somali-led, long-term political solution to the conflict.</p>

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="90122w0018.htm_para0"><a name="09012277000522">Fire resistance for electric cables is covered by European standards developed under the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC). The 1991 UK Construction Products Regulations (SI 1620) implement this directive in the UK, and require that all products used in construction works must satisfy essential requirements (including safety in fire) for their use, where that use is regulated. In turn, the England and Wales Building Regulations (regulation 7) require that products must be fit for purpose in use. The guidance to this functional requirement states that testing and certification to a harmonised EU standard is one way of demonstrating compliance. In addition, the guidance to part B of the Building Regulations (Fire Safety) states that cables showing the appropriate classification against harmonised EU standard (BS EN 50200:2006) can be deemed compliant with the relevant requirements of part B. Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar provisions. These conditions apply equally to products manufactured in the UK or imported from either the EU or elsewhere. These requirements govern the fire resistance of cables in use: there is no mandatory requirement for testing or certification at point of manufacture or marketing.</p>

Non-DAC donors are also contributing to meeting the targets. The ODA increases by the G8 and other donors towards the 2005 targets are monitored by the DAC, the European Commission and by civil society, and are discussed in intergovernmental bodies including the United Nations, the G8, the European Council, and DAC High Level meetings.

 At Gleneagles, the UK announced a timetable to provide 0.7 per cent. of gross national income (GNI) as official development assistance (ODA) by 2013. The European Union agreed to provide 0.56 per cent. of its GNI as ODA in 2010, with at least half of the increase allocated to sub-Saharan Africa. On the basis of these commitments, and those of other donors, the OECD estimated that total annual ODA would increase by around $50 billion between 2004 and 2010, and annual ODA to Africa would increase by $25 billion.</p>

This projected increase of &#163;4.8 billion is equivalent to US$7.3 billion at today's exchange rates, about 15 per cent of the $50 billion increase expected to result from the Gleneagles commitments. The Government has not announced a projection of total UK ODA to Africa, but has announced that DFID will increase its total multilateral and bilateral aid to Africa from &#163;1.3 billion in 2004 to more than &#163;3 billion in 2010&#151;equivalent to $2.6 billion at today's exchange rates, and over 10 per cent. of the $25 billion increase for Africa announced at Gleneagles commitments.</p>

We are responding to the short-term market conditions by introducing measures to provide extra help for first time buyers, homeowners facing difficulties, and keeping housing supply, especially social housing supply, as high as possible.

It has the ability to acquire land in support of its statutory objects and some of that land will be used for affordable housing. In addition, the HCA is responsible for the management of the programme for the delivery of more and better homes on surplus public sector land, with a target of 200,000 homes by 2016, of which the aspiration is that up to 50 per cent. of homes delivered will be affordable homes. In the current market, we are, however, keeping all options under constant review and the HCA is actively engaged in discussions with the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="90122w0021.htm_para0"><a name="09012277000823">Since 1 April 2007 the Army has collated quarterly figures for its deployable elements only, rather than for its total trained strength. For this reason the figures are not comparable to those provided by the Navy and RAF in the same period. The Army's deployability returns provide a snapshot, on a specific day, of the deployability of Army personnel broken down into the following categories: fully deployable; limited deployability (LD); personnel unable to deploy (PUD). Many of those personnel classed as LD can and will deploy to operational theatres, likewise PUDs will be able to undertake non-deployed duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="90122w0021.htm_para1"><a name="09012277000824">The following table provides the figures for calendar years 2007-08, personnel numbers are rounded to the nearest 10, and percentages rounded to one decimal point. It should be noted that since September 2008 the deployability return has extended the categories it collects against with the intention of providing greater granularity to limited deployability and PUD data. As result the September and December returns report against different metrics which may account for the increase in numbers.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether his Department's underspend of &#163;1.75 billion in 2007-08 against its budget is to be carried forward to 2008-09; and what the reasons are for this underspend. [249004]</p>

 The Department's final audited outturn underspend for 2007-08 comprised principally depreciation charges and movements on provisions, requested in the spring supplementary estimate through request for resources 1 (RfRl&#151;provision of defence capability), that did not materialise. This underspend was in indirect resource which, as non-cash, does not contribute to the Department's spending power. Moreover, it was agreed in comprehensive spending review 2007 that any RfR1 non-cash resource underspend would be set at zero at the start of 2008-09 and could not therefore be subject to end year flexibility (EYF), with any requirement for further non-cash provision to be considered with the Treasury when it arose.</p>

 The directive will provide member states with common procurement rules for defence and security which take account of the special features of that market.

The parent with care may apply to a magistrate&#146;s court for a maintenance order to be enforced overseas and procedures also exist to enable the parent with care to ask the foreign authorities to create an order for maintenance on their behalf.

<i> [holding answer 12 January 2009]:</i><i> </i>We concluded that the contract for the Post Office card account should be awarded to the Post Office without completing the tender process. In reaching that conclusion, we took into account that the Post Office card account is a simple product&#151;essentially a means of paying benefit&#151;and that it provides an important social service to vulnerable people, particularly in rural and deprived urban areas. Direct debits, and other additional functionality, are already available through the basic bank accounts which can be accessed at Post Office branches.

According to a study by the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA), even when foundation degrees were first introduced, this was not the main reason for institutions discontinuing HND and HNC provision (LSDA 2002). Since then the decline in HND and HNCs has accelerated, at least in part due to the growth in foundation degrees.</p>

 A functioning intellectual property system is an essential enabler to encourage innovation and economic recovery. The Gowers Review concluded that the intellectual property framework in the UK was broadly right. It did however highlight a number of areas for reform which it set out in a number of specific recommendations. Over half of these recommendations have been implemented. Work is continuing on the remainder. Meanwhile, the Government continue to attach priority to IP issues. The Creative Britain Report recognised the importance of IP, in particular copyright to the creative industries. As part of this report the Government have improved IP crime intelligence gathering and coordination of enforcement agencies. I also recently announced a broad review of the future of copyright to ensure that it continues to support creativity, promote investment and job growth while also inspiring business and consumer confidence.</p>

 It is not possible to quantify the number of cases referred to inspectorates by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The Department receives representations across a wide range of issues including on child protection, mostly in the form of correspondence. Some of these are shared with inspectorates for information whilst other matters may be passed to them on a more formal basis where specific action may be appropriate. In addition, local authorities are required in particular circumstances to notify Ofsted of the details of particular events, including those relating to serious incidents involving children or with respect to incidents occurring in settings for which Ofsted has regulatory functions. Other issues raised by correspondents with the Department may be pursued directly with local authorities or other agencies through the Department's regional Government office network.</p>

 Under the Safeguarding Children Research Initiative DCSF, in partnership with the Department of Health, have commissioned a suite of studies to support the Government's programme of reform to improve early recognition and cost-effective interventions to protect children. The Safeguarding Children Research Initiative runs until 2010 and includes 11 studies covering three themes: recognition of neglect and emotional abuse; impact of interventions; and inter-agency working.

It also recognises that their participation in the public sector supply chain can benefit local and regional economies. The Trust&#146;s website also contains a number of case studies where local authorities and schools demonstrate how they have successfully tendered for local produce for their meals&#146; service.</p>

 Schools are not required to obtain CRB enhanced disclosures on staff who have been in post since before the CRB was established in 2002, although schools are required to check that such staff are not barred from working with children. When the new Vetting and Barring Scheme is introduced, such staff will be required to register with the Independent Safeguarding Authority and to obtain a CRB enhanced disclosure. The new scheme will be phased in over a period of up to five years, but staff&#151;including school staff&#151;who have never had a CRB disclosure will have high priority in the phasing-in process. Although we cannot say precisely when this will be complete, staff without CRB disclosures will be taken early in the phasing process. The arrangements apply equally to head teachers, teachers and other staff.</p>

This work is currently examining how these priorities could be met locally by new or existing training and development routes and with new Government investment. Feasibility studies on an accreditation system to accredit existing and prior experience, and the delivery of training resources to support managers in identifying workforce needs for the third sector are also being undertaken. Leaders and managers in the third sector will also have access to a leadership and management programme designed to train up to 5,000 strategic leaders and managers from across young people&#146;s services over the next three years, starting this year.
