<P>
<a name="20116w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 Since the appointment of the first Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards in 1995 it has been recognised that the formal appraisal arrangements for senior Officers of the House are not appropriate for the special circumstances of the post. Both Commissioners have discussed their work from time to time with the Speaker and the Clerk of the House. In addition, Standing Order No. 149 (1)(b) provides that the Committee on Standards and Privileges shall oversee the work of the Commissioner.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The figures reflect Education SSA (primary and secondary blocks respectively) plus all school related revenue grants in DfES's DEL relevant to pupils aged 5&#150;10 (primary) and 11&#150;15 (secondary).<P>

2. The primary and secondary grant figures include notional allocations for those grants in support of more than one sector.<P>

3. Pupil numbers underlying the &#163; per pupil figures are those underlying the SSA calculations (primary and secondary sub- blocks respectively).<P>

4. Real terms figures are calculated using GDP deflators published by the Treasury 20 December 2001.<P>

5. 2001&#150;02 figures are provisional as decisions on some funding allocations have yet to be finalised. The figures are thus liable to be revised later on in the year.<P>

6. Figures rounded to the &#163;10. Difference figures may not sum due to funding. <P>

 All entrants to the Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) must meet the general requirements both for admission to postgraduate courses of initial teacher training laid down in my Department's Circular 4/98 and for admission to employment-based teacher training prescribed by the Education (Teachers' Qualifications and Health Standards) (England) Regulations 1999, as amended. Decisions on which applications to approve are taken by the Teacher Training Agency, which administers the programme on my Department's behalf. The criteria which the agency applies to reach those decisions are published in the booklet "How to Apply for the Graduate and Registered Teacher Programmes in England", a copy of which has been placed in the Library.

 The additional guidance issued on 5 October 2001 was not sent to Somerford Infant School, but to Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships, local authorities and others who received the February 2001 guidance, in response to which the school submitted its expression of interest in joining the programme.
<P>

<a name="20116w02.html_para0">Officials provided feedback to Somerford on their proposals in June 2001, and will shortly further follow up Somerford's interest in the programme by contacting the headteacher of the school in the first instance.

<a name="20116w02.html_para2">The majority of funding for the food in schools programme has not yet been allocated. We are working with the Department for Education and Skills to develop proposals that cover the breadth of opportunities for food in schools. The programme will aim to bring together all food related initiatives in schools and after-school clubs to improve both health and learning, and ensure consistent information is given about health and nutrition. Following an advisory forum meeting in the summer, proposals are being put together into a series of pilot schemes that can be tested throughout the country. This includes assessing existing initiatives as well as new ones to ensure that the programme builds on and supports existing work in schools by a number of organisations.

The British and Irish Governments have been working closely together to make progress, building on the existing good co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda S&#237;och&#225;na.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w06.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Government's strategy for tackling terrorist crime in Northern Ireland is two-fold. First, the police must have available to them robust legislative powers. The Terrorism Act 2000 contains a number of financial provisions for seeking information and restraining assets. These powers were supplemented by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, passed in the wake of the events on 11 September.
<P>

<a name="20116w06.html_para0">Second, in September 2000, the Government established an Organised Crime Taskforce for Northern Ireland. The taskforce brings together the agencies operating in Northern Ireland to agree crime types for concerted multi-agency action. The taskforce has published an assessment of the threat to Northern Ireland society from serious and organised crime, which assesses that approximately half of the organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have links with the paramilitaries.

 A clear distinction needs to be made between the expression of political attitudes, opinions and beliefs and the actual commission or instigation of terrorist crime. The Real IRA remains a proscribed organisation. The Government believe that the Real IRA and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement are inextricably linked. However, on the basis of the evidence currently available, the Government assess that the 32 County Sovereignty Movement is not concerned in terrorism.

 The FCO does all it can to help the families of British nationals murdered overseas. There are no specific protocols&#151;the needs of each family are different. We also give families leaflets published by the FCO on "Victims of Crime Abroad" and "Death Overseas" and put them in touch with relevant agencies in the UK who may be able to help them.

 The Indian Government have made public information which points to the involvement of Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in the attack on the Indian Parliament. As Home Secretary, I proscribed both these groups in February 2001 because of their clear involvement in terrorist activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Figures for the numbers of British nationals in prison overseas are compiled quarterly. These were last compiled as at 1 November 2001, when there were 3,485 British nationals in prison overseas. The next quarterly figures will be available at the end of January 2002.
<P>

<a name="20116w07.html_para0">We do not routinely compile data on UK prisoners overseas' according to their domicile in the UK or by gender, nor by nature of offence. Gathering the requested data in this format would incur disproportionate costs.

 We cannot be certain how many Zimbabwean residents may wish to seek refuge in the UK. As at 14 January 2002, there were 25,054 British nationals registered with the British high commission in Zimbabwe. There is no requirement for British nationals to inform our high commission if they plan to leave Zimbabwe, when they actually leave, or their destination.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We continue to have serious concerns about the human rights situation in China, including Tibet. I take every opportunity to raise these with the Chinese authorities and will seek to do so with the Chinese Foreign Minister.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The human rights situation in Tibet shows no signs of improvement. We are concerned in particular about reports of arbitrary detention, torture and the "re-education" of monks and nuns. We raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities at every suitable opportunity.
<P>

<a name="20116w07.html_para2">The overall human rights situation in China continues to be a matter of serious concern. There has been considerable progress in many aspects, for example in the ability of individual citizens to manage their own lives, engage in business, travel freely and own a home. China has also shown an increased willingness to engage with United Nations human rights mechanisms. But severe restrictions remain on the enjoyment of civil and political rights, especially the freedoms of expression, religion and association.

a programme of projects in China addressing such issues as the rule of law, legal and judicial independence, child rights and human rights awareness.
<P>

<a name="20116w07.html_para3">The dialogue is aimed at encouraging long-term, fundamental change in China. It has taken place in an increasingly open and frank atmosphere, and has been accompanied by increased co-operation with international human rights mechanisms, including ratification in February 2001 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and a programme of co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

<P>
<a name="20116w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We take every suitable opportunity to press the Chinese authorities to allow access to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima (the Dalai Lama's choice as Panchen Lama) by an independent and respected figure to assess his health and living conditions. It was last raised at the seventh round of the UK/China human rights dialogue held in London last November. The Chinese maintain that the parents of the boy do not want him exposed to international attention.

 The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been authorised by the United Nations, and enjoys wide support among the international community. In addition to the UK, which has agreed to serve as lead nation for the ISAF's initial three months, some 17 countries are contributing assets to the force. The ISAF will be about 5,000 strong, with the UK contributing around 1,800 personnel (together with an additional 300 airfield enablers to assist in activating and running Kabul international airport). Although separate from operations being conducted in support of the campaign against international terrorism, it deploys with the full support of the United States and enjoys very close relationships with US Central Command (which has deployed a liaison team to Major General McColl's headquarters).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many people have been killed and injured as a result of bombing raids on Iraq since 1991 and what discussions have been held with the UN co-ordinator in Iraq about the documentation and verification of the casualty figures.  [27174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The coalition only ever targets, in self-defence, Iraqi military facilities that pose a threat to its forces carrying out legitimate patrols of the no-fly zones. The coalition goes to exceptional lengths to ensure civilian casualties are kept to the absolute minimum possible, including the employment of very carefully controlled targeting procedures and precision guided munitions.
<P>

<a name="20116w08.html_para5">In practice, it is extremely difficult to give estimates of civilian casualties, despite the painstaking battle-damage assessment (BDA) that the coalition routinely carries out every time ordnance is released. The Ministry of Defence has no objective means of verifying Iraqi claims of civilian casualties; I am not therefore in a position to provide the information requested by my hon. Friend. However, we can demonstrate categorically that many of the Iraqi claims of civilian casualties are either exaggerated or wholly untrue.
<P>

<a name="20116w08.html_para6">On a number of occasions the Iraqis have claimed that coalition aircraft have caused civilian casualties when allied aircraft have not released any munitions, or even been flying. On 19 June 2001, for example, it seems very probable that the civilian casualties, which the Iraqis claimed were caused by coalition activities, were in fact caused by an Iraqi munition. No ordnance was dropped by the coalition on 19 June. There have also been many instances when the Iraqis claimed civilians have been killed, where our BDA has clearly indicated that only military facilities were attacked.
<P>

<a name="20116w08.html_para7">There have been no discussions with the UN Co-ordinator in Iraq about the documentation or verification of civilian casualties. The UN Co-ordinator in Iraq is responsible for implementing the humanitarian programme under the UN Oil for Food arrangements. He has no role in the no-fly zones.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment has been made of <i>(a)</i> the potential and actual interference of radar by wind turbines and <i>(b)</i> the obstruction that wind turbines represent to low-flying aircraft; how long the assessment has taken; and when the results will be published.  [27275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w09.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The RAF has carried out two trials, one in 1994 and one in 1997, both of which found that if a wind farm is in direct line of sight to radar it can have an extremely detrimental effect upon radar performance as the rotating blades can be a source of interference. The turbines can appear as genuine aircraft targets that could either mask aircraft responses or desensitise the radar within the sector containing the wind farm. Shadowing of aircraft at similar radar to target elevation angles as the wind farm may degrade radar performance even further which could be potentially hazardous to air traffic and impede an air defence control situation.
<P>

<a name="20116w09.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence recognised the need for further research and is currently assisting with a DTI sponsored study that is being undertaken by QinetiQ into the effects of turbines on radar systems. This study began in September 2001 and is due to be completed in September 2002.
<P>

<a name="20116w09.html_para1">Military low flying training takes place within the UK Low Flying System below 2,000 ft for fixed wing aircraft and 500 ft for helicopters. Fixed wing aircraft are permitted to fly down to within a Minimum Separation Distance of 250 ft from the ground or any other obstacle, and helicopters are permitted to fly down to ground level. The presence of wind turbines in most areas of the UK would present no difficulty to low flying aircraft and these and other naturally tall structures are taken into account as part of route planning.
<P>

<a name="20116w09.html_para2">In some circumstances, the presence or proliferation of wind turbines may pose a hazard to, or interfere with, military low flying training to such an extent that the training value is negated. The height of the turbines is often in excess of 70 m (approximately 220 ft) to turbine tip. Within the Tactical Training Areas aircraft can be flown at 100 ft above ground level, which is significantly 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2002 : Column 330W</I><P>
lower than the 250 ft minimum that applies to the rest of the UK low flying system. Therefore, for the safety of members of the public and aircrew it is imperative that any hazards to low flying aircraft are minimised, especially those that exceed 100 ft in height.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what representations he has received from his Canadian counterpart regarding the deployment of Canadian troops in Afghanistan; and if Canadian troops will be deployed as a part of the International Security Assistance Force.  [26645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We have been in close political, diplomatic and military contact with Canada throughout our operations in Afghanistan. I spoke to my Canadian counterpart on 21 December about the possibility of Canadian troops participating in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). We were keen for a company of Canadian engineers to participate from the beginning and hoped that these might be augmented by an infantry battalion to replace 2 Battalion the Parachute Regiment in due course. In the event, the Canadian Government have decided not to contribute to the ISAF, but will instead support operations around Kandahar. We welcome Canada's contribution. Canada may wish to participate in the ISAF at a later date.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what role international peacekeepers will have in securing routes for aid convoys and deliveries within Afghanistan.  [26877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The role of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is to help the Afghan Interim Administration provide security and stability only in and around Kabul; it will therefore not be involved in providing security for aid convoys. The responsibility for establishing and maintaining security across all of Afghanistan lies with the Interim Administration.
<P>

<a name="20116w09.html_para7">Essential to the building of peace and stability and the securing of aid routes is the defeat of the remnants of the al-Qaeda and Taliban. The international coalition against terrorism's operations against these groups, while distinct from the ISAF, will help ensure humanitarian aid is delivered where it is needed in Afghanistan.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Consumers should not be misled about additional costs imposed for paying in euros.

 The Government have admitted that, until the TUPE Regulations were amended in 1993, the acquired rights directive was not implemented correctly, and that this was a sufficiently serious breach of the UK's EC obligations to give rise to a liability for damages, where anyone suffered losses as a result. The Government are therefore prepared to compensate anyone affected provided that they can show that they suffered loss as a result of that breach. At present, a number of claims have been brought in the courts, but without the cause and amount of the claimed losses having been established.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) of 20 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 609&#150;10W, what decisions she has made on Out-of-Round Offshore Licence awards.  [28191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I will offer licences to Tuscan Energy (Scotland) Ltd. and Acorn North Sea Ltd. for Block 30/24, which includes the former Argyll, Duncan and Innes fields, and to ATP Oil and Gas (UK) Ltd. and CalEnergy Gas (UK) Ltd. for Part-Blocks 42/25a and 43/21a.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para6">These awards, in their different ways, are good signs for the future of the United Kingdom Continental Shelf. They demonstrate some of the new approaches and working arrangements that PILOT has been pressing for over the past three years.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para7">Argyll was the UK's first producing offshore field, but it was abandoned as uneconomic back in 1992 when less than 40 per cent. of the oil had been recovered. Tuscan/Acorn now hope to use the latest technology to reopen it and extract more of the oil left behind. Subsequently they should be able to reopen the old Duncan and Innes fields too, both of which were abandoned at the same time as Argyll. Tuscan and Acorn are two small new British companies, taking a fresh and imaginative look at the opportunities in the North sea and introducing a productive new alliance with the North sea's supply chain in the shape of Schlumberger and ABB.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para8">ATP is one of the new entrants that DTI has been working hard to attract to the UK to bring work to our Fallow Discoveries. Their focused, high-efficiency approach, developed in the Gulf of Mexico, will allow them to develop the 43/21a discovery and other Fallow Discoveries, which others may not see as economic.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para9">However, I do not intend to allow any of this valuable acreage to run to fallow. Accordingly the licences will be individually tailored to match the companies' plans. Tuscan/Acorn will receive four licences, three of which each cover one of the former fields while the fourth covers the rest of the block. Each licence will expire at an early date if the companies fail to meet their work commitments, so that if necessary each asset will individually be made available for relicensing. ATP's licence also has an early expiry date in the event that it is not progressed by then.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what opportunities there are for companies to acquire petroleum licences over unlicensed acreage in the North sea.  [28192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I am today inviting applications for petroleum licences over a large number of blocks in the southern, central and northern North sea which will form the 20th round of offshore petroleum licensing. The blocks made available for licensing are close to existing petroleum developments and infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para10">This is the first North sea licensing round since blocks were awarded in the 18th round in December 1998. As such, I anticipate that there will be significant demand 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2002 : Column 338W</I><P>
for licences from companies keen to acquire exploration opportunities in proven petroleum play areas. While there has been a great deal of oil and gas exploration on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) since North sea drilling started in 1964, there are still many geological horizons that have yet to be fully tested. The recent 'Buzzard' discovery is evidence that there is still significant potential for further large discoveries in the North sea.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para11">In deciding which blocks to make available for licensing, I have considered the results of the Strategic Environmental Assessment covering a large swathe of the North sea undertaken by my Department on which consultation closed in December. After considering the assessment and the responses to the consultation, I have decided to take a precautionary approach and not offer for licence parts of four blocks in the central North sea because of the need to undertake further scientific analysis of a number of 'pock mark' features which were highlighted by the environmental assessment.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para12">Any licences awarded in the round will contain conditions to protect environmental interests and the interests of other sea users. In addition, activities carried out under the licences will be subject to a range of legislation which is designed to protect the marine environment, including regulations which apply the Environmental Impact Assessment and Habitats directives to offshore oil and gas activities.
<P>

<a name="20116w10.html_para13">The licences will also contain provisions to ensure that licensees either undertake exploration work within a relatively short timescale or relinquish the licence at the earliest possible opportunity so that other companies are able to take forward exploration of the area. These requirements support PILOT initiatives to remove barriers to activity on the UKCS.

 The most recent measurements of the international ranking of the Science and Engineering Base (SEB) in terms of quality, relevance and cost- effectiveness indicate that the UK continues to maintain its position relative to other G7 nations. The details are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The quality of the science and engineering base is measured by the UK's world ranking in terms of citations of published papers. Over the period 1981&#150;2000 the UK received a 9.1 per cent. share of the citations in the international Science Citation Index, second only to the US. The UK was second in 'citation shares' for 15 out of 20 scientific fields with the lowest placing being fifth.
<P>
<BR>
One measure of relevance is the UK's world ranking in terms of the proportion of university research funding from non- governmental sources. For the latest year for which data are available (1997), the UK was again ranked first among the G7 countries.
<P>
<BR>
Cost-effectiveness is measured by the UK's world ranking in terms of the number of papers published per &#163;1 million of public expenditure on science. In 1990, 1993, 1996 and 1999, the UK was the leading country in the G7. For the latest year (2000) the UK was again ranked first.

 In line with all my Department's non-departmental public bodies, English Partnerships is controlled by net expenditure limits in accordance with the principles of resource accounting and budgeting. These are divided into separate limits for the Commission for the New Towns and Urban Regeneration Agency to reflect EP's twin statutory base. In 2001&#150;02, the net Capital Expenditure Limit for the URA is &#163;112.6 million and that for the CNT is -&#163;80.5 million.

 London Underground is responsible for managing the competition for the contracts to modernise the tube infrastructure. I understand that, subject to bids representing value for money and to consultation with the Mayor and Transport for London, London Underground expects to be able to sign contracts before the end of the financial year. Provided the safety arrangements are accepted by the Health and Safety Executive, the contracts would take effect, and the modernisation programme commence, as soon as possible thereafter.

SHI will be provided only to potential purchasers who can demonstrate that they can sustain the long term costs of home ownership. SHI will not benefit those who are unable to raise the other resources necessary for house purchase.

 As indicated in our Planning Green Paper, published on 12 December, a third-party right of appeal against the grant of planning permission could add to the costs and uncertainties of planning, which we could not accept. We believe that the right way forward is to make the planning system more accessible and transparent and to strengthen the opportunities for community involvement throughout this process. Proposals to achieve this were set out in the Green Paper.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w14.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 National Guidance to local authorities on preparing community strategies under the Local Government Act 2000 was issued in December 2000. No additional Guidance has been issued by the Government office for the south-east but GOSE has been involved in discussions with individual local authorities on the setting up of community strategies. For example, GOSE attended a meeting with Hampshire county council to discuss how the county intended to take forward a county-wide local strategic partnership and a county-wide community strategy.
<P>

<a name="20116w14.html_para2">In respect of plans prepared by local planning authorities under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, no specific guidance has been given by GOSE to county councils concerning their participation in or initiation of local plans. In addition, guidance has been published by central Government on local transport plans which are prepared by highways authorities under the provisions of the Transport Act 2000, but no separate advice has been issued by GOSE.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Alayne Wake and agree that there is a need to investigate the incidence, extent and causation of deep vein thrombosis among air travellers.

 It is not the role of Government to intervene in detailed issues of programme content and scheduling.

Within this framework, detailed decisions on programming and scheduling are a matter for the BBC, reflecting its editorial independence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w15.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Heritage Lottery Fund's policy is that <i>(a)</i> where a project involves conversion of information about collections into electronic forms, the Fund expects applicants to address the conversion of catalogues and other finding aids before digital imaging of collections and <i>(b)</i> to support documentary heritage projects from libraries of historical importance which run programmes of public benefit, and to support projects to widen access to collections, particularly those of non- national institutions.

 The ENSEMBLE bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) for a programme of retrospective conversion of holdings of printed music to electronic format has been withdrawn on advice from HLF. HLF has decided to put off further decisions on bids from the Consortium of University Research Libraries (CURL), of which ENSEMBLE is a sub-set, until the educational objectives for the website have been achieved through the Britain in Print project. The proposed website will be the foundation for delivering future CURL projects to the public. The decision rests with the Trustees of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which administers the HLF, as Ministers do not intervene in Lottery applications.

 Channel 5 services are available on all television platforms: terrestrial, satellite and cable. I do not expect the availability of analogue terrestrial Channel 5 services to be increased because the priority is to use available spectrum for developing digital terrestrial television (DTT). As part of the Digital TV Action Plan, Government and industry are considering the extension 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2002 : Column 354W</I><P>

 The Government are committed to ensuring that terrestrial analogue broadcasting signals are maintained until: everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form can receive them on digital systems; switching to digital is an affordable option for the vast majority of people; as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers have access to digital equipment.

 The Government believe that juveniles should be sent to custody only as a last resort. That is why we have greatly strengthened and expanded the range of non-custodial sentencing options available to the courts. These include the Reparation Order, the Action Plan Order, the Parenting Order, the Supervision Order, and Curfew Orders with electronic monitoring for 10 to 15-year-olds.

persistent juvenile offenders who would otherwise face a custodial sentence or remand. ISSP brings together intensive supervision with unprecedented levels of surveillance, aimed at protecting the community while tackling offending behaviour. Each juvenile has an individually tailored package of reparation, training and education measures and courses to tackle specific issues such as drug addiction or anger management, and may be electronically tagged or, in some cases, voice verified, as part of the intensive surveillance.
<P>

<a name="20116w17.html_para2">For some young people the seriousness and/or persistence of their offending may mean that a custodial sentence is the only appropriate response. We are therefore working with the Youth Justice Board to help ensure that custodial penalties are served in facilities which provide a positive and constructive regime focused on preventing re-offending.

 The discussion paper on family visitor appeals forms part of the review of those appeals announced by the then Home Secretary in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) on 11 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 610&#150;11W. As part of the consultation process I met representatives from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux to discuss their response to the paper. Their response and the other responses to the paper will be fed into the final report of the review team, together with the results of the independent research project commissioned by the team. We will consider all responses to the discussion paper in the context of the review as a whole and will publish a response.

 Under the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) recruitment initiative, Hertfordshire Constabulary has been allocated a total of 107 additional officers, over and above the force's previous recruitment plans for the three years to March 2003.
<P>

This carry-over brought the force's total allocation from the CFF for 2001&#150;02 up to 70 officers. The force has asked to defer just five of its allocation for this year into 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w18.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will define the test of dual criminality.  [26604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The issue of dual criminality arises mainly in the context of extradition. Under the Extradition Act 1989, dual criminality will ordinarily be established where the fugitive's alleged conduct discloses an equivalent offence under United Kingdom law which would be punishable in both countries with a prison sentence of 12 months or more. For cases arising under schedule 1 to this Act where the request is made under a bilateral treaty, the conduct must also be found on a list of offences set out in the treaty. In the case of the backing of warrants scheme which governs our extradition relations with the Republic of Ireland, the conduct must be punishable in both countries with a prison sentence of six months or more.
<P>

<a name="20116w18.html_para6">If the appropriate test for dual criminality is not satisfied, the extradition fugitive must be discharged under existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="20116w18.html_para7">There is also a test for dual criminality in respect of a limited number of requests for mutual legal assistance. This is where an incoming request involves the exercise of search and seizure powers or the special investigation powers of the Serious Fraud Squad in cases of serious or complex fraud. Again, if the crime alleged on the request is not a crime in the United Kingdom, there is no dual criminality, and the request cannot proceed.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Conviction for a criminal offence is a breach of the police code of conduct. Where there is reason to believe that a police officer has breached the code, the chief officer of the force concerned may suspend the officer where it is in the public interest to do so. An officer who is suspended may not resign unless the chief officer agrees. Current procedures therefore enable chief officers to ensure that, in appropriate cases, officers do not resign to avoid misconduct proceedings. It is for the chief officer to determine whether a officer should be suspended.
<P>

<a name="20116w19.html_para0">Where an officer is awaiting sentence for criminal offences and offers his resignation the resignation may be accepted because the maximum penalty a Chief Constable can impose is dismissal. That is a matter for the Chief Constable to decide.
<P>

<a name="20116w19.html_para1">In relation to officers seeking medical retirement, the Government set out its position in paragraph 6.46 of the White Paper "Policing a New Century: A Blueprint for Reform" (CM 5326). That paragraph said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations now allow for disciplinary hearings to go ahead in the absence of the accused, although the power is not used very frequently. The Government believe that it is wholly unacceptable for sickness or medical retirement to be used as a means of avoiding discipline. This requires strong support from the centre&#151;which we will provide&#151;and firm management action in using the existing power to proceed with hearings in all but the most exceptional cases. We will amend the central guidance and, if necessary, the statutory regulations to achieve this. Where medical retirement is at issue, the police authority should consider whether it would be right to exercise its discretion not to retire the officer where the public interest in completing the proceedings in a misconduct case outweighs the medical condition.

 Powers available to police to deal with raves are found in sections 63&#150;67 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.
<P>

<a name="20116w19.html_para4">These powers allow a police superintendent to direct those attending a rave to leave and take with them any vehicles or other property. If a person fails to comply with this direction or returns to the site within seven days, a constable may seize and remove their vehicle.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he gives to police forces on the prosecution of individuals who do not have a current MOT certificate for their vehicles.  [25136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 No specific guidance is given to the police. The requirement to have a current Ministry of Transport (MOT) certificate is backed up by some 320,000 roadside and other spot vehicle safety checks each year. The police work closely with the Vehicles Inspectorate in conducting these, and drivers or transport operators whose vehicles fail the most important standards are prosecuted as appropriate. In addition, the routine procedure of requiring drivers to produce their driving documents also identifies a large number of offences, including not having a valid MOT certificate. The police service is concerned for public safety in relation to this type of offence as many caught committing such an offence will be using unroadworthy and dangerous vehicles.
<P>

<a name="20116w19.html_para6">From January 2003, information from the computerised MOT database will begin to be available to the police via the Police National Computer. This will significantly improve the ability of the police to enforce the requirement for vehicles to be covered by a current MOT certificate.

 The information is not available in the format requested. Decisions to refuse entry to United Kingdom (UK) Citizens may depend on the type and date of any conviction and the reason for entry. Normal refusal may be overturned for compassionate reasons. The recommended action for travellers who have a drug conviction would be to check their admissibility with the UK embassy or high commission of the country they are planning to visit.

 The Rural Affairs Forum for England was set up to implement the Government's commitment in their Rural White Paper of December 2000 to establish a national sounding board so that Ministers "have regular and direct contact with the main rural groups so that they know what is going on and what countryside people think". It will be for the forum itself to define its priorities and agenda for action.
<P>

<a name="20116w20.html_para0">The forum met for the first time on 9 January. Following extensive consultation with rural stakeholders, its members were chosen to represent a wide range of rural organisations, people, and perspectives, including

economic, social and environmental interests. Each regional rural affairs forum will be represented on the national forum.
<P>

<a name="20116w20.html_para1">The forum had a useful preliminary discussion of its work programme at its first meeting and it is clear that the forum will wish to identify issues of concern to rural people and businesses; to give views on proposed Government policies as they affect rural areas; to review the implementation of the Rural White Paper, and suggest where further policy development may be needed to deliver its objectives; and to review the quality of public services in rural areas and make recommendations for how they might be improved.
<P>

<a name="20116w20.html_para2">The forum has agreed to some regular items of business, including consideration of the Countryside Agency's annual State of the Countryside report on its overview of Government Departments' reports on "rural-proofing" of their policies. It will also consider other issues that its members, Ministers or the rural advocate may raise. These may include matters referred to it by a regional rural affairs forum or by the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) Consultation Group. Reports from the forum will go to Ministers and to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Rural Renewal.

<a name="20116w20.html_para3">Members agreed that the full forum should normally meet four times a year, and set up sub-groups as needed. These are likely to involve a wider range of stakeholders than those directly represented on the forum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government maintain close links with the insurance industry to help ensure continued availability of affordable flood cover. There is an agreement among Association of British Insurers (ABI) member companies that they will continue to provide flood cover, except in exceptional circumstances, for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure, during 2001 and 2002. Cases where there is an alleged breach of this agreement have been referred by the hon. Member to the ABI for investigation. However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms. Also, the insurance industry is a competitive one and customers may need to shop around to obtain the best deal.
<P>

<a name="20116w20.html_para4">My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I met the ABI on 5 September to discuss our mutual aim of ensuring that affordable flood insurance cover continues to be generally available after December 2002. There have also been further meetings between officials and I expect to meet the ABI again reasonably soon.
<P>

<a name="20116w20.html_para5">Together with the flood defence operating authorities, we are reducing the risk of flooding and are communicating this to the insurance industry. We are reducing the risk through substantial increases in investment in flood and coastal defences (which now totals over &#163;400 million a year).

 Most people aged 60 and over in a specified qualifying week are entitled to a winter fuel payment. However, people living permanently in residential care homes or nursing homes who are receiving higher levels of income support are not entitled to winter fuel payments as they are already receiving public assistance with their care costs, which includes heating.

Other eligible people needed to make a claim.

 Combined pension forecasts are an important part of our commitment to provide individuals with better information about their pension position and the options available to them, in order to enable them to save for their retirement. Individuals are provided with a forecast of both their state and current private pension together for the first time. The statement is issued on a voluntary basis by the private sector provider, using state pension information supplied by the Department.

<P>

<a name="20116w21.html_para1">We have worked closely with a selection of private sector partners and conducted pilot exercises to inform the design and development of the service and learned valuable lessons on how best to present and support the service being offered to our mutual customer.
<P>

<a name="20116w21.html_para2">The service has been designed to ensure that it provides the right information in a way which individuals can easily interpret, is provided with their consent and that the data shared between the private/public sectors occurs in a controlled environment which does not add unnecessary overheads to the parties involved.

<P>

<a name="20116w21.html_para5">All employees earning above the lower earnings limit (&#163;66 per week in 1999&#150;2000) are members of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) unless they contract out into a personal or occupational pension. Therefore "all" full-time employees and part-time employees above earning over the lower earnings limit (above decile four) are accruing pension rights in the SERPS and/or are members of a private pension.
<P>

<a name="20116w21.html_para6">Furthermore, for 18 million low and moderate earners, carers and the disabled the introduction of the state second pension will significantly increase the amount of state pension they will become entitled to. This will boost the retirement income of approximately 65 per cent. of current full-time employees (those in deciles one to seven) and almost all current part-time employees above decile four.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Information is not recorded by the Family Resources Survey on those who have a pension scheme which they are not currently contributing to, nor which personal pension schemes are approved schemes. Therefore the figures show those not contributing to occupational or personal pensions.<P>





2. The deciles are calculated separately for full and part-time workers, and are of gross earnings. The separation between full-time and part-time workers is to make clear the behavioural similarities that exist between those in same deciles on the full-time and part-time scale, but who would be in different deciles were the data combined, due to their differing earning levels.<P>

3. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for region, council tax band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response. The information covers Great Britain.<P>

1. The information is derived from the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The NES provides the percentage of employees with access to the final salary occupational pension schemes and the LFS provides information on the overall number of public and private sector employees. Due to its sampling frame, the NES probably under represents relatively low paid and part-time staff. The LFS, like any sample survey, is subject to sampling error.<P>

2. NES estimates are collected on a workplace basis, from the employer. The LFS collects information on a residence basis from individuals. Research into commuting patterns has indicated that net levels of commuting to and from Scotland are not significant. <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The voluntary code of practice on age diversity in employment was launched in 1999 and the evaluation of its impact has now been completed. This evaluation will inform future plans for legislation in this area.
<P>

<a name="20116w23.html_para0">The report is the first comprehensive evaluation of employment-related age practices across Great Britain and the Government were pleased to publish it on 3 December 2001.

<a name="20116w23.html_para1">The report has identified that much progress has been made but that we must not be complacent in the lead up to legislation in 2006.

 Our reforms of bereavement benefits introduced in April 2001 concentrate the help available where and when it is needed most&#151;on immediate needs and on families with children. For the first time these benefits are available equally to both men and women. Immediate help with costs arising on bereavement is provided by a lump sum bereavement payment of &#163;2,000&#151;double the old widow's payment of &#163;1,000.

 Between March and October 2001, the Department received some 5,500 claims for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) in England, Scotland and Wales where people stated the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was the reason for their previous employment ending.

It has also kept us fully and regularly up to date with the initial difficulties being experienced with the launch of the online service owing to the unprecedented level of demand experienced in the first few days, and the steps that the PRO and its partner QinetiQ Ltd. are taking to resolve these difficulties. A limited online service is already available at the Family Records Centre, the Public Record Office at Kew and some other local libraries and archives.

<a name="20116w24.html_wqn5"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what mechanism is used to determine which Government documents are <i>(a)</i> retained within a department, <i>(b)</i> sent to the Public Record Office and <i>(c)</i> destroyed; and what estimate she has made for the last year for which figures are available of the percentage of documents falling into each category.  [27541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20116w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The mechanism for determining which Government documents should be sent to the Public Record Office originates from the Public Records Act 1958. Under sections 3(1) and 2(2), public records bodies (which includes Government Departments) are responsible for selection of those records which are to be permanently preserved. This process is carried out under the guidance, supervision and co-ordination of the Public Record Office.
<P>

<a name="20116w24.html_para0">The broad criteria governing selection are set out in the PRO's "Acquisition Policy", published in 1998, with more detailed criteria being set out in operational selection policies relating to particular themes or Departments. These are available on the PRO's website at www.pro.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/.
<P>

<a name="20116w24.html_para1">Records not selected for the PRO may be deposited in other archives that have been approved by the PRO under the Act as suitable places of deposit for public records.
<P>

<a name="20116w24.html_para2">The Public Records Act 1958 makes provision for Departments to retain records over 30-years-old for administrative purposes or other special reasons, subject to the approval of the Lord Chancellor. The White Paper "Open Government" (Cm 2290, 1993) defines the 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2002 : Column 389W</I><P>
grounds on which Departments may apply for permission to retain records. The Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on Public Records assesses the applications from Departments. Where applications for retention seem, either to the Advisory Council or to officials at the PRO, to be inappropriate, the items are referred back to the originating Department for further investigation. Once the Advisory Council is satisfied, a schedule of retention applications is passed to the Lord Chancellor for his signature.
<P>

<a name="20116w24.html_para3">Departments are responsible for destroying records which have not been selected for preservation in the Public Record Office or other places of deposit and which they do not require for continuing administrative purposes.
<P>

<a name="20116w24.html_para4">It is not possible to calculate precisely the percentages of records retained and destroyed because Departments are not required to report the overall quantity of records created. A study of records storage and management in Government, conducted jointly by the Public Record Office and Cabinet Office in 1997 ("Records Storage and Management, a Scoping Study"), estimated that on 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2002 : Column 390W</I><P>

<a name="20116w25.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The National Health Service Estates has written to all regional heads of estates, asking them to raise awareness of the potential of <i>aspergillus fumigatus</i> to cause infections within their Trusts. The letter gives advice on how to minimise the risk of <i>aspergillosis</i>, including detailed guidance on containment and reduction of spore numbers, particularly during demolition or extensive refurbishment. Guidance is given concerning those patients most likely to be at risk from <i>aspergillus</i> infection. Clinicians, infection control teams and estate teams are advised to undertake specific risk assessments and develop a co-ordinated strategy for ensuring that those at risk are not exposed to high levels of <i>aspergillus</i> spores when any new or refurbishment building work is undertaken.
<P>

<a name="20116w25.html_para4">This advice and guidance was reiterated in the publication "Quarterly Briefing", which is distributed to over 1,200 recipients, including chief executives of trusts and health authorities and trust estate directors.
<P>

<a name="20116w25.html_para5">Examples of the precautions that may need to be taken are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Erection of barriers impermeable to <i>aspergillus</i> spores between patient-care and construction areas to prevent dust from entering patient-care areas.
<P>

<P>
<BR>
Maintenance of negative pressure building work areas relative to adjacent patient-care areas unless there are contra-indications, clinical care or infection control requirements, for such pressure differential.
<P>
<BR>
Pedestrian traffic flow to be directed away from construction areas to prevent dust dispersion, entry of contaminated air or tracking of dust into patient areas.

Each pilot project will be evaluated and in the light of those evaluations, and the practical lessons learned, we will be able to properly assess the impact of those measures and what further measures will be needed.

We plan to invest an additional &#163;50 million per annum by 2003&#150;04. This total amount will match, on a national basis, the investment from the voluntary sector. The additional investment for specialist palliative care will be included in the overall increased investment for implementing the NHS Cancer Plan and will, therefore, be found from within health authority allocations.
