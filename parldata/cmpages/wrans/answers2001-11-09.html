<a name="11109w01.html_para0">The United Kingdom ratified the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) convention in December 1998 and a review of its legislation was published by the OECD in 2000. The Government's White Paper "Raising Standards and Upholding Integrity: the Prevention of Corruption", issued in June 2000 (Cm 4759), took account of that review and made two major proposals which reflect OECD recommendations:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason HMS Ocean has been recalled to the UK; if it is being sent to Devonport for repair; what the <i>(a)</i> nature and <i>(b)</i> cost is of the repair; and to what extent the repair is (i) planned maintenance and (ii) a consequence of failure while on its last operation.  [13127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Ocean is returning to the UK as part of the drawdown of forces following completion of Exercise Saif Sareea 2.
<P>

<a name="11109w01.html_para10">Due to current operational circumstances, the docking period planned for January next year has been deferred. HMS Ocean will, instead, return to Devonport for a shorter assisted maintenance period (AMP), during which some maintenance and defect rectification work will be carried out. The only repair work arising from failure during her last operation will be to some aviation fuel pumps. At this time it is estimated that the AMP will cost in the region of &#163;0.8 million to &#163;1 million.

 <i>[holding answer 7 November 2001]:</i> The limitations of the Clansman radio are well known, hence the current action on procuring a replacement. Information on failure rates of individual radios employed during Exercise Saif Sareea 2 is not available. But indications are that Clansman performed somewhat better than we might have expected during Saif Sareea 2, despite the harsh environmental conditions experienced during the exercise.

 The consultation process on the protection of military vessels, in particular, military maritime graves, ended in August. Following that consultation process it was decided that a small number of wrecks within UK jurisdiction, which are representative of all those lost, will be designated as controlled sites. This means that any activity within a controlled area will require a licence. All other military vessels which meet the criteria as set out in the consultation document, including those in international waters, will be designated as protected places. Those who contributed to the consultation process have been informed of this. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="11109w02.html_para0">We always maintain close liaison between US and UK forces. Lessons learned from operations are studied and refinements, where necessary, are made to the way our armed forces operate.

 Security of nuclear installations is a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry. The Royal Air Force has an established and well-practised air defence capability which is ready to detect, deter or destroy aircraft intending to attack any target within the UK, including nuclear installations. Adjustments have been made to our air defence posture since 11 September, but, for obvious reasons, I do not propose to go into detail on the nature of these changes.

 Personnel deploying on Exercise Saif Sareea 2 were not entitled to Local Overseas Allowances (LOA) or to concessions in lieu of them. Although neither a concession nor a substitute for LOA, a comprehensive Operational Welfare package was made available to deployed personnel. This was in accordance with my predecessor's announcement on 19 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 12, which covered the welfare arrangements for exercises lasting for two months or more. The package included shower and laundry facilities, 20 minutes of free telephone calls a week, access to free electronic aerograms and free e-mail, television, videos, DVDs, newspapers, books, sports equipment and a Combined Service Entertainment show.

 Cold weather payments provide extra help towards heating costs for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society in periods of exceptionally cold weather. Pensioners on low incomes are not the only people to benefit from the payments. They are also paid to people receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who have children under the age of five or who have a premium for disability or long-term sickness. We have no plans to change the eligibility conditions.

<P>
<a name="11109w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 These factors are under constant review as part of our on-going interest in teacher recruitment and retention. They are also kept under review by the School Teacher's Review Body, which makes recommendations to the Government on school teachers' pay and conditions. London area allowances increased by 30 per cent. in April this year, and schools have wide discretion to pay recruitment and retention allowances.
<P>

<a name="11109w03.html_para5">We are aware of the effect that high accommodation costs, especially in the south-east of England, has on the recruitment and retention of teachers. To help develop a solution, last year, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, in what was then the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, set out policies on home ownership, including proposals for a new initiative to help certain key public sector workers, including teachers, into low cost home ownership. The Government recently announced details of the starter home initiative, funded by &#163;250 million over the years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04. This scheme will benefit over 10,000 key public sector workers, including 3,500 teachers, helping them to buy homes in urban and rural areas where high prices would otherwise prevent them from living in or near to the communities they serve. Registered landlords, local authorities and other interested parties were invited to bid for a share of this funding.

 The Prime Minister has asked the social exclusion unit to make recommendations to reduce the number of young people running away and ensure that runaways' short and long term needs are met. Approximately 129,000 young people run away each year and one quarter sleep rough. Running away is also a strong predictor of later homelessness. The project will report its recommendations to the Ministerial Committee on Children and Young People at the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="11109w03.html_para6">The social exclusion unit report on rough sleeping published in 1998 found that there were very few rough sleepers aged under 18. None the less, it identified a range of measures specifically aimed at young people. Many of these have now been taken forward by the rough sleepers unit, set up in April 1999 as a result of the SEU report. Examples of this have been work on the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 and the setting up, in partnership with the Department of Health and funded by the National Children's Bureau, of a 'Care Leaving Support Service'.
<P>

<a name="11109w03.html_para7">In addition, part of the SEU report on the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal&#151;the Policy Action Team 12 on Young People&#151;looked at how Government could improve co-ordination of policies affecting children and young people and improve services, developing them to help prevent social exclusion. This led to the establishment of the children and young peoples unit in July 2000, based in the Department for Education and Skills. This unit supports cross-Government work on child poverty and youth disadvantage, looking across the full 0 to 19 age range, and is also responsible for implementing and managing the children's fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A great deal of epidemiological research has been conducted into the origins of this outbreak. The current epidemic has been caused by a specific strain of the foot and mouth virus (PanAsian Strain O) which has occurred in a number of countries around the world. The precise means of introduction of the virus is unknown and subject to continuing investigations, but is most likely to have been introduced in illegally imported meat or meat products. It would not be appropriate to comment further on the specific question of the source or sources of the outbreak until all investigations are complete.

 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2001]:</i> The Copenhagen charter is a set of principles that a group of European environment and consumer organisations believe should form part of a new European Union chemicals policy. The UK is working to ensure that the regulations which implement the EU Strategy achieve the improvements in protection of people and the environment that the Copenhagen charter seeks.
<P>

<a name="11109w05.html_para1">While the Government support the aims of the charter, we do have reservations about the practicality of some of its proposals. For example, we believe that a system which involved approving all uses of all chemicals should not delay action on the chemicals of most concern. The charter also does not take into account other issues that are important to the UK, such as the need to minimise the extra animal testing that will result from the EU Strategy.
<P>

<a name="11109w05.html_para2">The UK and other EU member states agreed a set of conclusions at the Environment Council in June which incorporated many of the elements of the Copenhagen charter. A copy of the Environment Council conclusions is available in the Library of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2001]:</i> Sole occupancy movement licences were introduced on 8 October to provide for the regular movement of livestock between premises in the same ownership and occupation within a maximum diameter of 20.0 kms. Licences are issued under the authority of the divisional veterinary manager only after an assessment by a local veterinary inspector. These arrangements were welcomed

<P>
<a name="11109w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has asked the Government to recognise and commit to meeting the need for a significant further increase in funding on a planned basis to (a) improve flood warnings and (b) maintain and improve the overall standard and extent of flood defence. This will be considered alongside other evidence through the Spending Review 2002 process. Current plans are for this Department's spending on flood and coastal defences for all operating authorities to increase from last year's outturn of &#163;66 million to &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

No agreement has yet been reached with Railtrack or with other private investors on the financing of station improvements, including platform extensions, but the investment is similarly likely to be recovered through access charges paid by the train operator.

 The agreement that the Government have reached with the authorities promoting the scheme provides for the public sector contribution to be shared between central Government and the authorities. This is in line with our general policy that about a quarter of the costs of a major public transport scheme of this kind should be met from local sources. The precise amounts involved will only be determined once the tendering process has been completed.

 We have received various representations from the air transport industry on all of these issues.

The initiative has subsequently been widely copied elsewhere and was recently extended until

<P>
<a name="11109w08.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 In September 1999 the Environment Agency published indicative floodplain maps using the best available current information. These were supplied to local authorities to inform the planning process and are updated annually. In December 2000 the Environment Agency placed these maps on the internet on their website www.environment-agency.gov.uk in the section entitled "What's in your backyard". Prospective home buyers can interrogate this site by postcode to see the area at flood risk. Further, more detailed information can be obtained by writing to the local Environment Agency area office.
<P>

<a name="11109w08.html_para5">Under the Government's proposals for sellers' packs, prospective buyers will be provided with key information about homes marketed for sale. Flood risk information is one of the items being considered for inclusion in the seller's pack. In the meantime, the Environment Agency is engaged in advanced discussions with the Law Society on making an 'Environment Agency Property Search Report', a standard part of the domestic and commercial conveyancing process in England and Wales. A pilot trial is running in North Wales and work is under way to extend this. Each Environment Agency report will include information on flood risk as well as other environmental data for which the agency has responsibility.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions which London-based organisations have received grants from <i>(a)</i> the single regeneration budget and <i>(b)</i> other sources to promote waste recycling in the past two years; and what the value was of grants in each case.  [13277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w08.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> Information on individual London-based organisations that received funding to promote waste recycling through the single regeneration budget is held by the SRB partnerships who distribute the funding. However, the London Development Agency, who are responsible for administering the SRB programme in London, have provided details of London SRB schemes that included waste management or recycling projects in their outputs in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01. These are at table A. In addition, a SRB round 6 scheme "Re-engineering Secondary Materials for Thames Gateway" was awarded &#163;5.4 million lifetime funding in summer 2000 but did not incur any project expenditure during 2000&#150;01. This is run by London Remade, a strategic partnership between waste management companies, statutory authorities, London boroughs and community organisations, with the principal objective of promoting new markets and secondary industries based on reprocessing and reuse of London's recyclable materials.
<P>

<a name="11109w08.html_para6">The Environmental Action Fund, operated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), is designed to help voluntary groups advance the Government's environmental policies to London- based organisations to promote recycling and raise awareness of waste management issues. Table B lists the grants that were issued during 1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="11109w08.html_para7">The Spending Review 2000 established a fund of &#163;140 million specifically for local authority waste management and recycling. DEFRA will be consulting shortly on proposals for the distribution and use of this fund.

<P>

<a name="11109w09.html_para3">Under the Children Act 1989, social services have a duty to assist any child under 16 who is in need. Monitoring by the rough sleepers unit by outreach workers shows there are very few under 18-year-olds sleeping rough. Children under 16 found on the streets by agencies, including police or homelessness workers, are helped from the streets and referred to social services. The social exclusion unit is currently leading an exercise looking at improving services available to young runaways.
<P>

<a name="11109w09.html_para4">Homeless acceptances represent households in need who are helped by local authorities into accommodation. The provisions of the Homelessness Bill will require housing authorities to take a more strategic, multi-agency approach to the prevention of homelessness and the rehousing of homeless households; ensure that everyone accepted by housing authorities as unintentionally homeless and in priority need must be provided with suitable accommodation until they obtain a settled housing solution; and allow housing authorities greater flexibility to assist non-priority homeless households, principally through a new power for housing authorities to secure accommodation for such households where they have the scope to do so.
<P>

<a name="11109w09.html_para5">To support these provisions, investment in new affordable housing through the Housing Corporation will rise to over &#163;1.2 billion by 2003&#150;04&#151;about double the current level.

<P>
<a name="11109w09.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government have recently consulted on proposals for a national strategy to tackle homelessness. A summary of responses will be placed on the DTLR internet site on 7 December. The consultation responses are being considered and the Government will announce their response in due course.
<P>

<a name="11109w09.html_para8">We have consulted on a draft order which would extend the groups of people who have a priority need for housing, under the homelessness legislation. This includes applicants who the local authority are satisfied are vulnerable as a result of an institutionalised background. We are considering the public consultation responses to the order, and will take decisions on implementation shortly. Guidance relating to the priority needs categories will be issued alongside the order.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many households living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation there were in the first quarter of <i>(a)</i> 1997 and <i>(b)</i> 2001; what plans he has to reduce this number; and what steps he is taking to ensure that this accommodation is of a reasonable standard.  [13761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w10.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There were 4,100 households in bed-and-breakfast accommodation at the end of the first quarter of 1997 and 10,830 in 2001. Over the next two years the newly established bed-and-breakfast unit will work with partners to reduce the need to place families in B and B. The unit will be hosting a conference on 20 November to consult on targets and actions for reducing B and B use.
<P>

<a name="11109w10.html_para0">Local authorities are required by law to ensure that any accommodation secured for people accepted as statutorily homeless is suitable. In considering whether accommodation is suitable, local authorities will need, among other factors, to have regard to whether it is of a reasonable standard. Statutory guidance issued by my Department also makes it clear that if authorities do have to use bed-and-breakfast accommodation they should ensure that the accommodation meets statutory standards for houses in multiple occupation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the commercial use by regional air services of private and military airports in the London area with runways of at least 1,800 metres.  [13692]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In 1998 my Department commissioned a three-part study of business aviation in the south-east. Part 1 (Demand and Capacity studies) was published in 1998 and Part 2 (The Economic impact of Business Aviation) in 1999. These reports cover a number of airports with runway lengths of at least 1,800 metres. Copies of both are available in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="11109w11.html_para0">Work on the final part of the study, Future Capacity for Business Aviation, has been subsumed into the on-going South East and East of England Regional Air Services Study (SERAS). The study will include an assessment of the contribution that smaller airports might make to short haul and domestic services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The DTLR has received a proposal from the Scottish Executive outlining the case for the imposition of a public service obligation on the Inverness to London route. This proposal is being analysed by the DTLR, while taking European Regulation 2408/92 into account. Informal discussions at ministerial level about protection for this route have taken place. In addition, DTLR and Scottish Executive officials recently met to discuss the proposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The standards for younger adults will be introduced on 1 April 2002, when the National Care Standards Commission starts work. Some of the more challenging standards will not be implemented until some time after that for existing providers to be given realistic timescales in which to meet new standards.

 The Department has received 500 responses to the younger adult and adult placement standards and is in the process of reviewing the standards in the light of the comments that have been received. A summary of these findings will be made available in due course.

[9501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The recent decision by the High Court has no implications for anyone infected with hepatitis C before the Consumer Protection Act came into force in March 1988. This includes the vast majority of haemophiliacs who were probably infected before that date.

 In 2000&#150;01, 65,712 women underwent cervical screening in Leicestershire health authority.

<a name="11109w11.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many pilot areas there are in England for cervical screening; and what the time scale is for these pilots;  [10582]

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The pilot of liquid based cytology (LBC) and human papilloma virus testing as triage for women with mild or borderline abnormalities is taking place at three sites; Newcastle, Norfolk and Norwich, and North Bristol. The pilot began in April 2001. The LBC arm of the pilot is being evaluated from October 2001, and results of the evaluation are expected in 2002.
<P>

<a name="11109w11.html_para1">ThinPrep and AutoCyte Prep were the only liquid based slide preparation systems available at the time the pilot was developed. ThinPrep is being used at two of the sites, and AutoCyte prep at the third site. The evaluation of the pilot will gather data on the effectiveness of both systems.
<P>

<a name="11109w11.html_para2">The NHS cancer plan set out the commitment that if evaluation of the pilot is successful we will fund the introduction of LBC across the national health service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew11"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The cost of treating different patients varies by the type of treatment they receive. The elements of the total cost incurred depend upon the individual components and treatments within the care pathway for that patient. For cervical cancer, a hysterectomy might be performed (&#163;1,861 average cost for elective in-patient in 1999&#150;2000) and/or a course of radiotherapy undertaken, which would vary dependent on the type and classification of the type of cancer involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w11.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department does not collect figures on the cost of national health service services in a way that enables an accurate figure to be calculated for the cost of or investment in a particular disease.
<P>

<a name="11109w11.html_para4">We made available an additional &#163;280 million in 2001&#150;02 for the development of cancer services. This will rise to &#163;407 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;570 million in 2003&#150;04. Local health authorities and primary care trusts, with cancer networks, are responsible for determining local priorities in implementing the NHS cancer plan.

 The available United Kingdom evidence on the extent of abuse among disabled children suggests that disabled children are at increased risk of abuse, and that the presence of multiple disabilities appears to increase the risk of both abuse and neglect.

<a name="11109w11.html_para8">That is why the Department funded, in partnership with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, a second training resource pack entitled "Turning Points". It is also why in our "Working Together to Safeguard Children" child protection guidance and in the practice guidance and training pack underpinning the "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families" we have been careful to refer to this evidence base and to the need for particular attention to be paid to promoting a high level of awareness of the risks to this group of children and to high standards of practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> The NHS plan stated there would be 7,500 more consultants in post in 2004 than in 1999. By September 2000, the number of consultants in post had already increased by 1,100 to around 24,300. The national health service is currently drawing up plans by specialty to deliver the rest of the increase, a further 6,400 posts by 2004, which will be targeted towards the key specialties needed to deliver the commitments in the NHS plan. Information for the year to September 2001 will be available in February 2002.

 The guidance on free nursing care in nursing homes was published on 25 September. This, and the accompanying directions to the national health service, set out the arrangements for health authorities and primary care trusts to carry out determinations of registered nursing care contribution (RNCC) for those eligible for free nursing care from 1 October. They should use their best endeavours to ensure that these are completed by the end of December and should agree the arrangements for making payments to nursing homes in respect of self-funding residents with effect from 1 October. The guidance also emphasised the need to process invoices from nursing homes as promptly as possible.
<P>

<a name="11109w13.html_para1">A survey carried out over the summer by the Department revealed that there were over 42,000 people in nursing homes responsible for funding their own care. While a small number of determinations were planned to take place before 1 October, the vast majority will have taken place after then.
<P>

<a name="11109w13.html_para2">The guidance acknowledges that, in some cases, individuals will be identified through the assessment and RNCC process who have exceptional long term needs for nursing care, both in amount and type, that do not meet local criteria for NHS continuing health care. The national health service has a similar responsibility to arrange or fund the services that individuals in nursing homes need as they would if they were receiving treatment in any other setting.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many nurses will be required in England and Wales to assess patients' eligibility for free nursing care;  [13157]
<P>
(3) who, other than a state registered nurse, will be <i>(a)</i> involved in and <i>(b)</i> responsible for determining whether a patient is eligible for free nursing care;  [13159]
<P>
(4) how many nurses will be <i>(a)</i> involved in and <i>(b)</i> responsible for determining each patient's eligibility for free nursing care.  [13160]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w13.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 A programme of nurse training began in every region of England at the beginning of September and, by the end of October, a total of approximately 800 nurses had received training in carrying out the registered nursing care contribution (RNCC). The training lasted a full day and was supported by a practitioner guide published by the Department.

<P>

<a name="11109w13.html_para3">Apart from these national health service nurses, the guidance on free nursing care in nursing homes sets out the roles of lead nurses and nursing home co-ordinators who will also be involved in the process for implementing free nursing care. In some cases, nurses employed by nursing homes may also be involved in the determination. A single nurse will usually carry out the RNCC unless the individual has specific and special needs. In certain cases, a separate continence assessment may need to be carried out by a continence adviser at a later date.

<a name="11109w13.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Burns: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reasons those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's are not eligible for free nursing care.  [13242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w13.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Anyone currently in a nursing home with a need for care from a registered nurse and who is paying towards that care should have it paid for by the national health service following a determination carried out by an NHS nurse under the arrangements for free nursing care introduced on 1 October. This applies equally to those with Alzheimer's disease and dementia as it does to other conditions.

 Euro notes and coins will be introduced on 1 January 2002. They will replace national notes and coins in the 12 countries that participate in the single currency. We estimate that in 2002 British citizens will make 40 million visits to those countries. So I am today launching a leaflet that provides basic factual information for UK travellers on the transition to euro notes and coins in the relevant countries. Copies of the leaflet have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 An effective single passport for issuers was identified as a priority for completion of the single European market in financial services at the Lisbon Council in spring 2000. The UK Government's policy is that the prospectus directive should achieve this goal; and that it meets the aim of reducing the cost of raising capital for EU companies, especially SMEs.

<P>

<a name="11109w16.html_para1">The directive, as currently drafted, could lead to an increase in the disclosure costs of issuers, and an increase in the cost to UK businesses of accessing capital by issuing securities. However, negotiations are at an early stage, and there are a number of issues that are as yet unclear, such as the directive's relationship with other existing directives, and the way that its provisions will be used. As the negotiations continue, the likely impact of the directive will be kept under close review.

It imposes obligations on member states to respond to requests from other member states for information on bank accounts in the context of criminal investigations. There is a further obligation to establish the ability to monitor transactions within a specified account or accounts. Consideration is taking place as to the practical implications of this draft instrument for the banks and others.

<a name="11109w17.html_para2">Article 50 of the convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 relates only to assistance in the investigation of fiscal and excise offences. It is therefore of narrower scope, and will be superseded by this instrument when it comes into force.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what sources of funding are available to enable young people with special educational needs to participate in international sporting events.  [10542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> At present, the main source of funding to athletes with a disability is provided by UK Sport through its World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) for elite athletes. Young people with special educational needs may be eligible for world class funding, provided they are named members of a national governing body's world class performance plan.




<P>
<P><I>9 Nov 2001 : Column: 493W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para3">Funding is available within each sport's WCPP award for athletes to compete in a programme of international sporting events. These events usually include World Championships, European Championships and any other international events considered to be an important competitive opportunity for the athlete.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para4">The athletes nominated on the WCPP receive individual support through their athlete personal awards. There are learning disability athletes included in two world class performance programmes&#151;swimming and athletics. At present there are five athletes in athletics and six in swimming with learning disabilities. These athletes receive APAs and have access to funding to cover the costs of attending major international competitions, agreed with the performance and technical directors of the sports, within an agreed programme of events for the individuals and the squad.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para5">As part of the world class funding initiatives, Sport England provides the world class start and potential programmes. These are designed to identify and nurture young athletes so they can receive the best possible training and services to enable them to achieve future success. The programmes aim to assist athletes with genuine hopes of success in the future.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para6">Both UK Sport and Sport England have prioritised paralympic competitors for world class funding. Therefore, funds for non-paralympic sports are limited and rely on the network of volunteers and charitable organisations that exist throughout the country.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para7">The Sports Aid Foundation gives awards of &#163;500 to individual athletes nominated by national disability sports organisations who are of international standard although not included on the world class performance programme. The award is intended for domestic training costs but may be used for international travel events if applicable.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para8">Individual governing bodies of sport directly fund athletes and teams to take part in international events. For example, the Football Association funds the England learning disability team and covers costs associated with squad training and major competitions. UK Sport also provides core funding to UK National Disability Sport Organisations such as the UK Sports Association for People with Learning Disability.

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister of State for the Arts represented the UK at the Culture and Audiovisual Council.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para10">The Commission presented a communication on the legal aspects of film and audiovisual works which clarified the application of state aid rules in the film and audiovisual sector, and proposed further studies on the legal deposit of audiovisual works, registration of films and a rights-holders database. The Commission also presented a communication on the application of rules on state aids to public service broadcasting which clarified what the Commission expects of member states.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para11">Resolutions were adopted on: encouraging the development of the EU audiovisual sector; the role of culture in a knowledge society, including the need to take advantage of new technologies to increase access to the EU's cultural heritage; a report on the exportation of cultural goods and the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from a member state; and the role of culture in the development of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para12">During a public debate on the role of culture in European development the UK emphasised the importance of culture in promoting social inclusion, cultural diversity and community cohesion, and reinforced the significant economic impact of the creative industries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when the Government will fulfil their obligations under the treaty of Amsterdam to define the role of public sector broadcasting.  [13223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w17.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The treaty of Amsterdam does not impose an obligation to define the remit of public service broadcasters and the interpretative protocol introduced by the treaty makes it clear that such a definition is a matter for member states. In its recent communication on the application of state aid rules to public service broadcasting, the European Commission considers that it is necessary to establish an official definition of the public service remit. The Government believe that the existing broadcasting legislation and licensing system and, in the case of the BBC, the Corporation's Charter and Agreement, clearly set out the remit for United Kingdom public service broadcasters.

 The "i2i" Audiovisual Initiative will make funding of approximately 600 million euros available to the European audiovisual industry over the next few years. The initiative was launched by the European Commission, the European investment bank and the European investment fund in December 2000 and will support a wide range of activities, including production and distribution. Support will be in the form of loans for medium and long-term investments in infrastructure (such as studios); production of film packages and distribution; global loans to the banking sector specialising in audiovisual matters to fund small firms which create or use audiovisual technology and shareholdings in risk-capital funds specialising in the audiovisual sector.
<P>

<a name="11109w17.html_para13">The EU's Media Plus programme runs from 2001 to 2005 and will provide funding of 400 million euros to the European audiovisual industry. At the outset of the programme just over 200 million euros was earmarked for distribution. Media Plus does not provide support for production but is aimed at supporting training, development, promotion and pilot projects, as well as distribution. The "i2i" Audiovisual Initiative has, in part, been developed to complement the Media Plus programme in respect of production.

 A total of 17,120 applications were received for consideration under the regulations of overstayers scheme. Of these 858 applications have so far been decided. Work is under way to validate the status of cases currently under consideration, though early indications are that there are now 4,300 cases in action within the integrated casework directorate. The remaining 12,000 cases are awaiting action.

The resources allocated will be monitored closely as details emerge of the complexity of these cases and the productivity of this team. A target date of April 2002 has been set for the identification and consideration of cases where leave to remain can be granted under existing policy concessions. During the next financial year (2002&#150;03) more caseworkers and resources will be devoted to the consideration of the remaining cases. The target date for the consideration of all cases is April 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prosecutions have taken place <i>(a)</i> for acts intended or likely to stir up racial hatred under sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Public Order Act 1986 and <i>(b)</i> under the Race Relations Act 1976; how many convictions resulted; and what were the (i) minimum and (ii) maximum sentences imposed.  [12659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11109w18.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The available information, provided by the Attorney-General's Office, relates to England and Wales for the years 1988 to date and is contained in the table. This relates to the number of applications for consent to prosecute for each year and the number of convictions resulting from the prosecutions. The whole of Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 is covered in the table, therefore including section 23 in addition to those sections requested.
<P>

<a name="11109w18.html_para1">The records relate to the year that the application for consent to prosecute was dealt with and so it is not possible to state with any certainty how many prosecutions resulted in convictions in any given year. Also, there are no centrally held records that can provide reliable information as to the minimum and maximum sentence imposed in any given year.
<P>

<a name="11109w18.html_para2">The Race Relations Act 1976 no longer includes provision for prosecuting offences of incitement to racial hatred, this having been transferred to Part III of the Public Order Act 1986.
