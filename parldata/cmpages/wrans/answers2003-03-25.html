<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_wqn0"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assessment he has made of changes to traffic levels on the Lancing to Worthing section of the A27 since the publication of the last Inspector's report recommending a by-pass;  [104951]
<P>
<UL>(2) what level of priority he attaches to providing a by-pass for the Lancing to Worthing stretch of the A27; and when it will feature in future planned works.  [104952]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The problem of traffic congestion on the Lancing to Worthing stretch of the A27 was the subject of detailed analysis as part of the South Coast Multi Modal Study (SoCoMMS). Assessment of past and future traffic levels in this section was undertaken as part of the SoCoMMS work and the Worthing Lancing Integrated Transport Study. We are currently considering the recommendations of the SoCoMMS study, as put to us by the Regional Assembly, with a view to making decisions on the way ahead in the near future.

<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_wqn1"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what improvements to traffic flow <i>(a)</i> have been made in the last five years and <i>(b)</i> are planned for the Lancing to Worthing section of the A27; and if he will provide relevant supporting figures.  [104953]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In June 2001 the A27 Worthing Transport Study, commissioned by the Government Office for the South East, identified small scale local solutions to address the problems in the A27 trunk road corridor through Worthing and Lancing.
<P>

<a name="30325w01.html_para0">As a result of this report the Highways Agency intends to implement a series of improvements along the A27 corridor as part of a short term strategy including traffic calming of local roads and enhancements for users of public transport, walkers and cyclists.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what <i>(a)</i> research his Department has conducted and <i>(b)</i> action has been taken related to the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the air industry.  [104484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department has not carried out any specific research into severe acute respiratory syndrome as this is a public health issue. My Department would advise travellers that although no restrictions on travel are currently being recommended, they should be aware of the symptoms and seek urgent medical advice should they develop them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what research has been conducted into the link between ill-health from infection and travelling by plane; and if he will make a statement;  [104487]
<P>
<UL>(2) what role the unit for addressing health issues affecting air passengers and crew announced by his Department on 6 March will have in examining the relationship between ill-health from infection and travelling by plane; what other work is <i>(a)</i> being conducted and <i>(b)</i> planned into this relationship; and if he will make a statement.  [104485]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Research by Building Research Establishment (BRE) Ltd., commissioned by my Department and the Department of Health and entitled the "Study of possible effects on health of aircraft cabin environments&#151;Stage 2", reviewed the published research on the transmission of infection and listed the papers of significance.
<P>

<a name="30325w01.html_para1">The Aviation Health Unit, announced on 6 March and to be based at Gatwick, will become a centre of expertise on health issues affecting air passengers and crew. The unit will be involved in reviewing the BRE recommendations on infection and travelling by aircraft and will propose appropriate further research as needed.

<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what <i>(a)</i> legislation and <i>(b)</i> regulations govern travel by people with suspected infectious ill-health (i) from and within the UK and (ii) arriving in the UK on board aircraft;  [104504]
<P>
<UL>(2) what <i>(a)</i> legislation there is and <i>(b)</i> measures are taken to prevent travellers with suspected infectious ill-health from travelling (i) from the UK and (ii) to the UK on board aircraft.  [104486]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1979 (S.I. 1979/1434) require the commander of an incoming aircraft to notify the port health authority at the first port of landing if the crew become aware that there is a person on board who is suffering from, or has symptoms which may indicate the presence of, an infectious disease. In the case of outgoing aircraft on an international flight, the medical officer at the airport may examine any person who proposes to embark if he has reasonable grounds for believing him to be suffering from a disease subject to the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organisation (ie cholera, plague, smallpox and yellow fever) and must prohibit his embarkation if he shows symptoms of such a disease. In addition, an airline may, under the terms of its Conditions of Carriage, refuse boarding to any passenger if they consider his mental or physical state is a danger to himself, the aircraft or any person in it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many names and addresses of vehicle <i>(a)</i> owners and <i>(b)</i> keepers have been disclosed over the last two years by the DVLA to a third party by virtue of that party showing reasonable cause for the disclosure; and if he will make a statement on (i) the number of cases where disclosure was made but was subsequently shown to be not for a reasonable cause and (ii) the action taken in such cases.  [104522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The DVLA vehicle register is a record of vehicle keepers&#151;the person responsible for paying vehicle excise duty. It does not contain details of the person who actually owns the vehicle. The number of 'reasonable cause' enquiries resulting in the disclosure of keeper details during the last two years is as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the total length of the motorway was that the Commission for Integrated Transport found

<P><I>25 Mar 2003 : Column 117W</I><P>
would be the main area of congestion charging as defined on page 35 of 'Paying for Road Use: Technical report February 2002'; if he will list the junctions of the motorway network that would define the main areas of charging; and if he will make a statement.  [102874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As the technical report prepared for the Commission for Integrated Transport indicates, their consultants' central case, on the modelling assumptions adopted, implies that charging would apply to about 10 per cent. (some 350 kms) of the motorway network. The report indicates the areas where the charge would apply, but does not identify specific junctions. CfiTs reports are produced independently of the Department and do not represent Government policy.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking him to list the ten stretches of motorways in England experiencing the most congestion.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency uses long-established modelling techniques to assess road network congestion, and to forecast future congestion depending upon a range of traffic growth and transport infrastructure investment assumptions. A traditional output of this work is a three-banded "stress map" indicating those parts of the network that are experiencing peak and off-peak congestion. The latest available version of the map estimating the effect of congestion was published in the Ten Year Plan for Transport.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This modelling method is not designed to rank individual motorway links within the congestion bandings. To obtain a measure of congestion on individual motorway links consistent with most congestion indicators, it would be necessary to measure journey times and speeds as they vary hour-by-hour and day-by-day. Regular network-wide measurement of journey times at this level of detail has not been carried out in the past, mainly because of the extremely high costs that would be involved. However, the opening of the Traffic Control Centre next year will greatly improve our knowledge of traffic conditions and will lead to comprehensive information on journey times and speeds being made generally available to the travelling public.</FONT></UL>

 In deciding applications for goods vehicle operators' licences, Traffic Commissioners are able to take into account the effect on the local environment which may result from the use of land as an operating centre. Factors may include noise, fumes, pollution, vibration and visual intrusion. We have no plans to review these criteria. Local traffic authorities and planning authorities are responsible for dealing with the wider environmental impact of traffic on local communities.

 The estimated total cost of the DfT website (www.dft.gov.uk) from 1 June 2002 to 31 March 2003 is &#163;752,000. This includes staff costs, development and HTML conversion costs. It also includes the capital costs of developing a new website, which aims to provide my Department with an improved more customer-focused website in terms of design, navigation and information retrieval. The new website, which is under development, accounts for 70 per cent. of total costs.

 We are committed to introducing the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).

The modernisation of the line is therefore being taken forward with protection provided by the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), as originally planned and now installed, with additional protection at higher speed junctions.

 Iraq used chemical weapons against its own people in the attack on Halabja in 1988. There are allegations that Iraq has used chemical weapons on other occasions. Given the circumstances in Iraq, Halabja is the only attack on Iraqi civilians which we have been able to verify beyond any doubt.

<a name="30325w05.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Under long-standing formal agreements with our European partners, we are only permitted to introduce reduced rates of VAT for a prescribed list of goods and services set out in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive. Independently certified wood products are not currently among the items included on this list. The provisions for VAT reduced rates are to be reviewed by the European Commission during 2003. We will consider any potential changes to these provisions in due course in the context of this review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The term "ordinarily resident" is not new. It is used for working families tax credit now and will be carried forward for working tax credit and child tax credit from April 2003. As part of the alignment of the rules for child benefit with those for the new tax credits, the same test is to be applied to new claims for child benefit after 6 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30325w05.html_para1">The term "ordinarily resident" has been the subject of previous judicial interpretation and its meaning is well established. Essentially, it means that the person must have their settled home in the United Kingdom. For the vast majority of claimants, it will be obvious that their settled home is in the United Kingdom. For those with more complex circumstances, the Inland Revenue will ask any follow-up questions necessary to establish whether or not they are entitled to child benefit.
<P>

<a name="30325w05.html_para2">Detailed guidance on the new residence rules for child benefit will be available on the Inland Revenue's website and from the Child Benefit Office (Customer Services) before the new rules come into force.

 The Treasury does not provide any cr&#232;che facilities.

The cost per child per day is &#163;30 and the Treasury subsidises the costs for its staff by 60 per cent. Around 10 members of staff take up places for their children.

<P>
<a name="30325w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There is no statutory definition of employment or self-employment for income tax, national insurance, tax credits or VAT. The courts have considered the question on many occasions and have indicated the kind of factors which need to be taken into account in deciding whether a particular engagement is one of employment or self-employment. The common 



<P>

thread running through the case law is that no single factor is conclusive; for each engagement the whole picture needs to be looked at in the light of all the facts.
<P>

<a name="30325w06.html_para0">The Inland Revenue interprets the courts' views consistently for the purposes of determining employment status for tax, national insurance and tax credits. Where the Inland Revenue has advised on a person's status that determination will usually apply for all three purposes. Customs and Excise generally follow the same interpretation and thus a consistent determination would apply for VAT purposes also.

 No special arrangements are in place for the payment of national insurance contributions (NICs) for supermarket employees. Like all employees, their employer deducts NICs from earnings of &#163;89 or more. These contributions are paid to the Inland Revenue and recorded on the individual's national insurance account, providing entitlement to state pension and other contributory benefits.

 The European Community does not have exclusive competence for economic and social cohesion. As a result, under the rule of subsidiarity, the Community's actions in this area should be limited to what cannot sufficiently be achieved by the member states. The principle of subsidiarity is set out in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. EU regional funding and policies under the EU Framework for Devolved Regional Policy as proposed in the Government's paper "A Modern Regional Policy for the United Kingdom" would have a legal base in Article 161 and other relevant articles of the same Treaty.

 There are no emergency measures in place. Instead, the Reserve Forces Act 1996 introduced a system of payments to ameliorate the impact of call-out on reservists.

In addition, a reservists whose military salary is less than his civilian earnings may apply for financial assistance. This consists of a Standard Award that makes up the difference (within banded limits related to rank) between civilian and military salaries. If this is insufficient to avert serious financial difficulties, a reservist can also apply for a Hardship Award to cover essential outgoings such as mortgage repayments, school fees, or childcare costs.

 The requested information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30325w08.html_para3">As at 18 March, 8,005 call-out notices had been issued, with 5,828 reservists having reported to their mobilisation point. 5,040 had been accepted into service. The overall requirement for reservists stands at 5,622.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the <i>(a)</i> recommended and <i>(b)</i> average times are between reservists being called up for duty and their arrival at the designated mobilisation centre.  [104680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w08.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Notice to report for compulsory call-out is set by operational requirements. Ideally, we would aim to give reservists 21 days notice to report for service. However, we cannot always achieve this and for Operation TELIC generally we were only able to give 14 days notice to report. We acknowledge that in some instances notice to report was considerably shorter, in the main this was due to postal problems or short notice changes in requirement.

<a name="30325w08.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the <i>(a)</i> recommended time is and <i>(b)</i> average time has been between reservists' arrival at their designated mobilisation centre and their deployment.  [104671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The time spent by Reservists at their designated mobilisation centre/unit before deployment is dependent on the training they require. The length of training is determined by the role of the Reservist and the operation they are to support.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w08.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what counselling and support services are available to the partners and families of reservists who have been called up for action in any of the the armed forces; and what plans there are to extend existing counselling and support services to cater for the partners and families of reservists who have been called up for action in the armed forces.  [104677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w08.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Reservists are provided with information on the counselling and support services which are available to their partners and families when they receive their call-out notice. All existing welfare systems that are available for Regular service personnel and their families are available to Reservists. In addition, with the Reservist's permission, we maintain contact with their employers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w11.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received concerning the Detention and Training Order sentencing policy; what measures he will take to punish juvenile offenders who commit less than &#163;6,000 of damage; and if he will make a statement.  [104345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w11.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 I have received no recent representations about the Detention and Training Order, (DTO), the main custodial sentence for young people aged 12 to 17. For criminal damage of &#163;5,000 or more a DTO sentence may be imposed. For damage of any scale in custodial establishments, the Prison Service and Youth Justice Board have developed a joint reward and sanctions strategy. This emphasises increased use of incentives, which can encourage positive behaviour and be withdrawn when negative behaviour is displayed. Most Young Offender Institutions have privilege schemes that are linked to sentence plans as well as institutional rules. For criminal damage of &#163;5,000 or more a DTO sentence may be imposed. Where punishment is needed, this can include stoppage of earnings, restrictions on association and recreation, extra work and removal from normal Section.

<a name="30325w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Ellman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is on detaining the head of household in a detention centre in order to ensure that remaining members of the family abide by conditions; and when this policy was decided.  [104600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w11.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 March 2003]:</i> There is no policy which directs that a head of household should be detained, but neither is there anything to prevent this where it is considered appropriate. Use of detention is an operational matter, is used only as a last resort, and is decided according to the circumstances of each individual case.

<a name="30325w11.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Staff Shortages (Holloway Prison)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w11.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many teaching hours have been cancelled at Holloway Prison over the last 12 months owing to staff shortages.  [103953]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w11.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The number of education hours cancelled at Holloway from February 2002 to January 2003 was 4,564.25 hours from a total ordered provision of 18,587.75 hours (approximately 25 per cent.). The loss of hours was due to a combination of staff shortages and operational requirements to staff hospital escorts, particularly bed-watches.
<P>

<a name="30325w11.html_para4">Although Holloway still suffers from staff shortages, a re-profiling exercise has been held resulting in a new staff profile of 220 officers to deliver an appropriate regime. At the end of December 2002, the shortfall of staff at Holloway was 46.5 officers, which had reduced to 37.5 on 19 March 2003. A further, 10 to 15 staff from the most recent recruitment campaign are expected to be in post by the end of May. It is anticipated that Holloway will have a near full complement by late summer 2003. With a full complement of staff, Holloway aims to deliver a full programme of education to women prisoners subject to daily operational requirements.

<P>
<a name="30325w12.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Juvenile regimes are designed to promote and maintain good behaviour, and to discourage anti-social activity. They are intended to provide a full, purposeful and active day, with 30 hours a week purposeful activity, focusing on education, training and personal development.
<P>

<a name="30325w12.html_para5">More specifically, each juvenile establishment has a rewards and sanctions scheme; a system of adjudications for breaches of discipline; an anti-bullying strategy; and a personal officer scheme which assigns a member of staff to each young person on induction to act as contact point with outside agencies and family and, through example, to act as a positive influence on the young person's attitude and behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30325w12.html_para6">Prison officers have a key role to play in the delivery of the regimes and in preventing anti-social behaviour, and they will be assisted in that role by effective training and management. Governors of juvenile establishments are required to ensure that every member of staff taking up post receives, at an early stage, suitable training for working with juveniles. A team is currently being set up within Prison Service headquarters to support Governors in fulfilling that responsibility and to help improve the quality and delivery of training across the juvenile estate, both for prison officers and managers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications for naturalisation as a British citizen have been outstanding for <i>(a)</i> more than 13 months, <i>(b)</i> more than 18 months and <i>(c)</i> more than two years; and what the nationalities are of the applicants whose applications have been outstanding for over 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w12.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the relationship between prisoner numbers and self-inflicted deaths in prison and <i>(b)</i> measures to prevent suicides and self-harm by offenders under the supervision of the Probation Service with particular reference to those living in probation hostels.  [104217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w12.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There are many reasons why a prisoner may self-harm or attempt suicide; the general prison population contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm. It is likely that the number of self-inflicted deaths is rising because of a combination of the effects of increased prisoner throughout and an increasingly risk-laden population.
<P>

<a name="30325w12.html_para8">The current operating environment is very challenging because of more prisoners being remanded to prison and greater movement of prisoners. This puts a strain on resources and makes it harder to prevent suicides. Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. The Prison Service's approach, in close partnership with other agencies such as the Youth Justice Board, and outside organisations such as Samaritans, is to better identify and support those who seem at greatest risk, with a stress on relationships, care and the physical environment. The Prison Service's suicide prevention and self-harm reduction programme includes a series of projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements. It also includes the exchange of information; the care of prisoners; detoxification; prisoners supporting each other, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.
<P>

<a name="30325w12.html_para9">With regard to approved probation and bail hostels, the National Probation Service last year brought in strengthened reporting requirements on deaths of residents. They are also currently developing a national suicide and self-harm awareness and prevention strategy for staff in hostels, which will strengthen existing local procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures she has taken to ensure that sportsmen and women in Northern Ireland who wish to compete as British competitors receive funding from the National Lottery; what measures she has taken to ensure that sportsmen and women in Northern Ireland who wish to compete on behalf of the Republic of Ireland do not receive funding from the National Lottery; and if she will list the occasions when funding from the National Lottery has been used to assist in the development of sport in a foreign country.

 National Lottery funding for Northern Ireland athletes who wish to compete as British competitors is available through UK Sport's World Class Performance Programme (WCPP). The criteria for the inclusion of an athlete from Northern Ireland on 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2003 : Column 164W</I><P>
the WCPP is the same as that for an athlete from any of the four home countries. Inclusion is based on sporting performance and future medal prospects.
<P>

<a name="30325w14.html_para7">An athlete may have the option to compete for All-Ireland or for UK/GB. Where an athlete chooses to compete for All-Ireland, he/she would not receive funding from the UK programme.
<P>

<a name="30325w14.html_para8">In addition, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland also provides National Lottery support to athlete development in Northern Ireland through Programmes such as Talented Athlete, Talented Athlete Next Generation and Talented Junior. This funding is provided for training and preparation for competition to enable the athletes to qualify for a variety of high profile tournaments eg the Olympic Games, the European Championships and the Commonwealth Games. As far as the Olympics and European Championships are concerned, athletes have a choice about which country they represent, either Great Britain or Ireland, and the choice often depends on the constitution of the Governing Body to which they are affiliated.
<P>

<a name="30325w14.html_para9">However, all athletes in receipt of funding ultimately represent Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games, if selected.
<P>

<a name="30325w14.html_para10">In accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, under which the British and Irish Governments recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland seeks to ensure that the structures of sport in Northern Ireland provide an equal and equitable opportunity to all to participate in a sport of their choice, for a country of their choice.
<P>

<a name="30325w14.html_para11">Normally, UK Sport Lottery funding is confined to supporting the goal of "winning athletes" and the bidding for and staging of world class events in the United Kingdom. The UK Sport Council agreed to make a Lottery award in support of the joint bid by Scotland and Ireland to bid for the UEFA Euro 2008 Championships. It was agreed that it would be counter-productive to attempt to confine UK Sport's Lottery funding to just the Scottish element of that bid. This is the only example of its kind.

 The 25 pence age addition for state pensioners aged 80 and over was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1971.
<P>

<a name="30325w15.html_para1">The age addition will be maintained, but on its own it is not the most cost-effective way to help elderly pensioners. We have gone much further.
<P>

<a name="30325w15.html_para2">We have introduced measures which, from October 2003, will mean that the poorest third of pensioner households will have gained over &#163;1,500 a year in real terms.
<P>

<a name="30325w15.html_para3">We have introduced free TV licences from age 75 worth over &#163;100 a year, winter fuel payments of &#163;200 per year for eligible households paid to some 11 million people in 8 million households, and the minimum income guarantee which means that no single pensioner has to live on less than &#163;102.10 and no couple on less than &#163;155.80 from April.
<P>

<a name="30325w15.html_para4">We are going further still with the introduction of pension credit from October 2003.

<P>
<a name="30325w15.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have taken powers in the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 to strengthen benefit fraud investigation and punish persistent offenders more severely. The provision to sanction people convicted of two separate benefit fraud offences in a three-year period, known as the 'two-strikes provision', came into force on 1 April 2002. This provision can only be applied to people who have committed, and then been convicted for, two separate benefit offences after that date.
<P>

<a name="30325w15.html_para9">Information on the number of people who were convicted of benefit fraud and who had one or more previous convictions for benefit fraud is recorded only from April 2002. However, our research suggests that prior to April 2002 approximately five per cent. of prosecutions involved a person with a previous conviction for benefit fraud.
<P>

<a name="30325w15.html_para10">By 28 January 2003, our records showed that four people had been convicted of benefit fraud on two separate occasions since April 2002. In two of these cases, one or more of the offences had occurred before 1 April 2002, so the 'two strikes' legislation does not apply. In the third case, sanctionable benefits are not in payment currently, but the case has been marked so that if the person reclaims benefit within the next three years a sanction will be applied. In the fourth case, sanctionable benefits are in payment and sanctions are being imposed. Information about the amounts obtained and the benefits defrauded in the four cases concerned are in the following table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 25 February 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 496W, on medical services, what proportion of the audits carried out by medical services in the last five years were targeted audits carried out in relation to complaints from claimants about the quality of those medical reports; and what proportion of these targeted audits have been awarded grade C.

 Medical Services management information does not allow for analysis of targeted audit that has arisen from complaints.

<a name="30325w16.html_para4">Targeted audit is used when a problem has been identified with a particular doctor, as a result of random audit, a complaint, a rework, or as a chance finding. It involves consideration of a number of reports completed by the doctor concerned, in order to gauge

 Pension credit will replace the minimum income guarantee from 6 October 2003.

<a name="30325w16.html_para6">The Department does not produce detailed forecasts of expenditure on the basis of different levels of take-up. However as an indication of the likely expenditure on pension credit, if all those entitled claimed it, DWP simulations suggest spending might be in the region of &#163;7.5 billion for 2004&#150;05. There is likely to be a wide margin of error around this estimate as it is based on survey data, which relies on individual responses and may be subject to non-response bias.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates were calculated for all pensioners using the Department's Policy Simulation Model based on the Family Resource Survey data for 2000&#150;01 projected forward to 2003&#150;04. This shows around 3.6 million households entitled to pension credit.<P>





2. The Policy Simulation Model excludes all pensioners in nursing or residential care homes. This is because the Family Resource Survey data do not contain information on these cases. We estimate that just over 200,000 pensioners in care homes will be entitled to pension credit. This means that total pension credit entitlement for 2003&#150;04 is estimated to be about 3.8 million households.<P>

3. The figures in the tables were rounded to the nearest 50,000 cases. The figures may not add up due to rounding.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what arrangements exist to compensate employees who lose a significant proportion of their company pension when the company goes into liquidation.  [104089]<P>

<P>
<a name="30325w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government are sympathetic to the situation faced by members of pension schemes who find themselves in the unfortunate position of being in a scheme that has insufficient funds to secure all its liabilities when it is wound up.
<P>

<a name="30325w17.html_para0">A compensation scheme already exists to provide compensation for losses caused by dishonesty where the employer is insolvent. However, our Green Paper, "Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement", (Cm 5677), published on 17 December 2002, contains additional proposals aimed at improving protection for scheme members if their schemes wind-up. We are seeking views on removing the restrictions on the amount of compensation payable under the compensation scheme, sharing out scheme assets more fairly, insurance for schemes that are wound up due to employer insolvency and on strengthening the protection for members whose solvent employer chooses to wind up its scheme. The consultation period for the Green Paper proposals runs until 28 March 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to allow sub-postmasters to advise people on whether to open a Post Office card account for receiving benefit payments; and if he will make a statement.  [103802]<P>

<P>
<a name="30325w17.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Post Office card account is one of three account options that will be available to customers if they want to access their money at the Post Office. Because the Post Office card account has limited features it will not be the best option for everyone.
<P>

<a name="30325w17.html_para1">We will write to customers when it is their turn to change their method of payment. Customers will be supplied directly with information which clearly sets out their account options and enables them to decide which account is right for them. Sub-postmasters also have official Post Office leaflets, which provide factual information on the account options available, which they can give to customers.
<P>

<a name="30325w17.html_para2">As neither Post Office staff nor staff in the Department are experts in giving financial advice, it would not be appropriate for them to do so. Sub-postmasters, therefore, should not advise customers on which account is most suitable. It is for customers to choose which account best meets their needs and circumstances.

 The proposed partial repeal of section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947 is a key element in the replacement of the existing over-centralised framework for fire cover and the early introduction of the new risk-based approach recommended by the Independent Review of the Fire Service chaired by Professor Sir George Bain. The Government believe that decisions on fire cover should be taken by democratically accountable fire authorities, acting on the professional advice of chief fire officers, and after taking account of the views of local communities. The proposed repeals are also consistent with the principles, set out in the White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services", of giving local authorities 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2003 : Column 177W</I><P>
greater freedoms and flexibilities by cutting back on consent regimes and red tape. The Bain Review, which recommended urgent repeal or amendment of section 19, invited evidence from all major stakeholders in the fire service. Since publication of the Review the Local Government Association and the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association have repeated their support for repeal. Draft guidance on the implementation of the new fire cover arrangements and on the consultation of local communities on significant changes in fire cover were placed in the Libraries of both Houses on 5 March, and are being circulated to a wide range of stakeholders for comment.
<P>

<a name="30325w17.html_para3">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has met the Fire Brigades Union a number of times in recent weeks.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the capacity of Shropshire's Fire Service to maintain fire cover during the Fire Brigades Union strike on 20 March and <i>(b)</i> the number of military personnel able to provide fire cover.  [104619]<P>

<P>
<a name="30325w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The proposed Fire Brigade Union (FBU) strike on 20 March did not go ahead. However, the emergency fire cover provided by the armed forces under Operation Fresco was once again made available to deal with the situation. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence liase regularly at both ministerial level and official level, we are also in regular touch with other parties, such as Fire Authorities, to ensure that an appropriate level and range of emergency fire cover is available to minimise the risk to public safety caused by FBU strike action.

On 19 February 2003, My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) announced the full programme of Capacity Building initiatives and committed &#163;27 million to help fund this work. This programme will help draw in top quality people by improving the attractiveness of the sector as a potential employer, and ensure the long term development of effective senior management.

<a name="30325w18.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working closely with the Employers' Organisation (EO) on the development of key parts of this programme. This will complement the work already being undertaken by the EO into recruitment of senior management. This includes: a consultancy service to support local authorities recruit at senior levels; a comprehensive guide to recruiting senior posts, due to be published in April 2003; and a research project to identify the main barriers to recruiting senior management to inform future work.

comparisons in the years 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are not available. There were no changes in funding and function between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 that needed reflecting in adjusted grants for 1998&#150;99 to allow a like-for-like comparison; the actual 1998&#150;99 values have therefore been used in this case.

 The tables give all the special and specific grants inside Aggregate External Finance (AEF) provided to Tunbridge Wells and Kent. The information is taken from the Reporting Officer forms returned on an annual basis by authorities to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The entries for 1997&#150;2002 are actual figures. These are not yet available for 2002&#150;03 and therefore budgeted figures have been given. The definition of ring-fencing was updated last year to reflect the types of grant which now exist. Some grants previously classified as ring-fenced are not now classified in this way. The key distinction made remains that ring-fenced grants are those which restrict local authority spending. For completeness the following list includes all special grants inside Aggregate External Finance. Further details of classifications are in an annex to the freedoms and flexibilities announcement of 26 November.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many plans were <i>(a)</i> Tunbridge Wells borough council and <i>(b)</i> Kent county council required to submit to central government in each year since 1997.  [104695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The number of plans submitted in each year to central government is set out in the following table. These figures include plans that are required from partnerships that include local authorities. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently announced a significant reduction in the number of plans that will be required from all authorities. Authorities assessed as excellent will themselves only have to prepare two plans, neither of which will be submitted to Government except in cases, such as Kent, in which the authority did not receive a three star rating in education. For these authorities, education plans will be required until the top rating is attained. The table, therefore, includes the three different types of education related plans that are required for 2003&#150;04. The table assumes that none of the small number of other mandatory plans produced by partnerships of which Kent is a member fall due in 2003&#150;04.

The FSA is working closely with local enforcement authorities, who are now deciding what action to take against the wholesalers.

 When considering closure of areas of water off the coast of Northern Ireland in such circumstances, the Food Standards Agency uses ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) areas as a means of designating particular areas of water. In every case the aim is to include any area where there is reason to think there is a hazard. Because of the very mobile nature of marine algae, it is necessary to include a safety margin to ensure protection of public health.

It is difficult to isolate the success of the education campaign due to other factors at work such as prices, incomes, social trends etc. However, a number of different measures are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the "Don't Give Up Giving Up" advertising campaign. These include prevalence surveys, quarterly tracking research, monitoring calls to the national health service smoking helpline, evaluation of media coverage and helpline referrals to local services.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2003]:</i> The Department has no plans at present to commission research into the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. For all three types of cancer the main risk factors are known to be smoking and heavy drinking, and efforts to reduce these are the main preventive measures. But the Department has of course noted with interest the report published in the <i>British Journal of Cancer</i> of a study on the effects of aspirin undertaken at the Institute of Pharmacological Research in Milan. The Department is working closely with its partners in the National Cancer Research Institute to plan strategically national research efforts on the prevention of cancer.

 The Government's 5-a-day programme, an NHS Plan commitment, aims to increase access to, and availability and consumption of, fruit and vegetables particularly in low income groups. The 5-a-day message includes the health benefits of eating at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables in helping to reduce the risk of some cancers.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2003]:</i> The Government recognises that primary care trusts (PCTs) have a crucial role to play in the delivery of effective drug treatment services. It is because of this that mechanisms have been set up to ensure that we have regular contact with PCTs and other key stakeholders.

<a name="30325w21.html_para3">The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) monitors the performance of all drug action team (DAT) members, including PCTs, via a DAT treatment plan, which is completed on an annual basis. Progress against this treatment plan is reviewed by the NTA, with all DAT partners, on a quarterly basis. These regular reviews ensure that all DAT partners are making a positive contribution to the effective delivery of drug treatment services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its guidance on the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the treatment of dyspepsia in July 2000. The guidance made a number of recommendations intended to achieve the most clinically and cost-effectiveness use of PPIs. NICE estimated that its advice, if fully implemented, could lead to a reduction in the use of PPIs. Such a reduction has not yet occurred. We anticipate that the impetus to better target these treatments will increase when NICE publishes its clinical guideline on the primary management of dyspepsia, due later this year.

 A national baseline survey of national health service child care provision, undertaken early in 2001, found that 114 NHS trusts provided some form of nursery facilities for their staff. The NHS child care strategy has provided central funding over three years to develop up to 150 on-site nursery facilities by 2004. In the first two years of the strategy, 120 nursery schemes, including both new and extensions to existing nurseries have been funded.

We intend to do a further survey of NHS child care provision in 2004.

<P>

 The agreement on Polish midwifery qualifications was reached at the Copenhagen European Council in December, as part of an overall package that came within the budgetary ceiling for enlargement agreed at Berlin in 1999. Negotiations on the Treaty are now closed. Once ratified, the Accession Treaty, which will be signed by Heads of State and Government in Athens on 16 April, will provide for the recognition of Polish midwifery qualifications on the same basis as for those awarded by other member states.
<P>

<a name="30325w23.html_para5">Qualifications awarded following training begun after accession will comply with minimum community requirements and be automatically recognised. In other cases, evidence of recent and substantial professional experience in Poland may be required.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent assessment has been made of the effects of mobile phone masts on human health; what current research he has commissioned on the effects of mobile phone masts on human health; what comparison he has made of the level of emissions from mobile phone masts in the UK with those in other European countries; and what plans he has to regulate the level of emissions from mobile phone masts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w24.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The public health implications of mobile phone base stations were assessed by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP), chaired by Sir William Stewart. Their report, issued in May 2000, was a comprehensive review of relevant research and can be found on the Group's web site at www.iegmp.org.uk. A main conclusion was that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30325w24.html_para0">Measurements undertaken, since publication of the IEGMP report, by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and the Radiocommunications Agency (RA) have confirmed that public exposures are very much lower than the international guidelines: www.nrpb.org&#151;see publications NRPB R-321 and www.radio.gov.uk&#151;see mobile phone base stations.
<P>

<a name="30325w24.html_para1">The Stewart Group proposed that gaps in knowledge were sufficient to justify a precautionary approach to the development of this technology and recommendations were made for further research. A comprehensive research programme has now been established under an independent programme management committee. Information can be found on the web site at www.mthr.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="30325w24.html_para2">The UK uses the same GSM/mobile phone technology and frequencies as other European countries. Measurement programmes exist in a number of European countries. Wide variations in emissions data are noted, but the measurements show emissions are significantly inside the exposure guidelines. Similar results have been obtained by the RA base station audit programme and by the NRPB in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30325w24.html_para3">Mobile phone and mast emissions fall within the Radio equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive (R&TTE). The European Commission issued a mandate requesting the European standardisation bodies prepare and adopt harmonised standards covering the aspects of emissions of electro-magnetic frequencies covered by the R&TTE Directive. It was stated that standards should take into account the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) limits laid out in the Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC to allow presumption of conformity to Article 3.1<i>(a)</i> of the R&TTE Directive.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30325w24.html_para4">Three groups of standards on measurement of exposure from mobile phone masts have been, or are in the process of being agreed. Upon completion of this family of standards the mobile operators will have clear obligations to comply with the ICNIRP Guidelines though the European Council Recommendation on exposure, the R&TTE Directive and the relevant standard. In the absence of a final harmonised measurement standard, the obligation under the R&TTE Directive and the Recommendation would still apply.

 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2003]:</i> The Health Survey for England 2001 shows that the prevalence of obesity continues to rise and that 21 per cent. of men and 23.5 per cent. of women were obese. Analysis of the Health Survey for England 1999 showed the prevalence of obesity in children was 10 per cent. at age six rising to 17 per cent. at age 15.
<P>

<a name="30325w25.html_para0">Information is not available on the direct cost for each individual to the national health service of treating obesity. However, the National Audit Office report "Tackling Obesity in England", published in February 2001, estimated that the direct cost to the NHS of treating obesity in 1998 was &#163;9.4 million. Treating the consequences of obesity cost the NHS approximately &#163;480 million per year, or about 1.5 per cent. of the total NHS expenditure for that year.

 Under the National Health Service Act 1977, it is the responsibility of national health service primary care trusts (PCTs) to arrange the provision of pharmaceutical services in their area. This includes determining whether it is necessary or desirable to secure adequate provision of services by granting applications to open new NHS pharmacies. Additionally, the Health and Social Care Act 2001 empowers PCTs to devise contracts for local pharmaceutical services which address particular local needs, including access to a NHS pharmacy.

This sets out the Government's programme to maintain and improve access to and the range and quality of services offered by NHS pharmacies. Three waves of the medicines management collaborative are under way, involving 106 PCTs. All NHS Direct sites are now able to refer callers where appropriate to their local community pharmacy. Repeat dispensing schemes in selected sites which enable patients to get their pharmacy to dispense medicines for up to a year, rather than going back to their general practitioner for a new prescription each time and new arrangements for pharmacists to prescribe on the NHS in accordance with an agreed clinical management plan start later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research <i>(a)</i> has been conducted and <i>(b)</i> he intends to commission into (i) the causes and (ii) potential treatments for reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  [103568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC is not currently funding any research on reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are considered in open competition with other demands on funding.

<P>
<a name="30325w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 All national health service bodies are required to develop contingency plans to enable them to cope with the current international situation. The Department of Health is working with the Ministry of Defence to minimise disruption to NHS services. In common with all NHS organisations, the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital NHS Trust has robust plans for dealing with the aftermath of any possible terrorist attack.

 The rules relating to special advisers' political activities are set out in the Model Contract for Special Advisers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of comments made by the coroner in the case of Mr. Whitefield about the drug Seroxat; and what plans he has to request a review of the safety of Seroxat.  [103843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w26.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Following the tragic death of Mr. Whitefield two weeks after commencing treatment with paroxetine (Seroxat), an antidepressant of the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) class, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has taken careful note of the comments of the coroner for Brecon. The MCA has also written to the coroner to obtain further details of Mr. Whitefield's case.
<P>

<a name="30325w26.html_para2">Since it was authorised in 1990 the safety of paroxetine (Seroxat) has been closely monitored by the MCA and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM has considered the question of suicidal behaviour in association with Seroxat on a number of occasions and carefully assessed any new data. CSM has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to confirm a causal relationship between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30325w26.html_para3"><P>

<a name="30325w26.html_para4">CSM has advised that it is general clinical experience that patients taking any antidepressant may develop an increase in suicidal behaviour in the first few weeks of treatment. Product information for prescribers and patients for all SSRIs has been amended to include warnings that suicidal behaviour may increase in the early stages of treatment with any antidepressant. In September 2000, an article was published in the drug safety bulletin, Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance, which is distributed to all doctors and pharmacists.
<P>

<a name="30325w26.html_para5">An expert working group on the safety of SSRIs has been set up by the CSM to review the current available evidence relating to the safety of SSRIs, including paroxetine, particularly in relation to suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The expert working group will report its findings to CSM in due course.

[101334]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30325w26.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 While there is no compulsory additional training for school nurses specifically around sexually transmitted infections and sexual assault, as registered nurses they would be expected to have knowledge and understanding of these issues as well as details of local services should referral be appropriate. Standards for qualification as a specialist practitioner in school nursing specify that the practitioner should be able to:
