 We, along with other international partners, made our concerns about the Shia Personal Status Law clear to the Afghan Government at a senior level. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister raised the issue with President Karzai. We welcomed President Karzai&#146;s announcement on 27 April 2009 that the law would be changed to bring it in line with the Afghan Constitution, which guarantees equal rights for women, and the international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="90707w0001.htm_para0"><a name="09070774000030">On 20 June 2009, the Minister of Justice met with female representatives of the Afghan Parliament and civil society and told them that his Ministry has now amended the Law. The amendments were made following written recommendations by Afghan civil society (the Afghan Women&#146;s Network), Katib university and moderate Ulema (religious scholars).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="90707w0001.htm_para1"><a name="09070774000031">We understand the amendments made by the Afghan Ministry of Justice have added around 60 articles and removed around 10 from the Law. Language was also added to clarify the meaning of certain articles. The amended draft was viewed by the above female representatives as broadly &#145;pro women&#146;, and contentious articles, including the provision appearing to legalise rape, had been removed. The Law is also being reviewed by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="90707w0001.htm_para2"><a name="09070774000032">President Karzai has indicated that the Law will next be sent back to the Afghan Parliament for approval (in time for the new session of Parliament, beginning 20 July 2009).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="90707w0001.htm_para3"><a name="09070774000033">The Law continues to cause controversy on both sides&#151;some religiously conservative Ulema are still lobbying the President to pass the original draft, parts of which the international community and many Afghans deemed unacceptable. The outcome is still uncertain, therefore we, along with our international partners and Afghan civil society, will continue to follow the passage  <br>

Our ambassador in Pyongyang raised our concerns most recently in February 2009 during the visit to North Korea by Lord Alton and Baroness Cox with the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and Speaker of the North Korean Parliament.

 On 22 June the EU Council of Ministers reached political agreement on the final text of a Council regulation on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter. The regulation is expected to apply from 1 January 2013. It will replace the current directive 93/119 which the European Commission considers out of date.

 The National Audit Office estimated an underspend of around &#163;250 million in 2008 based on the take-up rate of the Help Scheme during the switchover at Whitehaven and Copeland. We have since had continuing discussions with the BBC Help Scheme about take up rates in subsequent switchovers and other cost drivers, and these confirm that this is a robust estimate of the eventual underspend. After switchover in the Granada TV region is completed at the end of 2009, when a significant proportion and representative sample of households will have switched over, we will conduct a further stock-take of the position.</p>

 The &#147;National Agreement on Arrangements for the Use of Interpreters and Translators in the Criminal Justice System&#148; only applies to provision within England and Wales. In Northern Ireland, a joint contract has been established between relevant criminal justice organisations and the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (for face-to-face interpretation) and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (for sign language). This aims to enhance consistency in how interpretation is used across the criminal justice system by setting out the specific requirements of each partner organisation which is underpinned by individual organisational guidance. The contract provides flexibility for the use of interpreters registered with the National Register of Public Service Interpreters (England and Wales), where particular requirements cannot be met locally.</p>

 A number of nations have benefited from the UK-FR helicopter initiative to make their helicopters more deployable. The first three helicopters will deploy to Afghanistan as a direct result of the initiative from December this year. We expect a further five to deploy in 2010 and up to three more by end 2011. Additional contributions to the fund would further increase these numbers.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the written ministerial statement of 1 July 2009, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 18-21WS, on armed forces recognition, for what reason a distinction is drawn between retrospective recognition for the families of those who served and died in <i> (a)</i> Palestine since 27 September 1945 and otherwise since 1 January 1948 and <i> (b)</i> the Second World War.

 The Commonwealth War Graves Commission attributed deaths up to 1 January 1948 to world war two service and recorded them on their Rolls of Honour and Memorials. The only exception to this is deaths in Palestine from 27 September 1945 to 30 June 1948, which will also be eligible for the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll. This is consistent with the dates used for recognition on the Armed Forces Memorial, although the criteria for inclusion on that memorial are different.</p>

 Insufficient information is held to enable a reliable estimate to be made of the number of Gurkhas who retired from the armed forces before 1997 and who have now passed away. Many generations of Gurkhas have served with great distinction in the UK armed forces, since they were first permitted to volunteer for British military service in the 1815 peace treaty that ended the Anglo-Nepalese war of 1814-15. Between 1948, when the Brigade of Gurkhas was formed as part of the British Army and 1 July 1997, when the Brigade became UK based, it is estimated that some 37,100 Gurkhas served in and were discharged from the Brigade. We also estimate that from those years there remain 34,700 Gurkhas and Gurkha widows, who are in receipt of a Gurkha pension.</p>

 It has been the policy of successive governments not to implement changes to pensions and similar benefits retrospectively. This policy has been applied across the public sector in the United Kingdom, not just to Gurkha veterans. To do so now would not only be counter to this policy but would also lead to potential claims from other groups in public sector schemes.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what changes to the criteria for eligibility for legal aid for civil cases have been made since May 1997. [284086]</p>

<p><a name="st_205"><a name="09070790000524"><a name="90707w0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="09070790001207"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 On 1 April 2000, the Access to Justice Act 1999 came into force and established the community legal service (CLS) in place of the previous civil legal aid scheme. The financial eligibility criteria for legal help and for legal representation through the CLS were set out in the Community Legal Service (Financial) Regulations 2000, which came into force on 1 April 2000. The financial criteria were substantially amended by the Community Legal Service (Financial) (Amendment No.3) Regulations 2001, which came into force on 3 December 2001. This brought about the simplification of the means test, with the introduction of a gross income limit and disposable income calculation based on a small number of targeted allowances. The financial eligibility limits are increased from time to time in line with inflation. From April 2005, the income limits for legal help and legal representation were aligned. At the same time the disposable capital limit for legal help was increased from &#163;3,000 to &#163;8,000, and we allowed the disposable income limit to be waived for victims of domestic violence seeking protection from harm.

2. The landlord data includes all types of landlords whether social or private sector, and cover orders made using both the standard and<br>
accelerated possession procedures. The accelerated procedure is used by landlords in relation to shorthold tenancies, when the fixed period of tenancy has come to an end. It enables orders to be made by the court solely on the basis of written evidence and without calling the parties to hearings.<br>
3. The court, following a judicial hearing, may grant an order for possession immediately. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted. However, even where a warrant for possession is issued, the parties can still negotiate a compromise to prevent eviction.<br>
4. Includes outright and suspended orders, the latter being where the court grants the claimant possession but suspends the operation of the order. Provided the defendant complies with the terms of suspension, which usually require the defendant to pay the current mortgage or rent instalments plus some of the accrued arrears, the possession order cannot be enforced.<br>

 Unpaid work was introduced as one of the 12 requirements that sentencers can impose as part of a community order by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Community Payback was launched nationally in 2005 with the aim, among other things, of increasing the visibility of the work done and improving public confidence. To increase visibility still further, distinctive clothing in the form of orange high visibility jackets, has been worn by offenders undertaking Community Payback since December 2008. The level of use of this distinctive clothing is being monitored on a quarterly basis and shows that by the end of March 2009 over 400,000 hours of Community Payback had been performed by offenders wearing distinctive clothing.

1. The high proportion of deliveries with an unknown length of gestation recorded needs to be taken into account when interpreting the rates of deliveries for each gestation group.<br>
2. <i> Length of gestation:</i> This field shows the number of completed weeks of gestation according to the World Health Organisation definition, which specifies time from the first day of the last menstrual period. If this date is not reliable, an estimate is provided. This item appears for each baby on multiple birth delivery records; 0-36 weeks premature birth; 37+ weeks (includes post term births); and unknown.<br>
3. <i> Finished consultant episode (FCE):</i> An FCE is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. However, the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. Maternity events taking place in either NHS hospitals or in non-NHS hospitals funded by the NHS will be recorded as ordinary &#145;delivery&#146; or &#145;birth&#146; episodes. &#145;Other delivery events&#146; are delivery events other than those resulting in delivery or birth episodes under NHS funding or in any other facility supplied under a service agreement with the NHS.<br>
4. <i> Ungrossed data:</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
5. <i> Data quality:</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. <i> Hospital providers: </i>A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). TCs (also known as diagnostic centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients. Some TCs are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the health care provider&#146;s data. It does this by adding TC to the trust code; if there is more than one per trust, &#145;T1&#146;, &#145;T2&#146;, &#145;T3&#146; etc. are suggested unless already in use by the trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an &#145;X&#146;. <i> Source:</i><br>

 In October 2008 the Prime Minister announced that central Government Departments will pay their suppliers as soon as possible and within 10 days. This commitment has also attracted support from the wider public sector. The Government are now working with the Regional Economic Fora (which provide a strategic approach to coordinating economic policies across Government in the regions, are made up of key regional bodies and are all either chaired or co-chaired by regional Ministers) to identify payment best practice across local authorities and the NHS and encourage these areas to commit to the prompt payment code.</p>

The Government have committed to only performance managing local authorities within these agreed indicators and targets and as the 10-day payment policy for local authorities is not in the national indicator set, we will not be asking local authorities to report their performance. Instead, the focus on businesses in the national indicator set is on business growth and sustainability. In that context we know anecdotally, and through other surveys, that local authorities are targeting those businesses in most in need of prompt payment and are working on a range of wider measures to increase cash flow, simplify and increase the transparency and take up of public procurement opportunities particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much funding his Department has allocated to tackle antisocial behaviour in <i> (a)</i> Tamworth constituency, <i> (b)</i> Staffordshire and <i> (c)</i> the West Midlands in each year since the inception of such programmes. [282427]</p>

 The Home Office allocated &#163;25,000 a year from 2003-04 to each crime disorder and reduction partnership (CDRP) in West Midlands which includes Tamworth and Staffordshire, as a contribution towards funding ASB co-ordinator posts. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supported the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs). As of 2008-09, Home Office funding for local authorities to tackle antisocial behaviour now form part of the general area-based grant (ABG) paid by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This funding has been renewed for the period 2008-11 and it is for local partnerships to agree how the grants received should be allocated against locally determined priorities, including tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="90707w0022.htm_para8"><a name="0907082000766">Respect Programmes in the West Midlands have also had an impact on antisocial behaviour. These programmes, now the responsibility of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, were designed to kick-start a change in the way the area worked to tackle antisocial behaviour. Other Home Office led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example, the introduction of community support officers in the West Midlands, including Staffordshire but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="90707w0022.htm_para9"><a name="0907082000767">Similarly, other programmes and services contribute, sometimes indirectly, to tackling antisocial behaviour, including diversionary activities for young people, neighbourhood wardens, as well as neighbourhood policing and neighbourhood management.</p>

Coefficients of Variation have been calculated as an indication of the quality of the estimates, as described:<br>
<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) (%) Statistical Robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV[le]5 Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 = CV [le]10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 = CV [le]20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites etc.<br>

 We do not currently hold data centrally about the total number of apprentices made redundant. Arrangements are in place from 1 August 2009 onwards to record the number of apprentices who are made redundant. Working with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) we have established a matching service to help apprentices at risk of redundancy to find alternative employment and to complete their apprenticeship. More generally, providers and the LSC have procedures to advise and relocate apprentices, in cases where providers or employers fail, to help ensure that they are able to continue in work and complete their apprenticeship. The &#163;140 million package announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister for an additional 35,000 apprenticeship places will help fund new provision in both the public sector and private sector, and will extend the opportunities available to people facing redundancy.</p>

 We intend to tackle the issues raised in the question as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_688"><a name="90707w0029.htm_para4"><a name="09070817000426"><i> </i><i> (a)</i> Section 15 of the Children and Young Persons Act places a duty on local authorities to arrange for all looked after children to be visited by a representative of theirs and for all looked-after-children to have available to them advice, support and assistance when they seek it. We shall be issuing regulations about how local authorities should discharge its duties under this section. We intend to impose a general minimum requirement setting the frequency of social work visits to looked-after-children and we will specify in addition that visits should also take place at the request of the child or their carer. We will be consulting on draft regulations and guidance including the frequency of visits in due course.</p>

We will be strengthening regulations and guidance so that all placement decisions must be based on a thorough assessment of the needs of the individual child concerned which, for some children is likely to result in a placement away from their home community and out of their local authority area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_691"><a name="90707w0029.htm_para7"><a name="09070817000429"><i> </i><i> (d)</i> Our strengthened regulations and guidance will say that every looked-after-child must have a care plan based on thorough detailed assessment setting out how the local authority intends to respond to their needs. All care plans must take into account the child's wishes and feelings. Plans to re-unify looked-after-children with their families must take account of children's safety and include an assessment of how the child and their family's circumstances have changed so that their parents are able to resume the child's care.</p>

This is to ensure that they understand the purpose of the review and are given the opportunity to fully contribute to the discussion about the plan for their future care. Every review should provide a real opportunity to scrutinise the child's care plan to ensure that it continues to offer an appropriate response to the full range of their needs.</p>

However, based on the information available, our estimate of the largest (in terms of 2008-09 expenditure) 10 field forces working directly with LAs and Children's Trust partners are listed as follows:</p>

 We have not made any estimate of the number of teachers who may not have had a Criminal Records Bureau check.

All new appointments, both teaching and support staff, in the school workforce now require an enhanced CRB disclosure under the terms of the School Staffing (England) (No2) Regulations 2006, and those regulations also require schools to maintain a record of the vetting checks they have carried out on their staff. From November 2010 all new appointments to the school sector will have to register with the new vetting and barring scheme, and all existing staff in school will have to register by 2015. The ISA registration process incorporates a CRB check. The CRB collect some statistics on the volume of checks being made in the education sector on a monthly basis.</p>

Medicine and Dentistry, Subjects allied to Medicine, Biological Sciences, Vet Science, Agriculture and related, Physical Sciences, Mathematical and Comp Science, Engineering, Technologies, Architecture, Building and Planning, Combined Sciences. The tables above use this definition.<br>
3. From 2002 entry, UCAS switched from using the Standard Academic Classification of Subjects (SCAS) to the Joint Academic Coding System (JACS). Data reported for 2008 entry uses JACS2, an updated version of JACS. For further information see:<br>
http://www.ucas.ac.uk/he_staff/datamanagement/jacs/jacs20<br>
4. From 2005, the former Social Work Admissions System (SWAS) was incorporated into the main UCAS system, therefore a small number of Social Work Postgraduate courses will be included in the data from 2005 onwards.<br>

The period covered should not, therefore, be treated as a consistent time series.<br>
