<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41110w01.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 18 October 2004. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Development was also present.

<a name="stpa_1">As this was the last Council expected to be attended by Commissioners Franz Fischler and David Byrne, the Council took the opportunity to pay warm tribute to the contribution that they had made during their time in office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41110w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">As to the agenda, the Council responded to a number of key questions arising from a Commission report on the simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables. I joined several delegations in noting that, while changes to the regime agreed in 1996 have had a positive effect, we need to look constructively at the scope for further changes, including increased flexibility and subsidiarity in the regime. Its impact on developing countries and on the Doha Development Agenda would also be important factors. We should be wary of further intervention in the market but we could look at the scope for promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption. The Commission will reflect upon the exchanges before tabling any proposals for further reform. Discussion will resume at official level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41110w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Council took note, without discussion, of discussions on the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming and agreed conclusions supporting a range of further actions.

<a name="41110w01.html_para4">
On fisheries, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary emphasised the importance of consistent and effective enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and welcomed the proposal for a Community Fisheries Control Agency. However, he emphasised that the Agency should act in a co-ordinating, not instructing role; that it should build on work to develop a regional input to the CFP; and that it should be cost neutral. Many delegations made similar points. Discussion will continue between officials.

<p>
<a name="41110w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">The Council held an initial exchange of views in preparation for this year&#039;s negotiation on a fisheries agreement with Norway. My hon. Friend made clear the high priority the United Kingdom attaches to ensuring that the EU has access to the full amount of Arctic cod quota it is entitled to under the terms of the EEA Agreement, and identifying stocks that the EU can offer Norway in exchange without making use of mackerel which is a fully utilised quota stock. There was general agreement that the Commission needed to take a robust line with Norway. Further preparations for the negotiation will be taken forward by officials.

<a name="41110w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">The Council held a policy debate on Commission proposals for recovery plans for hake and Norway lobster in the Cantabrian Sea and for sole stocks in the Western English Channel and Bay of Biscay. My hon. Friend made clear the United Kingdom&#039;s commitment to sustainable management of western Channel sole which is an important stock for fishermen in south-west England, but that we do not believe western Channel sole should be a recovery stock or that the Commission&#039;s effort control proposals are appropriate. He drew attention to the advice on this stock delivered by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) in August which suggests that this stock is less likely to be outside safe limits than other sole stocks, confirming the results of collaborative research carried out with commercial fishing vessels in the south-west. He called for inconsistencies between this advice and the most recent ICES draft advice to be clarified urgently. Other member states expressed a range of views on the recovery plan proposals. Discussions will continue among officials.

<a name="41110w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">The Commission reported on the state of play on a number of important trade negotiations. On the WTO, Commissioner Fischler welcomed the framework agreement reached in Geneva in the summer as a basis for continued detailed negotiations which safeguard essential European interests. He also reported on the continuing attempts to make progress in the EU/Mercosur negotiations; on work to agree a tariff-only arrangement for reform of the banana regime; and on resolving outstanding negotiations with certain third country suppliers of rice. Among a long list of many other business items, I and several others supported a Danish request to consider how best to include low fat dairy products in the school milk programme. Several, mostly central European, member states drew attention to the problems on the EU cereals market following this year&#039;s harvest. Other matters raised were: the impact of the US Bio-terrorism Act, implementation of the reformed CAP in Denmark, state aid for weather damage in Lithuania, the co-existence of GMO and other crops, the impact on fishing of increased diesel prices in France and the EU/Angola Fisheries

We are therefore formulating an outreach programme to explain counter-terrorism powers more fully. This work will involve the building of significant and productive relationships through regular meetings with key opinion formers in religious and ethnic communities, and by undertaking a comprehensive programme of visits by senior officials to those communities to explain the purpose and operation of our counter-terrorism powers.

 Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) are inspected by Ofsted to assess the quality of the provision being delivered by LEAs and to address any instances where it falls below our expectations. PRUs form a significant element within each LEA&#039;s alternative provision strategy. However, in June 2003, Ofsted reported that the quality of alternative provision made for older pupils is variable. Well run PRUs make a great difference to their pupils, and we are disseminating guidance on good practice to help LEAs improve their effectiveness. We will also expect PRUs to work with groups of schools which take collective responsibility for managing excluded pupils and those at risk of exclusion, and provision for them.

Under this programme the UK is working in partnership with the Russian Federation and other international partners on a variety of areas including redirection of former weapons scientists, improving protection of nuclear and radioactive material, and nuclear clean-up and submarine dismantlement in North West Russia.

The UK has also funded the decommissioning of two Oscar class submarines at the Zvezdochka shipyard near Archangelsk and is an active participant in the Arctic Military Environmental Programme alongside Norway, the US and the Russian Federation. Negotiations are also under way on various other programmes where final decisions on funding have not yet been reached.

 There is no prescriptive upper age limit for treatment with anti-TNF therapies. However, local clinicians do take the age of the patient into account when considering whether the potential clinical benefits arising from treatment outweigh the risk of side effects. As individuals get older, there is an increased risk of serious infection in those with a longer duration of inflammatory disease, and where patients have complex medical histories.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answers of 27 October 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1261&#150;62W, on hazardous waste, what assessment has been made of the sources of illegal special waste being dumped in Northern Ireland; if he will list the nature of the special waste being dumped; and what action is being taken to prevent future incidences of the illegal dumping of special waste.

 The majority of special waste illegally deposited is the residual material produced from the illegal laundering of diesel with a small amount (less than 2 per cent.) of waste asbestos accounting for the remainder.

<a name="stpa_247">Given the very nature of the waste and the way in which it is deposited (fly-tipped usually at night), it is difficult to trace the source. In most cases there is insignificant evidence or eye witness accounts to identify the culprit and hence pursue a prosecution.

Note:<br>

Data for 2003&#150;2004 is provisional and may be subject to change. I have set a target for 2004&#150;05 to reduce the number of patients waiting more than two hours in an A&E department between the clinician&#039;s decision to admit and admission to a ward by one third compared to 2003&#150;04 levels.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the average waiting time is for each speciality in elective surgery in each <i>(a)</i> health and social services board and <i>(b)</i> health and social services trust; what the equivalent figures for the last three financial years were; and if he will make a statement.

 Waiting list information is collected by time band. It is therefore not possible to calculate the arithmetic mean length of time waiting. It is however possible to identify the median or mid point waiting time band.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what research he has evaluated into a putative link between passive smoking and cot death. [196253]</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="41110w32.html_spnew6"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 United Kingdom and international research in this area links both prenatal maternal smoking and children&#039;s exposure to second-hand smoke (passive smoking) to a range of conditions including sudden infant death syndrome. However, the relative impact on the foetus of maternal smoking in pregnancy, and the infant through subsequent exposure to second-hand smoke remains unclear.
