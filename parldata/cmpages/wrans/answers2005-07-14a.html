<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50714w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Information about the level of illegal culling of badgers by farmers is not generally available. However, the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB is monitoring suspected unlawful activities within the survey areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. Within those areas, seven suspected incidents of illegal badger culling have been identified since February 2002 and reported to the police authorities.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50714w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I met representatives of the South West National Farmers Union on 16 June to discuss the problem of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. This was a positive and constructive discussion. The NFU outlined a number of ideas, subsequently published in a national NFU document on 4 July 2005. The NFU document will be considered as the Government develops its TB strategy as will cost benefit analysis work based on the Irish badger culling trials and other data.

<a name="stpa_0">The report describes more than 40 proposals for a future climate change regime either published or publicly presented in recent years.

Some of the large supermarket chains have already introduced Bag for Life, whereby a charge is made to the customer for a strong and durable plastic bag which is replaced by the retailer when it eventually wears out. The scheme encourages a change in behaviour through the reuse of bags, and the plastic from worn-out bags is recycled. WRAP is investigating the implementation of such a scheme on a national basis.

 Waste Strategy 2000 sets out the Government&#039;s aim to minimise waste and recover value from waste in line with the waste hierarchy. It includes targets to increase material recovery through recycling and composting, but does not support any particular technology to achieve them. Local authorities also have targets to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill under the landfill allowances trading scheme. Local authorities are responsible for and best placed to decide the most appropriate waste management facilities for their areas, based on local circumstances and their statutory obligations.

<a name="50714w04.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_27"><i>Letter from Jil Matheson to Mr. Clive Betts,</i> <i>dated 14 July 2005:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question concerning the ratio of the population, aged 18 and over, recorded in the 2001 census to the number of residents who were registered to vote in each parliamentary constituency. I am replying in his absence. (10815)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">I am placing in the House of Commons Library, a table supplying the requested information.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors on census day (29 April 2001), a weighted average is taken of the 1 February 2001 and 1 December 2001 electoral data. Data are given for parliamentary electorates. Data for the local/European electorate, by parliamentary constituency are not readily available for 2001</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">It should be noted that the ratio of residents who are registered to vote in each constituency is not a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">The UK parliamentary electorate excludes residents of countries other than the UK and the Commonwealth and includes UK citizens resident abroad. In addition not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Also there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This latter is the main reason why in some constituencies the population aged 18 and over is less than those registered to vote. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Furthermore, you should note that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revised the mid-2001 population estimates since the publication of the 2001 census results. In September 2003, revisions were made that added approximately 193,000 to the population of England and Wales. This revision primarily related to the addition of a number of young males that were not captured by the census. In September 2004, ONS made further revisions as a result of concluding studies designed to improve population estimates in the areas that proved hardest to count in the 2001 census in England and Wales. The results of this work showed that the one number census (ONC) worked well in most areas, but that there were a few cases where it was not able sufficiently to adjust for exceptional circumstances. The analysis showed that there was a need for revisions to the 2001 census based population figures of around 107,000 for England and Wales as a whole. The adjustments were included in the new mid-year population estimates for 2001, published in 2004. The census database itself was not revised following the publication of these adjustments. More details on these issues can be found at: www.statistics.gov.uk/lastudies .</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">Any comparison of these data with figures for other years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
</ul>

<sup>(2)</sup> Guide to quality:<br>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is given to indicate the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>

The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.The Annual purvey of Hours and Earnings, (ASHE), carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a 1 per cent. sample of all employees.<br>

2.The ASHE replaces the New Earnings Survey (NES) from October 2004. The main difference between the ASHE and NES being that estimates are weighted to population totals from the Labour Force Survey.<br>

3.Average gross weekly earnings for adult full-time employees whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.<br>

 We have been working with the Home Office to identify areas where the identity cards scheme could provide business benefits. On 28 June 2005, my right, hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Mr. Clarke) placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity checks necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade information technology systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.

 The Department is currently investing about &#163;300 million to improve and expand child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). In September 2004, the Department, in conjunction with the Department for Education and Skills, sets out its vision for improving CAMHS in the children&#039;s national service framework (NSF). Although the NSF covers the whole range of CAMHS patients from young children 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1194W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
to, typically, 17-year-olds, there are some recommendations which are particularly relevant to teenage users of mental health services. These include: consultation with young people about the design of patient-centred services, providing a choice of appropriate locations for young people to visit for their treatment, and ensuring a smooth and flexible transition from CAMHS to adult mental health services, taking into account the wishes of the patient.

 An acceptable behaviour contract (ABC) is agreed and signed at a meeting with the individual involved in the antisocial behaviour and one or more lead agencies.

The meeting may also be used as an opportunity to challenge any evidence put forward in support of making the ABC. ABCs are not statutory orders and therefore it is for local authorities to decide details such as what evidence may be used to support an ABC and how this evidence is tested.

 The Government&#039;s plan for civil renewal, Together We Can&quot;, is about empowering citizens to work with public bodies to set and achieve common goals. It will encourage more citizens to work with local agencies to obtain antisocial behaviour orders to tackle persistent problems where that is appropriate, and also involve more local people in developing strategies and activities for positive community action to help conflict resolution and youth inclusion. In providing co-operative and restorative options to deal with potential antagonism between citizens, the plan will contribute to the reduction of the level of antisocial behaviour and the need for antisocial behaviour orders.

 The US-UK Extradition Treaty 2003 is not yet in force, although certain provisions in it have been given effect in the 2003 Extradition Act which came into force on 1 January 2004. Part 2 of that Act provides the framework for the scrutiny of requests from countries outside the EU.

Unless discharged by the court, they are then passed to Ministers for consideration of issues relating to the death penalty, speciality and earlier extradition if applicable, and for final decision.

 In 2003/04 there were just under 88,000 exclusions from maintained school for physical violence, of which 80 per cent. were for violence to other pupils. This total is equivalent to just over 1 per cent. of the relevant pupil population. But any level of violence in schools is too high. So we have made it clear that head teachers may permanently exclude pupils for violence even when this is a first offence. It is even more important to help schools create an environment that reduces the risk of violence to an absolute minimum. To achieve that we have:

 I have no appointment to meet Mr. Robert McNamara. The UK has a very strong record on nuclear disarmament and we have reduced the explosive power of our nuclear forces by over 70 per cent. since the end of the Cold War. We are committed to the global elimination of nuclear weapons. We are most concerned about nuclear proliferation and active in efforts to combat it. This is demonstrated by the negotiations we, France and Germany, in association with the EU, are conducting with Iran concerning its nuclear programme, and by the assistance we and the US gave to Libya in implementing its announcement of December 2003 to abandon its nuclear weapon and other WMD programmes.

 The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 makes it an offence to obstruct or interfere with an employee of a fire and rescue authority carrying out his or her duties. In addition assault is a criminal offence and there is a hierarchy of criminal offences where injury results. It is important that such incidents are reported and that the fire and rescue authorities collaborate with the police so that offenders are prosecuted and punished appropriately.

 The amount of training required to deal with attacks on firefighters, including training in dynamic risk assessment, is a matter for fire and rescue authorities who tailor the training to meet the need.

I understand that the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) has set up a task and finish group, to review practice relating to assaults on firefighters and to make recommendations.

Under the arrangements for Integrated Risk Management Planning, it is for individual authorities to decide how to fulfil that duty, following consultation, but I know that many schemes and partnerships exist where the Fire and Rescue Service engages with the local community and schools. These can have a direct impact on behaviour.

 Statistics published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister show about 1.5 million dwellings were built in England and Wales in the decade to April 2005. Statistics on pressure tests are not collected. I am aware that pressure tests have been carried out on about 150 houses built to comply with the Building Regulations as amended in April 2002. The approved documents supporting that amendment covered air tightness for the first time. While there was no evidence of overall non-compliance, the evidence is that the pressure test results were unsatisfactory. This has prompted consideration of stronger requirements for testing and improved technical guidance.

 It is a matter for each local authority to decide its threshold for key decisions, having regard to the statutory guidance which the Government have issued under the Local Government Act 2000.

<sup>(38)</sup>People who have been claiming jobseeker&#039;s allowance for six months or more are eligible for new deal 50 plus. Additionally around 15 per cent. of those people claiming jobseeker&#039;s allowance for less than six months may also be eligible for new deal 50 plus as a result of another qualifying benefit claim preceding their jobseeker&#039;s allowance claim.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Figures are for Great Britain and are rounded to the nearest 100, totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2.Years are defined as 1 March to 28/29 February in each year.<br>

3.A person is only counted once each year regardless of how many times they have flowed on and off jobseeker&#039;s allowance in that year, but they may appear in more than one year. The claim with the longest duration within each year has been used.<br>

4.Due to late notification of commencements on the jobseeker&#039;s allowance payment system (JSAPS) for the most recent quarter i.e. to the end of February 2005, the total number of claims for 2004&#150;05 can be expected to increase.<br>

5.Durations for claims that have not ended by the end of the relevant financial year have been calculated at that point in time. Due to only having data up to the end of February 2005, the number of claimants in the six months and over category is an underestimate for the 2004&#150;05 year i.e. anyone starting after 1 September 2004 whose claim is still live at the year end has had a duration of less than six months calculated. As more data comes in over the following months the durations of these claims will become over six months.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the impact of Pension Protection Fund regulations on the incomes of members of schemes affected who have taken early retirement.  [9107]</p>








<p><a name="st_289"><a name="50714w30.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Pension Protection Fund provides 90 per cent. level of compensation for those members who, immediately before the assessment date, are under the scheme&#039;s normal pension age. This includes early retirees. However, those members who took early retirement, but have then reached the scheme&#039;s normal pension age before the assessment date, will receive 100 per cent. level of compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w30.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_208">The compensation cap applies to all members who receive 90 per cent. level of compensation. The compensation cap is age related and is currently &#163;27,777.78 at age 65 (effectively &#163;25,000 at 90 per cent. level). The compensation cap is adjusted, according to age, in accordance with actuarial factors published by the Board of the PPF.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w30.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_209">We have based this split on those over and under the scheme&#039;s normal pension age because we believe those over that age are less likely to be able to make good or cope with a sudden reduction in income. We also considered it would be unfair if, for example, two members of the same age (e.g. 58 years) received different levels of compensation simply because one member chose to take early retirement while the other chose to continue to work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w30.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_210">The compensation members receive from the PPF may not be equivalent to the pension they may have been expecting to receive from the scheme. However, it is important to remember that PPF compensation is effectively an emergency backstop that only takes effect

</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w30.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_211">It is also true that in previous years should a pension scheme have to wind up underfunded the scheme&#039;s current pensioners had first claim to the assets of the scheme. This was advantageous to pensioners but in some cases led to all other members of the scheme (including those just a few years or even months from retirement) losing almost all of their pension. This was a situation that became worse the more a scheme was in deficit when it was wound up. This was frequently criticised and perceived as unfair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w30.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_212">We believe the PPF levels of compensation strike the right balance between the amount of compensation payable and the amount that would be required to be paid into the PPF via the levies. In total, more money will be paid out by the PPF than could have been paid by the scheme.

<p>
<a name="50714w30.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_213">There are two groups of individuals who, regardless of age, are not subject to the 90 per cent. compensation level; individuals who, before the assessment date, are already in receipt of a survivors&#039; pension and those in receipt of an early pension on the grounds of ill health.

 Since 1997 the Government&#039;s priority has been to tackle the scourge of unemployment, inactivity and poverty through investment in, and reform of, the welfare state. The UK now has one of the strongest labour markets in the world, with the best combination of employment and unemployment of the major world economies. More people are moving from welfare back into work with employment up almost 200,000 in the last year and by over 2 million since 1997. With more people in jobs than ever before, we now spend &#163;5 billion less on unemployment benefits than we did in 1997.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many adjustments of <i>(a)</i> council tax benefit and <i>(b)</i> housing benefit payments have resulted from corrected overpayments of tax credit; and what research is being carried out on (i) the number, (ii) costs and (iii) effects of such adjustments.

<p><a name="st_300"><a name="50714w32.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 It is the actual amount of a tax credit award that is in payment that is taken into account when assessing entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit. There is, therefore, no retrospective reassessment of those benefits because a tax credit award has been overpaid during a past period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w32.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_222">The housing benefit or council tax benefit claim does, however, need to be reassessed if the amount of a tax credit changes because, for example, of an overpayment of the tax credit. This is to ensure that housing benefit or council tax benefit takes account of the actual amount of tax credit in payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50714w32.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_223">No assessment has been made of the cost implications to local authorities of readjusting payments of housing benefit or council tax benefit because of the correction of an overpaid tax credit award. This is because such a change is only one of many that may mean a housing benefit or council tax benefit claim needs to be reassessed. However, local authorities have received additional administration subsidy in recognition of the ongoing costs to local authorities of administering claims which include tax credits.
