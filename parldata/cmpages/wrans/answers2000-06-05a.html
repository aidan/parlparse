 Mr. McDonald's report is being published today and copies are being placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00605w01.html_para2">I note that Mr. McDonald has said that the military authorities have continued to respond constructively to his independently developed assessment of their role in the complaints system, and that the renewed priority given to training in the specific areas of complaint handling and complaint avoidance produced good results in 1999.
<P>

<a name="00605w01.html_para3">The Report of the Independent Assessor continues to provide valuable reassurances to both Government and the public that the army's complaints procedures stand scrutiny. The Government attach importance to this role and its statutory basis is to be continued through the Terrorism Bill, currently before the House of Lords.

<P>
<a name="00605w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am pleased to confirm that Joint Force Harrier was formed, under the command of Rear Admiral Iain Henderson, on 1 April this year. My hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces had the pleasure of attending the launch ceremonies at RAF Strike Command and RAF Wittering on 31 March.
<P>

<a name="00605w01.html_para10">Joint Force Harrier combines the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier and RAF Harrier squadrons in a single force which is able to operate from land bases or carriers, as the recent operation off Sierra Leone has demonstrated. In 2003 both fleets will be co-located at RAF Cottesmore and RAF Wittering to fully realise the significant operational benefits that the creation of Joint Force Harrier will bring.

 Between April 1999 and March 2000 RAF aircraft flew a total of 2,683 sorties in the no-fly zones; 450 in the Northern no-fly zone and 2,233 in the Southern no-fly zone.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on the destruction of radioactive materials held by his Department.  [122662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The primary legislation controlling the holding and disposal of radioactive materials is the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and its associated Exemption Orders. Although the Act does not apply to Ministry of Defence activities, my Department's policy is 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 4W</I><P>
to apply standards and arrangements which, so far as is reasonably practicable, are at least as good as those required by the Act. This policy is promulgated in the Departmental Environmental Manual, Joint Services Publication 418, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

<a name="00605w01.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We have sold former married quarters in Hendon to the Notting Hill Housing Trust and in Mill Hill to Annington Homes as part of the sale of all married quarters in England and Wales in 1996. We do not know how many of these are empty once they are no longer our responsibility.

<P>
26. <a name="00605w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions he has had with the Environment Agency following the decision to refer for judicial review the activities carried out at AWE Aldermaston.  [122665]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Ministers have had no discussions with the Environment Agency on this matter since the EA granted a licence to AWE plc to operate at Aldermaston. However, officials of the Ministry of Defence and of the Environment Agency hold regular discussions as part of the normal course of business and these have included the judicial review of the Environment Agency's recent discharge authorisations for the Aldermaston site.

<a name="00605w01.html_wqn15"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of procedures adopted by the private operators of the Aldermaston site to give his Department temporary ownership of radioactive substances; and if he will make a statement.  [122573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I presume that the question refers to erroneous reports that the Ministry of Defence sought to avoid public scrutiny of measures to dispose of some slightly radioactive material at its DERA Shoeburyness site. In fact, the transfer of material was carried out only after the Environment Agency (EA), following a period for consultation with local authorities, had granted approval on the basis that the environmental impact of disposal in this fashion is minimal. The material in question is conventional high explosive removed from obsolete nuclear weapons, dismantled by the Atomic Weapons Establishment, and only contains small traces of 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 5W</I><P>
radioactive tritium. The EA provides independent monitoring at the Shoeburyness facility to ensure that there is no risk to staff or the public from these activities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of how much NATO ordnance was <i>(a)</i> directed against imposter targets and <i>(b)</i> dumped unexploded in the Adriatic as a result of bad weather during the war in Kosovo.  [122666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 NATO's assessment of the air campaign was made public by the then Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Wesley Clark, in September last year. It is the most comprehensive assessment undertaken and is explained in detail on NATO's website www.nato.int/ kosovo/press/p990916a.htm. The Ministry of Defence has not undertaken a separate assessment of how much NATO ordnance was directed against decoy or imposter targets.
<P>

<a name="00605w02.html_para0">It would not be appropriate to comment on behalf of other nations, but no UK aircraft dropped ordnance in the Adriatic during the campaign.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the number of opportunities for training with live ammunition in each of the last five years.  [122667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Service personnel are trained, individually and collectively, in all aspects of their roles, and live firing of weapons is one element of a balanced training programme which is subject to the constraints of time, money and infrastructure. The opportunities available to military personnel to train with live ammunition vary according to the specialisation of the individual concerned, and also according to the operational role of the formed unit to which that individual belongs. Because most live firing is carried out at unit level, the information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A total of 3,975 Territorial Army soldiers have been mobilised for duty in the Balkans since December 1995. Their role has been to provide individual reinforcements with a variety of skills to Regular Units on operational tours, and fill a number of staff appointments in the various Headquarters in the Balkans.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the use of United Kingdom forces in Sierra Leone.  [122669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 United Kingdom Forces deployed to Sierra Leone in early May have done an excellent job. They deployed to get UK nationals out and, in securing the airport at Lungi, they were able to help UNAMSIL while reinforcements flew in. The operation has been a success: hundreds of UK nationals were evacuated; thousands of 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 6W</I><P>
UN reinforcements have flown in. The arrival of capable, well-equipped reinforcements has helped create a much more stable and secure environment than when UK forces arrived. We expect to be able to have withdrawn the bulk of our troops from Sierra Leone by mid-June. We will, however, continue to provide UK military observers to UNAMSIL and training and advice to the Government of Sierra Leone, as part of our wider programme of assistance.

 We expect the bulk of British forces deployed to Sierra Leone, including 42 Commando, to leave by mid-June.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his oral statement of 23 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 863-65, concerning Sierra Leone, what United Kingdom weapons and ammunition will be issued to any military organisation other than the Sierra Leone army; and how the distribution of such arms will be controlled and monitored.  [124055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Light weapons and ammunition will be distributed to Government of Sierra Leone Armed Forces only. Their distribution will be overseen by UK military personnel in Sierra Leone.

 The peacekeeping role of UK forces was set out in the Strategic Defence Review. There has been no change to that role in the last three years. As my hon.

<P>

<a name="00605w02.html_para1">The prevention, containment and resolution of conflict is a vital element in the maintenance of international stability and security to which this Government are committed.

 The situation in Kosovo has been a major subject for discussion among NATO Defence Ministers since the crisis began.

 The numbers of munitions used during Operation Allied Force were published by the Ministry of Defence last year, in my right hon. Friend, the then Secretary of State, Lord Robertson's account of the Kosovo crisis. Details of the percentage of our stockpile this expenditure represented would assist a potential adversary to assess our operational capability. I am therefore withholding this information in accordance with exemption 1 (Defence, Security and International Relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 Since this Government took office, the Ministry of Defence has received three written Parliamentary Questions calling for the award of a medal for service in the Suez Canal Zone in the early 1950s. We have also received 229 Parliamentary Inquiries from 175 hon. Members, and my officials have dealt with 164 letters from 71 members of the public. Five Early Day Motions have been tabled. In March 1998, my predecessor held a meeting with a delegation of veterans at which he was handed a petition containing some 20,000 names, and in March this year, I held a meeting with two hon. Members with an interest in this subject.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what guidance he gives to the Defence Housing Executive and Defence Estates concerning the disposal of surplus housing stock.  [123873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w04.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Defence Housing Executive is required to dispose of as much surplus housing stock as is compatible with meeting its principle function of providing housing for entitled and eligible Service personnel and their families at their place of work.
<P>

<a name="00605w04.html_para0">The bulk of Service families accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales was sold to Annington Homes Ltd. (AHL) in 1996. The Ministry of Defence leases back those properties it needs to house Service families. Properties which become surplus to military requirements are handed back to AHL for disposal.
<P>

<a name="00605w04.html_para1">Surplus housing which does not form part of the underlease with AHL, including all that in Scotland, is dealt with by Defence Estates (DE) in accordance with Chapter 32 of Government Accounting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many MOD properties in Scotland are used for civilian and irregular occupancies; and how many such properties he expects to be disposed of in the next three years.  [123914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w04.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Of the total number of 5,728 Service Families Accommodation (SFA) held by the Ministry of Defence in Scotland, 51 are occupied by Irregular Occupants and 136 are let to MOD and other non-entitled civilians. There is no intention to dispose of these properties at present although plans continue to evolve in the light of developing demand and it is possible that such properties may be included in those identified for disposal during the next three years.
<P>

<a name="00605w04.html_para2">A further 173 properties are let to housing associations. Negotiations are continuing for the disposal of 118 let properties at Helensburgh and it is hoped these will be completed within three months. The remaining 55 let properties at Forres have been handed over to Defence Estates for disposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 To the best of my knowledge, the Ministry of Defence has no requirement to issue any forms for completion by charities and other voluntary organisations in relation to their charitable functions. However, the Department purchases services from a number of charities, and some forms may need to be completed, for example for invoicing purposes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence undertakes limited scientific work involving the use of animals for defence research purposes. This work is carried out on behalf of the Department by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) mainly at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector at Porton Down, but also to a lesser extent at the Centre for Human Sciences at Alverstoke. The research programme involving animals is 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 18W</I><P>
concerned wholly with providing the UK's Armed Forces with safe and effective protection against hazards they may encounter while carrying out their duties. The Ministry of Defence does not use animals in the development or evaluation of weapons and we continue to seek alternatives to the use of animals in experimentation wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="00605w05.html_para2">Research using animals within DERA is conducted strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under which the Home Office licences and oversees all such activity. In addition, an independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee was appointed in 1996 in response to public and Parliamentary concern over the use of animals in research. Its purpose is to keep animal care and welfare arrangements under review within DERA. A report by this Committee is published annually and a copy placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00605w05.html_para3">The only research involving animals currently being undertaken by the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector at Porton Down on behalf of other countries is a study of the efficacy of prospective vaccines against a potential biological warfare agent.

<a name="00605w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Surgical Training Exercises in Denmark use pigs as surgical models because they are considered to have the closest physiological response to humans and are similar in size and weight. The pigs are deeply anaesthetised and then wounded by Danish Armed Forces' marksmen using weapons of three different calibres. Each animal is then given medical treatment as if it were a human casualty wounded in battle. Throughout, the pigs remain deeply anaesthetised and are humanely killed at the end of the exercise without regaining consciousness. Veterinary staff are in attendance at all times during the exercise and may withdraw an animal at any point for any reason.

<i>[holding answer 19 May 2000]:</i> The Ministry of Defence requires a Strategic Sealift service which is based on the availability of six ships on graduated notice of call-up for Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF) operations. The Ministry of Defence cannot predict when this requirement may arise. In addition, during those periods when there are no JRRF operations, the Ministry of Defence will need to employ on average about four vessels to carry out routine tasks such as supporting exercises or transporting freight.

Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics.

Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or period of medical/social suspension.<P>

<P>
<a name="00605w08.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The measures taken by the National Health Service net contractors were at no charge to the NHS. Any costs at NHS trust and health authorities would be largely in the time of personnel as a part of their normal duties to manage local e-mail services and have not been identified separately.
<P>

<a name="00605w08.html_para0">NHSnet provides controls for network access between organisations, including transfer of e-mails between NHSnet and external systems that are passed through a secure gateway between NHSnet and the internet. Management of the gateway is the responsibility of the NHSnet service providers under the supervision of the NHS Information Authority. The NHS Information Authority maintains close liaison with the service providers and users of NHSnet services to ensure that information about virus attacks and appropriate countermeasures are disseminated rapidly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what plans he has to commission an independent survey into the incidence of lameness in the United Kingdom broiler chicken flock; and if he will make a statement;  [122557]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps he is planning to take to persuade the European Commission to propose a directive to address the health and welfare issues raised by the recent report of the Commission's Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on the Welfare of Chickens Kept for Meat Production (Broilers); and if he will make a statement.  [122556]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have made clear their wish to improve standards of broiler welfare.
<P>

<a name="00605w09.html_para9">The report from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare (SCAHAW) on broiler chicken production usefully identifies and assesses the issues. It should enable the Commission now to bring forward proposals for EU standards, an approach which we much prefer to acting unilaterally: it should bring real welfare improvements without putting British producers at a competitive disadvantage in relation to their continental counterparts. We look forward to seeing proposals from the Commission in the light of the report. In preparation for this we shall carefully study the content of the report and the papers to which it refers.
<P>

<a name="00605w09.html_para10">The report recognises, as do the Government, that leg disorders can be a major cause of poor welfare in broilers. A five-year industry survey in this country on broiler leg health should be nearing completion. The Farm Animal Welfare Council to whom the industry is reporting will carefully consider the survey, together with an independent evaluation of the results. I have written to both FAWC and the industry to make clear my concern that this exercise should be swiftly concluded so that we can determine what should be our next steps on leg health and what provisions we should be looking to secure in the EU negotiation. It is essential that we have FAWC's views before we consult on and determine these matters.
<P>

<a name="00605w09.html_para11">The SCAHAW report also makes clear that the subjective nature of the widely used gait scoring system leads to difficulties in making direct comparisons between different studies employing this technique. As a result, the report suggests the need to develop objective 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 35W</I><P>
measurement systems and to carry out systematic epidemiological studies. In this context, the Government already have in train a number of research projects on broiler leg health, including the development of other quantitative methods of assessing the extent of lameness in broilers.
<P>

<a name="00605w09.html_para12">Meanwhile, the State Veterinary Service continues to carry out random visits to broiler units to assess all aspects of welfare including lameness, litter quality, and ventilation. We are also in the process of drawing up a new Broiler Welfare Code, which takes on board a number of the recommendations contained in FAWC's 1992 report. This is not a substitute for necessary EU action, but represents an important step we can take nationally in the meantime.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what assessment he has made of the effect of the charge for making a submission on the number of organisations making representations as part of the consultation regarding the addition of Chardon LL maize to the national seed list;  [122773]
<P>
<UL>(2) what factors he took into account in determining the level of charge levied on those wishing to make representations as part of the consultation regarding the addition of Chardon LL maize to the national seed list;  [122774]
<P>
(3) how many representations were received regarding the addition of Chardon LL maize to the national seed list prior to the closing date for the consultation.  [122776]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There is a statutory requirement to pay a fee for making written representations (&#163;30) or requesting a hearing (&#163;60) about the proposal to add Chardon LL to the National List. A substantial number of representations (227) and requests for a hearing (68) have been received which will ensure that Ministers receive a wide range of views and evidence about the proposed decision.
<P>

<a name="00605w10.html_para0">The requirement for these statutory fees is set out in the Seeds (National List of Varieties) Regulations 1982 (as amended) and the level of fees is set in the Seeds (National List of Varieties) (Fees) Regulations 1994 (as amended). These fees were introduced many years ago, prior to the advent of genetically modified plant varieties, to help meet the cost of running the National List representations and hearings system. The representations fee was increased to its current level of &#163;30 from &#163;25 in 1999, and the hearings fee was increased to its current level of &#163;60 from &#163;55 in 1999, in line with general increases in National List fees. They apply equally to GM or conventionally bred varieties.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 36W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00605w10.html_para1">The National List system does not itself address the safety aspects of GM traits. This is dealt with under quite separate legislation. No GM plant variety may be proposed for addition to the National List until the appropriate GM consents have been obtained and no charge is made to anyone objecting to the DETR or the FSA about the approval of GM crops or foods.

 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> We estimate that at least 10,000 Kosovar Albanian civilians were killed in Kosovo between June 1998 and June 1999. This figure is based upon a variety of sources, including debriefing of refugees, eye witness accounts, reports from international and non-governmental organisations and the media.

 We are very concerned at reports that British weapons may be in the hands of child soldiers. This is why we sought and secured from the Government of Sierra Leone assurances that any UK-supplied weapons will be used only in accordance with established human rights principles and humanitarian law; and why the release programme of light weapons to the Government of Sierra Leone, as announced by the Defence Secretary on 23 May, will be carefully supervised by British military personnel on the ground with a view to ensuring that any British weapons only go to adult soldiers of the Sierra Leone army for training or for legitimate operational requirements.

But more work needs to be done to ensure that the end product fulfils the remit agreed by Heads of Government at the Cologne European Council last June.

 Full information on the purchase cost of small incinerators is not held, but we believe the cost of a new animal carcase incinerated under 50kg/hr capacity is of the order of &#163;2,000-&#163;10,000.

 No assessment has be made of the impact of the proposed waste incineration directive on farm costs in general. The cost implications of the proposed waste incineration directive for the sort of small-scale animal carcase incinerators which may be operated on farms was considered by Entec UK Ltd. as part of the cost-benefit analysis work undertaken on behalf of my Department (copies of which are in the House Library). They have estimated on the basis of a 100 kg/hr unit that the capital compliance cost in respect of combustion requirements, abatement plant, monitoring equipment and spillage control for incinerators in the under 50 kg/hr capacity category would be approximately &#163;230,000 with annual operating costs of approximately &#163;12,000. We would expect farmers to look for alternative options rather than paying such sums. We recognise that this will involve some cost, but nowhere near &#163;230,000.

 Several complaints were made between 1993 to 1995, all of which were investigated by the Environment Agency. Following a complaint in July 1995 the Environment Agency issued an enforcement notice. The operator complied by introducing controls on the blending and checking of waste. These modifications were carried out in November 1998. The Environment Agency is currently investigating a complaint made in April 2000 and will consider appropriate action in line with its Enforcement and Prosecution Policy when the investigation is complete.

 We understand that the US Federal Government's proposal to significantly reduce or eliminate MTBE in petrol--which had been actively encouraged in a number of US States for air quality reasons--has been made because of concerns about MTBE in groundwater. At the same time, the Federal Government have proposed that air quality benefits gained through use of MTBE--primarily reductions in carbon monoxide emissions--be preserved through the use of alternative, renewable fuel additives such as ethanol. This proposal has been made in the light of circumstances pertaining in parts of the United States and which may differ from those in many parts of Europe, including the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 24 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 701W, if <i>(a)</i> back-up power for controls was required at the Byker Heat Station during the 1995 failure and <i>(b)</i> back-up is required and available now; for what reason the releases to air following the failure cannot be quantified; and what assessment he has made of the extent to which the failure to quantify such releases constitutes a breach of the operating licence.  [123922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In 1995 electrical power was supplied from the national grid and by the plant's own generator. As power is no longer generated on site, the alternative power source is no longer available. The authorisation issued by the Environment Agency does not specifically require back-up power.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 60W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00605w16.html_para0">The releases could not be quantified, as both the pollutant concentration and their flow rates changed continuously throughout the 15 minute incident. The amount released was non-quantified and did not constitute a notifiable release; the then regulator HMIP took no action. Authorisation conditions normally take account of transient conditions such as unpredicted power failure, and this did not constitute a breach of the authorisation.

 Responsibility for the safe maintenance of platforms and their interface with trains rests with the infrastructure controller and train operators and not with the shadow Strategic Rail Authority.
<P>

<a name="00605w17.html_para3">The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Railway Inspectorate monitors safety on the railways and enforces safety legislation. HSE has published "Railway Safety Principles and Guidance" (RSPG) which covers the issue of platform gaps for new and altered works. Any infrastructure developed outside this guidance must be agreed with the HSE. Additionally, Railtrack publishes criteria on this subject in the form of Railway Group Standards. Compliance with these Group Standards generally ensures compliance with criteria set out in the HSE Guidance. HSE is aware that historically the stepping criteria set out in RSPG are not complied with at a number of locations. It was this knowledge which led to the HSE criteria being developed. Railtrack is implementing a programme which is intended, among other things, to address the problem of large gaps between trains and platforms at stations. Some work has already been carried out; the programme is risk-based and prioritised. HSE is monitoring progress.
<P>

<a name="00605w17.html_para4">HSE's records are insufficiently detailed to provide information on locations where gaps may exceed particular dimensions. Railtrack's programme is intended to identify problem locations and to develop an action plan to deal with them.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the current limit for the gap between a train and a railway station platform; what representations his Department has received regarding the dangers of large gaps between platforms and trains; what the Government are doing to ensure that the gap between a railway station platform and the train is at a safe level; who is responsible for ensuring that the gap between a train and a railway station platform is at a safe level; and what recent recommendations he has received from the Health and Safety Executive with regard to the distance between a train and a railway station platform.  [124454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Railtrack, as infrastructure controller, is responsible for the safety of its infrastructure. There are no regulations which specify a maximum gap at the train/platform interface. However, the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Railway Inspectorate has published guidance documents entitled "Railway Safety Principles and Guidance" which provide an accepted standard of good practice for new or altered work within the railway industry. "Railway Safety Principles and Guidance Part 2 Section B: Guidance on stations" sets acceptable stepping criteria between trains and platforms, the maxima for these are:

developing a strategy of identifying and dealing with these on a prioritised basis. HSE is following this initiative closely to ensure that there is a satisfactory outcome.
<P>

<a name="00605w17.html_para7">These dimensions may only be exceeded when dispensation has been obtained from the Inspectorate. Warning notices reading 'Mind the Gap' with hatching along the platform edge, or other agreed measures for example, public announcements, may be required. HSE considers that to require the infrastructure controller or station operator to carry out work specifically to rectify platform gaps would not be reasonably practicable. HSE would however expect any planned alteration or new works around the train/platform interface to include a reduction in the gaps at interface.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question (123578) about the unemployment rate in pre-1997 travel-to-work areas in Scotland. I am replying in the Director's absence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ONS produces two measures of unemployment. The first is derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). It is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). This counts as unemployed people who are (a) without a paid job (b) available to start work within the next two weeks and (c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS also publishes the monthly number of people who are claiming unemployment-related benefits also known as the Claimant Count.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The definitions of travel-to-work areas that were used before 1997 are those first used in 1984. LFS data for 1984 travel-to-work areas are not available but figures for the claimant count can be obtained from the Nomis database at the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2000]:</i> Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.

 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> The Treasury uses a very wide range of statistics, many of which are collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Collection by the ONS is not specifically designed to produce statistics at the level of Parliamentary Constituencies, though statistics that the ONS can often provide at this level include economic status (employed, unemployed, inactive), the claimant count, employee jobs, average earnings, and Census data. Other government departments can also supply some statistics by Parliamentary Constituency. However, a comprehensive list of all statistics used by the Treasury that can be collated by Parliamentary Constituency is not held centrally, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The humanitarian situation in Mozambique has continued to improve as the flood waters have receded and road access has improved. However, the continued provision of emergency assistance to those worst affected by the floods will remain essential while longer term rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts get into full swing. For example, the World Food Programme is continuing to make food deliveries to over 500,000 people, which includes some 10,000 still accommodated in displacement camps and unable to return to their homes due to the residual flooding.

<a name="00605w23.html_para16">Those who have returned home are beginning to rebuild their houses and plant crops. Many have been provided with materials and tools provided under relief projects.

 Uganda received debt relief of $347 million in 1998 under the original HIPC initiative, and, earlier this year, qualified for a further $656 million relief under the revised HIPC framework. The Government of Uganda was scheduled to come to a meeting with the Paris Club of official bilateral creditors on 16 May to implement this element of their debt relief. However, in the week before the meeting, we, and a number of other Governments, were concerned to receive reports of Uganda's role in fighting at Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was therefore agreed that the implementation of Uganda's debt relief should be postponed. I am pleased that the Government of Uganda are responding to these concerns. We hope that the Paris Club meeting will be rescheduled soon. Uganda continues to receive interim relief on its debt service payments to the IMF and World bank.

They established that there were adequate food stocks available within the country to cope with current needs. Hunger and cases of malnutrition have been reported some two months ahead of the usual pattern. The situation is particularly bad in rebel-held areas of the north and east where food stocks have been severely depleted through looting. Humanitarian agencies are constrained from assisting until access becomes possible.

<a name="00605w24.html_para3">Our aim is to help build and sustain effective and equitable education systems which give priority to primary education for all. This requires a shift from the traditional projects-based approach to a sector-wide approach to education, with development agencies working together around a focused, agreed strategy drawn up by the Government of the country concerned. Uganda is a good example. In collaboration with five other donors and the Government of Uganda, DFID has played a key role in the establishment of a sector-wide approach to education, resulting in 1998 in its largest ever commitment to a programme in Africa (&#163;67 million) towards the education sector support programmes. This will provide flexible budget support to the Government for five years.

 The Government announced in December 1999 that they will provide 100 per cent. relief for qualifying HIPC countries on their remaining debts owed to the ECGD. Aid debts have already been cancelled. This relief will be available, on a conditional basis, from Decision Point until Completion Point, when it will become irrevocable. By 23 May, Uganda, Bolivia, Mauritania, Tanzania and Mozambique had reached their Decision Point under the revised HIPC framework, and so qualified for full relief on their debts to ECGD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w24.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has been working since 1997 to strengthen and improve the three main elements of international disaster response. Firstly, we are working with the Red Cross Societies to improve their preparedness and response to disasters, specifically in poor countries. Secondly, we are working with United Nations organisations such as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme, United Nations Children's Fund and United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to improve their coordination and improve the speed and effectiveness of their responses. And, thirdly, we are working with the international non- governmental organisations to agree minimum standards of assistance that those affected by disasters can expect to receive.
<P>

<a name="00605w24.html_para7">Our aim is to build a better international humanitarian system but until that is achieved there is a role for donor Governments, such as the UK, to fill gaps in rapid direct response. Therefore my Department maintains an extensive capacity to respond to emergencies around the clock. The decision on whether an operational response is justified and, if so, in what form, is based on assessed needs on the ground and the operational resources available locally or regionally.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> In the year to date, the official sponsors of the Millennium Experience account for the majority of bookings (47 per cent.) for corporate hospitality events. The bulk of the remaining bookings (30 per cent.) are made through NMEC's corporate hospitality partners: Business Pursuits; Cavendish Hospitality; Langston Scott Limited; Letheby & Christopher and Mark Butler Associates. A smaller number of one-off bookings (23 per cent.) from within NMEC and from charities and other third parties, such as the TUC, account for the remainder of the total.

 My Department has not sought external legal advice on this issue. The view of the Government's legal advisers is that the films shown in cinemas are not covered by Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) (the provisions relating to goods, facilities and services). However, cinema proprietors have the same responsibilities under Part III of the Act as other providers of services to the public. These provisions make it unlawful for service providers to discriminate against disabled people by: refusing them service; providing them service on worse terms; or providing a lower standard of service. In addition they must make reasonable adjustments when their services are impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use.

 The roles of Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (previously National Heritage) and Chairman of the Millennium Commission are separate and distinct, but have run in tandem since the Millennium Commission was established in 1994. The Millennium Commission is an independent body, with the status of a body corporate. Each of the nine Commissioners, including myself as Chairman, have equal status.
<P>

<a name="00605w25.html_para3">Both roles are governed by strict rules covering conflicts of interest--namely the Ministerial Code: A Code of conduct and Guidance on Procedures for Ministers; and the Code of Conduct for members of the Millennium Commission.

 No specific definition of distance is used to determine access to leisure centres. Sport England have established a Facilities Planning Model to help assess the extent of under provision of different kinds of sports facility. That model currently uses driving time rather than distance. It is currently being updated to take greater account of other modes of transport.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) if additional pension entitlement based on earnings will be calculated automatically; or if each pensioner will be requested to claim individually;  [124200]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The additional pension (SERPS) component of a State Retirement Pension is calculated automatically by the National Insurance Recording System (NIRS) computer. There is no need for a pensioner to request separately payment of SERPS--completion of one claim form suffices for all components which can make up a pension with the exception of a claim for a dependency increase when a separate claim form must be completed.
<P>

<a name="00605w26.html_para8">Most people who are entitled to both basic pension and additional pension (SERPS) have that entitlement available to receive in time for their first pension pay day. There are however about 60,000 claims a year where NIRS has not been able to supply the SERPS rate. The principal reason for this is the existence on the person's National Insurance account of a discrepancy regarding the time they were contracted out of SERPS. That discrepancy must be resolved before NIRS can provide the SERPS rate. Putting right the discrepancy falls to the Inland Revenue's Contracted Out Employments Group (COEG) but the delayed implementation of NIRS2 has meant they have not until recently been able to do this. As a result the Benefits Agency and COEG have carried out clerical calculations to ensure that as far as possible pensioners receive their SERPS entitlements on time. There are 22,000 claims waiting for a clerical calculation.
<P>

<a name="00605w26.html_para9">The Benefits Agency expects to complete its recovery from the effects of the delayed implementation of NIRS2 by the end of this year including cases where there has been a delay in processing the additional pension (SERPS). All clerical calculations will be compared with the NIRS2 calculations.

Subject to these caveats, we estimate it could cost up to &#163;160 million. Based on current data, we estimate that the cost of removing the Single Room Rent restriction in 2001-02 would be &#163;140 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator has not made any such assessments. The Police Research Group report, "Clubs, Drugs and Doormen" published in 1998, highlighted how serious a problem drugs could be in clubs when door staff are involved in drug dealing. The Co-ordinator has held meetings with parties involved in this sector and has encouraged the work of industry bodies such as the British Entertainment and Discotheque Association and partnerships between local authorities, the police, Drug Action Teams, venue managers and owners to disrupt the selling of drugs in venues, improve the standard of security staff and club mangers, and challenge the corrupting influence which drug dealing can have on door supervision, and supported their efforts to ensure that dance events are as safe and well organised as possible. The Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator supports the Government's proposed legislation to regulate the private security industry, including the licensing of security staff employment in night clubs and similar premises.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary last year published a White Paper, "The Government's Proposals for Regulation of the Private Security Industry in England and Wales". This proposed that people employed in the private security industry, including those in managerial and supervisory positions and directors, should require a licence from a new Private Security Industry Authority. The licensing process would include a criminal record check. These proposals specifically included security staff employed in night clubs and similar premises. Responses received to the White Paper have been under consideration and my right hon. Friend will announce his conclusions shortly. We have made it clear that we intend to introduce legislation to regulate the private security industry as soon as parliamentary time permits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reasons the UK voted in favour of a postponement of an EU marketing ban on cosmetics tested on animals on 5 May.  [124052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w29.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government are very serious about animal welfare, and already have a voluntary ban on testing on animals of cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients. However, Government policy is to ensure not only a strong commitment to animal welfare but that our regulatory framework is in full compliance with our WTO obligations. Internal advice has confirmed the European Commission's assessment that a marketing ban would risk challenge under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. In addition, there were concerns that the 6th Amendment would be legally and practically unenforceable.
<P>

<a name="00605w29.html_para2">A 7th Amendment to the cosmetics directive has recently been transmitted to the Council and European Parliament by the European Commission. This Amendment aims to introduce a ban on animal testing in the EU rather than a marketing ban and is WTO compatible. The two-year deferment of the entry into force of the 6th Amendment should allow sufficient time to enable the 7th Amendment to be adopted. I believe that the 7th Amendment will offer a better level of animal welfare in the EU as a marketing ban would have offered as it will introduce a total ban in the EU on animal testing (in relation to cosmetic products and the ingredients contained therein).
<P>

<a name="00605w29.html_para3">On 5 May EU member states voted unanimously (one member state abstained) in favour of deferring the entry into force of the 6th Amendment of the cosmetics directive.

 The process of consultation of the local population, by consultants appointed by the Project Owner DSI, commenced in December 1999 and this process is continuing. We await the production of a Resettlement Action plan.
<P>

<a name="00605w29.html_para7">In order to provide additional professional assistance to DSI in the planning of resettlement and compensation, the Swiss Export Credit Agency, as the leader of the eight agencies involved of which the UK is one, has recruited Dr. Ayse Kudat for an initial period of two years. Dr. Kudat is an eminent environmental sociologist, and was until this month a senior staff member at the World Bank.
<P>

<a name="00605w29.html_para8">The expertise of Dr. Kudat will help ensure that the resettlement programme will reflect internationally accepted practice, which is the first of the four requirements set out in the announcement made by my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 21 December 1999.

(3) which Departments of Government were consulted about the advisability of providing ECGD cover for the building of the Ilisu Dam; and on what dates.  [124182]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The following Departments have been consulted about relevant aspects of the proposed Ilisu Dam project: H.M. Treasury, Department of Trade and Industry, British Trade International, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development, Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions and Department for Culture, Media and Sport. These exchanges began in January 1999, although DCMS were not involved until later. ECGD continues to maintain regular contact with FCO, DTI, DETR, DCMS and British Trade International. DFID has not been involved since July 1999, as Turkey is not one of their key partner countries.

<a name="00605w29.html_para9">There were intensive exchanges of correspondence between the Ministers most concerned during November and December 1999 prior to the announcement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 21 December 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) for which areas of research covered by each Research Council the budget has contracted in each year since 1994;  [122134]

 The evolving nature of the Research Councils' programmes makes it impossible to provide consistent expenditure figures for all programme areas over the period requested. In particular, the Economic and Social Research Council established a new set of themes in 1995-96 and the Medical Research Council made major changes to the structure of its portfolio in 1995-96 and again in 1999-2000. The available information for each of the six Councils is set out, in cash terms, in the table.

<a name="00605w29.html_para10">Strictly speaking, there are no programme areas where the expenditure has diminished in each year over the period, although the Councils have increased the budgets for high priority programmes at the expense of certain others. For example, the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council has significantly enhanced its support for biomolecular science over the period, while keeping some other programmes broadly level in cash terms.
<P>

<a name="00605w29.html_para11">The uneven spend on PPARC particle physics is largely due to the timing of payments of the UK subscription to the CERN laboratory in Geneva.
<P>

<a name="00605w29.html_para12">Further details of individual programmes can be found in the Councils' Annual Reports, copies of which are in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w30.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2000]:</i> The most recent estimation we have of Business Link impact is from the Business Link Value for Money Evaluation, which relates to the period 1994 to 1997. This study was carried out in 1998 by independent consultants and is available from the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="00605w30.html_para0">It estimated that, during this period, the support provided by Business Links was responsible for generating more than 8000 jobs, &#163;1 billion extra turnover, &#163;30 million extra profits, &#163;145 million extra net assets and &#163;400 million extra exports nationally.

 My Department has recently prepared estimates of future energy use, covering selected years. Estimates have not been made for any other years. These have been made available in the form of a working paper, representing work in progress, entitled: "Energy Projections For The UK--Working Paper".
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para0">Copies of this document have been placed in the Library of the House. The following tables are extracted from Annexe D of the Working Paper. These set out the amounts of generation by type of fuel for two of the six scenarios examined in the Working Paper. As an example, in 2010, coal's share of generation varies between 10 and 22 per cent., that of gas between 45 per cent. and 59 per cent., while nuclear's share varies between 18 per cent. and 19 per cent.

 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> A Call for Proposals on the DTI's New and Renewable Energy (NRE) Programme was issued on 17 April 2000. As part of this Call, outline proposals were sought for research and development into fuel cells of all types, and particularly for stationary and transport applications. The Call itself, and guidance for proposers, may be found on the DTI's web pages at www.dti.gov.uk/renewable/ renew.htm. The closing submission date for this call was 1 June 2000. Notwithstanding this deadline, potential proposers are welcome to investigate other options for funding research and development projects relevant to fuel cells by contacting the Programme Manager of the DTI's Advanced Fuel Cells Programme (part of the New and Renewable Energy Programme) at ETSU.

 The Small Business Service has been set up, among other things, to help to make regulatory information, including employment legislation, more comprehensible and accessible to small firms. The SBS is looking at a number of ways in which this might be done including the possibilities presented by information technology. For example, they are piloting a new service on the internet called Small Business Start-Up Service (www.sbssonline.org/sbss/) which guides people wanting to start a business to relevant information including employees' rights. They have also recently published a guide to the regulatory requirements relating to employing staff which can also be accessed on the internet (www.dti.gov.uk/COMMS/employ?index.htm). The Department provides a wide range of information and guidance on the requirements of employment law,

including through its website (www.dti.gov.uk/er), and is currently developing further internet and interactive services. These will be made available by a number of routes, including through the SBS general advice and information service (www.businessadviceonline.org).

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans he has to exempt small businesses from <i>(a)</i> new and <i>(b)</i> existing regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [123869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w31.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government are always ready to consider exemptions as a policy option in relation to or existing regulations, but each case would need to be carefully looked at on its merits.

<a name="00605w31.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Pollard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures are being taken by the Small Business Service to reduce the administrative burden on small businesses.  [123868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w31.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Chief Executive of the Small Business Service (SBS) is a member of the Panel for Regulatory Accountability which is reviewing new and existing regulations in Government Departments.
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para2">The SBS has a particular duty on behalf of small businesses to examine regulatory proposals put forward by Government Departments to ensure that they do not impose an unnecessary or disproportionate burden on the small businesses community, that compliance is made easier through the provision of comprehensible and accessible guidance, and that the enforcement regime is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para3">The SBS will also undertake research to establish a Regulation Index showing the cumulative burden of regulation on small businesses and to inform priorities for simplifying existing regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress has been made in enabling <i>(a)</i> consumers and <i>(b)</i> small businesses to have access to their credit reference files.  [123870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w31.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The rights of individuals and sole traders to access financial information held by credit reference agencies have now been consolidated under the Data Protection Act 1998. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 continues to contain rights to challenge the accuracy of such information. The Data Protection Commissioner is now responsible for supervising these rights. Partnerships and other unincorporated bodies have rights to this information under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Director General of Fair Trading supervises their rights.
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para4">We have also simplified the statement of rights on correcting wrong information which the agencies must provide in the Consumer Credit (Credit Reference Agency) Regulations 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w31.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government have set in place a policy framework, which is delivering macro-economic stability and helping to promote long-term investment and productivity; public finances are under control; inflation is historically low and expected to remain close to target.

<a name="00605w31.html_para5">Following Budget 2000, the business climate has never been better. Since 1997, the Government have cut the average corporation tax bill for small companies by nearly 25 per cent. Britain now has its lowest ever corporation rates for small companies and--with the 10p starting rate from April--the lowest starting rate in the EU.
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para6">We are also looking further to improve the infrastructure and ensure that small firms get the support they need. That is why we established the Small Business Service (SBS)--a key part of our strategy to create an entrepreneurial Britain. The SBS will act as a strong voice for small businesses at the heart of Government; help small firms meet the demands of regulation; and achieve a step change in the quality and consistency of advice and information available to small and medium-sized enterprises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w31.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Small Business Service, which became an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry in April 2000, is undertaking two significant activities aimed at improving access to, and quality of, advice services for small business.
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para7">The first is to provide an internet enabled network of knowledge and information for use by small businesses, business advisers and the local Business Link network.
<P>

<a name="00605w31.html_para8">The second activity is a radical redevelopment of the Business Link network including refocusing the remit of the Business Links so that they concentrate on delivering high quality solutions to their customers' needs; widening the customer base of the local network to include those who are at a disadvantage, for whatever reason, in starting up or running a business; and a rationalisation from 81 to 45 Business Links. Only organisations which can meet rigorous assessment criteria and successfully complete business plans will be awarded contracts from April 2001.

<P>
<a name="00605w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In November 1997 the Department agreed to provide launch investment of &#163;200 million to Rolls-Royce to assist with the development of the Trent series of large aeroengines. The conditions attached to the agreement are commercially confidential.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what reports he has received concerning the sale of Advanta Seeds UK's Hyota oil seed rape seeds found to be contaminated with GM herbicide-tolerant seeds; and what action he plans to take.  [123756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> The UK Government were informed on 17 April that stocks of oil seed rape seed sold by Advanta might contain low levels of GM material. In line with Government priorities to protect public health and the environment, the Department of Health and the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions sought urgent advice from the Food Standards Agency and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment respectively. The advice was that there were no risks to human health or the environment. Contamination of seed stocks is a MAFF responsibility, and last week the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced measures that the Government will take. DTI has no specific responsibility for any of the issues involved.

 In accordance with the internationally agreed format for publishing such information, my Department publishes each year figures for the total amount of plutonium held in the UK in unirradiated separated form as well as the total amount of plutonium estimated to be contained in spent civil reactor fuel.

This total is not further broken down into separate figures for individual countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) if he will list by field the number of licences issued by the Government for North Sea and Atlantic oil and gas exploration where no development has taken place;  [122832]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on the inspection and enforcement in respect of fallow fields in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf.  [122837]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="00605w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 May 2000]:</i> The Department of Trade and Industry classifies as "fallow" any block on the UKCS which is currently licensed and not in its initial term but which has seen no drilling activity for six years or more. A "fallow" discovery is one that was made six years or more ago but which has not yet been developed. (Acreage that has been determined as a field would not generally be classified as "fallow".)
<P>

<a name="00605w32.html_para2">193 significant discoveries made up to 31 December 1999 have not yet been developed. The definition of "significant" discoveries used here is based on flow rates achieved during well tests. It makes no attempt to take account of commercial viability. Work is proceeding on some of these discoveries to bring them to development, but in each case no Development Plan has yet been approved. These discoveries are not necessarily the same as those that are the subject of the Fallow Discoveries Initiative because many are less than six years old. They are as listed.

 The Postal Services Bill is going through Parliament and the new Consumer Council for Postal Services (CCPS) is expected to be in place by 1 January 2001. It has been widely accepted that the existing arrangements for consumer representation in postal services should be reviewed as part of the process of forming the new Council. In April, Peter Carr, Chairman of the Post Office Users' National Council (POUNC) and Chair designate of the CCPS, issued a consultation document that sought views from interested parties on the new regional structure for CCPS.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para2">It would be premature to make a statement until Peter Carr has had an opportunity to examine all the views he has received and has formally submitted his proposals to the Secretary of State for him to consider and approve.

<a name="00605w33.html_para3">As I mentioned in the "Conclusions in Response to the Public Consultation" on renewable energy, the Government are looking at the possibility of some limited additional support for offshore wind (and energy crops). The renewable energy industry has also been consulted as part of the DETR-led consultation on the Energy Efficiency Measures under the Climate Change Levy package, on how a part of the &#163;50 million Levy Fund might be used to promote renewables.

[123891]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w33.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Latvian study is of populations residing in close proximity to a military radio location station that operates a high power pulsed radar installation. The University of Berne study examined the local population residing in the vicinity of a high power short wave broadcast transmitter located at Schwarzenburg in Switzerland. Although the Schwarzenburg installation is also used for air radio and wireless telecommunications, the authors of the study note that these operate at far lower levels and suggest that they can be neglected. Thus neither study is directly relevant to radio telecommunications. I have nevertheless asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) for advice about these studies.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para4">The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP), chaired by Sir William Stewart, recommended a further review of possible health effects of mobile phone technology in three years time, or earlier if circumstances demand it.

 My Department collects information about pupils in maintained and independent schools in the Annual Schools Census. Information about Government- funded places in private nursery schools, pre-schools and playgroups, and independent schools, which are registered with Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships, is obtained from the Early Years Census.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para5">I understand that the Pre-school Learning Alliance (PLA) does not collect information about pre-school places, but it does conduct an annual survey of a sample of pre-schools asking whether they think their group is threatened with closure. The PLA's most recent survey published in March was based on a sample of 722 pre-schools and playgroups.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para6">We commissioned an independent review of pre-schools and playgroups last summer to look at what further steps could be taken to help pre-schools and playgroups play their full part in the expansion of early education and child care services, and have responded positively to its recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w33.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2000]:</i> The Government provided specific funding for new, free early education places for three-year-olds for the first time in 1999-2000, although some local education authorities did provide free places before that. The following table shows the number of free early education places for three-year-olds funded by means of Nursery Education Grant in spring term 2000, the latest period for which figures are available. 65 local education authorities received grants for the spring term. From the summer term 2000, all will do so. In 1999-2000, 80 per cent. of the new Government-funded places were in the private and voluntary sectors. &#163;100 million is being provided for 2000-01 which will fund an additional 83,000 places.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para7">These figures do not include funding for provision for under-fives in the maintained sector made through the Standard Spending Assessment. We will shortly be publishing data from the annual Schools Census on the

<a name="00605w33.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many three-year-olds had free early-years education places providing five or more sessions of education per week <i>(a)</i> in 1979, <i>(b)</i> in 1990 and <i>(c)</i> for each year from 1992 to 1999 (i) in England and (ii) in each local education authority in London.  [122709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w33.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 May 2000]:</i> The information is not available in the form requested. Up to September 1999, 'free' places for three-year-olds were available only in maintained nursery and primary schools funded directly by local education authorities. Since September 1999 specific funding by the Government for three-year-olds has been extended to private, voluntary and independent providers via the Early-Years Development and Childcare Partnerships in 65 local education authorities, including 18 London authorities. From summer 2000 this extra funding will be available in all local authority areas.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para9">The available information on the numbers of three-year-olds in early-years provision for England and in each local education authority in London is shown in the following tables. Table 1 gives the number of children in free early-years education places from 1996 to 2000. Table 2 shows the number of new funded places for three-year-olds being created in all sectors over the next year, including projected figures for summer 2000, autumn 2000 and spring 2001.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para10">The new places are supported by &#163;100 million of funding. Half of all three-year-olds will have access to a free place by spring 2001, and the Government are well on track to meet the 2002 target of expanding overall nursery provision to 66 per cent. of three-year-olds.

 <i>[holding answers 17 May 2000, 18 May 2000 and 22 May 2000]:</i> The following table shows the number of early education places for three and four-year-olds that have been taken up in each year since 1997. It also shows the amount of funding the Government have made available to fund these places through either Nursery Education Grant or the Under Five's Education Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) sub block, which has been increased by &#163;253 million from &#163;1,089 million in 1997-98 to &#163;1,342 million in 2000-01, and on current plans is estimated to increase to &#163;1,430 million in 2001-02. The 1998 figure represents an increase of 25 per cent. in the number of free, early education places taken up in 1992.

 Information is not available in the form requested. The Department does collect information on playgroups and other day care facilities, which is published in Statistical Volume "Children's Day Care Facilities" (as at 31 March) which is available from the Library. This shows that the total number of places in pre-schools and playgroups fell from 383,700 in 1997 to

347,200 in 1999, a reduction of 36,500. This was due to the introduction of vouchers by the previous Administration. However, since 1999, information from Early Years Development Plans indicates that an extra 33,000 places will have been created in playgroups and the voluntary sector by Spring 2001 as a result of the introduction of early years development partnerships.

<P>
<a name="00605w33.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The independent review of pre-schools and playgroups, commissioned by the Government last year, included several recommendations concerning funding for early years. The main recommendation called for consultation on the feasibility of a funding system to replace the nursery grants and child care grant, which would allow greater flexibility to meet local needs, and greater stability for pre-schools and playgroups. The progress report, published last week, set out the current position: the Department will, as part of its own spending review, evaluate whether changes can be made to the current arrangements to further assist those nursery settings outside the maintained sector. We expect to complete this by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="00605w33.html_para15">In response to other funding recommendations in the report, we have announced funding of &#163;500,000 for a further scheme to assist pre-schools and playgroups facing financial difficulties, to give them a further breathing space as policy initiatives work through to individual groups, and &#163;250,000 for projects to help pre-schools and playgroups develop, in partnership with others, as the early education and care places expand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w34.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The role of the South West task groups is to collect information from current funding bodies (such as TECs, FEFC, and local education authorities) on the range and volume of provision currently being funded in each Learning and Skills Council area. The aim is to ensure that sufficient funds will be available in each area to at least maintain current levels of provision and to avoid any disruption to learners from the introduction of the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00605w34.html_para0">There is no requirement for further education colleges to be represented on task groups since they are not funding bodies. However, a representative of the Association of Colleges is a member of the Regional Transition Steering Group, which oversees the transition to the new arrangements in the South West. Similar arrangements apply in other regions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what financial support is available to students in the first 28 weeks of leave of absence for the purpose of medical treatment or therapy.  [123761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w35.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Under the Education (Student Support) Regulations, full-time students in England and Wales who are absent from their course because of illness are entitled to continue to receive student support for the first 60 days of absence. Before academic year 1998-99 this was only 28 days. Local education authorities have the discretion to decide whether such students continue to receive support after the first 60 days' absence. Among the factors they will consider in coming to a decision is the possibility of financial hardship.
<P>

<a name="00605w35.html_para6">Additional assistance for students studying in the UK who are absent from their course due to illness may be available through the Access Funds. These allow universities and colleges to provide discretionary support for students in particular need; and a total of &#163;76.4 million has been made available in England for the 1999-2000 academic year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what representations he has received calling for the official recognition of British Sign Language; and if he will make a statement;  [123770]

<P>
<a name="00605w35.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The Government have received a number of representations about recognition of British Sign Language, particularly since they announced their intention to ratify the Council of Europe's "European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages". The Charter contains what appears to be a fairly specific definition of what constitutes a regional or minority language. It is clear that those who drafted the Charter did not intend that sign languages come within its terms. We understand that of the 22 member states which have signed the Charter, nine have ratified it and none of these countries has specified their indigenous sign language. We have concluded that consideration of sign languages should not impede signature and ratification but the issue should be explored with other parties once we have ratified the Charter. The Charter has been signed and ratification is currently subject to Parliamentary procedures. Our understanding is that, after ratification, representations on sign languages could be considered by the Charter's Committee of Experts in about 18 months' time when the UK would be submitting its report on the implementation of its obligations under the Charter.

 Inspection of specialist and mainstream early education provision is carried out by Ofsted. The inspectors check whether staff in the settings are following the Desirable Learning Outcomes (to be replaced with the new Early Learning Goals in September 2000) and are having regard to the Code of Practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs (SEN).
<P>

<a name="00605w35.html_para7">Where settings cater mainly for children with SEN, the inspection is undertaken by an inspector who is specially trained by Ofsted to inspect SEN provision, using additional guidance developed by Ofsted for this purpose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what has been the net change in each year since May 1997 in the number of forms issued by his Department which <i>(a)</i> charities and <i>(b)</i> other voluntary organisations are required to complete.  [123950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w36.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 In its monitoring of regulatory impact, DfEE does not distinguish the numbers of forms issued exclusively to charities and voluntary organisations which they are required to complete. The collation of this data could be done only at disproportionate cost. However, I am unaware of any requirement placed on charities or voluntary organisations as such, over and above what applies equally to any other providers of education, training or employment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what guidance he has issued to those conducting the current review of the higher education research assessment exercise in connection with reduction of the administration requirements of the system.  [124539]<P>

<P>
<a name="00605w36.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England, in collaboration with the other funding bodies in the United Kingdom, is carrying out its own fundamental review of research policy and funding. This includes an examination of the research assessment exercise and its continuing fitness for purpose. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has given no guidance to the Funding Council on how to carry out this review, which is expected to result in a report for consultation later this summer.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to the answer of 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 639W, on the Northern Ireland Bar, if he will <i>(a)</i> make a statement on dates of correspondence with the Lord Chief Justice and <i>(b)</i> place copies in the Library.

<P>
<a name="00605w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Since January 1997 there have been 16 letters between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice about appointments to the Northern Ireland Senior Bar.
<P>

<a name="00605w37.html_para1">Two letters between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice relating to appointments to the Senior Bar have already been disclosed in proceedings before the High Court in Northern Ireland (in the matter of an application by Seamus Treacy and Barry Macdonald) and will be placed in the Library. All of the remaining correspondence was conducted on a confidential basis and much of it relates to individuals' suitability for appointment to the Senior Bar or ministerial responsibility for such appointments. It will not, therefore, be placed in the Library.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to the answer of 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 640W, on the Northern Ireland Bar, if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> consultation procedures, <i>(b)</i> responses made and <i>(c)</i> conclusions reached.  [124103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 This related to the Report of the Committee (the Elliott Committee) established by the Bar Council in November 1996 to investigate and report on all aspects of the appointment of Senior Counsel in Northern Ireland. That Committee reported to the Bar Council the following year and a copy of the Report was provided to the Lord 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 2000 : Column: 148W</I><P>
Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in May 1997. The Bar Council did not, however, provide a copy of the Report to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (who was responsible for matters relating to Queen's Counsel at that time) nor to the Lord Chancellor who subsequently assumed those responsibilities. Copies of the Report were, however, provided to the Northern Ireland Office and the Lord Chancellor by the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>

<a name="00605w37.html_para2">I am not in a position to know what responses the Bar Council received following publication of the Elliott Report. Although the Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor had been invited to comment by the Elliott Committee as part of the Committee's original consultations, neither of them were invited to comment on the recommendations of the final report.
<P>

<a name="00605w37.html_para3">The Lord Chancellor is presently considering the effect of the judgment in the case brought by Seamus Treacy and Barry Macdonald. It would be premature to comment on the Declaration to be made by new Queen's Counsel and the Lord Chancellor's conclusions concerning the Elliott Report until final decisions have been reached concerning the issues raised in that case.

 Information on the time taken in magistrates courts proceedings is collected by the Lord Chancellor's Department's Time Intervals Survey. The accompanying table shows the average number of days from charge or laying of information to first listing for Youth Court defendants in June 1997, June 1999 and February 2000. The only survey to cover all Youth Court defendants in 1997 was the June survey, and the most recent results available are from the February 2000 survey.

(19) From the start of 1999 analysis of the Time Intervals Survey has included certain longer cases than were previously excluded. In this table however the results presented are calculated on the pre-1999 basis for comparability. On the new basis of calculation the only figure in the table that would be different is the February 2000 figure for Merseyside which would be 9 days.<P>

<P>

(20) In the June 1997 survey the sample sizes for Youth Court cases were less than 100 in Merseyside, South Yorkshire, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire and due to these small sample sizes these figures should be treated with added caution.<P>

<P>

(21) Includes youths apprehended by City of London Police and proceeded against in London Youth Courts. Youth Courts are not held at the magistrates court in the City of London.<P>

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to her answer of 12 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 222-23W, when she will make a further statement on part-time judicial appointments to tribunals.  [124542]<P>

<P>
<a name="00605w38.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 On 12 April 2000, the Lord Chancellor announced that he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Social Security had agreed with the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, new arrangements for part-time judicial appointments. Similar arrangements have now been put in place for an additional range of part-time Tribunal appointments for which the Lord Chancellor is responsible and for appointments made by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the Secretary of State for Health, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the President of the Council and the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="00605w38.html_para0">The Lord Chancellor has also agreed with the Lord President of the Court of Session that for those Tribunals which sit in Scotland, but where appointments remain wholly or partly the responsibility of Westminster Ministers, the Lord President will assume the role that the Lord Chief Justices have already agreed to for appointments in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In practice, this will mean that the Lord President will have to concur in all decisions to remove or not to renew an appointment.
<P>

<a name="00605w38.html_para1">Where Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales are now consulted on appointments to Tribunals in accordance with the relevant Statutory provisions or Devolution Concordats, they will also be consulted on removals from office, and decisions not to renew appointments.
<P>

<a name="00605w38.html_para2">These changes will come into effect immediately.

<a name="00605w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Equipping people in the United Kingdom through education and training is key to addressing specific skill shortages. Enhancing access for skilled people from overseas is also important. The Home Office's formal aim for immigration explicitly recognises regulation of entry to and settlement in the United Kingdom in the interests of social stability and economic growth. Within the European Union, freedom of movement means that there is in effect a free market for employment. For non-European Economic Area nationals, the Immigration Rules provide for people seeking to enter or remain in the United Kingdom for specified employment and business purposes, subject to the

[123865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w40.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I replied to my hon. Friend on 23 May. There was no need to consult the Secretary of State for Social Security about the content of the interim letters to asylum seekers, because the relevant paragraphs were concerned with support from the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) which is part of the Home Office. There was never any intention to cut off support before the asylum seekers had the opportunity to appeal against the refusal of their claims, but I accept that the wording used in the interim letters may have caused some confusion. In order to avoid this in future, the paragraphs about NASS support have now been removed from the interim letter. Where appropriate, they are now included in the letter which provides full reasons for the refusal of the asylum claim.

[124361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00605w40.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Water cannon are not currently in use for public order purposes in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="00605w40.html_para0">The possibility of providing the police with water cannon to deal with serious public disorder was carefully considered by a joint police and Home Office working party in the 1980s. Tests were conducted into all aspects of the water cannon's operational capabilities. Models in use on the continent were examined and a wide range of tests were carried out using custom-built British prototypes, as a result of which a number of operational problems emerged.
<P>

<a name="00605w40.html_para1">Water cannons cannot be mobilised quickly in order to deal with spontaneous disorder and when mobilised are slow and difficult to manoeuvre, particularly in narrow streets. When water cannon were used in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s they were not found to be effective and, in fact, they became prize targets for rioters.
<P>

<a name="00605w40.html_para2">For these reasons, chief police officers in England and Wales have not been persuaded that water cannon would be of operational value in dealing with public disorder in this country.

<a name="00605w40.html_para6">The oral statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 14 December 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 250-54, stemmed from a misleading newspaper report in the Sunday Times on 12 December 1999. This report appeared to be based on a misreading of the Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999, which came into force on 30 December 1999. The Act tightens controls over commercial breeding establishments supplying dogs for the pet trade. It is designed to raise standards of care in puppy farms and stipulates tighter controls on the sale of dogs by dealers and pet shops and stiffer penalties for breeders who flout the law.
<P>

<a name="00605w40.html_para7">Establishments breeding animals for laboratory use are exempt from the Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999 and will continue to be regulated by the provisions of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which requires Home Office inspection and close veterinary supervision.

 All police authorities in England and Wales have been provided with statutory guidance under the Best Value regime (Section 5 of the Local Government Act 1999) which requires that specific five year targets should be set by all police authorities for domestic burglary and for vehicle crime. In addition, five police authorities, including Greater Manchester, are required to set a target for robbery. The targets are a matter for individual police authorities and those set by each police authority are contained in their Best Value Performance Plan which they were required to publish before 31 March 2000.

<a name="00605w41.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Home Office has considered the scope for reforming street trading and pedlars legislation in the light of the previous Government's deregulation reviews. We intend to discuss shortly with interested parties the deregulatory possibilities for street trading. Reform or repeal of the Pedlars Acts would, we believe, require primary legislation. We are ready to listen to views on pedlars but have no present plans to change the law.
