To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what studies his Department has conducted into the effects on the environment of the London area of the proposed introduction of congestion charging by the GLA.  [39846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> The Government commissioned and published early in 2000 a report by an independent group of experts called Road Charging Options for London&#151;A Technical Assessment (known as the ROCOL report). Copies are available in the library. The report covers environmental effects. It says that there could be environmental and amenity benefits from the reduced traffic volumes but much would depend on the how the benefits of reduced traffic were allocated. Emissions of CO <sub>2</sub>  would be reduced, but there would be no significant improvement in local air quality.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 This will be determined through the SRA's development of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and through negotiations with Network Rail and other possible bidders for Railtrack Plc on their proposed Business and Financing plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proportion of the Government's total targets for new housing in the south-east has been provided for in the strategic plans of local authorities; and what proportion remains to be allocated provisional sites.  [47519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9), issued in March 2001, sets out the level of housing provision to be made in the region. Housing 



<P>
<P><I>12 Apr 2002 : Column 626W</I><P>
provision in existing strategic plans&#151;namely county structure plans&#151;is broadly in line with guidance in RPG9 for the Government Office South East area, although usually only for the period up to 2011 and in some cases only up to 2006. Some County Councils have started the process of reviewing their structure plans. At the same time, about a third of all local plans have already expired and half are due to expire by 2006. District authorities need to update their local plans in order to allocate sufficient land for housing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w02.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The Children Act 1989 places a duty on local social services departments to provide for unaccompanied asylum seeking children. As a matter of policy and practice all those accepted as being unaccompanied asylum seeking children are referred to the local social services department. Unaccompanied asylum seeking children are not routinely detained under immigration powers. But detention may occasionally be necessary in exceptional circumstances whilst alternative arrangements for their care are made. Where detention is in such circumstances necessary, this is normally limited to overnight, with appropriate care.
<P>

<a name="20412w02.html_para7">The decision to detain a family is always taken with due regard to Article 8 of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
<P>

<a name="20412w02.html_para8">Families may be detained at the Oakington Reception Centre whilst their claim for asylum is processed. In other cases a family would be detained in line with the general detention criteria, which include consideration of the likelihood of removal, evidence of previous absconding and previous history of complying with the requirements of immigration control. There is however, as in any other case, a presumption in favour of granting temporary admission or temporary release.
<P>

<a name="20412w02.html_para9">Any case where it is proposed to detain a family will be risk-assessed by the Immigration Service. Checks are made to see if any child is on the "At Risk" register. In addition the family protection team at the local police station will be contacted. If there has been any involvement by the Social Services in any particular family case, they will also be consulted before an operation leading to the detention of children is undertaken.

on this, but it has not yet proved possible to devise a satisfactory single measure of system-wide performance. Meanwhile, however, each component part of the system has an efficiency or value for money target, and has plans in place to meet its target.

Shoreham seaport. This is because illegal entrants are frequently detected inland and will not identify, or cannot be attributed to, any particular port of entry.
<P>

<a name="20412w03.html_para0">Shoreham seaport does not receive any passenger vessels and so has no permanent immigration presence. However, for the purposes of immigration control the port is covered by Immigration Service staff based at Newhaven who may be deployed there should a need be identified. Remote coverage is also provided by officers from Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and Sussex Police, Special Branch.
<P>

<a name="20412w03.html_para1">The Immigration Service views very seriously any potential breach of immigration controls, as well as the risks that migrants take by seeking to enter the United Kingdom clandestinely. Whilst there is currently no evidence to suggest that Shoreham seaport is being targeted for such activity, should such information be received, it would be passed to the District Intelligence Unit at Gatwick. They would assess the risk and ensure that appropriate measures were taken to combat any threat to the integrity of the immigration control.

 There are safeguards for both individual and corporate subscribers who do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing faxes.

The Fax Preference Service is also open to individual subscribers who may find it useful to register in order to reinforce their rights. Subscribers should report any breaches of these regulations to the Information Commissioner's Office, or to the Fax Preference Service if they have registered with it.

We have always made it clear that we will not consider any defence manufacturers as strategic partners of QinetiQ, nor any parties which would pose a risk to the defence and security interests of the United Kingdom.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) what sums have been paid out in each of the last 10 financial years to solicitors acting for Mr. Malcolm Robert Ross in litigation related to Mr. Ross's bankruptcy and involving disputes with Stonewood Securities Limited and its shareholders; and what sums have been received back from other parties to the litigation in costs recovery; [48064]

 I have requested a report from the Legal Services Commission (LSC). According to their records, Mr. Ross has been granted a number of civil legal aid certificates. These cases relate either to Mr. Ross's bankruptcy or involve disputes with Stonewood Securities Limited. One case has been concluded; the others are 



<P>
<P><I>12 Apr 2002 : Column 644W</I><P>
ongoing. As all the certificates are material to ongoing litigation, the LSC cannot provide details of payments made to the solicitors in connection with the closed case.
<P>

<a name="20412w06.html_para2">In respect of the ongoing litigation, the Commission has not yet received final bills from the solicitors involved and so, in any event, is not in a position to provide information about sums paid out. Normally, only when the actions have been concluded and the solicitor's bills assessed would meaningful figures be available on the costs of the proceedings. If the cases are successful, an order for costs in the individual's favour could be made and the Commission reimbursed.
<P>

<a name="20412w06.html_para3">Most of the certificates predate the implementation of the Access to Justice Act 1999 which significantly reduced the scope for funding cases which arise out of the carrying on of a business.

 QinetiQ Ltd. is continuing to work on the technical enhancements. Once configuring of the technical enhancements is complete, rigorous testing will be undertaken on all aspects of the system. These enhancements are intended to make the site sufficiently robust to permit general Internet access, and are being done with a sense of urgency. However, the most important consideration is to ensure that the service is re-launched successfully. The system will again be made available to designated service centres as part of the general re-introduction of the site. General on-line searches will be available as soon as practicable following testing and availability at the service centres.

 I have been asked to reply. We are committed to reducing the number of deaths of children through abuse and neglect. That is why over the last few years we have introduced new legislation, new guidance, new structures and new policy initiatives to make children safer and to ensure that there is a proper focus on children at the very heart of Government. These measures include:

The Care Standards Act 2000 to improve the inspection and regulation of children's care services, and the Protection of Children Act 1999 which makes it much more difficult for unsuitable people to work with children;

<BR>
The first ever national Children's Rights Director for England&#151; Roger Morgan&#151;to act as a powerful champion for some of the most vulnerable children in our country;
<BR>
The establishment of the Children and Young People's Unit, which is responsible for ensuring the coherence of Government policies that affect all children and young people under 19; and

<a name="20412w06.html_para4">In addition, the Department will shortly be publishing the first of a series of biennial overview reports drawing out the key findings of a sample of serious case reviews following child deaths or other cases of serious abuse in recent years. These reports will draw out common themes and trends and their implications for policy and practice. We will disseminate these findings widely to enable practitioners and managers to learn from them. It will be important for professionals to consider how their own practice might be developed or improved as a result of these findings to help prevent avoidable injuries to, and deaths of, children.

 I did not say that the integration of Gibraltar into the UK would contravene the Treaty of Utrecht. I said that it was not this Government's policy to integrate Gibraltar. I reminded the Committee that the Treaty of Utrecht gave Spain first refusal in the event that Britain ever relinquished sovereignty over Gibraltar; and that the position of Gibraltar was therefore different from that of Ceuta and Melilla.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 There is no reason why refurbishment should be delayed. Ineffective refrigeration systems can already be disposed of in the UK via mobile fridge recycling plant or high temperature incineration, they can be exported for recycling in other Member States, or they are stored pending treatment in the UK. There is sufficient capacity in the UK to store waste refrigeration equipment for up to one year. The risk of food being stored in ineffective systems for this reason is therefore negligible.

<a name="20412w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We have not carried out such an assessment. Experience has shown that although anaerobic digestion is an appropriate treatment for a wide range of biodegradable wastes there are doubts about its commercial viability.
<P>

<a name="20412w07.html_para0">The Government support the development of anaerobic digestion through mechanisms such as eligibility for the Renewable Obligation Certificates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Action Programme measures required by the Nitrates Directive 1991 which apply in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) detail closed periods prohibiting the application of manures containing a higher proportion of available nitrogen (slurries, poultry manures and liquid digested sewage sludges) on to sandy or shallow soils which are more prone to nitrate leaching. Relaxation of these measures would entail a high risk of increased nitrate leaching so there are no plans to allow exemptions under licence.
<P>

<a name="20412w07.html_para2">The Action Programme measures take account of information produced by the Government funded research programme on nitrates and experiences gained during operation of the Nitrate Sensitive Areas Scheme. For further information about cover and catch crops please refer to MAFF Booklet PB3578 "The Pilot Nitrate Sensitive Areas Scheme: Final Report" available from DEFRA publications (08459 556000).
<P>

<a name="20412w07.html_para3">Cover crops and also catch crops, used late in the year, can help to reduce nitrate loss compared with both uncropped land and land sown with autumn sown cereals. This benefit is recognised in the Action Programme measures with the shorter closed period for manure applications for land sown with a cover crop before 1 October and not removed before 1 December of the same year.
<P>

<a name="20412w07.html_para4">Advice on using cover or catch crops to reduce nitrate leaching in fields that would otherwise be bare over the autumn and winter months is also given in the DEFRA Booklet PB5505 "Guidelines for Farmers in NVZs".

 Since becoming Party to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) the UK has worked at an international level to abate transboundary air pollutants. The UK is preparing to ratify these three Protocols.
<P>

<a name="20412w08.html_para0">I issued a consultation paper on 20 March 2002 outlining the steps necessary to ratify the 1998 Protocol on Heavy Metals; comments are invited by 12 June 2002. I have arranged for a copy of the consultation paper to be placed in the Library. The consultation paper sets out a draft strategy for the UK to meet its commitments under the Protocol. The main requirements are the reduction of annual emissions to air of cadmium, lead and mercury to below 1990 levels. We already meet these requirements as annual emissions in the UK in 1999 were 30 per cent, or less, of 1990 levels for the three metals. Subject to the results of the consultation exercise, I hope to ratify the Protocol by the end of 2002.
<P>

<a name="20412w08.html_para1">The Department is also looking at what measures need to be in place for the UK to ratify the 1998 Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants, although the basic obligation to reduce emissions of POPs below their 1990 levels has already been achieved.
<P>

<a name="20412w08.html_para2">The UK signed the Protocol to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground level ozone (the "Gothenburg Protocol") in December 1999. The main requirement of the Protocol is to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds and ammonia to meet individual national ceilings from 2010. The Protocol covers the same four pollutants as the European Union National Emission Ceilings Directive, adopted last November, and ratification of the Protocol and and implementation of the Directive will be done jointly. I hope to issue a consultation paper later in the year on our proposals. Projections suggest that the UK is

 The Environment Agency, which is responsible for monitoring ground and surface waters for pesticides, does not distinguish between compounds used in conventional and organic farming. Similarly, the costs to water companies of treatment to remove traces of pesticides before water can be put into supply are not quantified and apportioned according to the different farming methods, which may vary within any single water catchment area.

In order to be transparent about their discussions, CERRIE are preparing their own website which will include, among other things, summary minutes of their meetings.

The tuition fee data for planned expenditure are for all students, including students from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at English HE institutions, while for out-turn the figures are based on students from England at English HE institutions.

 The Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) has developed an inspection framework for combined care and nusery education inspections which is currently being piloted. The pilot will be evaluated by the end of April 2002 and OFSTED are on course to meet the target of 1,200 inspections per year for those providers which are not schools but offer a service that includes both childcare and Government funded nursery education.

<i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Nationally, the non-completion rate has remained broadly the same at 17&#150;18 per cent since 1991&#150;92. In 2000, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a table comparing estimates of non-completion rates in member countries. They showed an average of around a third of university students did not complete their course in OECD countries. The UK boasts the second lowest non-completion rate among the OECD countries.
<P>

<a name="20412w11.html_para0">The available information on non-completion rates is contained in "Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK" published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), copies of which are available from the House library. The figures cover full-time first degree courses only, and show, for each individual HE institution in the UK, the proportion of entrants who failed to complete their course. Copies of the HEFCE publication are available for students starting courses in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99. The next edition, covering students starting courses in 1999&#150;2000, is scheduled for publication in autumn 2002.

 Most of the funding made available to local education authorities by the Government is unhypothecated. In recent years, however, LEAs have been strongly encouraged by the Secretary of State to increase their education budgets annually by an amount at least equal to the increase in their Education Standard Spending Assessments, and the Department monitors the extent to which this target has been achieved. The Education Bill currently before Parliament contains a provision, intended for exceptional use only, empowering my right hon. Friend to set a minimum level for an LEA's schools budget where she considers that the budget proposed by the LEA for a particular year is seriously inadequate.

<a name="20412w11.html_para2">Consistent with our aim of encouraging wider access to the health professions, a significant (and growing) number of student nurses are mature entrants, single parents and others with dependants.
<P>

<a name="20412w11.html_para3">Approximately 13 per cent of diploma level nursing and midwifery students receive the additional dependants' allowances available to those who have financial responsibility for dependants (including adult dependants). Other sources of information available to the Department, including a recent survey from the Royal College of Nursing, indicate that up to 35 per cent of nursing and midwifery students have children living with them.
<P>

<a name="20412w11.html_para4">NHS Bursaries were introduced in recognition of the demands of health professional training and the need to guarantee the supply of staff to the service. The Government are increasing the number of health professional training places at both diploma and degree level, and already during the current academic year 15,000 students have embarked on diploma level nursing and midwifery programmes. The number of individuals applying for these courses is now running at a buoyant level with the number of applicants having more than doubled since the 1997&#150;98 academic year. There are now on average more than two applicants for every training place.

<a name="20412w11.html_para6">The Department does not routinely monitor the level of debt amongst diploma level nursing and midwifery students. These students are not reliant on student loans and instead receive a flat-rate basic maintenance grant with no contribution required from the student's income or their family's. In addition, the NHS meets students' liability for a tuition fee contribution (currently &#163;1,075 a year) in full and without means testing. This package of support is, in many circumstances, more favourable that the loan-based system of support available to most other students.

<i>[holding answer 13 March 2002]:</i> The NHS Plan announced an extra &#163;900 million annually by 2003&#150;04 for new intermediate care and related services to promote independence and improve quality of care for older people. Further details are in HSC 2001&#150;01, LAC (2001) 01, published in January 2001 [which is in the Library of the House].
<P>

<a name="20412w12.html_para2">The NHS funding earmarked for intermediate care which commenced in 2000&#150;01 forms part of unified allocations to health authorities. Unified allocations are based on a weighted capitation formula that determines every health authority's fair share of available resources. The Government's policy is not to hypothecate resources made available to councils unless it is essential to do so. Deployment of resources made available through the Standard Spending Assessment remains a decision for councils to make in the light of local circumstances.

1. Three month vacancies are vacancies as at 31 March 2001 which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents)<P>

2. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post from the September 2000 non-medical workforce census (whole time equivalent)<P>

3. At 3 September 2000 Non-medical workforce census, 17 PCTs were in existence, of which only one, 4LA06, had Speech Language Therapy staff. As SIP figures from the census are required for the calculation of vacancy rates, no rates are available for the PCTs formed on 1 October 2000.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action his Department has taken in response to the audit of abortion services in 1999 by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; and if he will make a statement.  [43329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20412w13.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The audit of abortion services funded by the Department provided valuable baseline data on abortion services prior to the publication of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) Evidence Based Guideline <i>The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion.</i>




<P>

<P>

<a name="20412w13.html_para0">The audit found good awareness of and compliance with the RCOG guidelines available at the time and the report informed the development of the our sexual health and HIV strategy, which was issued for consultation in July 2001. The strategy recommends that services should be developed in line with the Royal College's guidelines ensuring that women meeting the legal requirements for an abortion are referred without delay. In addition, we have set a target in the strategy that from 2005, commissioners should ensure that women who meet the legal requirements have access to an abortion within 3 weeks of their first appointment with their general practioner or other referring doctor.
<P>

<a name="20412w13.html_para1">An action plan setting out how the strategy will be implemented will be published in the spring. The audit data will help us monitor progress in improving services.

 The Department commissioned a research project on suicide in high risk occupational groups, conducted by Professor Keith Hawton and colleagues at the centre for suicide research, University of Oxford. The project was funded over the period 1 December 1993 to 30 June 2000.
<P>

<a name="20412w13.html_para2">In addition, the Department funds the national confidential inquiry into suicides and homicides by people with mental illness to ensure that everyone involved with mental health services learns and implements lessons from the factors associated with serious incidents. The inquiry, led by Professor Louis Appleby, is crucial to gaining a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding homicides and suicides committed by people with mental illness.
<P>

<a name="20412w13.html_para3"><i>Safety First,</i> the 5 year report on suicide and homicide by psychiatric patients, builds on Professor Appleby's earlier report "Safer Services" published in 1999. The Department is committed to taking necessary action in response to the findings of the Inquiry. We have already published the national service framework for mental health and national plan which specifically address a number of the recommendations out lined in the earlier report. The key findings and further recommendations outlined in <i>Safety First</i> will be given full consideration and will help to inform the national suicide prevention strategy that we are currently developing.
<P>

<a name="20412w13.html_para4">In addition, the Department has funded:

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:<P>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare on behalf of other health bodies;<P>

asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities;<P>

some double counting of expenditure between health authorities and primary care trusts within the health authority area; and<P>

the calculation is not precise as relevant expenditure in primary care trusts is not analysed completely into the purchase of primary and secondary healthcare. Prescribing services expenditure has been added in to primary health care expenditure but there may be other elements of expenditure which cannot be identified which should be incorporated within the answer.<P>

Expenditure cannot therefore be reliably compared between health authorities.<P>

Allocations provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>

2. Source: Health authority audited summarisation forms 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;2001 Primary care trust audited summarisation schedules 2000&#150;2001<P>

3. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent on primary and secondary healthcare by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not 



included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of expenditure on pharmaceutical services is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.<P>

4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>

5. Major increases in expenditure and reductions in individual cases can be explained as follows:<P>

The increase in Dorset health authority is due to the majority of expenditure being double counted between the health authority and primary care trusts (&#163;38,408,000 primary, &#163;133,761,000 secondary).<P>

The &#163;87,121,000 increase in secondary care expenditure in Sefton health authority is due mainly to an extra &#163;63million included in its accounts as it was the lead body in the region for mental health secure commissioning in 2000&#150;01.<P>

The reduction in secondary care in Herefordshire is caused by Herefordshire PCT taking over the commissioning of community health services in 2000&#150;01 from the health authority and netting off the expenditure against income, resulting in a &#163;14,484,000 apparent reduction in 2000&#150;01.<P>

The apparent decrease in secondary care expenditure in Merton, Sutton & Wandsworth health authority of &#163;20,754,000 is caused by the treatment of asset revaluations in NHS trusts. The reduction is solely a result of accounting practice agreed with their auditors.<P>

Decreases in secondary care expenditure in Brent and Harrow, East Sussex, Brighton and Hove, Hillingdon, South Humber and West Kent health authorities are also caused by the treatment of asset revaluations in NHS trusts.<P>

Decreases in primary care expenditure in Northumberland and Shropshire health authorities in principally due to lower drug costs in 2000&#150;01.<P>

 We do not currently hold data on waiting times from urgent general practitioner (GP) referral to treatment for all cancer patients. Standards of a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and one month from urgent GP referral to treatment for children's and testicular cancers and acute leukaemia came into effect at the end of December 2001. Central monitoring of these standards began on 1 January 2002 and data will be published on a quarterly basis. Data collection on waiting times to treatment for other tumour types will be introduced as we rollout the Cancer Plan waiting times targets.

 The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care. Since 1997 the Department's expenditure on directly commissioned research projects relating to cystic fibrosis is approximately &#163;394 thousand.
<P>

<a name="20412w16.html_para0">In addition to specific projects, the Department also provides support funding for research commissioned by charities and the research councils that takes place in the National Health Service. Management of much of the research supported by NHS research and development funding is devolved and expenditure at project level is not held centrally by the Department but the total investment is considerably greater than just the spend on directly commissioned projects.
<P>

<a name="20412w16.html_para1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease and receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry.

 The information requested is not currently collected centrally. However, we are developing a comprehensive database of all serious case reviews, carried out in accordance with Chapter 8 of <i>Working Together to Safeguard Children</i>&#151;the Government's guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, to improve the national recording of serious incidents, including deaths and serious injuries. This will enable us to identify the numbers and types of a range of serious cases, where the children concerned are known to social services Departments.

<P>

<a name="20412w16.html_para3">On 30 November 2001 the Department issued information and advice to the airlines and the public about minimising the risk of DVT during long journeys. This included practical advice for air passengers on long haul flights. It also identified certain groups who may be at a higher risk of DVT and advised them to seek medical advice before travelling and described simple in-seat exercises that should be recommended to all air passengers.

 None. The first pre retirement health check pilots began in 2001&#150;2. They are focused on the health needs of people who have not yet retired, in the 50&#150;65 age group, many still in active employment, although some retired people are also involved in them.

Changes (in line with best accounting practice) in the accounting and financial reporting arrangements for NHS trusts mean that the figures provided for 1996&#150;97 are not directly comparable with 1997&#150;98 or thereafter.
