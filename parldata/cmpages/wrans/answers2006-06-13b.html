 DFID supported analysis of the human resources for health crises in Africa for the High Level Forum for Health in November 2005. The migration of skilled health workers from poorer African countries to developed countries in Europe, the United States and elsewhere has a significant impact on the capacity of African national health services to deliver HIV and AIDS treatment, prevention and care. However, migration to other more developed African countries and internal migration from rural to urban areas are also important factors. Health worker shortages are exacerbated by AIDS-related mortality among the health work force. The result is an overburdened health work force and weak health systems with inadequate capacity to deliver services.</p>

 The Refreshment Department supports the small independent brewers of Britain by offering a guest ale, changed weekly, in two of the House of Commons bars. This scheme does not operate during parliamentary recesses, when the bars are very quiet. It would therefore not be economic to support Cask Beer Week in September 2006 by stocking Harvey&#146;s or any other real ale. I have asked the Director of Catering Services to contact the hon.

These levels will deliver a significant increase on current sales and will mean that by 2010 the vast majority of UK forecourts will be supplying renewable fuels in the form of biodiesel and bioethanol. The RTFO will deliver real environmental benefits and is projected to save around 1 million tonnes of carbon by 2010.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 June 2006]:</i> Local authorities are assessed against a number of indicators on household waste which include the percentage sent for recycling or composting and the total weight collected per head. The Audit Commission publishes information on local authority performance against these indicators each year. This is available from the Audit Commission website:</p>
<a name="60613w0002.htm_brev1"><a name="06061334000688"><ul><p class="tabletext">http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/performance/data provision.asp</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="60613w0002.htm_para14"><a name="06061334000224">Currently, there is no local authority statutory performance standard for waste minimisation. However, as part of the review of England&#146;s Waste Strategy, Defra is looking at what levels and what forms of targets and indicators will, in the longer-term, be the most efficient at continuing the recent improvements we have seen in waste performance. The review will take into account existing policies designed to make waste management more sustainable, and consider how best to present information on local authority waste performance, consistent with sustainable waste management objectives.</p>

 The UK&#146;s key aims are to resist any attempts to end the moratorium on commercial whaling and resist threats to weaken or remove the conservation agenda of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). We will also highlight the cruelty involved in whaling, and promote the adoption of a new whale sanctuary in the South Atlantic. Furthermore, we will strongly urge Japan, Iceland and Norway, to cease their whaling activities.</p>

 Although Japan and her allies may, for the first time, gain a simple majority at the next annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), such a majority would not be sufficient to overturn the moratorium on commercial whaling (which requires a 3/4 majority). However, it would enable them to determine the IWC agenda, delete certain key conservation items and change the rules of procedure to their ultimate benefit.</p>

The information was passed to the Manager of Norris Green Jobcentre plus, who has arranged for staff to visit the site to assist those employees who are facing redundancy.

Housing Associations are now the main providers of new social housing. Regional Housing Boards recommend the allocation of resources to deliver regional and sub-regional priorities identified in Regional Housing Strategies. The Housing Corporation has invested &#163;3.3 million for 54 new supported housing units in West Yorkshire between 2004-06.

Council housing adaptations are resourced through Council's Housing Revenue Account, or from other financial resources available to the local authority. Local authority tenants are statutorily entitled to assistance under the Disabled Facilities Grant programme but the present financial arrangements preclude the ODPM ring fenced fund being used for the provision of such adaptations for LA tenants. In the private sector, each year around 30,000 applicants benefit from a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG), which since 1997 has increased from &#163;57 million to &#163;103 million in 2005-06.

 The mixed communities approach is one element of our strategy to tackle concentrated deprivation and create sustainable communities for all. It brings together social, economic and physical regeneration, alongside essential improvements in public services, in order to transform failing communities into ones able to attract and retain households on a wide range of incomes. The Government are currently working with a number of locally led and managed projects in order to develop mixed communities in some of our most disadvantaged areas, while also testing out approaches to encourage mixed communities more widely.

 Gross output is the standard measure of the value of agricultural output. The published gross output figures normally include the value of agricultural subsidies paid on products. In answer to this question the gross output figures for agriculture in Northern Ireland are given with the subsidy on products removed to give a clearer picture of the value of market returns. These figures and the total value of direct agricultural subsidies in Northern Ireland for the last four years are presented in the following table.

 The EU Commission has proposed a legal instrument, European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC), to allow public bodies from different member states to create or join an EGTC with the objective of facilitating and promoting cross border, transnational and interregional co-operation in order to strengthen economic and social cohesion. No new powers are confirmed on public bodies by joining an EGTC and member states can withhold their approval of an EGTC if it considers it to be contrary to the public policy of the member state.</p>

This may have operational benefits and can be welcomed. The institutions created under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the North South Cooperation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 already facilitate work across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The current Ireland/Northern Ireland PEACE and INTERREG IIIA programmes are managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and these structures have performed well.</p>

Resources available for each maintenance activity (e.g. resurfacing, patching, gully emptying, grass cutting etc) are apportioned to district council areas using appropriate indicators of need. This ensures, so far as possible, an equitable distribution of funds across the country.</p>

Therefore, it is not possible to give an initial budget allocation for 2006/07 for structural maintenance in each district council area as requested. However, expenditure this year, coupled with the Revised Budget allocations, suggests that approximately &#163;170m will be invested in roads' structural maintenance across Northern Ireland in the three years to 2007/08.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 June 2006]:</i> There are a number of steps we are taking to increase the take up of vocational training by both boys and girls. In particular we are challenging stereotypical choices through the Young Apprenticeship programme for 14 to 16-year-olds, the 14-19 Pathfinders and in the development of new specialised Diplomas.</p>

The &#147;Youth Matters: Next Steps&#148; document, published on 8 March 2006, sets out proposals for improved information, advice and guidance for young people. Central to improved information, advice and guidance will be the development of quality standards. The challenging of traditional stereotypes will be included in these standards. The Equal Opportunities Commission is represented on the Steering Group that is supporting the development of the standards.</p>

The Department for International Development has recently commissioned several papers on the impact of Chinese policies in Africa, one of which, from the Institute of Development Studies, focuses on aid, among other issues. This paper can be found at the following website: http://www.ids.ac.uk/ids/global/AsianDriverpdfs/DFIDAgendaPaper06.pdf. Copies will also be placed in the Library of the House and sent to my hon.

These provide for the creation of a strong and independent oversight regulator, the Legal Services Board, a new independent Office for Legal Complaints and a provision for legal services to be provided in new ways to meet the needs of consumers. The draft Bill is currently subject to Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by a Joint Committee which is expected to report by 25 July. The Government will carefully consider the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations and will introduce a full Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

This information can be used in conjunction with the full range of pre-appointment checks to ensure that the prospective employee is suitable for the post.

 It is not routine practice to fingerprint deportees under immigration powers, as the notice of intention to deport is often served by the prison service on behalf of the immigration service.

Fingerprints may also have been taken at an earlier stage if the deportee had been identified as an immigration offender or under police powers at the point of charging.</p>

</ul><a name="60613w0019.htm_brev1"><a name="06061417000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">The shape of the Jobcentre Plus network is under continual review. Following the creation of Jobcentre Plus in 2002 a programme of closures emerged. A detailed service delivery planning exercise was carried out in each District, in consultation with local stakeholders, to identify the locations from which new processes and services would be delivered. Jobcentre Plus inherited a network of around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency. It was established during the service delivery planning process that many were unsuitable due to the fabric of the building, location or both. These factors influenced the shaping of the future network. For these reasons a total of 206 offices have closed since 1st April 2005. A further 113 offices are scheduled to close in 2006/07 and 8 during 2007/08. In addition there are a number which are scheduled to close but for which final closure dates are subject to further planning and stakeholder consultation.</p>
</ul><a name="60613w0019.htm_brev2"><a name="06061417000526"><ul><p class="tabletext">Secondly, as a result of a decision in September 2004 to centralise the processing of benefits, 35 offices have been identified for closure once processing work has migrated out of those locations. Four have closed during 2005/06. The closure dates for the remaining offices is subject to more detailed planning but the assumption is that a further 10 will be closed during 2006/07 and the remaining 21 sites during 2007/08.</p>
</ul><a name="60613w0019.htm_brev3"><a name="06061417000527"><ul><p class="tabletext">We continue to evaluate our services and the network of offices from which they are delivered to ensure efficiency. Any site identified as a potential closure, as part of this process, is referred to the Minister of State for consideration. To date 12 offices have been agreed for closure. The actual dates for these closures are currently being finalised but the expectation is that they will occur during 2006/07.</p>

The recommendations in the published report are substantially the same as were in these two drafts. Therefore, when the report was published the Department had already had over two months to consider the issues raised. Having decided that it was not able to accept four out of the five recommendations made by the Ombudsman, the Department saw no reason to delay responding to her published report. To do so could have raised expectations in the affected members which would not be met.</p>

Figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Patient counts:</i><br>
Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier hospital episode statistics identifier (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>
<i> Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> Primary care trust (PCT) and SHA data quality:</i><br>
PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data are ungrossed.<br>

 The Department has not collected data on the number of dentists accepting new patients. The Department has in the past asked primary care trusts (PCTs) to provide information to the nhs.uk (web resource) and NHS Direct on which dentists are accepting new patients. The main problem with these data is that they can change at a rapid pace and therefore may not be reliable, thus making them limited in their practical use. That is why the Department has given PCTs more flexibility in deciding how they most effectively inform the local public about access to dental services. The implementation review group, which includes patient representatives, dentists and national health service organisations, has been set up to monitor the NHS dental reforms; as part of this they will be assessing the level of information that is on the website.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many civil servants were employed in her Department before the Gershon Report; what net reductions are proposed in the Gershon Report; how many reductions have been made; and how many civil servants are expected to be employed in her Department in the Gershon target month of April 2008. [74290]</p>

<p><a name="st_393"><a name="06061424000371"><a name="60613w0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="06061424002411"><b>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</b>
 The Gershon Report, confirmed by the 2004 Spending Review, set the Department a target net reduction of 720 in its number of full-time equivalent (FTE) posts. As the Department had already embarked on its change programme, it was agreed that reductions made since the programme was announced in March 2003 would be included and the 720 target was calculated and agreed on this basis. The baseline level of staffing was therefore the 3,645 FTE posts that had previously been budgeted for in 2003-04. The Change Programme anticipated an eventual staffing level of 2,245 FTE posts, a reduction of 1,400 FTE posts. This consisted of the 720 Gershon target and a further 680 to be achieved through the transfer of work to other organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_614"><a name="60613w0023.htm_para0"><a name="06061424000372">As at 31 March 2006, the Department&#146;s staffing was 2,387 FTE (this may not correspond with other published figures because of the way secondments into and out of the Department are counted). This represented a reduction of 1,258 FTE from the baseline of 3,645 FTE, and consisted of a 635 net reduction and 623 transfers to other organisations. The Department is therefore well on the way to meeting its April 2008 targets in terms of both net reductions and transfers.</p>

 NHS Specialised Services Commissioners are responsible for commissioning photodynamic therapy.

Locally, commissioners and clinicians have worked to raise awareness and speed the patient's passage from first contact with a health care professional to treatment.

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Patient counts</i><br>
Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>
<i> Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> Main Operation</i><br>
The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for "all operations count of episodes" give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>
<i> Primary Care Trust (PCT) and Strategic Health Authority (SHA) Data Quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data were added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment are poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 are also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
<i> Low Numbers</i><br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with "*" (an asterisk).<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
