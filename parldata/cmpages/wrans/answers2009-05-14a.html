EU member states are individually members of the International Monetary Fund and are not represented by the EU or by a single voice. Co-ordination procedures between EU member states on international financial issues were agreed upon at the Vienna European Council of 1998 and developed subsequently in discussions among Finance Ministers in Oviedo and Copenhagen in 2002.

 The Department for Transport does not routinely collect or require data to be submitted on the use of speed cameras, although the Department's guidance does recommend that speed and collision data are collected by partnerships. However, the Department has an interest in the effectiveness of all road safety interventions and so from time to time requests evaluation work from delivery partners. For example, as part of two wider rural demonstration projects supported financially by the Department, Norfolk and Lincolnshire county councils are proposing to install permanent average speed enforcement cameras during the next year. Because these are demonstration projects the Department will receive information about the impact of these cameras alongside the other road safety measures being implemented locally.</p>

 In response to long-standing demand for reform of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, DEFRA has substantively reviewed the Act. The most recent public consultation on proposals to amend the main body of the Act, to make it less burdensome on local authorities and keepers, was undertaken last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="90514w0005.htm_para10"><a name="09051458000695">The proposals are intended to provide an improved and better focused licensing and enforcement regime in line with the &#147;Hampton principles&#148; of better regulation.

 We have been closely monitoring the statements of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the OIE) on the new variant Influenza A/H1N1.

The Canadian authorities reported on 2 May 2009 that this infection was also identified in a herd of pigs in Alberta, Canada. This single report from Canada indicates that this strain readily infects pigs and is of low pathogenicity to pigs. It is not possible to be certain that this virus will infect and affect other pigs in the same way, nor any other animal or bird species. To date there are no other reports of infection in pigs (or other animals). We understand that a joint OIE/FAO mission has taken place in Mexico where areas of further co-operation with Mexican authorities has been discussed. We would expect to see a report of this mission in due course.</p>

 The short service commission is the normal first commission for those who become an officer in the armed forces and requires a minimum engagement of three years. Certain corps and regiments may have longer minimum engagements. It is a commission for those who do not wish to commit to a long career but would like to benefit from the high quality training and exceptional opportunities available to young officers. The gap year commission is open to people who have a firm place at a UK university for a first degree. It involves a year's commission in the Army, at the end of which, personnel can decide either to join the Army or go to university.</p>

 There is extensive liaison at official level between UK and US colleagues on the Battlemind programme. Battlemind is a military skills training programme, developed in the US by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, to prepare service personnel for the demands and challenges of operational deployment, and to enable them to adjust successfully to the peacetime environment when they return home. A version of the programme, modified for the UK, is currently being trialled by the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health, King's College London (ACDMH). The results of this trial are due early 2010.</p>

 Research undertaken at the King's Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR) has produced evidence which strongly suggests that such processes are ineffective and may indeed be counter-productive.</p>

This explains that selecting out individuals who might be at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties prior to deployment is a flawed strategy because, whether one uses clinical interviews or questionnaire-based methods, it is impossible to distinguish reliably between those who will go on to experience psychological difficulties and those who will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="90514w0014.htm_para5"><a name="09051474000319">Furthermore there is evidence of a detrimental effect on those screened out, even though they may, in reality, be suitable for deployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="90514w0014.htm_para6"><a name="09051474000320">Similarly, although mental health screening after deployment is practiced by other countries, the Department is not aware of any evidence which demonstrates that formal mental health interviews or the use of questionnaires on return from deployment are able to distinguish effectively between those who might benefit from further intervention and those who might not. The MOD does, however, strongly support the notion that the psychological welfare of troops is primarily a chain of command responsibility. We place great emphasis on ensuring that those in positions of command remain vigilant for signs of any mental health difficulties and support these aims through our post-operational stress management protocols which include, but are not limited to, the use of decompression and of Trauma Risk Management (TRiM).</p>

 I visited eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from 26 to 29 April 2009 and was made acutely aware of the alarming humanitarian situation. The Lords Resistance Army (LRA), FDLR (ex-FAR Interhamwe) and other rebel groups, continue to prey on the civilian population, provoking displacement and untold suffering. The United Nations (UN) estimates some 1.7 million are displaced with over 300,000 newly displaced in 2009. The humanitarian community is currently bracing itself for the humanitarian consequences of the joint FARDC and MONUC military operation against the FDLR (Operation Kimia II) in South Kivu and has, as a result, developed contingency plans. In meetings with MONUC, I pressed upon MONUC the importance of ensuring adequate steps are taken to mitigate the impact of military operations on civilians and to work closely with the humanitarian community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="90514w0021.htm_para8"><a name="09051479000679">The well-established humanitarian response to the ongoing crisis in eastern DRC is able to cope with current levels of displacement and existing need. DFID established Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) in 2005, run by UNICEF with NGO partners, to provide water and sanitation, shelter, non-food items and education for conflict affected populations. Other DFID partners, including Oxfam, IRC, MERLIN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provide food, nutrition and health assistance. However, DFID is constantly assessing the situation and is ready to provide additional support if necessary.</p>

 Our assessment of the effects on private sector investment following the pause in the negotiations on the St. Helena airport is that it is likely to be reduced in this financial year. This is because many current plans for investment by local businesses, which are modest in scale, have been put on hold pending a final decision following the consultation that is under way. In regard to foreign investment, the St. Helena Development Agency (SHDA) has received interest from five investors in a range of development projects, which are now on hold. The largest potential investor in the hotel resort sector has confirmed commitment to St. Helena while the prospect of air access remains.</p>

This includes the introduction of responsible officers, who will have statutory responsibility for ensuring that there are robust systems in place to monitor the conduct and performance of all doctors, including those working as locums. Health care organisations and designated bodies will also be subject to a new duty of co-operation, which will ensure that concerns about health care workers are shared and acted upon, to protect patients and ensure quality of care. The new regulations will be accompanied with guidance for employers and patients. A public consultation on the regulations will be undertaken later this year.</p>

 In September 2008 the independent regulator, the Healthcare Commission, published its review of Urgent and Emergency Care which rated the Peterborough primary care trust (PCT) area as 3 or &#147;better performing&#148; and the Cambridgeshire PCT area as 4 or &#147;best performing&#148;, of which performance on out-of-hours services contributed around 25 per cent. to this score.</p>

In addition, the overall results of the review were positive, with 60 per cent. of PCTs scored as &#147;better&#148; or &#147;best performing&#148; and 82 per cent. rated as at least &#147;fair performing&#148;.</p>

Where a provider is failing to meet the National Quality Requirements, PCTs, as commissioners of the service, and strategic health authorities must act to support out-of-hours providers to improve their performance. It is vital that if the local NHS has concerns about the quality of out-of-hours provision in its area, it takes urgent and robust action to improve services.</p>
