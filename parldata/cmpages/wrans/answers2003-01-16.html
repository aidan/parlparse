To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many full-time equivalent staff are employed in <i>(a)</i> the Department and <i>(b)</i> each of the agencies it sponsors; and what the figures were for 1997.  [90662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Full-time equivalent numbers for staff in all civil service departments and agencies is released twice-yearly by press notice. The latest data, for April 2002, was published on 31 October 2002. Data for April 1997 appears in the annual publication XCivil Service Statistics". Copies of the press notices and annual publication are available from the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="30116w01.html_para0">It is not possible to make exact comparisons over time because of changes in the make up of the departments and agencies comprising the civil service. Not only do new organisations appear and old ones disappear, but staff changes may reflect the transfer of work between departments and agencies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is recognised by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry as the sole national body for the accreditation, against international standards, of certification and inspection bodies, testing and calibration laboratories. My Department uses UKAS accreditation services whenever it is appropriate to do so.
<P>

<a name="30116w01.html_para1">Examples include our ISO 14001 environmental management systems and the certification work undertaken by the Vehicle Certification Agency in the motor trade industry and proposed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in the shipping industry. The Highways Agency also continues to work closely with UKAS to help establish benchmark standards within the industry for certification purposes.

<P>

 Approximately 7 per cent. of staff in DfT Central Units work part time. Information specifically on job sharers is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. Job sharing forms just one strand of a range of possible alternative and flexible working arrangements. Under DfT central posting arrangements, all posts are open to part-time workers or job sharers. In very exceptional cases where line managers consider that a post cannot be filled on a

<P><I>16 Jan 2003 : Column 697W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30116w01.html_para4">The central Department, in conjunction with ODPM, supports a part-time workers network.
<P>

<a name="30116w01.html_para5">The DfT agencies, in almost all cases, also operate a policy of advertising all posts as open to part-time workers or job sharers. All operate a range of flexible working options. Several also support part-time working or carers networks.

 An operational analysis of the Portland area helicopter was carried out for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) by consultants for internal purposes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate his Department has made of the comparative effectiveness in their air defence roles of <i>(a)</i> fixed-wing carrier-borne aircraft, <i>(b)</i> modernised Type 42 destroyers and <i>(c)</i> future Type 45 destroyers.  [90103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 United Kingdom maritime forces normally operate as part of a Task Group, which protects itself against air attack through a series of 'layered' defences. Task Groups typically include carrier and/or land based fixed wing aircraft as an outer layer. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2003 : Column 700W</I><P>
Inside and complementary to this, the Type 42 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers (and also Type 22 and 23 Frigates) are equipped to provide an air defence capability for both Force and self protection. The Type 42 Destroyers systems are being enhanced to ensure they remain effective in the air defence role.
<P>

<a name="30116w02.html_para1">The Type 42 Destroyers will be replaced by the Type 45 Destroyers, fitted with the highly capable Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS). PAAMS will represent a significant improvement in Air Defence capability compared with that provided by the current Type 42 Destroyer fitted with Seadart. Key improvements will include better surveillance, increased channels of fire, a larger magazine capacity and a faster, more manoeuvrable missiles.
<P>

<a name="30116w02.html_para2">The comparative effectiveness of these complementing layers has been successfully demonstrated in many recent National, NATO and Allied exercises and proven in the Gulf and Adriatic conflicts to adequately protect a Task Group.

 A Strategic Environmental Appraisal (environmental sustainability assessment) was prepared in accordance with MOD Policy for each of the site relocation options considered by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl).




<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2003 : Column 701W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30116w02.html_para5">It is recognised that the rationalisation of Dstl sites will result in a change in travel patterns, the overall effect of which is likely to be beneficial, in that it will contribute to reducing the need for travel between geographically dispersed sites. Dstl also recognises, however, that at Portsdown Main there will be local issues concerning the increased level of commuter traffic entering and leaving the area. Dstl are consulting with the local planning authorities and are commissioning consultants to identify any significant environmental constraints and to prepare a Preliminary Environmental Report. As part of this commission a detailed transport assessment will be completed, which will highlight areas where improvement and mitigation might be beneficial. Dstl are committed to establishing a travel plan for Portsdown Main with the aim of reducing dependency on the private car and promoting the use of other modes of transport. The prime contractor appointed to complete the refurbishment and re-population of Portsdown Main will be required to take full account of these findings during design, construction and subsequent operation of the site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The appraisal referred to contains information that is commercially sensitive, it is withheld in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The move of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) staff from Farnborough to a new site at Portsdown is planned for 2006. At this comparatively early stage it is difficult to predict whether or not Dstl will lose staff and if so in what numbers. We hope that all staff currently employed by Dstl at the Farnborough site will choose to stay with the Laboratory and move to the new site.
<P>

<a name="30116w02.html_para6">In October 2002, after the relocation decision had been announced to staff, Dstl commissioned MORI to carry out an independent Staff Opinion Survey. The response of staff, particularly at Farnborough, was very positive and had improved in key areas over the previous survey in 2001. There are no indications at this time that Dstl will lose significant numbers of staff because of its relocation plans.

<P>
<a name="30116w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Government believe it is important for consumers to have choice in financial products, including the availability of 'ethical' products. However, it would not be appropriate for the government to exclusively support the development of one specific group of financial service providers. It is for individual consumers to decide the attributes they most value from their financial services and for financial services firms to be transparent about their use of funds and investments.

 There is no standing European Rapid Reaction Force. Under the European Security and Defence Policy, national forces will come together for specific, EU-led crisis management operations (the 'Petersberg tasks') where NATO as a whole is not engaged.

<P>

As of 13 January, some 615 call-out notices had been sent under the authority of the call-out order made on 7 January 2003 under Section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96). For operations in the former republic of Yugoslavia (including Kosovo) and Afghanistan, Reservists were also called out under Section 54 of RFA 96. For Operation Granby (the Gulf conflict 1990&#150;91), Reservists were called out under Section 10 of the Reserve Forces Act 1980.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether reservists are awaiting call-up to come from <i>(a)</i> the Territorial Army and <i>(b)</i> the Civilian Regular Reserves; what reserve liabilities exist for each category of reserve in each of the three services; which situations must exist before recall can be permitted; what procedures have to be followed in order to implement the call-up in each case; and if he will make a statement.  [90799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w03.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Initially we envisage to secure about 1,500 reservists under the call-out Order made on 7 January 2003. That Order was made under section 54(1) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996. The vast majority of those being called out will come from the volunteer reserve forces, ie. the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve, the Territorial Army and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. However, some reservists, particularly those who have skills not readily available in the volunteer reserve forces, will be called out from the ex-regular reserve forces, ie. the Royal Fleet Reserve, the Army Reserve and the Royal Air Force Reserve.
<P>

<a name="30116w03.html_para7">The general liabilities for members of the reserve forces, both volunteer and ex-regular, are set out in Part VI of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, particularly sections 52, 54 and 56. The liability of certain officers and former servicemen who are not members of any reserve force to be recalled for service is set out in Part VII of the Act and the power to authorise their recall is laid down in section 68. The call-out Order made on 7 January does not authorise the mobilisation of such individuals and there are no plans to make a recall Order. Such an Order could only be made in time of national danger or if a great emergency had arisen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w03.html_spnew15"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) requires Reservists who are served with a call-out notice to report for service at a specified time and place. Failure to comply may result in the Reservist being charged with desertion or absence without leave and may be tried by court-martial or summarily by a civil court. However, RFA 96 also contains safeguards for individuals, including the right to apply for exemption from or deferral of call-out. The detailed regulations are contained in the Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) (Exemptions Etc) Regulations, Statutory Instrument 1997/307. Schedule 1 of those regulations sets out the grounds on which a Reservist may make an application. Reservists are made aware of their right to apply for deferral or exemption at the time of their call-out. There are separate arrangements for conscientious objectors.

<a name="30116w06.html_para4">The main reason for these in-year variances from plans stems from the nature of the Department's budgets and the difficulties this causes in forecasting spending accurately. For example: new and innovative programmes such as Sure Start rely on the pace of build up of local partnerships; capital projects can also take longer than anticipated to get off the ground; and the Department has a significant number of demand led budgets. The availability of End-Year Flexibility is designed to allow us to manage such fluctuations sensibly over a number of years.
<P>

<a name="30116w06.html_para5">This year my Department intends to utilise approximately #600 million accumulated End-Year Flexibility, across a range of priorities, this will be drawn down at the spring Supplementary Estimate in February. The planned use of over #880 million accumulated End-Year Flexibility for years beyond 2002&#150;03 was tabled in my statement of 19 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 67WS.

 Pupils study international development issues as part of both the citizenship curriculum&#151;now statutory in secondary schools&#151;and within geography. Primary pupils learn about living in a diverse world through citizenship, and about less economically developed countries through geography as part of studying water, settlements and environmental issues. As they progress to secondary level, they are taught about the world as a global community, including the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, both through geography and citizenship. We have

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not allocate funding for the teaching of specific individual languages. The National Curriculum requirement is that all maintained secondary schools should offer one of the working languages of European Union. Over and above that, it is for schools to decide which and how many additional languages they choose to offer. There are no specific resources allocated by the Department to train teachers in Mandarin. It is up to Initial Teacher Training providers to choose which languages to include in the courses they offer. However, the Government does allocate #300,000 per year to the British Council run UK-China Educational Co-operation programme, which includes language immersion courses in Mandarin Chinese for teachers and pupils and the exchange of language assistants.
<P>

<a name="30116w06.html_para6">Although there is a strong language learning element to the programme, the UK-China Educational Co-operation programme, which has been running since 2000, also provides grants for school linking visits, joint curriculum projects, electronic curriculum links and head teacher study visits.
<P>

<a name="30116w06.html_para7">There are no figures available on how many language colleges offer Mandarin but 50 of the 157 language colleges offer Chinese. Aspiring language colleges are not required to give advance notice to the Department of the languages they intend to include in their applications so it is not possible to indicate how many intend to teach Mandarin. However language colleges are encouraged to diversify their language provision and Chinese continues to be a popular choice for applicant schools. Specialist applications are assessed by independent assessors and are not approved by the Department on the basis of a specified range of modern foreign languages.
<P>

<a name="30116w06.html_para8">From an analysis of OFSTED inspection reports for 1997&#150;98, no mention is made of Mandarin. From the reports of secondary schools inspected by OFSTED for

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Data are only available for 2001. The Learning and Training at Work Survey in England for that year indicates that 12,000 employers with 25 or more employees had participated in modern apprenticeships in the previous 12 months and 24,000 with between one and 24 employees. The results of the 2002 survey are due to be published by the Department shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 All new maintained schools are funded principally through public funds, but promoters of voluntary aided schools generally provide 10 per cent. of the capital costs. The Department does not maintain any records of the source of the 10 per cent. funding for the establishment of any new voluntary aided schools, or any significant contribution to the costs of establishing any other maintained school.
<P>

<a name="30116w06.html_para9">Academies are publicly funded independent schools with private and voluntary sector sponsors contributing up to 20 per cent. of the capital cost. Three Academies opened in September 2002, one of which is sponsored by a private sector company. A further nine will open in September 2003. At least 33 Academies will be open by 2006.

<P>
<P>

 The judgment by Mr. Justice Keith concluded that the definition of 'contractor's plant' in the Industrial Training (Construction Board) Order 1964 (Amendment Order) 1992 was clear, unequivocal and unambiguous.

 The Skills for Logistics Expression of Interest for a Sector Skills Council (SSC) was accepted, on 18 December 2002, by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA). This will result in the SSDA committing development funding of up to #100,000 to help the sector prepare its bid for SSC status.

<a name="30116w08.html_para1">All new maintained schools are prohibited from selecting pupils by high academic ability by the School Standards and Framework Act (SSFA) 1998. The SSFA permits fair banding whereby schools select a proportion of pupils from each part of the full range of abilities.

CTCs are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum with an emphasis on science and technology, and to teach the core and other foundation subjects of the National Curriculum. They are not required to follow the National Curriculum programmes of study, although most do so.
<P>

<a name="30116w08.html_para6"><i>(c) Science curriculum</i>

<a name="30116w08.html_para7">The National Curriculum requires all pupils to study the Science Curriculum at key stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (ages 5&#150;16). At key stage 4 pupils study the fossil record as evidence for evolution and how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction. Schools do teach how scientific controversies can arise from the interpretation of empirical evidence and this is likely to include Darwin's theory of evolution. Pupils are encouraged to explore different views, theories and beliefs. The origins of the universe are also addressed in the teaching of religious education at key stage 3 (ages 11&#150;14).

<a name="30116w08.html_para9">The human rights of female students are protected by legislation. All maintained schools, including those set up by faith organisations, must comply with the Race Relations and Sex Discrimination Acts, and with the Human Rights Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many Union Learning Representatives there are within his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [88831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There is currently one Union Learning Representative in the Department. My officials are working with the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the main civil service union, on how best to promote the development of Union Learning Representatives within the Department.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w08.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the Government's budget is for the promotion of Union Learning representatives in the <i>(a)</i> public and <i>(b)</i> private sectors; and if he will make a statement.  [88832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government does not have a specific budget for the promotion of Union Learning Representatives in either the public or the private sector. We recognise, however, that trade unions and their learning representatives have a key role to play in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this, my Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1988. This year (2002&#150;03) #9 million is available and a further #33.6 million has been allocated for the next three years up to 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30116w08.html_para11">When it was launched, the Union Learning Fund was a new and innovative experiment, but it has now become an established part of the lifelong learning agenda. It is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and others to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their capacity as learning organisations. It has so far benefited over 28,000 people in the workplace through a wide variety of projects ranging from tackling basic skills needs to advanced professional development. It has also led to the development of a new breed of activist, the Union Learning Representative, and has helped to establish and train a growing network which now stands at more than 4,000 learning representatives nationwide.
<P>

<a name="30116w08.html_para12">Union Learning Representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly amongst the very lowest skilled workers and those with literacy and numeracy problems. That is why we have included a clause in the new Employment Bill that will give statutory backing to Union Learning Representatives. It will reinforce the invaluable role that Union Learning Representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote workforce development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.
<P>

<a name="30116w08.html_para13">Any trade union based in England can submit an application to the Union Learning Fund. A prospectus inviting bids for Union Learning Fund projects for the coming year was sent to trade unions at the end of November. This information is also available electronically via the DfES or TUC Learning Services websites. The closing date for applications is 24 January.

<P>
<a name="30116w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how she intends to implement the proposals to protect England's ancient woodland as set out in <i>(a)</i> the Forest Partnership for action and <i>(b)</i> Working with the Grain of Nature; a biodiversity strategy for England.  [89757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At the World Summit on Sustainable-Development in Johannesburg we launched the UK Forest Partnership for Action bringing together government, forest industry and environmental groups with a commitment to working together to promote sustainable development in the forest sector. Each partner will make their own contribution to the four priority areas, one of which is forest restoration and protection, through a range of actions.
<P>

<a name="30116w10.html_para0">As set out in the biodiversity strategy for England we will be refining our approach to the conservation and restoration of ancient woodland, including research to increase our knowledge of the condition of woodland and practical action on the Forestry Commission's own estate to enhance biodiversity. We will also be revising our package of incentives to ensure they help protect and enhance ancient woodland, developing ways of providing more direct advice to owners, and ways of promoting the high value of ancient woodlands.
<P>

<a name="30116w10.html_para1">One of the main threats to ancient woodland is the impact of adjacent agricultural activity and that is why the new entry-level agri-environment scheme pilots include woodlands. The scheme provides support for the maintenance of woodland fencing and the creation of buffer strips adjacent to woodlands. Both these measures will reduce or avoid any adverse impacts on woodland from adjacent agricultural activities.

 Defra officials met officials from the Home Office and Department for Trade and Industry in February 2002, and met officials from the Planning Division of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in December 2002. The meetings addressed the level of coverage required by the emergency services against the need to contain the number of telecommunication masts in AONBs and national parks, and to minimise the impact of the installation of essential masts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much was paid to the Countryside Agency for AONBs in 2002&#150;03, for core costs and projected expenditure, broken down by AONB.  [90895]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w10.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 For 2002&#150;03, Defra has provided the Countryside Agency with an extra #2.5 million to increase core funding for AONBs and cover the necessary costs incurred by local authorities in preparing and publishing statutory AONB management plans. This has raised the AONB programme budget to #6.2 million. It is for the Agency to allocate monies to individual AONBs. I am advised by the Agency that currently the national figure is only broken down to a regional level. The Agency is moving to resource accounting this year, so that accurate figures by AONB will be available shortly.

 Subject to successful completion of the current preparations, we plan to consult on draft statutory instruments establishing Conservation Boards for the Chilterns and the Cotswolds from March to June this year. I would then expect the orders to be laid (in draft form) before both Houses after Parliament returns from the summer recess. The orders would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to encourage AONBs to become recognised as biosphere reserves by UNESCO; and what support her Department will provide to successful applicants.  [90853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Any area considered for nomination as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve will need to fulfil the specific criteria for that designation. AONBs can be a useful supporting mechanism for a Biosphere Reserve as is the case with the recently extended Biosphere Reserve at Braunton Burrows in Devon. An area designated as AONB will not automatically meet the criteria for Biosphere Reserves. It is for the UK Man and Biosphere (UK MAB) Committee to consider applications for Biosphere Reserve status. The Committee will shortly be considering the next steps following the review of UK Biosphere Reserves. The Government will consider any proposal put forward by the UK MAB Committee on its individual merits for submission to UNESCO.
<P>

<a name="30116w10.html_para2">There is no funding programme specifically for Biosphere Reserves, but Biosphere Reserve status has the potential to provide an area with a framework for attracting relevant funding streams such as LEADER+ and stimulating investment. The Government support AONBs generally in England through the AONB programme, which in 2003&#150;04, will receive grants worth more than #6 million. The Countryside Agency, who administers this funding on behalf of Government, pays up to 75 per cent. of an AONBs core costs and 50 per cent. of its project costs.

 The British Cattle Movement Service operates to ISO 9001:2000 standards, is registered with the British Standards Institute and its operating practices have received the Kite mark. All documents received by the organisation are scanned electronically and recorded on arrival, and great care is taken to avoid any loss.
<P>

<a name="30116w10.html_para3">It is likely that this question refers specifically to movement notifications made by cattle keepers to the British Cattle Movement Service. BCMS has received around 22,000 representations about movement notification failures since May this year from around England, Scotland and Wales. Some cattle keepers have claimed to have told the BCMS about cattle movements, when their computerised records have been cross checked and deficiencies found, as part of the subsidy claims checking process. The Rural Payments Agency and the BCMS check these cases very carefully, and it is not right to assume that the BCMS has lost keepers' movement notification when there is no evidence of the document ever arriving at the BCMS site.
<P>

<a name="30116w10.html_para4">If keepers want to guarantee that their notifications are received by BCMS, they can send them electronically to BCMS using the online system at: www.bcms.gov.uk The BCMS are encouraging all cattle keepers to register their records via the cattle tracing system online.

 The cattle passport scheme has been in operation for over six years now and the national cattle database contains the details of the 9.4 million animals that make up the national herd. We are currently investing a further #12 million to upgrade the system and improve its performance.

<a name="30116w10.html_para5">The British Cattle Movement Service operates to ISO 9001:2000 standards, is registered with the British Standards Institute and its operating practices have received the Kite mark.

 During March and April last year the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St. Andrews University made encouraging progress in developing and testing separator grids during their monitoring work on the seasonal bass fishery off South West England. Some further work was carried out in December 2002 to refine the gear but planned trials at sea could not take place because of an accident involving one of the vessels chartered for the trial. The trial will now be resumed in spring once the commercial fishery restarts in order to further refine the system and assess its suitability for protecting dolphins in the fishery.

 The United Kingdom already meets many of the requirements of the European Landscape Convention and Defra has commissioned consultants to report on the costs and benefits of the UK deciding whether or not to sign and ratify the European Landscape Convention. That report, together with a Regulatory Impact Assessment, will inform the Government's decision which will be taken in the next few months.

<P>
<a name="30116w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The operation of UK fishing vessel licences is kept under constant review, in consultation with the industry, through the Joint Industry/Departmental Licensing Working Group which meets regularly and last reported to Ministers in November 2002. In accordance with EU rules on freedom of movement and rights of establishment, EU nationals and corporate bodies incorporated in a member state may own and license vessels on the UK fishing vessel register provided that they are resident in the UK or have a place of business in the UK respectively or alternatively that they appoint a representative person in the UK. All vessels so owned must be managed, and their operations directed and controlled, from within the UK. They must also maintain an economic link with the UK. Reports on economic link compliance are 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2003 : Column 735W</I><P>
published annually by Fisheries Departments and copies are available from the Library. Details of the number of licences acquired annually by foreign owners operating from within the EU are not recorded centrally by Fisheries Departments. However the reports on compliance include estimates since 1996 of the numbers of vessels which are understood to be beneficially owned in whole or in part by foreign interests. At 31 December 2001 there were 118 such vessels out of a registered over 10 metre fleet of 1,942 vessels, compared with 161 vessels out of a fleet of 2,467 vessels at 31 December 1996. There are currently nine vessels on the UK register whose licences are held by EU nationals not resident in, or companies not with a place of business in, the UK.

 I am advised that 645 houses were flooded during the floods over the New Year holiday. As for previous events, it depends on what the hon. Member defines as a major flood. Floods occur most winters although property flooding is generally avoided. Obviously we are all aware of the autumn 2000 event in which more than 10,000 homes were affected. In addition the 1998 flood remains in most people's memory and in that event more than 4,200 homes were flooded. Prior to that, probably the most notable was the flood event which occurred in September 1968 when large areas of the south west and southern England

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Canadian and US authorities do not require separation distances to be applied for commercial GM oilseed rape crops, but do require them for field trials. They distinguish between Brassica napus (which they call Argentine rape canola or swede rape) and Brassica rapa (which they call Polish rape canola or turnip rape). They do not differentiate separation distances based on whether the neighbouring crop is non-GM (conventional) or organic. In the UK the vast majority of the oilseed rape grown is Brassica napus, although some Brassica rapa is also grown. Cross-pollination frequency between B. napus and B. rapa is less than between plants of the same species. The separation distances in North America are as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what differences there are in the treatment of <i>(a)</i> endowment mortgage savings and <i>(b)</i> ISA mortgage savings in assessing savings in each relevant means tested benefit, including council tax benefit with savings thresholds and disregards; and whether this issue is under review.  [89104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w14.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 January 2003]:</i> Unlike an ISA mortgage savings scheme, an endowment mortgage also provides life insurance cover. It is a long-standing principle that the surrender value of any life insurance policy should be disregarded when determining entitlement to the income- related benefits, including Council Tax Benefit. This is because the intended beneficiaries of life insurance policies, are not the policy-holders themselves, but any dependants they may have at the time of their death. Because a life insurance policy is an integral part of an endowment mortgage, the overall surrender value is disregarded in the same way. However, if a life insurance policy is surrendered early or linked endowment mortgage savings are redeemed, any resulting capital is taken into account in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para2">Because ISA mortgage savings schemes do not provide life insurance cover any savings held are taken into account as capital from the outset when determining entitlement to the income-related benefits, including Council Tax Benefit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the time limit is for claiming Bereavement <i>(a)</i> Allowance and <i>(b)</i> Payment; what powers exist to extend the limit in individual cases; and in what circumstances these powers are used.  [88470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w14.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We want bereaved people to claim and receive the help that they and their families are entitled to when they need it&#151;immediately after the bereavement. Most people do: more than four-fifths claim within four or five weeks of their loss.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para6">Entitlement to Bereavement Allowance lasts for 52 weeks after the death of a spouse. If the claim for Bereavement Allowance is made within three months of the death, the benefit will be paid for the full 52 weeks. Where a claim is made more than three months after the death occurred, benefit is paid from the date of claim for the balance of the 52-week period.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para7">There are no powers to extend the three-month time limit for claims for the full 52 weeks benefit. However, there are special rules for cases in which a death is not confirmed until some time after it has occurred, for example, following a disappearance.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para8">Bereavement Payment, a one-off lump sum, must currently be claimed within three months of the death of a spouse. However, we laid amending regulations on 24 October 2002, which extend the time limit within which the lump sum Bereavement Payment may be claimed to 12 months in respect of deaths that occur on or after 1 April 2003. This aligns it with the period for which Bereavement Allowance can be paid. We believe this is a sensible alteration that will simplify the scheme for everyone, while remaining compatible with underlying benefit entitlement rules.

In addition, the pension credit when it is introduced in October 2003, is intended to reward rather than penalise those people who have modest amounts of second pension or other savings.

<P>
<a name="30116w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government is aware of the difficulties surrounding the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan and sympathises with those affected.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para9">We have had discussions with the Independent Trustee of the Plan, The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc. but have received no request to meet the Consultative Committee of the Maxwell Communication Pension Plan.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para10">The difficulties faced by the Plan are not connected to Maxwell's original fraud but reflect the subsequent performance of the pension fund in relation to the scheme's liabilities. As we have made clear to Law Debenture, this is an issue for the trustees, not the Government.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para11">We have set out the facts of the case in full in our response to representations received on this matter and I have placed a copy of that response in the Library.

<P>
<a name="30116w14.html_wqn8"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what is the weekly value of the state second pension in 2050 in the case illustrated in Figure 7.5 of the pensions Green Paper (Cm 5677); what it would have been under SERPS <i>(a)</i> as amended prior to April 2002 and <i>(b)</i> if the 20 best years provision had not been repealed; and what are the assumed earnings of the woman concerned.  [89646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The weekly value of the state second pension in the particular case illustrated is #67. The weekly value of SERPS as amended prior to April 2002 is #33. If the 20 best years provision had not been repealed, the weekly value of SERPS would have been #87.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para12">It is assumed that the woman in question earns the average female full-time weekly wage when working full time (#383) and the average female part-time weekly wage when working part time (#144). She is assumed to work for 30 years, 17 of which are full-time.
<P>

<a name="30116w14.html_para13">The reason that the 20 best years provision in SERPS generates a higher pension than state second pension is that an example of someone with substantial full-time work at average earnings is used. State second pension has been designed to benefit lower earners and part-time workers who would generally receive far less from the 20 best years rule than from state second pension.

 The allowance made in the pre-Budget report public finance forecast is based on assumptions about changes to cross-border shopping behaviour following the October launch of the next stage of the Government's long-term strategy to tackle tobacco smuggling.
<P>

<a name="30116w15.html_para1">The assumptions focus on effects that can be quantified with a degree of certainty. EU shoppers have always been allowed to bring back as much tobacco as they like, as long it is for their own use, and the revisions to the tobacco indicative levels as part of the October package do not affect that entitlement. Data from Customs and Excise's survey of cross-Channel travellers show that the majority of travellers made no purchases of cigarettes, and that, of those who did make purchases, two thirds purchased below the previous indicative level of 800 cigarettes, and that a further 15 per cent. purchased above. The recent change to the levels can be expected to have little effect on the shopping patterns of these travellers.
<P>

<a name="30116w15.html_para2">The assumptions for the public finance forecasts relate to the impact on behaviour of those remaining travellers purchasing at the previous indicative levels for tobacco. Those assumptions include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that a small proportion of travellers may be expected to increase their purchases to the new level; and
<P>
<BR>
that the average level of other purchases would increase to 1,600 cigarettes, a three-month supply for an average smoker, taking into account the affordability and profitability of trips.

<P>

<a name="30116w15.html_para3">The 2003&#150;04 figure for GLA funding is not yet available. GLA funding comes from a range of sources and is not a single grant as in the case of Scotland and Wales. A large percentage of GLA funding comes from the local government revenue support grant, and the police grant. The Home Secretary and the Minister for Local Government announced a consultation on proposals for these amounts to the House on the 5 December. Further funding to the GLA comes through the GLA transport grant.

1. Licence fees include receipts from fees for onshore and offshore petroleum exploration and production licenses, including initial and periodic payments and tender receipts from offshore licensing of #37 million from the 4th round in 1971&#150;72, #33 million the 8th round in 1982&#150;83 and #121 million from the 9th round in 1984&#150;85.<P>

2. Supplementary Petroleum Duty (SPD) was introduced with effect from 1 January 1981 by the 1981 Finance Act and lapsed after 31 December 1982; it was payable at the rate of 20 per cent. on the gross value of oil and gas produced under UK licences less an allowance per field of one million tonnes per year; it did not apply to PRT-exempt sales of gas to the British Gas Corporation.<P>

3. Advance Petroleum Tax (APRT) is included with PRT. The net PRT repayment in 1991&#150;92 and low net receipts in 1992&#150;93 resulted from high tax-relievable expenditure claimed on some fields.<P>

4. The level of Corporation Tax receipts in 1993&#150;94 reflected low liabilities in 1992 (paid in the following financial year) and repayment resulting from lower settlements for earlier years.<P>

5. The ACT (Advance Corporation Tax) Set-off is estimated because the dividends attributable to UK oil and gas cannot be separately identified from other dividends.<P>

6. Mainstream Corporation Tax (CT) equals CT before the ACT Set-off less the estimated ACT Set-of.<P>

<a name="30116w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government's Updated Drug Strategy, launched on 3 December 2002, described the introduction, from 2003&#150;04, of a comprehensive new programme of criminal justice interventions aimed at getting drug misusers out of crime into effective treatment. This programme includes, amongst other initiatives, the enhancement of existing arrest referral schemes, doubling the availability of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders, building on the current Drug Testing projects and extending the approach more widely and piloting a presumption against bail for those who refuse to access treatment. The programme will be backed up by improvements in treatment capacity and local delivery.
<P>

<a name="30116w17.html_para3">Some elements of the new programme, such as enhanced arrest referral, will apply across England and Wales from year one; others will be introduced on a phased basis, with the initial focus on those areas with the highest levels of acquisitive crime.

 The Government's position on the reimbursement of penalties paid under the previous civil penalty regime is clear. We are under no obligation to return any of the money paid against penalties imposed in cases which were not party to the Roth litigation. The previous legislation was not found to be unlawful. Theoretically, unpaid penalties could have been enforced but, in the light of the Court of Appeal's findings in Roth, we considered it appropriate not to take enforcement action in respect of outstanding penalties.

 The Immigration Service uses a wide range of technology to detect clandestine entrants, including heartbeat detectors, passive millimetric wave imagers and CO2 detectors. However, responsibility for protecting vehicles in order to prevent the carriage of unauthorised people properly lies with the vehicle operator and not with the Immigration Service. Carriers who comply fully with the Code of Practice for the prevention of clandestine entry, and who have no knowledge or suspicion of the presence of unauthorised people, will not be liable to a penalty. If liability is incurred, the level of penalty set will take into account mitigating factors which will include the extent of any checks, including those using CO2 or other detection equipment, carried out by third parties immediately prior to embarkation for the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what health study his Department proposes to undertake into the Airwave Police Communication System; and if he will make a statement;  [89603]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many police forces use the Airwave Communication System; what representations he has received about the system; and if he will make a statement.  [89604]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We have taken advice from experts and consider that Airwave is safe. The Stewart report recommended that a precautionary approach should be taken on mobile phones and health. The Home Office is, therefore, setting up a health-monitoring programme for Airwave users in the police service, inconsultation with police organisations, epidemiologists and occupational health experts. Tenders are currently under consideration.
<P>

<a name="30116w19.html_para0">When a force moves to Airwave, the roll out is phased, starting from the point at which forces achieve a ready for service (RFS) date. Once that date has been achieved, the move from the existing system to Airwave begins within the force. Generally, that move takes place over a period of time with the forces migrating, typically, one division at a time.
<P>

<a name="30116w19.html_para1">Currently, there are seven forces in various stages of migration to Airwave: Lancashire, Greater Manchester Police, West Mercia, Suffolk, Leicestershire, North Yorkshire and Northumbria. West Mercia has just become the first force to become fully live with Airwave.
<P>

<a name="30116w19.html_para2">Representations have been received from a range of groups, including the Police Federation, Mast Sanity, Association of National Park Authorities, residents associations and individuals. Topics have included health and safety, mast placement and potential interference with other equipment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 January 2003]</i>: We announced the provisional police funding settlement on 5 December. The consultation period for representations ended on 14 January. All representations received by then will be taken into account before the announcement of the final funding settlement on 5 February. I would be very happy to meet members of the Authority and hon. Members, as I have other hon. Members from other areas, but I must respect the closing date for representations on the allocation for next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 January 2003]:</i> The most recent figures available are those given in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) annual report, published on 9 December 2002. These show that the response times for attending incidents in <i>(a)</i> rural areas were 85.3 per cent. within 20 minutes and <i>(b)</i> in urban areas 83.9 per cent. within 1 5 minutes.

<a name="30116w19.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There is no routinely collected data on the number of prisoners who have dependent children. However, a Home Office study of a large sample of imprisoned mothers and children, published in 1997, found that 60 per cent. of female prisoners had dependent children under the age of 18. Another 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 2003 : Column 763W</I><P>
smaller, but more recent, study of women prisoners and their work in custody, published in 2000, found broadly similar results (out of a sample of 567 sentenced women, 66 per cent. had dependent children under the age of 18).
<P>

<a name="30116w19.html_para3">Directly equivalent information for male prisoners is not available. However, the 1991 England and Wales prison survey showed that 32 per cent. of male prisoners had dependent children who had been living with them just before they were imprisoned; the corresponding figure for female prisoners was 47 per cent.

 The Home Office has an Anti Fraud and Corruption Strategy that is based upon increasing the awareness of staff, use of cost effective methods to inhibit fraud and corruption and establishing procedures to respond effectively to incidents of alleged fraud including the provision of confidential 'hot lines'. The department's overall security arrangements provide the basis for combating theft, supported by reminders to staff about preventative measures available to them. Individual line managers are responsible for combating fraud and corruption in their own areas.
<P>

<a name="30116w20.html_para0">In the 2001&#150;02 annual return, the known cost to the Department of fraud involving employees and contractors was #142,485, of which #121,310 related to the Department's agencies.

<a name="30116w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The study 'Young People and Street Crime' published by the Youth Justice Board on 9 January shows clearly that young people involved in street crime offences are more likely to have been disruptive in school and to have had a high level of absence through truancy or exclusion. This adds to the existing evidence to show that truancy and exclusion can increase the risk of offending. The 2002 Youth Justice Board Youth Survey showed that 44 per cent. of young people who admitted to offending in the last year had also played truant.
<P>

<a name="30116w20.html_para1">The Government are taking action to reduce levels of truancy. Specific measures include the Behaviour Improvement Programme, covering over 700 schools, to improve pupil behaviour and reduce truancy and exclusions; the police and schools working together to conduct truancy sweeps; the deployment of an additional 100 police officers to work in schools; and increased powers to deal with the parents of persistent truants, including the piloting of new fast-track prosecution procedures.

 A precise figure is not available, but the cost of recording electronically the admissions and departures of all non-EEA nationals is provisionally estimated to be around #20 million a year. This estimate includes the costs of reintroducing fully staffed embarkation controls, which were withdrawn for passengers travelling to European Union destinations from ferry ports and small airports in 1994 and reconfigured at major airports in 1998.

<a name="30116w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The disruption of drug production in Afghanistan was not among the aims of the military campaign. However, the fall of the Taliban and consequent appointment of the Afghan Transitional Authority through a Loya Jirga meeting (Grand Council) has created a new opportunity to end Afghan opium production. The UK is co-ordinating international support for Afghanistan's drug control efforts and has produced, in consultation with the Afghan Government, other donors and international agencies, a long-term strategy for building up Afghan drug law enforcement capacity and providing alternative livelihoods to opium poppy farmers. The brutality of the Taliban regime had helped to restrict production of poppies in the final year of their rule. Their replacement by a Government committed to international human rights norms will inevitably see some increase in production. But alternative livelihoods

The strategy we have negotiated with the Afghan Government aims to achieve the Government's target of contributing to the elimination of drugs from Afghanistan within 10 years.

Therefore, no fines were payable, but the Commission asked the Court to order that costs of the case be borne by France. The UK Government regrets the decision by the European Commission not to pursue the case for penalties against France. The UK has supported the Commission throughout and believes that pressing this case would have sent a firm message to member states that no one country can avoid its obligations and responsibilities.

 The Government believes it is important for consumers to have choice in financial products, including the availability of 'ethical' products. However, it would not be appropriate for the Government to support exclusively the development of one specific group of financial service providers. It is for individual consumers to decide the attributes they most value from their financial services and for financial services firms to be transparent about their use of funds and investments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what further steps the Russian Federation has agreed to take to advance the implementation of the Global Partners Agreement, known as ten plus ten plus ten; what further action it is required to take; and if he will make a statement.

 Russia is a committed member of the G8 'Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction'. In December 2002 the Russian Government decided to set up a new interagency committee, which will be chaired by the Russian Prime Minister. On 10 January this year Russia pledged $2 billion over the next 10 years to the Partnership. This includes $204 million on high-priority projects in 2003, focusing on the destruction of chemical weapons and work on decommissioned nuclear submarines.
<P>

<a name="30116w21.html_para0">However, for most of the work to begin Russia has to agree to a legal framework that is satisfactory to donor countries. At present there are problems with liability and taxation provisions and these must be solved before many large projects can go ahead. This delay also affects the UK, which has made strenuous efforts to overcome these final obstacles. Conclusion of an agreement is a prerequisite to the start of much of the project-work. We hope that an agreement can be reached very shortly, as the UK is at an advanced stage of readiness and once the legal framework is in place, projects can quickly begin.
<P>

<a name="30116w21.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced to Parliament last July the UK's commitment to the Global Partnership of up to $750 million over 10 years (1 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 21).

 I have been kept fully informed of plans to establish a university for the NHS (the NHSU).
<P>

<a name="30116w23.html_para11">NHSU has initially been developed with the Department of Health for the NHS in England although it is recognised that discussions will have to be held with other administrations on the scope of NHSU outside England. As a first step the NHSU Development Plan is being circulated to HPSS bodies and other interested parties here for comment. This process will inform decisions on how NHSU might be used to support lifelong learning for everyone involved in health and social care in Northern Ireland.

 Ambulance Service response times to emergency calls has improved significantly since sub-stations were introduced. For example, in the 12 months since the ambulance sub-station at Carrickfergus was opened in January 2002, the 8-minute response target was met in 45.3 per cent. of cases&#151;against a target of 50 per cent.&#151; while the 21-minute response target was met in 94.7 per cent. of cases&#151;against a target of 95 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what financial assistance the widow of a police officer who was killed in the line of duty will receive.  [86654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w24.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The financial assistance awarded to the widows of police officers killed in the line of duty is governed by the RUC Pensions Regulations 1973 and 1988 and the RUC Injury Benefit Regulations 1988 which provide for the payment of a gratuity and a pension.
<P>

<a name="30116w24.html_para1">Prior to 25 November 1982 the gratuity was two  average pensionable pay (APP). The APP was averaged over three years. From 25 November 1982 the gratuity was five  annual rate of pay or four  total remuneration, whichever is the lower, plus two  maximum pay of a constable in the London Metropolitan less 1&#188; APP.
<P>

<a name="30116w24.html_para2">The widow's pension awarded is the rate of pay plus rent allowance less child allowance for the first 13 weeks. Thereafter, the pension is 50 per cent. of APP. Child allowance is 10 per cent. of APP per child up to a maximum of 40 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w24.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Police Service of Northern Ireland records indicate that 224 awards have been paid as a result of officers being killed in the line of duty as a direct result of terrorist activity. The total amount of money distributed in respect of these 224 awards could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30116w24.html_para3">The above awards would not take into account the #4.2 million paid by Government to those RUC widows whose husbands were killed by terrorists prior to 25 November 1982, or any subsequent payments made to RUC widows by the Police Fund.

 The Government do not comment on intelligence assessments. The Secretary of State continues to make judgments on ceasefires, taking account of all the relevant factors, but it has been made plain that there must be an end to all paramilitary activity, including training, targeting and punishment attacks.

 The RUC Benevolent Fund, the Police Dependants Trust and the Northern Ireland Police Fund are in a position to provide financial assistance to the families of ex-police officers murdered as a direct result of terrorism. In addition to financial support, PSNI Welfare Services and the Police Rehabilitation and Retraining Trust can provide emotional and counselling support.

 The majority of memorials erected locally within police stations, and the Book of Remembrance at PSNI HQ Brooklyn, commemorate the death of serving police officers as a result of terrorist activity. There are no plans to include ex-officers in these memorials.

 I want to hear the views of parents on the responses to the Burns consultation and on the next stages of the post-primary review. A sample of schools, drawn from all sectors and management types across the five education and library boards, (a copy of which has been placed in the Library) have each been asked to nominate a parent to meet with my officials in mid-January to give their views on these issues. This follows the process used by CCEA in its consultation on the Curriculum Review.

 Sectarian violence in North Belfast is constantly monitored by both NIO and PSNI and, in response to this, security measures are kept under continual review. A 3 m high extension has been completed to the security fence that runs along the Alliance avenue/Glenbryn park interface, bringing the total height to 9 m. Also, in addition to the CCTV camera already in place at the junction of Ardoyne road/Alliance avenue, the PSNI are currently installing two new cameras at Berwick road and Etna drive.

<a name="30116w24.html_para7">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE), operates the SPED scheme.

Applicants are also required to make a statement that they have been resident in Northern Ireland for the requisite three-month period before the date of their application and to state any other address in the United Kingdom in respect of which they are, or have applied to be, registered. The Chief Electoral Officer is required to remove a person's name from the Electoral Register if their application does not contain any of the above information. These changes came into effect at the Annual Canvass conducted on 15 October 2002. The new Electoral Register was published on 29 November 2002.

 The causes of the gender pay gap are complex. The Government have set in place a number of measures designed to tackle them. The Employment Act 2002 when it comes into force in April 2003, for example, will introduce an equal pay questionnaire and measures to help mothers stay attached to the labour market.

<a name="30116w25.html_para5">In order to qualify for childcare tax credit, parents have to satisfy two requirements. Firstly they must qualify for WFTC working more than 16 hours per week with a family income below the eligible maximum. Secondly they have to be using registered child care and if you have a partner he or she must also be working more than 16 hours. Because of the difficulties in identifying the people meeting these criteria and the constantly changing profile of recipients, it is difficult to estimate the number of parents eligible but not claiming the childcare tax credit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what has been the average <i>(a)</i> gross and <i>(b)</i> net price received per barrel of oil extracted from the UK section of the North Sea in each year since 1974; and what the average price of oil per barrel was on the world market in each of those years.  [90792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30116w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The DTI surveys which collect data giving the average price received per barrel of oil extracted from the UK were begun only in 1976. The prices from these surveys have been converted to $/barrel and are shown in the table against the spot prices of the three major world benchmark crudes. The prices shown are gross; prices net of costs and taxes/royalties cannot be estimated because data restricted to oil production are unavailable.

<a name="30116w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that proven global reserves of conventional crude oil and natural gas liquids are 959 billion barrels. In addition, the IEA estimates undiscovered resources of conventional crude oil and natural gas liquids to be 939 billion barrels and recoverable non-conventional reserves, such as oil shales, to be 580 billion barrels. In their 2002 publication World Energy Outlook, the IEA commented that resources of conventional crude oil and natural gas liquids are adequate to meet the projected increase in demand to 2030, although new discoveries will be needed to renew reserves.

<P>

<a name="30116w27.html_para3">To date, off-site plans under REPPIR have been identified as necessary for all sites licensed under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and certain Ministry of Defence sites. REPPIR allows local authorities to charge site operators for their costs in preparing, reviewing, revising and testing off-site plans and has formalised local arrangements that existed for many nuclear sites prior to the Regulations coming into force. I would not expect the additional costs to local authorities of complying with REPPIR to be significant.

 The Department of Health has no plans to change the name of accident and emergency departments and has therefore made no estimate of the costs or effect of doing so. We understand the British association of accident and emergency medicine (BAEM) and faculty of accident and emergency medicine (FAEM) are balloting their members on a proposal to change the name of the specialty to emergency medicine. We will consider the views of the BAEM and FAEM when they have reported them to the Department.

 Information is not available in the form requested. In the case of residential rehabilitation, places are often purchased at a residential centre that may be outside the drug misusers area of residence. In practice some local authority social services departments agree to fund long distance placements with the agreement of the drug misusers so he/she can be removed from the area where they are involved in drug using. This means that in theory all of the approximately 3,100 residential rehabilitation places for drug and alcohol misusers in England are available to drug misusers resident in Twickenham and other parts of London. However, purchasing decisions are a matter for agreement between the drug misusers and the local agencies.
