To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer of 8 July 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 702W, on Nepal, if she will make a statement on the failure of the Nepalese Government to allow journalists and aid agencies access to the western districts of Nepal.

 UK funded development assistance, and that of other donor agencies too, continues throughout Nepal, including in many of the Mid- and Far-Western districts of the country where the conflict situation is worse. However, development staff based in Kathmandu do not, for security reasons, visit areas of active conflict. There are no Government restrictions per se.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para0">There has been some press coverage recently of visits made by journalists to districts in the west of the country. However, the current State of Emergency is deterring many journalists from visiting parts of the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) of 8 July 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 613W, on World Bank loans, how much the UK Government contributed to the 12th Replenishment of the International Development Association IDA-12; and how much it contributed to IDA-13. [69515]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The British Government contributed &#163;511m to the 12th Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA-12), equating to a 7.3 per cent. share. This made the UK the joint fourth largest donor to IDA.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para1">The UK's contribution to the 13th Replenishment of IDA (IDA-13) has not yet been finalised. An announcement will be made shortly.

<P>
<a name="20712w01.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) of 8 July 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 613W, on World Bank loans, what provisions are in place to ensure that the level of overall IDA resources does not decrease in future as a result of the conversion of some loans to grants; and if she will make a statement. [69514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Around 40 per cent of the International Development Association's (IDA's) resources currently come from re-flows from previous loans being repaid. During negotiations for the 13th Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA-13), the British Government argued consistently that if some loans were to be converted to grants under IDA-13, IDA donors 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 2002 : Column 1226W</I><P>
should ensure that a scheme was agreed to compensate IDA for the resulting future loss in re-flows. Such a scheme would require donors to start putting aside a small amount of resources now and during future replenishments.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para2">Very regrettably, IDA donors have not yet managed to agree such a scheme, despite strong UK pressure to do so. Donors have, however, accepted the principle that extra resources do need to be put aside in advance of future shortfalls. They have agreed to make a final decision on what sort of scheme should be used during the Mid-Term Review of IDA-13, which is scheduled to begin in around six months' time. The British Government will continue to press hard to ensure a satisfactory outcome which will protect IDA's long-term financial sustainability.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of the collection of fines by the Court Service; [62600]
(2) what the level of arrears of fines was, and what percentage of fines had not been collected within the due time <i>(a)</i> in the last 12 months and <i>(b)</i> in the 12 month period before the change in the collection system; and if he will make a statement. [62601]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w01.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Fines are imposed by both Magistrates' Courts and the Crown Court. The Crown Court is part of the Court Service, which is an executive agency of the Lord Chancellor's Department. The Court Service does not collect fines. Fines are collected by Magistrates' Courts and their staff, which constitute an independent local service with statutory powers for the enforcement and collection of financial penalties.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para3">The Government are committed to improving the enforcement of financial penalties. Variations in performance across the country are too wide. We have transferred lead responsibility for warrant execution from the police to Magistrates' Courts Committees, on 1 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para4">We have established an information sharing scheme, which enables Magistrates' Courts to obtain basic information on defaulters from the Department for Work and Pensions. We have set performance targets for 2002&#150;03 and Magistrates' Courts Committees have also been given nearly &#163;10 million extra from April 2002, ring-fenced for enforcement purposes. We will monitor the position carefully to check that performance improves.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para5">Magistrates' Courts Committees have responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed through the courts, including not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not possible to separate out just the fines from the total.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para6">Arrears is described as the total of missed lump sums or missed instalments on impositions where deferred payment was allowed. The latest available figures for the level of arrears of all debt are:




<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 2002 : Column 1227W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para7">(c) &#163;246 million as at 31 March 2002; and
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para8">(d) &#163;226 million as at 31 March 2001.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para9">Data are only collected on the financial value of the debt, not the number of fines. Fines are normally payable from the moment of imposition unless time to pay is granted.
<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para10">Since the transfer, the write-off rate has reduced from 19 per cent of total debt imposed in 2000&#150;01 to 15 per cent. of total debt imposed in 2001&#150;02, which was equivalent to &#163;19.5 million.

<P>

<a name="20712w01.html_para11">The Board provides specialist training to those judges authorised to hear cases of rape through its regular Serious Sexual Offences Seminars.

 The Highways Agency has received numerous complaints from local residents living adjacent to the M1 south of junction 25 about the high level of traffic noise. As part of the Government's "New Deal for Trunk Roads in England", revised criteria and a ring fenced annual budget have been established to help the Agency to deal with some of the most serious and pressing cases of noise from the motorway and trunk road network.
<P>

<a name="20712w02.html_para6">Following an initial assessment of sites on the network, the M1 junction 25 was identified as an area with a particular noise problem and was subsequently included in the list of locations to be prioritised for treatment published in <i>Hansard </i>in November 1999.

Environmental barriers were found to be the most cost effective solution. A local consultation exercise was carried out in October 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In June 2001 Defence Estates SW provided an outline desktop valuation of the Dean Hill Munitions Site to advise the Defence Munitions Rationalisation Study 2 Investment Appraisal.
<P>

<a name="20712w02.html_para8">The valuation was based on the estimated realisation price, assuming that the sites had been subject to a Phase 2 Land Quality Assessment. It had been proposed that the eventual value for the site would be abated by the cost of the remedial work once known. Site inspections were permitted. However, in view of the sensitivity of the issues and as the purpose was to inform an investment appraisal, no approach was made to the local planning authority at that stage.
<P>

<a name="20712w02.html_para9">Due to the absence of clear planning guidance, with the exception of the residential property and agricultural land, the possible future uses of the remainder of the site were limited, The value was established by assuming disposal of the residential and agricultural property, and based on the limited redevelopment and re-use of the remaining area for potential employment uses.

 Defence Munitions is part of the DG Defence Supply Chain (DG Def SC) that, in turn, is part of the Defence Logistics Organisation. Defence Munitions Rationalisation Study 2 identified a number of potential efficiency initiatives pertinent to the Defence Munitions environment, including the proposal to close Defence Munitions Dean Hill.

<a name="20712w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Nottingham's last refit began in August 1999 and she returned to the Fleet in February 2001 following sea trials.
<P>

<a name="20712w03.html_para0">HMS Nottingham deployed from Portsmouth on 18 March 2002 and was scheduled to return to the United Kingdom on 6 December 2002. She deployed for duties as the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) ship but was subsequently assigned to Operation ORACLE in support of the fight against terrorism and was being held at notice for this purpose while deployed to the Asia Pacific to honour our commitments to the FPDA. The main focus of this deployment was to have been participation in the FPDA Exercise STARDEX in September with other FPDA partners (Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore). HMS Nottingham was also scheduled to undertake a series of visits in support of Defence Diplomacy, wider security objectives, and Defence Export Services and United Kingdom industry initiatives. Her immediate programme will no longer proceed. The impact on Fleet programming is being assessed.

<a name="20712w03.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I have received a number of letters from the UK pig industry, which is naturally anxious that overseas restrictions on the import of British pigs are removed as soon as possible. The Chief Veterinary Officer wrote to his opposite numbers in other countries on 25 January this year asking them to recognise the UK's foot and mouth disease free status and requesting import certification requirements for livestock and genetic material. Officials in my Department are working closely with representatives from the livestock industry to identify the priority markets and to pursuade those countries to lift any remaining restrictions. The priority countries for pigs and porcine genetic material include Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovak Republic, South Africa, Thailand, USA. This is being pursued by a variety of methods such as lobbying officials at trade shows, bringing them in on inward missions, getting British Embassies to make representations and through further correspondence.

 The accounts of the principal contractors used by DEFRA during the FMD outbreak have been the subject of detailed examination. This has been an extensive exercise as the contractors concerned carried out work to the value of hundreds of millions of pounds involving the generation of tens of thousands of invoices. This work is on-going.
<P>

<a name="20712w03.html_para2">It has necessitated DEFRA obtaining legal advice from a number of external law firms as well as the establishment of invoicing panels and commercial teams staffed by forensic accountants and quantity surveyors, all of whom come from external professional firms.
<P>

<a name="20712w03.html_para3">It is on the recommendation of these panels and teams following examination of the accounts that further payments have been made by DEFRA to contractors and/or deductions have been sought from the contractors' invoiced sums. In many cases, the deductions have been substantial. The process is on-going.
<P>

<a name="20712w03.html_para4">Wide-ranging issues have arisen on the accounts. These include legal issues such as matters of contractual interpretation, forensic accountancy issues and evidential issues involving the assessment of both a large amount of documentation and proofing of witnesses.
<P>

<a name="20712w03.html_para5">Some of these disputes will inevitably result in court proceedings although DEFRA remains committed to resolving matters by mediation where appropriate. We will have no hesitation in taking whatever action is required to protect taxpayer interest in the light of forensic examination of the accounts of contractors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 On TRIPS, we are strong advocates of the need to find a solution by the end of 2002 to the problem of the difficulties which some WTO Members could face in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement as a result of having insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector.
<P>

<a name="20712w06.html_para2">Beyond that, we support continued discussions in the TRIPS Council on the relationship between TRIPS and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and how TRIPS and the CBD can be implemented in a mutually supportive manner.

<a name="20712w06.html_para4">On GATS, the Government strongly support the current negotiations. The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world. Our aim is to achieve further steps in the progressive liberalisation of trade in services, which we believe will have a positive impact not only on our own economic interests but also on the development of developing countries. That said, the EC has made clear in its liberalisation requests that it is not seeking the dismantling of public services nor the privatisation of state owned companies. Under GATS, countries cannot be forced to privatise services where it is not in their interest to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w07.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House on 3 July 2002, announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until 10 January 2003. The Government have made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para2">The paper includes a number of estimates of what a scheme would cost, depending on the sophistication of the card. A reasonable estimate would be that a scheme would cost around &#163;1.5 billion over a 13 year period covering the three years it would take to set up the necessary Information Technology systems and the 10 year period for which the first cards would be valid.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para3">This would include much more stringent identity checks than currently apply for passports and driving licences in response to increased levels of fraudulent applications.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para4">It would also include the costs of using biometric information (fingerprints or iris images) which would uniquely link the card holder with a card.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para5">This estimate does not include any savings to Government through more efficient administration and reductions in fraud. The paper also sets out how the costs might be recovered through increases in fees for driving licences and passports and charging a fee for entitlement cards issued to those who did not qualify for or who did not want to apply for a card in the form of a photocard driving licence or passport card. It would not be the Government's intention to use funds allocated for investment in public services for a card scheme.

 Details for the calendar years 1990 to 1997, and financial years thereafter, were published in table 2.11 of "Criminal Statistics England and Wales 2000", and are given in the table.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para8">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which increased the total number of crimes counted in each police force area, and therefore may have affected the detection rate. Detection rates after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para9">There was a change in the counting rules for detections on 1 April 1999, the new instructions providing more precise and rigorous criteria for securing a detection, with the underlying emphasis on the successful result of a police investigation. For example, detections obtained by the interview of a convicted prisoner were no longer included. Numbers of detections before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="20712w07.html_para10">As different police forces have different crime mixes, comparing overall detection rates between forces is of limited value. This is because different types of crime tend to have different detection rates, and so a police force with which has a higher proportion of types of crime with high detection rates will tend to have a higher overall detection rate. Also, police forces may give priority to tackling particular types of crime, with the detection rate of those crimes having some effect on the force's overall detection rate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department at what level he plans to set the crime fighting fund in future years; and what plans he has to fund an increase in the number of police officers. [68040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Under the Government's Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) recruitment initiative, forces have been allocated funding for 9,000 recruits over and above their previous recruitment plans for the three years to March 2003 which will ensure a total 130,000 officers by April 2003.
<P>

<a name="20712w08.html_para0">&#163;454 million has been provided to cover the cost of officers recruited under the scheme during these three years. In addition, the Spending Review 2000 also provided &#163;272 million for 2003&#150;04 to meet the continuing cost of officers recruited under the CFF initiative.
<P>

<a name="20712w08.html_para1">Provision for funding CFF officers beyond 2003&#150;04 is a matter for the current Spending Review. Further provision for the Crime Fighting Fund or other central government funding specifically to increase the number of police officers will be determined in the light of the outcome of the Spending Review 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The cross-government Street Crime Action Group, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister agreed that it would be helpful for each of the 10 street crime areas to be supported by a minister. As one of the sponsor ministers Baroness Blackstone is undertaking visits to Avon and Somerset to meet with and support local agencies, to promote a shared approach to tackling street crime at local level, and to identify any issues on which further action by government agencies would be helpful.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prosecutions for illegal working have taken place in the last 12 months; and with what results. [68644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w08.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The information requested is not available centrally, as illegal working is a circumstance rather than a specific offence and the Home Office Court Proceedings Database does not hold information on offence circumstances. However, in the year 2000, 32 persons were prosecuted under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. This section makes it an offence for employers knowingly or negligently to employ persons aged 16 or over who are subject to immigration control unless they fall into one of two categories. They must either have current and valid permission to be in the United Kingdom which does not prevent them taking the job in question, or they must fall into a category where such employment is otherwise allowed.
<P>

<a name="20712w08.html_para3">Information on the number of prosecutions in 2001 is due to be published in the Command Paper "Control of Immigration Statistics United Kingdom 2001" in late autumn of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w08.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are the equivalent of 68 immigration officers, based on the number of staff days worked in a typical week, deployed on freight searching duties at Dover. The officers operate the heartbeat detector as well as other methods for detecting clandestine illegal entrants, such as dogs and carbon dioxide detectors.
<P>

<a name="20712w08.html_para4">The heartbeat detector is not deployed at Folkestone. However the Immigration Service deploys 56 officers in the United Kingdom Control Zone at Coquelles to operate the heartbeat detector and other detection methods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Public Service Agreement target is to reduce robbery in the Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, West Midlands and Metropolitan Police Service areas by 14 per cent by 2005. The target is ongoing and the forces concerned are continuing to work towards its delivery.

<a name="20712w08.html_para5">In 1999, the CPS prosecuted 6,404 cases of domestic violence. In 2000, the CPS prosecuted 7,680 cases of domestic violence. In 2001, the CPS prosecuted 7,996 cases of domestic violence. The figures include cases where a defendant agreed to be bound over and are based on the CPS monitoring system of annual 3-month snapshots carried out between 1999 and 2001.

 From a community of over 19,500 persons entitled to immunity, 21 serious offences, allegedly committed by such persons, were drawn to the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2001. "Serious offences" are defined in accordance with the 1985 White Paper on Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges&#151;i.e. as offences that would, in certain circumstances, carry a penalty of 12 months or more imprisonment.

 At the end of 2001, unpaid fines in respect of parking and other minor traffic violations incurred by Diplomatic Missions and International Organisations in the United Kingdom totalled 5,842 (&#163;276,410.00). In April this year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to all affected Diplomatic Missions and International Organisations giving them the opportunity either to pay their outstanding fines or to appeal against them if they considered that the fines had been issued incorrectly. As a result payments totalling &#163;62,931.00 were received, leaving a total of 4,485 (&#163;213,479.00) unpaid fines for 2001. The attached table details those Diplomatic Missions and International Organisations that have more than 10 undisputed fines unpaid.

 The other factors referred to by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary in his response to the question from the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), 8 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 650&#150;52W, were the result of extensive discussion within Government. Since they were an elaboration of existing policy covering a limited category of cases, we did not conduct consultations outside the Government within the UK. But we conducted two rounds of consultations with other EU Member States to check carefully their approach in such cases. Our consultations confirmed that other EU MS recognise the need for a special approach in such cases.

 Since April 2002, funding to support implementation of local teenage pregnancy strategies has been routed to top tier local authorities through the teenage pregnancy local implementation grant. The resources support locally agreed teenage pregnancy strategies and action plans, developed jointly by health and local authority partners, with the aim of pump-priming promising approaches and new developments, and facilitating effective local co-ordina- tion. The local teenage pregnancy partnership board, with representation from the local authority, primary care trusts (PCTs) and other key local partners, make recommendations on the use of the grant and oversee implementation of the local action plan.

<a name="20712w10.html_para3">Local teenage pregnancy partnership boards also liaise with the local authorities, PCTs, and other local organisations to secure additional mainstream sources of funding to support implementation of the strategy.

 The Department's committee on the medical effects of air pollutants published a report in 1998 on "Quantification of the Health Effects of Air Pollution on Health in the United Kingdom", a copy of which is available in the Library. The report was based on levels of pollutants in 1995. It estimated that the deaths of between 12,000 and 24,000 vulnerable people (mainly those with heart or lung disease) may be brought forward and between 14,000 and 24,000 respiratory hospital admissions and readmissions may be associated with short term exposure to air pollution each year.

 Staffordshire Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust has consistently been one of the best performers for "Category A" response times in the United Kingdom. In 2001&#150;02, they not only exceeded the national target of 75 per cent. of calls responded to within eight minutes, but also exceeded the target for 2002&#150;03 of 80 per cent of calls responded to within eight minutes. Their response rate was listed by the National Audit office in figures published recently as achieving an average of 87.5 per cent., the top performer in the UK. The trust is to be commended on their continuing excellent response rates.

Proprietary analgesics are difficult to define as a group and include aspirin-based, paracetamol-based and NSAID based products, the data for which are provided in the table above. These data should be seen in the context of the very wide usage of these drugs with millions of patients being treated every year in the United Kingdom.<P>

It is important to note that submission of a suspected ADR report does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease.<P>

Data from the yellow card scheme cannot be used to measure the frequency of an adverse reaction as it is associated with a degree of underreporting which varies between different medicines.<P>

The MCA/CSM has provided guidance on safe prescribing of NSAIDs to health professionals in 1994 and most recently in April 2002.<P>

<a name="20712w11.html_para2">The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) recommended (COMARE Third Report) an investigation of the geographical distribution of childhood cancer and leukaemia in Great Britain and how the pattern of cases around nuclear installations compares with the national pattern. A study has been commissioned by the Department of Health Radiological Protection Research Programme (RPRP) and is a multicentre study co-ordinated by the childhood cancer research group in Oxford. This study is nearing completion and the Department has asked COMARE to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations in Great Britain have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity which are statistically outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE is hoping to report on this aspect of the study to the Department in 2003. The study is investigating, among other topics, clustering as a feature of childhood cancer. This will be broken down as leukaemia and other childhood cancers and other groupings considered relevant. The study will also relate leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma around nuclear installations to the Great Britain clustering analysis.

<a name="20712w11.html_para3">When complete, the database will also allow investigation of other environmental factors and their potential relevance to the temporal and spatial distribution of childhood cancer.

<a name="20712w12.html_para0">In November 2001 the HFEA and the Human Genetics Commission (HGC) published the outcome of their joint public consultation on PGD which had begun in November 1999 as a joint consultation between the HFEA and the then Advisory Committee on Genetics Testing. This supported the use of PGD, subject to strict licensing arrangements, and concluded that tissue-typing as part of PGD would require further discussion. Following further consideration of the issue by the HFEA's ethics committee, the HFEA announced in December 2001 their decision in principle to allow PGD for serious genetic disease to be used in conjunction with tissue typing. Applications are considered on an individual basis and to date only one licence has been granted after very careful and lengthy consideration of the issues involved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what progress the Government have made in its negotiations within Europe to amend the drafting of the European Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive to ensure that account can be taken of herbal traditions from outside the EU in satisfying the 30 years qualifying period for herbal products without proof of efficacy; [66852]

(5) what estimate his Department has made of the number of herbal products available in the UK that will be excluded under the current draft of amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC concerning traditional herbal medicinal products; [66855]
(6) what plans he has to inform the public of the difference between a licensed and a registered herbal product; and what this difference will mean in terms of the safety and efficacy of the herbal product; [66859]

(8) if he will define the terms very high, high and medium in terms of pounds sterling, with regard to compliance costs referred to in the regulatory assessment for the prosposals amending Directive 2001/83/EC regarding traditional herbal medicinal products. [66774]<P>

<P>
<a name="20712w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 An assessment of safety issues associated with herbal medicines, whether comprising of one or more ingredients, will be placed in the Library. In summary, safety issues relating to unlicensed herbal remedies leading to public health risk have arisen in the United Kingdom and elsewhere as a result of a number of factors. These include: interactions between herbal remedies and other medicines; the inherent toxicity of a herbal ingredient; the inclusion of toxic herbal ingredients or contamination as a result of poor manufacturing standards; and the adulteration of herbal remedies with other ingredients, such as prescription only cortico- steroids.
<P>

<a name="20712w12.html_para1">There are a range of possible reasons why a product currently sold as an unlicensed herbal remedy under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, 1968, might not satisfy the criteria of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. There are no specific quality or safety standards set under the current regulatory regime for unlicensed herbal remedies and it is therefore possible that in some cases, without adjustment to the product, the safety and quality standards applicable under the proposed directive might not be met. Concerns have been expressed by some respondents to a recent consultation exercise (MLX 283) carried out by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) that some products, currently legally sold as unlicensed herbal remedies may fall outside the scope of the directive as a result of an inability to demonstrate traditional usage as currently defined in the directive. The consultation period has been extended to the end of July specifically to allow those expressing concerns to identify any examples of such products.
<P>

<a name="20712w12.html_para2">As the MCA's consultation exercise on the proposed directive is still in progress analysis of the results is ongoing. There have, however, been some representations suggesting that the 30 year period for demonstrating traditional use might be reduced. The figure of 30 years as a reasonable indicator of traditional usage was one that commanded wide support among many member states throughout the informal development of the directive. The specific examples which the MCA has asked the herbal sector to provide by the end of July should help to demonstrate whether the proposed 30 year criteria would 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 2002 : Column 1272W</I><P>
in practice present a significant threat to the regulatory position of herbal remedies which could reasonably be regarded as traditional.
<P>

<a name="20712w12.html_para3">An initial discussion of the proposed directive took place in the Council of Ministers' working group on 10 June. The UK Government indicated their view that the quality, reliability and relevance of the evidence of traditional use was more important than its geographical origin. We will continue to argue this position as negotiations proceed.
<P>

<a name="20712w12.html_para4">The purpose of the positive list of herbal substances within the proposed directive is to facilitate applications for traditional use registrations so that, where an application complies with the positive list, the applicant need not demonstrate safety or traditional use of the product. The directive proposes that the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the list. Items will be included on the list where the committee accepts that a particular herbal substance, used within the parameters laid down in the list for example as to strength and therapeutic indication, meet the requirements of the directive as to safety and traditional usage.
<P>

<a name="20712w12.html_para5">The terms used in the initial regulatory impact assessment of the proposed directive were intended to give a very broad indication of the relative impact of the proposals. The actual costs attributable to the directive are likely to vary widely between companies, depending on many factors. For example, the impact of the directive could be very high on a company which was currently placing large numbers of herbal medicines on the market while not following any systematic quality standards. This assessment of very high regulatory impact is unlikely to apply, for example, to those UK companies which manufacture unlicensed herbal remedies in compliance with various systematic codes of practice operated by a number of trade associations in the herbal medicines and health food sector. Similarly, the potential for increased sales, which may for example flow from increased public confidence in the quality of products on offer and improved product information will depend on the response of individual companies.
<P>

<a name="20712w12.html_para6">The proposed directive would require product information for a herbal medicine with a traditional use registration to include a statement indicating that the efficacy of the product was not proven. A separate proposal in the review of European Union legislation for licensed medicines would allow companies to state in advertising that a medicine with a marketing authorisation was licensed. Both herbal medicines with a marketing authorisation and those with a traditional use registration would have been assessed by the competent authority as having acceptable safety. The indication for a traditional use registered product would be based on long usage rather than proven efficacy, as is required for a product with a marketing authorisation. The MCA has indicated that it has no present plans to review licensed herbal medicines with a view to assessing whether some might more appropriately come within the category of traditional use registration. This is a complex issue and it is possible that the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products as proposed in the directive may develop guidance on this area in due course.

<a name="20712w12.html_para7">Concerns have been expressed by some in the health sector that the proposed quality and manufacturing standards may be over-regulatory. Those expressing such concerns have been invited during the extended period of consultation on the directive to identify which particular standards might be regarded as unnecessary or inappropriate.

 We intend to participate actively in negotiations on the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products and will make representations and propose, support or oppose amendments to the directive as may be necessary in the interests of public health and consumer choice in the United Kingdom. We have extended the period of the Medicines Control Agency's consultation on the directive until the end of July in order to allow those with concerns an opportunity to provide more specific evidence. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and I are meeting representatives of the herbal sector during July to discuss the proposed Directive. In the light of points which may emerge from this further consultation and dialogue, we will consider what additional points we may wish to pursue during the course of the negotiations. We have already highlighted that we wish to see greater flexibility to take account of non-European herbal traditions and that we intend to press for an early date to be specified for the review of the scope of the directive with a view to its possible extension to at least some categories of non herbal traditional medicines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20712w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 I am advised that food and fluids should always be offered to patients who are capable of swallowing them. For terminally ill patients in the final days of life the objective is to control distressing and painful symptoms. Achieving such control may result in sedation. Many patients stop drinking and eating during the final days and it will be for clinical judgment to decide what is the appropriate treatment. Where nutrition and hydration have to be provided by artificial means, their possible withdrawal is in all cases a matter of clinical judgment which is undertaken in accordance with professional advice in accordance with a responsible body of medical opinion and the general law.
<P>

<a name="20712w13.html_para0">An adult patient who is capable of making his or her own treatment decision is entitled to do so and can refuse artificial hydration and nutrition just as he can any other form of treatment. In the absence of a valid advance

refusal of treatment, doctors are required to act in the best interests of a adult patient who is unable to make his or her own treatment decisions. Sometimes this will mean that medical treatment (which includes artificial hydration and nutrition) which is no longer beneficial to the patient should be withdrawn. In these circumstances, suitable medical or other care should be provided to ensure that the comfort and dignity of the patient are maintained. In line with good practice, decisions to withdraw medical treatment should be made only after discussions with the healthcare team and those close to the patient.
<P>

<a name="20712w13.html_para1">Guidance in relation to palliative care <i>(Changing Gear&#151;Guidelines for Managing the last days of life in adults</i>) was issued by the Department of Health in 1998, and advice on withdrawing and withholding treatment was included in the <i>Reference Guide to Consent for Examination and Treatment,</i> published in March 2001.

 A defibrillator advisory committee (DAC) was established at the outset of the initiative to assist the government with the implementation of the defibrillator initiative. One of its tasks was to recommend criteria for the training competencies of those individuals who may be required to use an automated external defibrillator (AEDs) at sites identified. An initial four hour training programme was agreed that covered the training outcomes of basic life support (BLS) and the use of an AED. Trainees are not certified if they fail to achieve the crucial competencies. Refresher training occurs at six monthly intervals to ensure skill and knowledge retention. All trainees who pass the course are issued with a training record card that is certified by the trainer to show they have attended a training course in BLS and the use of an AED; this is updated following the successful completion of subsequent refresher training courses.
<P>

<a name="20712w14.html_para3">A formal procurement process to purchase training services was undertaken to meet the training requirements of the programme's national roll-out and to ensure the appropriate training of personnel at sites identified. Training contracts were awarded under the direction of the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) and in conjunction with medical and educational advisors from the resuscitation council (UK) Training contracts for five National Health Service regions were awarded to ambulance service training departments, St. John Ambulance was awarded contracts for two regions, and the British Red Cross was awarded a contract for one region.

The projects ranged in size from one to exchange information between NHS Direct and general practitioner (GP) systems, to a pan community service covering a health authority (as previously defined), linking hospitals, general practice, ambulance and social care. Two general practices (Bury Knowle and Hatfield) have explored the issues of allowing patients access to their own GP records.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) are carrying out an appraisal of photodynamic therapy as a treatment for age related macular degeneration. NICE published its final appraisal determination on photodynamic therapy on 12 June. This has been appealed against. An appeal panel will now be convened to hear the appeal and decide the outcome. If the appeal is not upheld, then guidance will be published, however, if it is upheld then the appeals panel will ask the appraisal committee to reconsider the evidence in light of the appeal panel's decision. The earliest guidance could be available to the National Health Service is early August.
