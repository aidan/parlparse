<p><a name="40701w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Steen: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what public funds are available to pay land and river owners to improve access for recreational canoeing; and if she will make a statement on the number of rivers to which canoeists have access.  [181369]</p>








<p><a name="40701w01.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The lengths of water for canoeing on canals, rivers with public navigation rights and rivers with formal access agreement in England total over 5,000 km (34 per cent. of the major river and canal network). According to the feasibility study &quot;Improving Access for Canoeing on Inland Waters: A Study of the Feasibility of Access Agreements&quot;, published in May 2004, there are no specific funds for land and river owners to improve access for recreational canoeing but the report highlights a number of potential sources of funding for access agreements.

<p><a name="40701w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement about the Government&#039;s policy on the stamping of ungraded eggs <i>(a)</i> at the farm gate and <i>(b)</i> at local public markets.  [181284]</p>








<p><a name="40701w01.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Under the Registration of Laying Flocks Order and the Egg Marketing Regulations, all producers must register in order to obtain an identifying code. Currently small producers with less than 350 birds are exempt from this requirement, provided that the eggs are ungraded and sold direct to the final consumer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w01.html_para0">
However, because of enforcement difficulties in other member states, it was agreed in November 2003 that part of the derogation from marking for ungraded eggs be removed. From 1 July 2005 farmers selling eggs from 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Jul 2004 : Column 362W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
their own farms at local public markets will no longer be exempt from the requirement to mark their eggs, irrespective of the number of laying hens kept. Some producers with fewer than 350 laying hens will therefore have to register for the first time, in order to obtain a distinguishing number. This measure had the support of the majority of other member states. Sales in farm shops and door to door do remain exempt.

 UK contributions to the EC Budget are made in accordance with the Own Resources Decision, which sets out the rules for financing the Budget. These contributions are made to the Budget as a whole, including to the EC external aid programme, and not to specific programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w01.html_para1">
The UK&#039;s contribution to the European Development Fund, which does not form part of the EC Budget, is paid directly from DFID accounts in three instalments. The overall level of contributions are based on Commission estimates of expenditure and agreed by Council Decision.

<p><a name="40701w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on poverty in East Timor; and what assistance the UK is providing.  [180954]</p>








<p><a name="40701w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 East Timor is one of the poorest countries in South East Asia, with most people surviving on less than 50 cents a day. Essential services are of poor quality, especially education and health, and access to them is limited. The Government has prepared a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Jul 2004 : Column 364W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
National Development Plan, which focuses upon poverty reduction, and the international community is contributing to the Plan&#039;s implementation. East Timor should be able to finance development programmes itself once significant revenues from Timor Gap oil and gas start to flow, probably around 2007&#150;8. Until then it must rely heavily on external support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w01.html_para2">
Since 1999 the UK have committed over &#163;30 million to East Timor. Currently DFID is contributing &#163;12 million (between 2002&#150;5) to a World Bank managed fund for implementing their National Development Plan. A further &#163;1.3 million is being provided over the same period, through OXFAM, to support community education. Britain has also contributed some 19 per cent. of European Commission development expenditure in East Timor. Between 1999 and 2002 (the last year for which figures are available) this is estimated to be approximately &#163;14 million.

<p><a name="40701w02.html_wqn0"><b> Ms Abbott: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will undertake an in-depth review of the development needs of Haiti; and if he will open a bilateral programme in the country at the end of the current Assistance Plan.  [180335]</p>








<p><a name="40701w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 An urgent assessment of the development needs of Haiti has just been completed and produced an Interim Co-operation Framework. Following initial discussions with donors in Port-au-Prince, the Interim Government of Haiti will formally present this Framework at an International Donors&#039; Conference in Washington DC on 19/20 July 2004. The UK will participate in the Conference with a view to ensuring that the assistance provided by the development community, including the International Financial Institutions, is targeted so as to respond effectively to the development needs of poor Haitians. In these circumstances DFID sees no value in carrying out a separate needs assessment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w02.html_para0">
There is no current plan for DFID to open a bilateral programme in Haiti. We will, however, continue to provide significant amounts of indirect assistance through our financial contributions to the European Community (where we finance almost 13 per cent. of the European Development Fund), the World Bank and the Inter American Development Bank. We will also maintain our Small Grants Scheme and operate a number of central funds to which civil society organisations active in Haiti are eligible.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development whether a performance indicator which compares the effectiveness with which the Department operates in different partner countries has been developed since the Strategic Review of Resource Allocation Priorities was published; and if he will make a statement.  [180552]</p>








<p><a name="40701w02.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b>

country office in terms, for example, of progress they are making in improving joined-up working with other donors; and there are a range of corporate indicators, covering for example compliance with HR procedures and standards, financial procedures and good practice, which are monitored in a similar way across the organisation. These have not yet been brought together into one single balanced assessment of DFID&#039;s performance at country level. However we are now bringing together a wider range of performance indicators at a corporate level, and&#151;in the light of experience with this system&#151;will decide whether to apply these to cover Divisional, and, potentially, country levels within DFID.

<p><a name="40701w02.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development whether non-Sudanese trucks are being used for the distribution of humanitarian aid in Darfur.  [181334]</p>








<p><a name="40701w02.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The International Committee of the Red Cross uses non-Sudanese trucks for their operations in Darfur. Other agencies are now looking to use non-Sudanese trucks. WFP is importing 25 non-Sudanese trucks, which are due to arrive in mid/late July.


</p>







<p><a name="40701w02.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent information he has received about the length of time taken to receive customs clearance for the distribution of humanitarian aid in Darfur.  [181335]</p>








<p><a name="40701w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The Sudanese Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs confirmed at the high level Committee on 24 June that all items for Darfur would be cleared by Customs within seven days. On 27 June, the UN reported that some NGOs were facing continuing delays, particularly with regard to clearance of vehicles and radio and communications equipment. We are working with the Government of Sudan to ensure that customs clearance for humanitarian assistance is given as soon as possible and I spoke to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs about this on 28 June. With the UN, we have urged the Government of Sudan to suspend all regulations regarding the movement of humanitarian goods and people in Darfur for a period of three months.


</p>







<p><a name="40701w02.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent discussions he has had with representatives of the World Food Programme about the extent of the use of the rail line to deliver supplies from Port Sudan.  [181336]</p>








<p><a name="40701w02.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The use of the rail line has been discussed by the UN at co-ordination meetings in Khartoum. WFP have recently recommenced using the rail line to deliver supplies, but there are problems. Delays result from the poor state of repair and lack of capacity of the rail track as well as inadequate security for the trucks at night. Supplies transported by this route are therefore only a small proportion of those required. We are working with WFP to help to ensure that food supplies reach as many people as possible.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what multi lateral aid is available to deal with the crisis in Sudan; and what strategy he is pursuing to try to persuade the international community to increase its aid commitments.  [181411]</p>









<p><a name="40701w02.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UN tracks the resources that have been made available by the international community for the crisis in Sudan. Their report of 27 June 2004 stated that $319,889,014 (about &#163;170 million) had been pledged by the international community for humanitarian assistance to Darfur and Chad. This includes all funds pledged for assistance through NGOs and the Red Cross as well as in response to the UN appeal. I will place a copy of the report in the Libraries of the House. The majority of the contributors are bilateral donors. The total Humanitarian Aid contribution from the UK in response to the humanitarian crisis has been &#163;34.5 million and from the EC (including ECHO) is $56,259,990 (&#163;30 million) since September 2003.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w02.html_para1">
The UN tables demonstrate that the UK has provided 19.4 per cent. of the total response to the crisis since September 2003. Over 66 per cent. of total funding has been provided by the US, UK and EC. The UK is also the largest donor in the non-food sector. I have been urging other donors to make significant contributions in response to the crisis in Sudan. I have written on a number of occasions to my colleagues in development ministries in the OECD and raised the issue of Darfur in discussions at the EU Development Ministers Informal on 1 June at the Tidewater meeting of donors on 22 June and with EU Commissioner Nielsen on 30 June. In addition, there are continuing discussions with other donors at official level in Khartoum and in donor capitals.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what proportion of the Departmental budget was allocated to cycling in each of the last 10 years.  [180668]</p>









<p><a name="40701w03.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 Many strands of my Department&#039;s funding, for example, that provided for road maintenance, will be of benefit to cyclists. It is therefore not possible to provide a meaningful assessment of the proportion of Departmental funding allocated to cycling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w03.html_para0">
Nevertheless, there are conspicuous examples of funding which target cycling alone. Greatest among these is funding through the Local Transport Planning (LTP) process. Local authorities (outside of London) fund cycling capital schemes from the Integrated Transport (IT) Block grant made by my Department as part of the Local Transport Planning (LTP) process. Allocation of funds from the IT block is a matter for the individual local authority. The LTP regime has been in operation since 2001&#150;02 and only since its inception has the Department collected returns specifically on local authority spend on capital schemes for cycling. The tables sets out spend or forecast spend, on cycling schemes derived from returns from local highway authorities (outside of London), as compared with total spend on schemes under the IT block and funds allocated by the Department under the IT block.

<i>[holding answer 28 June 2004]:</i> Charges for pads of blank MOT certificates are reviewed each year along with the test fee. There will be no increase in the charge for 2004. The charge will be increased again probably in 2005 after the expected roll-out of MOT computerisation to provide VOSA with additional income to fund a full year&#039;s operation of the service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40701w03.html_para12">
VOSA&#039;s income from sales of pads of MOT certificates covers its costs administering and controlling standards in the MOT testing scheme. Since 2000 the charge has also funded VOSA&#039;s costs managing the PFI contract with Siemens Business Services (SBS) to deliver MOT computerisation. The additional income raised as a result of the certificate charge increase of 25p per certificate in August 2003, was &#163;3.99 million. Some income from charges will be used to smooth the transition to the full certificate charge increase that will be necessary to fund the MOT computerised service once all MOT garages are linked to the service from mid-2005.

 As far as schools PFI projects are concerned the Department does not collect or collate such information as to do so would involve disproportionate cost.

 Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced on 1 October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields that occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s.

nothing to stop it and it could spend the proceeds as it wished. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State&#039;s consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field. Applications to sell school playing fields are only approved where it is clear that they meet the needs of local schools and their communities and that any proceeds are used to improve school sports provision or education facilities.

Since the publication of the Strategy, the DiverSETy team has been through a tendering process for the Resource Centre, followed by contract negotiations.

The DiverSETy team also facilitated the appointment process of the Independent Implementation Group which has met twice. The members of this group were announced in January 2004 and the DiverSETy team provides secretariat support for its meetings. The DiverSETy team is strengthening relationships with relevant policy areas across DTI, other Government Departments (including their agencies) and the Research Councils to ensure that the representations and participation of women in SET is considered and incorporated across Government. This includes working towards the Government&#039;s target of 40 per cent. female representation on public bodies/policy committees by 2008 on which the DiverSETy team leads. The team is tasked with ensuring that mainstream science policy does not disadvantage women in SET and therefore scrutinises and comments on OST and Research Council policy documents to ensure that diversity is mainstreamed. Recently, it has also been working collaboratively with the DfES and the Treasury on the Skills chapter of the 10 year framework for Science and Innovation to ensure continuity of effort for girls and women in SET throughout education and employment.

The Department&#039;s September 2003 workforce census records 24 hospital medical staff specialising in allergy, including 20 consultants. The number of hospital medical allergy staff as a whole has doubled since September 2000, the first year allergy was collected as a separate speciality and numbers of consultants specifically increased by 14. The NHS Plan also announced that there would be 1,000 general practitioners with special interests by 2004. Already, there are over 100 GP-led schemes and around 35 nurse-led schemes.

In December 2003, the CSM issued advice on the use of SSRIs that paroxetine, venlafaxine, sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram should not be used in children and young people under 18 years because of a lack of benefit in this patient population and an increased risk of adverse events, including suicidal behaviour.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished consultant episode is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Specialty&#151;care is needed when analysing hospital episode statistics data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. This analysis is based on episodes in which the main specialty of the consultant was one of the following: mental illness, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, psychotherapy, old age psychiatry.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data is ungrossed).<br>

There will also be managerial and administrative benefits, as clinicians, but also other staff, are freed from having to search for missing or incomplete medical information; waiting while records, X-rays, and prescription information are transferred by post; and dealing with missed appointments. However, the NpfIT is not expected to lead to a significant change in the overall numbers of staff.

 The United Kingdom national screening committee (NSC) advises the Government on all aspects of screening policy. It does not have a specific budget for the development of screening programmes. Decisions about screening programmes are made by the four UK countries after the NSC has given its advice. Last financial year, the Department spent a total of &#163;17 million on developing various antenatal, child health and adult screening programmes in the national health service. Allocated funds were fully utilised. The Department also funds the NHS research and development programme, which aims to identify NHS needs for research and to commission research to meet those needs. A list of relevant projects and their costs is shown in the table.

 Holding a British passport, either at the time of internment or now, has never been a criterion for eligibility under the Ex Gratia Payment Scheme and as this information has not therefore been sought from claimants, it is not possible to say how many British passport holders who were civilian internees are not eligible for the scheme.

A number of claims had also been received from surviving spouses of former civilian internees who had died, but the figures available for claims from surviving spouses cover the spouses of all eligible groups and not just civilian internees and it is therefore not possible to isolate the requested information.

Responsibility for discussions with representatives of the former civilian internees also rested with the War Pensions Agency and the DSS.

Since the occupation of Iraq ceased with the handover of authority to the Iraqi Interim Government on 28 June, that convention has no further application.

1. Figures are for 2002&#150;03 the latest date for which data are available.<br>

2. Estimates are for Great Britain and are quoted to the nearest per cent.<br>

3. Estimates relate to the household&#039;s status at the time they were interviewed for the FRS.<br>

4. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that, in the case of the Family Resources Survey, control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to remaining variability in non-response.<br>

5. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household), both before and after housing costs have been deducted.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. All figures have been rounded to the nearest 1,000 and figures fewer than 3,000 are not included. For these reasons totals and sub group totals do not always tally; figures should be seen as an approximation.<br>

2. Figures refer to incapacity benefit, incapacity benefit credits and severe disablement allowance.<br>

3. Incapacity for work is determined by two medical tests: the own occupation test, which applies for the first 28 weeks of sickness for those with a recent work record; and the personal capability assessment, which applies after 28 weeks of sickness.<br>

4. Figures refer only to a failure of the personal capability assessment or the own occupation test; incapacity benefit may be withdrawn for other reasons.<br>

5. Differences in the levels of withdrawal for those with some characteristics or conditions are likely to be the result of different levels stocks and inflows for the different characteristics and conditions.<br>

<p><a name="40701w21.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The June European Council agreed to grant Croatia candidate status, and set a start date for negotiations of early 2005. The UK welcomes this and will continue to support Croatia&#039;s EU aspirations. The date of Croatia&#039;s eventual accession is in Zagreb&#039;s hands, and depends on the pace of reform, the legislative harmonisation process, and continued co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

Such contractors will be immune from Iraqi legal process with respect to acts performed by them pursuant to the terms of a contract. Contractors must, however, respect Iraqi laws.
