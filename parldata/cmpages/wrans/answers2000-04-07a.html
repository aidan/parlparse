<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence which asked about the Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapon System. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapon System (LIMAWS) programme will form a lightweight artillery capability for our rapid reaction forces, and is planned to consist of lightweight towed 155mm howitzer, lightweight rocket launcher, and a lightweight weapon locating radar. Both the weapon locating radar and the rocket launcher programmes are at the early concept phase of the smart procurement cycle. However, as part of our initial consideration of the rocket launcher programme, we invited tenders in January for a study to examine the technical risks to the development of a lightweight launch platform. The results of this study will inform the more detailed assessment phase in due course. We are currently examining options for the weapon locating radar, and intend to commence a formal assessment phase shortly. The gun programme is more advanced, and the United Kingdom continues to work closely with the United States on its lightweight 155mm howitzer development programme, the contract for which is with BAE Systems RO Defence. The information generated from this will assist in deciding the way forward on this element of the programme.</FONT></UL>

<a name="00407w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will establish a memorial to the British servicemen killed during the Cyprus emergency in the 1950s; and if he will make a statement.  [117937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It has been a long-standing policy of successive Governments that the cost of memorials is not usually met from public funds, but from private donations or public subscription. For this reason, my Department has no plans to erect a memorial to those British Service personnel who were killed during the Cyprus Emergency of the 1950s. However, should it be the case that the necessary funds were to be raised from public subscription or private donation, my Department would be happy to provide representation at any dedication ceremony which might take place.

<P>
<a name="00407w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The average cost of a place in a maintained secondary school in England based on 1999-2000 Local Schools Budget figures was &#163;2,917. This figure includes delegated funding and associated LEA costs. The estimated average amount per pupil delegated to schools, through the Individual Schools Budget and devolved Standards Fund, was &#163;2,403.
<P>

<a name="00407w01.html_para1">The city of technology college (CTC) average recurrent grant unit cost for the 1999-2000 academic year is &#163;3,502. This figure includes funding for some services which LEAs provide to maintained schools but CTCs have to provide for themselves.
<P>

<a name="00407w01.html_para2">As CTC funding does not have the same coverage as the LEA Local Schools Budget and is on an academic year basis these unit cost figures are not directly comparable.

 The trunk road network constituting a national system of routes for through traffic was defined under the Trunk Roads Acts of 1936 and 1946. The network has altered over the years as new roads, including motorways, have superseded parts of the network which have in consequence been de-trunked. The Secretary of State is required to keep the trunk road network under review. In developing our integrated transport policies set out in the White Paper "A New Deal For Transport" (Cm 3950) we concluded that there were a number of existing trunk roads which mainly served local and regional traffic, that would be more appropriately managed by the local highway authorities to ensure integrated local transport and land use planning. We identified a core network of nationally important trunk roads in England taking the following factors into account:

Guidance for the South-East and East Anglia were published on 27 March and are now subject to consultation. Final RPG is likely to be in place in autumn 2000, following which local authorities will consider the need to review their development plans. Whether, and when, they need to make changes to their plans will depend on the rate of provision in existing plans, the period the plan covers and the revised rate of provision for their area for the future. For the South-East, the latter will be determined by the distribution of the total, on which I am consulting local authorities through SERPLAN.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The intention to introduce a "plan, monitor and manage" approach to planning for housing at the regional level was announced in "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cmnd 3885) in February 1998. It has since been the subject of wide discussion and was reflected in the consultation draft of Planning Policy Guidance note 11 (Regional Planning) published in February 1999. Under this approach, the annual average rate of housing provision set out in the draft changes to the Regional Planning Guidance for the South-east is on-going but subject to monitoring and review at least every five years, and sooner if necessary. I am currently consulting local authorities, through SERPLAN, on the proposed changes to the draft RPG.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide a reliable forecast. The housing needs in the south-east region outside of London derive in very large part from the needs of the people who are already in the region and those migrating into it from London. Any forecast of the additional car journeys generated by an additional 215,000 dwellings to cater for these needs would have to take account of the additional journeys generated by separate rather than shared households. Our policy is for development to be located as far as possible within existing urban areas, with more mixed use development and using sites which have ready and convenient access on foot, by cycle and public transport, thereby reducing the dependency on car travel. The net effect could be a reduction in additional car journeys compared with what would otherwise be the case.

<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2000 : Column: 610W</I><P>
and those migrating into it from London. Any forecast of water consumption associated with an additional 215,000 dwellings would need to take account of the additional consumption generated by households living separately rather than sharing accommodation while allowing for improved water conservation measures in new development. In view of the uncertainties involved my Department has made no forecast. However, draft Regional Planning Guidance for the south-east (RPG9) emphasises that local planning authorities need to take water resources into account when identifying land for development or redevelopment, working closely with the Environment Agency and the water industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Provisional estimates from the National Land Use Database were published in the DETR/Government Statistical Service Press Notice of 20 May 1999 and reflect returns made for 1998. They show the total amount of previously developed land reported by local authorities and how much of this was allocated in plans, had planning permission for housing or was judged suitable for housing by local authorities. The estimates do not show how much of the land was available for development. They are a snapshot and take no account of the future supply of previously developed land or changes to planning policy introduced by the new Planning Policy Guidance note 3 on Housing. The relevant estimates for the SERPLAN (including London) region are 15,730 hectares of previously developed land of which 9,320 hectares (59 per cent.) were judged suitable for housing.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his oral statement of 7 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 865, on planning, what number and density of dwellings was used in the calculations underlying his conclusion that his new housing targets would use no more land than the SERPLAN proposals.  [117796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Evidence submitted by SERPLAN at the public examination into the draft Regional Planning Guidance for the South-East indicated that for sites in progress or not started the average density of housing development was 26 dwellings per hectare (dph). Planning Policy Guidance note 3 (Housing) makes clear that local authorities should avoid planning for developments of less than 30 dph and encourage developments between 30 and 50 dph. It is also our policy to maximise the contribution that conversions can make to the dwelling stock. If local authorities in the South-East follow the guidance in PPG3, it will be possible for them to achieve the average annual rate of provision of 43,000 dwellings per annum without taking more land than implied by the SERPLAN total of 36,000 dwellings per annum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We carry out each year a thorough programme of inspections of trials to ensure that crops are being grown in accordance with the consents granted by the Secretary of State. Inspectors are fully trained and qualified in a relevant discipline. If the inspections show that a consent is not being followed, appropriate enforcement action is taken. This can include a formal instruction to remedy, revocation of consent, a prohibition notice or in some cases prosecution. Inspectors pay particular attention to new or inexperienced consent holders and those who have had previous non- compliance problems.

<P>

<a name="00407w03.html_para0">Our inspectors will visit every GMO release site during the growing season and supply inspection reports for each in a format ready for the Department's website. In addition, inspectors will conduct up to 20 audits of consent holders to ensure that they have effective lines of supervision of staff running the GM field trials and that GM material is disposed of safely in line with the consent.

 Before public information materials on the new meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine and the immunisation programme were produced, the Heath Education Authority (HEA) conducted research into what the public and health professionals felt the materials should contain. Focus groups, representing a cross section of the community, were convened and asked what information they wanted and who should get the information. They stated that the leaflet should give information on what meningitis is, what the new vaccine protects against, safety and efficacy, contraindications, the programme and its implementation and the need to continue to be aware and alert to the signs and symptoms of meningitis. The leaflet for parents covers these issues and received strong support from the focus groups; plans for its widespread distribution were also endorsed.

<a name="00407w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 As part of the assessment of the BAe Systems application for launch investment, my Department received independent advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). In their report, PWC looked at the case for Government investment in the A3XX, including the other alternatives open to BAe Systems. Although the details of the report are commercially confidential, the conclusion was that, in the absence of launch investment from the UK Government, BAe Systems would not undertake the A3XX work in the UK. This would have had a major impact on the UK civil aerospace industry, and would have put in jeopardy the tens of thousands of UK jobs which currently depend on Airbus work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w06.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under UK competition law in the first instance it is the responsibility of the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour and possible abuses of a dominant position. The Director General of Fair Trading has recently investigated the market for home personal computers and concluded that no individual retailer or manufacturer has market power in the home PC market, market entry to retailing is relatively easy and there is no evidence that supra-normal profits are being made.
<P>

<a name="00407w06.html_para0">It is a matter for the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to set out the research behind the reasons for its decision. They are looking at ways of increasing transparency in merger decisions. I welcome that. I am today placing a copy of the OFT's press notice of 28 October 1999 announcing its conclusions in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w06.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 On 6 April, I announced that I had decided not to refer Dairy Crest's proposed acquisition of the liquid milk and cheese business of Unigate to the Competition Commission for investigation.
<P>

<a name="00407w06.html_para1">My decision was in accordance with the independent advice of the Director General of Fair Trading who advised me that the merger did not raise competition concerns which would warrant reference to the Competition Commission under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973.
<P>

<a name="00407w06.html_para2">The DGFT consulted widely before offering me his advice. I considered it very carefully, and was persuaded that the merger will not have an adverse effect on competition. While the merger will lead to increased concentration in the market for the procurement of raw milk, the parties will continue to face significant competition from alternative purchasers. Farmers and raw milk marketing groups will still have a good choice of customer.

<a name="00407w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 On 1 April, sections 27, 29 and 30 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 were commenced by the Access to Justice Act (Commencement No. 3; Transitional Provision and Savings) Order 2000 (2000/774). On the same day, the Conditional Fee Agreements Order 2000 (2000/823), the Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 



<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2000 : Column: 626W</I><P>
2000 (2000/692) and the Access to Justice (Membership Organisations) Regulations 2000 (2000/693) came into effect together with the Access to Justice Act (Transitional Provision) Order 2000 (2000/900) relating to existing agreements. Rules of Court providing guidance on the recovery of success fees, disclosure of the success fee, information to be provided to clients, and other issues will be published after Easter and come into force shortly after that.
<P>

<a name="00407w07.html_para0">The reformed scheme for conditional fees will make access to justice more affordable to more people who wish to assert their legal rights, will encourage the early settlement of disputes and will protect consumers of legal services. In particular it will make sure that damages awarded to people winning cases are not significantly reduced by having to pay their solicitors' success fees, or the cost of litigation insurance. It will make the use of conditional fee agreements and insurance suitable for defendants or those who are not claiming money, or only modest sums, by making the costs involved recoverable from the losing party. It will also enable membership organisations, such as trade unions which provide legal services to members and their families, to recover a sum for legal costs to reflect the provision of legal help for members and their families. Making success fees and insurance premiums recoverable for everybody is a major improvement in access to justice.

 Measures to stop and prevent fraud and error are all aimed at reducing the rate of overpayment. Their overall effect can be measured by reviewing representative samples of cases in payment, as we do to track progress towards meeting our Public Service Agreement fraud target. It is not possible, however, to give a precise figure for the separate contribution made by each individual initiative because, for example, several initiatives may be directed towards addressing a single goal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what powers he uses to compel claimants of <i>(a)</i> Income Support and <i>(b)</i> Jobseeker's Allowance, whose claim is selected for inspection by the area benefit review to give an interview to a Benefits Agency review officer;  [118276]
<P>

[118210]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w08.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There is no specific power to compel a person to give an interview to an Area Benefit Review Officer. However, under Claims and Payments Regulations 7 and 8 a person who claims Income Support is required to supply the Department with information in connection with their claim and to attend interviews if so requested. There are equivalent provisions in Regulations 23 and 24 of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations. The Department has no record of any benefit claimant having refused to be interviewed under the Area Benefit Review programme.

 It is impossible to measure precisely the contribution that last year's "Your Britain, Your Europe" roadshow made to our performance target to increase public support for our EU activities.

<a name="00407w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The UK remains committed to the OSCE arms embargo against both Azerbaijan and Armenia, which the UK interprets as covering all goods and technology controlled under entries in Part III of schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (commonly known as the military list).
<P>

<a name="00407w08.html_para3">We have recently approved the export of 60 protective vests for demining operations to Azerbaijan. These will be used by the United Nations Development Programme during humanitarian land mine clearance operations. While the grant of this licence constitutes an exception to the UK's interpretation of the scope of the embargo, it is in no way inconsistent with the purpose of the embargo and our continuing commitment to uphold it. It also reflects the determination of the Government to eliminate the scourge of land mines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As the deployment of joint investigation teams is currently permitted under United Kingdom law, we do not require the adoption of a legally binding instrument to allow the setting up of joint investigative teams. However, some of our European Union partners have problems with this type of co-operation in the absence of such an instrument. The Government therefore support the initiative as a welcome extension of our co-operative ability. The adoption of a joint instrument will not affect the existing arrangements concerning joint investigation teams that are currently used on a regular basis by United Kingdom law enforcement authorities such as the police service and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. The Government do not consider that the initiative should in any way detract from the need to agree the existing draft European Union Mutual Assistance Convention which itself contains a provision on joint investigation teams.

They were not asked whether any additional costs would arise from payments to contracting companies, but I am aware that of the three local authorities which are piloting electronic voting, Bury and Salford will be using technology supplied by Trilogy Information Systems Ltd. and Stratford on Avon will be using the Nedap Powervote System.

 Information is not available which identifies those who have committed a criminal offence, other than a breach of an antisocial behaviour order, as the subject of such an order.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para2">Provisional 1999 court data identifying defendants proceeded against for the offence of "breach of an anti-behaviour order" since the order was introduced in April 1999 will be available this summer, with provisional data for the first quarter of 2000 available in the autumn. The data will not identify the circumstances of the breach. The breach of an antisocial behaviour order is an arrestable criminal offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many regional crime reduction directors have been appointed in total; when each director was appointed; what the pay scale is for regional crime reduction directors; and what is the total additional <i>(a)</i> cost to date and <i>(b)</i> projected cost to public funds of the appointment of regional crime reduction directors.  [118082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The recruitment of regional crime reduction directors is still in train but the appointment of nine directors in England, and a tenth post in Wales is expected to be made over the next three months. The salary range for the posts is &#163;40,000-&#163;60,000 and starting salary will depend upon relevant skills and experience. The main cost to date has been the placing of advertisements in the national press and consultancy costs for organising the processing and sifting of the applications: these amount to &#163;46,000. The directors will be located in the existing Government Offices for the Regions or in offices for the National Assembly for Wales. In addition to the salary costs, the accommodation, Information Technology, secretarial support and other overhead costs would be about &#163;300,000 in a full year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w09.html_wqn9"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the success rate is of the Home Detention Curfew scheme; how the success rate is determined; if it is determined with reference to re-offending after completion of the scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [118084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The success rate for Home Detention Curfew (HDC) has been consistently over 90 per cent. since the scheme began. It is calculated by dividing the number of prisoners who successfully complete their HDC period by the total number placed on HDC.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para3">Information about curfewees re-offending after completion of the scheme is not held centrally. The HDC period concludes at the point at which the prisoner would otherwise have been released from prison. Offending after this period is, therefore, not a factor in defining the success rate. One purpose of the HDC is to secure a better transition between custody and the community for those offenders for whom HDC is deemed appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para4">The definition of successful completion is a curfewee who completes the curfew period of his licence and who does not breach the conditions of the curfew; can be monitored electronically for the duration of the curfew period; does not present a risk of serious harm to the public; and is not notified to the Prison Service as having been charged with an offence or having breached any requirement of probation supervision.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w09.html_wqn10"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list for the period between the commencement of the Home Detention Curfew scheme on 28 January 1999 and 31 March 2000, inclusive, <i>(a)</i> the total number of prisoners who were released on the scheme, <i>(b)</i> the number of prisoners convicted of each specific offence who were released, on the scheme, including a breakdown of the specific offences committed by prisoners normally classified under the categories (i) other homicide and attempted homicide, (ii) other violence against the person, (iii) drug offences, (iv) assaults, (v) other theft and (vi) other motoring offences, <i>(c)</i> the average sentence (i) received and (ii) served for each specific offence prior to release, <i>(d)</i> the average period spent on the scheme in respect of the prisoners convicted of each specific offence, <i>(e)</i> the number of prisoners released who (i) breached the conditions of the curfew, (ii) disappeared and were recaptured, (iii) disappeared and remain unlawfully at large and (iv) had their licences revoked, <i>(f )</i> the reasons why prisoners released on the scheme had their licences revoked, <i>(g)</i> the specific offences committed by prisoners released on the scheme while on the scheme and <i>(h)</i> the specific offences committed by prisoners released on the scheme who committed an offence similar in character to that for which they were originally convicted; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00407w09.html_spnew10"><B>  Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2000]:</i> As of 31 March 2000, a total of 18,736 prisoners had been released on Home Detention Curfew since the scheme commenced on 28 January 1999.




<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2000 : Column: 637W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para5">The original offences committed by prisoners released under the scheme during that period, the number of prisoners convicted of each specific offence, the average sentence received and served for those offences, and the average period spent on the scheme in respect of the prisoners convicted of each specific offence, are shown in table 1. The data are taken from the Prison Service's Inmate Information System based on the data recorded by each prison. The table provides as detailed a breakdown of offences as is possible from central records.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para6">As of 31 March 2000, 661 prisoners place on the Home Detention Curfew scheme had breached the conditions of the curfew.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para7">On 31 March, there were 42 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large. This represents less than five per cent. of the total number of revocations. In the vast majority of cases, when a curfewee's licence is revoked, he or she can expect to be quickly apprehended and returned to custody. While the priority to be given to pursuing individual cases will be an operational matter for local police forces, Home Office Circular 1/1999 made clear that Home Detention Curfew recalls should be regarded as "urgent action" cases. In addition, the National Identification Service at New Scotland yard issues "The Police Gazette" weekly to all police forces, including details of curfewees who are unlawfully at large. When curfewees are apprehended following a period unlawfully at large, they are required to serve the period of time outstanding at the point their licence was revoked.

<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para8">As of 31 March 2000, 897 curfewees had their licences revoked, using the powers available to the Secretary of State under Sections 38A(1) and 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The reasons why licences were revoked were:

</FONT></UL>
<a name="00407w09.html_para13">Curfewees who are charged with new offences may also be recalled on any of the preceding grounds depending on the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para14">As of 31 March 2000, the Prison Service had received notifications of 190 curfewees who had been charged with an offence committed while subject to the Home Detention Curfew scheme. A breakdown of the offences with which the curfewees were charged is shown in table 2. This breakdown has been prepared from information supplied by police forces and drawn from the Police National Computer. Further analysis of re-offending by those subject to Home Detention Curfew, including the procedures for notification of further charges to the Prison Service by the police, is currently underway as part of a long term evaluation of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00407w09.html_para15">Of the 190 curfewees charged with a further offence, a manual check of Prison Service records shows that in 74 cases, the curfewees have been charged with offences similar in nature to their original offence. A breakdown of these offences is in table 3.

 <i>[pursuant to the reply, 30 March 2000, c. 215-16W]:</i> The Smith Group is reporting to the Home Office on a consultancy study to examine the technical and costs implications of interception at Internet Service Providers. The Smith Group is also reporting to the Home Office on some technical aspects of the proposed Government Technical Assistance Centre which will be responsible for complex processing (including decryption) of intercept produce. However, these consultancy studies are not funded by the Home Office. The costs are being met by the intercepting agencies using a joint budget for the strategic development of the interception capability.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what steps he has taken to ensure that gelatine <i>(a)</i> as part of a food product and <i>(b)</i> as a separate ingredient imported into the United Kingdom is (i) produced by manufacturers certified according to ISO 9000 international standard, and (ii) has not been contaminated with brain, spinal cord and ocular tissues of cattle (A) born, (B) reared and (C) finished in countries where incidents of BSE have been reported;  [117009]
<P>
<UL>(2) what guidance he gives to consumers seeking to obtain gelatine, <i>(a)</i> as part of a food product and <i>(b)</i> as a separate ingredient, that is free of BSE infectivity;  [117026]
<P>
(3) what steps he is taking to ensure that gelatine <i>(a)</i> as part of a food product and <i>(b)</i> as a separate ingredient imported into the United Kingdom (i) has not been produced using hides from cattle that have shown signs of neurological diseases and (ii) is produced using bones and hides from countries (1) with no incidence of BSE and (2) which meet the OIE standards;  [117010]
<P>
(4) what steps he is taking to ensure that gelatine <i>(a)</i> as part of a food product and <i>(b)</i> as a separate ingredient, imported into the United Kingdom is (i) free of BSE and (ii) accurately labelled with the country of origin and production.  [117003]

<a name="00407w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2000]:</i> There is a legal ban on the use of bovine raw materials of UK-origin to make gelatine for use in food. My Department carries out regular inspections of gelatine manufacturers in the UK to ensure compliance with the requirements.
<P>

<a name="00407w10.html_para0">There is no EU requirement for gelatine manufacturers to be certified according to the ISO 9000 standard, which is an audit standard to provide quality assurance guarantees.
<P>

<a name="00407w10.html_para1">In line with OIE guidelines, the Specified Risk Material Order 1997 requires imported gelatine and related products intended for human or animal consumption and which may come from countries with a significant risk of BSE, to be accompanied by official veterinary certification confirming that they do not contain and were not derived from Specified Risk Material. These import controls will remain in place until EU SRM controls are agreed.
<P>

<a name="00407w10.html_para2">In addition, imported bovine hides and skins which have not been pickled limed or tanned must be derived from animals which have passed ante- and post-mortem examinations and showed no signs of serious diseases communicable to man or animals. All such imports must be accompanied by veterinary health certification in accordance with EU requirements.
<P>

<a name="00407w10.html_para3">Food labelling rules, which are agreed at EU level, require prepacked foods to carry an ingredients list. These generally require gelatine to be listed as an ingredient.
