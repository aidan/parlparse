To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee if the Committee will investigate the possibility of increasing the speed of lifts within the Palace.  [78254]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 The Parliamentary Works Directorate has a rolling programme of lift machinery modernisation. Five lifts in the Palace are to be refurbished in 1999. When new machinery is installed the lift winding speed can be adjusted and I have asked the Director of Parliamentary Works to ensure that speeds are carefully set with regard to both the convenience and the comfort of users. Door speeds are generally set so as not to inconvenience any users with disabilities.

<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The current estimated cost of furnishing Crickhowell House for the Assembly is &#163;2 million. This is included in the estimate for establishing the Assembly stated in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Government of Wales Bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales for what reason no external assessment has been made of the plans of his Department for millennium compliance.  [78461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Independent assessment of the Welsh Office's Year 2000 programme is being undertaken by the Department's Internal Audit Service, who report separately to the Permanent Secretary from the staff responsible for implementing the compliance programme.
<P>

<a name="90324w01.htm_para0">The content of the programme was audited at inception and progress against established activities is reviewed on a regular basis. Internal Audit are free to recommend changes to the programme as they see fit.
<P>

<a name="90324w01.htm_para1">Duplicating this effort by employing external assessors is unnecessary and would add additional costs to the compliance programme.

<a name="90324w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development when was the last time that <i>(a)</i> the ALA and <i>(b)</i> the EDF Committee of the European Commission completely rejected a proposed project (i) on any subject and (ii) on environmental and social grounds; what was the title of the project; and what were the grounds for the objections.  [77930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The Asia and Latin America (ALA) and European Development Fund (EDF) committees have not completely rejected any proposal within the last 12 months. Such rejection is rare for three reasons. A proposal cannot be blocked by a single member state acting alone. Secondly, if the commission senses that there is wide opposition to a project, it may choose to voluntarily withdraw the proposal from the agenda. Finally, in order to secure sufficient support from member states to proceed, the Commission may undertake to revise aspects of its proposals to take account of the views expressed by member states. In the last 12 months, the following projects have either been withdrawn or blocked as a result of pressure applied by the member states.

<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 During the last 12 months neither committee has demanded an independent Environmental Impact Appraisal as a pre-condition to approval. The Commission is required to undertake Environment Impact Appraisal screening as part of its project appraisal process and environmental issues are often raised at Committee meetings. For example, at the last European Development Fund (EDF) Committee on 17-18 March 1999, the UK raised environmental issues on 4 out of the 9 projects under consideration. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements are normally agreed when project proposals are submitted to the Committees for consideration. At the last EDF Committee, the UK raised the question of evaluation with regard to 3 projects.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 15 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>495</i>, if he will rank police forces according to the number of accidents in 1997-98 involving police vehicles which resulted in injury and death.  [78203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Ranking of police forces by number of accidents involving police vehicles would be misleading, as many different factors can affect the figures, such as force size and local road conditions. For accidents during pursuits and emergency responses broken down by force, I refer my hon. Friend to the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford) on 18 January 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>334</i>.

<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 1999]:</i> I have had a number of meetings regarding the reorganisation of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and will continue to do so. I have received representations about the current delays there from hon. Members, from interest groups and from the business community. I am, therefore, taking a close personal interest in improving the level of service.
<P>

<a name="90324w01.htm_para2">The Home Secretary and I recently met with officials from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and Siemens Business Services to discuss the casework programme. Siemens Business Services have reiterated their commitment to working in partnership to deliver the major modernisation programme as a whole.

 The reorganisation in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon has caused significant disruption and delays in the throughput

of cases. A number of steps have been taken to improve matters. These include taking on additional staff, running special exercises to target priority cases and providing additional temporary accommodation to the Public Caller Unit to ensure that all callers are seen on the day by a member of staff. In addition, there have been changes in procedure which have resulted in increasing productivity particularly relating to straightforward cases. Extra training has also been provided in certain key areas to ensure maximum flexibility of staff resources and a steady throughput of work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Operational deployment of police officers is a matter for the Chief Constable. Details of the number of police based at ports in England and Wales is not collated centrally.
<P>

<a name="90324w01.htm_para3">The number of immigration officers, including assistant immigration officers, based at ports in England and Wales as at 1 January 1997, 1998 and 1999 is set out in the table. Immigration officers at some of these locations attend both airports and seaports. Other ports in England and Wales which do not have permanently based staff are covered as required.
<P>

<P>
<a name="90324w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government hope to publish a draft Bill on freedom of information in May. It is our intention to make sure the legislation is clear and easy to use. We are still considering the precise drafting of the Bill to ensure that the principles set out in the White Paper "Your Right to Know" form the basis of the legislation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w02.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if the Advisory Group on openness in the public sector will be able to consider the progress since 1 May 1997 of proposals for freedom of information legislation.  [78343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The purpose of the Group is to advise me on the steps needed to be taken ahead of freedom of information legislation to increase openness in the public sector. I expect the group to submit a report to me before the end of the year making recommendations on how I might facilitate an increase in openness in the public sector as a whole.
<P>

<a name="90324w02.htm_para0">The Home Office took over responsibility for freedom of information legislation from the Cabinet Office in the summer of 1998, to enable the policy to be developed alongside other constitutional measures, such as human rights and data protection. Since then, we have devoted a great deal of effort towards translating the White Paper's proposals into a draft Bill. I now hope to publish the draft in May.

 An external assessment of my Department's Year 2000 programme began earlier this month, to complement an internal assessment recently completed. DBI Associates were awarded a contract to carry out this independent assessment, following a competitive tender exercise. This comprehensive assessment will examine the Year 2000 work carried out within the main Home Office, its executive agencies and the Police Information Technology Organisation, concentrating on business critical processes and business continuity planning.

[78149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w02.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The available information has been placed in the Library and is set out as follows:
<P>

<a name="90324w02.htm_para2">Table 1: performance appraisal markings for the Home Office including the United Kingdom Passport Agency and the Forensic Science Service (but excluding the Prison Service and the Fire Service College which have different appraisal systems) for the reporting year 1996-97 broken down by grade, ethnicity and gender. Information on part-time/full-time working could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90324w02.htm_para3">Table 2: performance appraisal markings for the Fire Service College in 1998 broken down by gender and part-time/full-time working. There were no ethnic minority or disabled staff working at the College in this period.

 Abu Hamza al-Masri and two other men were arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (PTA) on 15 March. I subsequently authorised extensions of detention beyond the initial 48 hours allowed by the Act. On 18 March, all three detainees were released from detention under the PTA, re-arrested under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and given police bail to return for further questioning in mid-May after further inquiries have been made.

<a name="90324w03.htm_para0">The United Kingdom has no extradition treaty with Yemen. The law contains provision in these circumstances for a special arrangement to be considered. I cannot say what would be the outcome were such an approach to be made by the Yemen, but it would be open to their authorities, if they so wished, to pursue the possibility.

 I do not consider that such a policy would be justified at present, but we are keeping the situation in Sierra Leone under continuous close review.
<P>

<a name="90324w03.htm_para1">Following a decline in the country situation in December 1998, enforced removals to Sierra Leone were suspended on practical and precautionary grounds. In view of the continued fighting and the rebel invasion into parts of Freetown, consideration of asylum applications was suspended in January 1999.

<P>

<a name="90324w03.htm_para2">Appalling human rights violations and destruction have been perpetrated by the rebel forces in Sierra Leone. However, President Kabbah has remained in power and Freetown has recently been secured following action by ECOMOG troops. There are large numbers of internally displaced people in the city. In all the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to resume widescale enforced returns of rejected asylum seekers at this stage. We will consider the viability of making limited returns to Freetown now that the city is secure, but no one will be returned to Sierra Leone unless it is considered safe to do so.
<P>

<a name="90324w03.htm_para3">As and when consideration of applications by asylum seekers from Sierra Leone is resumed, they will be considered in accordance with the standing instructions to caseworkers which point, among other things, to the grant of exceptional leave to remain in cases where there are compassionate or humanitarian reasons which merit not requiring the person to return to their country of origin or habitual residence.

<a name="90324w04.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answers of 18 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>721</i>, and 11 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>332</i>, on life prisoners, on the basis of what evidence the Parole Board decided that Mr. Tangney fulfilled the conditions that the life sentence prisoner is trustworthy enough not to abscond.  [78270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Parole Board recommended that Mr. Tangney be transferred to open conditions on the basis of reports and recommendations from prison and probation staff that Mr. Tangney's attitudes and behaviour had improved to the point where he could be trusted in open conditions. Ministers accepted the Board's recommendation taking account of those reports and recommendations and Mr. Tangney's overall progress in prison, and reduction in risk, since the offence for which his mandatory life sentence was imposed.

<a name="90324w04.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the minimum period a life sentence prisoner must serve before being considered for transfer to an open prison.  [78269]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w04.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The general position is set out in my right hon. Friend's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) on 9 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>587-88</i>. The first Parole Board review of a life sentence prisoner's case occurs 3 years, or in the case of a prisoner who has made good progress through his sentence 3&#189; years, before expiry of the minimum period required for retribution and deterrence, commonly known as the tariff. The tariff varies considerably from case to case.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what regulations govern prisoners writing to addresses registered as Post Office box numbers; and what security considerations apply.  [78358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Prisoners' correspondence is governed by the Prison Rules, and policy is set out in Prison Standing Order 5 (copies of which are in the Library). Under paragraph 29 of Standing Order 5B, governors have the authority to stop prisoners writing to a Post Office Box. Prisons must be able to identify and check the recipients of prisoners' correspondence, particularly in the case of high risk prisoners and sex offenders.
<P>

<a name="90324w04.htm_para0">While this provision will more often apply to individuals using PO Box numbers, it may also be applied to organisations where the governor considers there to be a risk. Some organisations, for example, operate pen-pal schemes for prisoners to make contact with people on the outside. Such schemes may be susceptible to infiltration by sex offenders and paedophiles seeking to network and make contact with vulnerable people. These schemes, therefore, need to be thoroughly vetted. Where the organisations concerned are not able to do this, and the use of a box number precludes prisons from making appropriate checks on the recipients, a governor is within his or her rights to stop prisoners from writing to the organisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to report his assessment of the environmental damage to coral reefs following his recent visit to India and the Maldives.  [75543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w04.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Prescott </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> During my visit to the Maldives, I was able to see for myself some of the damage to the coral reefs there, particularly the evidence of the coral bleaching event recorded during April to June last year. This was the worst ever recorded in the Maldives and affected some 95 per cent. of the reefs. On one of the sites that I was shown, over 35 per cent. of the corals were bleached and approximately 40 per cent. were dead.
<P>

<a name="90324w04.htm_para2">I was also shown a reef that had been mined for use in the construction of the airport 30 years ago (traditionally in the Maldives, coral has been used as a building material). The extraction of coral had removed the upper 0.5m of reef framework, leaving a bare, flat surface of broken rubble and unconsolidated sediment and had resulted in a loss of live coral cover and associated reef fish. The area covered by live corals was less than 3 per cent. compared with 35 per cent. on nearby unmined reefs.
<P>

<a name="90324w04.htm_para3">A BBC crew joined me on these dives and recorded much of what I was shown. The resulting film report was transmitted on BBC News programmes around the world, confirming the point that I had set out to make; that there are clear links between climate change, oceans and land-based sources of pollution.
<P>

<a name="90324w04.htm_para4">I intend to continue to highlight this issue and to press for improvement in international co-ordination on oceans matters when I attend the Commission on Sustainable Development in New York next month.
<P>

<a name="90324w04.htm_para5">While I was in the Maldives, I was also able to announce continuing UK support for the South Asia region of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. This will evaluate the sustainability of coral reefs; raise community level awareness of coral reef status and resource management issues; and establish regional capability to collect critical monitoring data on coral reefs, coral reefs resource-use and related livelihoods. Coral reef monitoring programmes at key sites will develop a national coral reef database in each country. The programme will provide a foundation for maximising sustainable benefits from coral reef resources for coastal communities, thereby improving livelihoods in coral reef areas in South Asia.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of whether the UK will achieve the targets set under the EU Directive on Packaging Waste; and if he will make a statement.  [76983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As I said in my answer to my hon. Friend on 15 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>466-67</i>, the recovery rate for packaging waste is expected to have reached approximately 32 per cent. in 1998 and the interim business targets are designed to enable the UK to achieve the mandatory EC Directive recovery and recycling targets in 2001. Industry itself has reported that there was an oversupply of reprocessing capacity in 1998 compared with the targets that had to be met and this was damaging the market. The increase in the interim business recovery and recycling targets should therefore generate the necessary momentum to enable sufficient activity to be carried out to achieve the 2001 targets. A further consideration was the need for sufficient resources to be directed at generating the necessary collection and reprocessing capacity that will be needed to meet the targets in 2001. With this additional infrastructure in place the UK should be able to meet the mandatory Directive targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the purpose of the medical examination required by Regulation 16(2) of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 1987 as amended by the Control of Asbestos at Work (Amendment) Regulations 1998.  [77876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w05.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Doctors carry out medical examinations under Regulation 16(2) to advise workers on their general fitness for work with asbestos (including their fitness to work wearing respiratory protective equipment), to provide them with information about their current state of respiratory health, to alert workers to early signs of disease, and to warn them about the increased risk of lung cancer for those who smoke and work with asbestos.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Contractors are required to give 14 days advance notice of work with asbestos as a condition of their licence. In 1999-2000, the Health and Safety Executive's Field Operations Directorate plan to visit at least 800 notified jobs and also to visit 40 local authorities to deal with risks from asbestos to building and maintenance workers in their properties.

<P>

<a name="90324w05.htm_para2">In addition, in 1999-2000 the Directorate has planned for 80,000 preventive inspections in addition to complaint and accident investigations. Inspectors are aware of the importance of asbestos and will be alert to illegal work during such visits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Yes. From 1 August 1999, the regulations will apply to licensed contractors who only work with asbestos insulation board in the same way as they do to those working with asbestos coating and insulation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w05.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the medical examination certificates issued to workers exposed to asbestos under the amended Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 1987 are intended to fulfil the requirements of asbestos laws in all European Union member states.  [77875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 No. The intention behind the amendment to the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations to issue a medical certificate to both the employer and employee is to prevent the forgery of medical certificates. The UK's requirements for medical surveillance are stricter than the minimum standards laid down by the EU Directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to asbestos at work.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proportion of the net yield of the landfill levy was from local authority payments in each year since it was introduced.  [77675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The net yield of the landfill tax was &#163;360 million in 1997-98, the first full year following the introduction of the tax in October 1996. Initial data on waste arisings from the Municipal Waste Survey for England and Wales for 1997-98 will not be available until

later this year. In addition, the landfill tax is payable to Customs and Excise by landfill operators on a registered person basis rather than a site specific basis. This makes it difficult to accurately calculate the proportion of landfill tax revenues effectively paid by local authorities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w06.htm_wqn1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the additional financial contribution which will be made by local authorities for each of the years to which the Government have committed itself to escalate the landfill levy by &#163;1 per annum.

<a name="90324w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Municipal Waste Survey for England and Wales for 1995-96 and 1996-97 shows that municipal waste arisings were approximately 26 million tonnes per year, of which approximately 22 million tonnes was disposed of to landfill. Until sufficiently reliable data are available for several years, it is not possible to be confident about the trend. This makes it difficult accurately to predict the future cost to local authorities of the announced increases in the landfill tax.
<P>

<a name="90324w06.htm_para0">If one assumes that: the majority of the waste will be active, and so taxed at the standard rate of &#163;7 per tonne; and that site operators will pass the tax on in full to their customers; and that the level of waste being disposed of to landfill is broadly in line with figures for 1996-97, the additional financial contribution from local authorities in England and Wales for each incremental increase of &#163;1 would be approximately &#163;22 million. We would, however, expect the tax increases to start to have an effect on the amount of municipal waste sent to landfill, even though there is little evidence so far that the tax has led to a significant change in behaviour. A delayed impact in this area is in line with our expectations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what statistics his Department collates of the level of <i>(a)</i> commercial fly-tipping and <i>(b)</i> domestic fly-tipping.  [77672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 My Department does not collate statistics on the fly-tipping of either commercial or domestic waste. However, the Tidy Britain Group has carried out a study into fly-tipping. The study comprised three surveys and one of its main aims was to establish the types, quantities and locations of fly-tipped waste. The third survey was carried out in partnership with the Environment Agency and was published last month. It suggests a modest increase in fly-tipping over the period from 1994-95, but less than was originally feared following the introduction of the landfill tax.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he is taking to encourage the offshore industry work force to become involved in safety matters.  [77940]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w06.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The promotion of work force involvement is one of the Health and Safety Commission's/Executive's key priorities. As elsewhere, the involvement of the workforce offshore is critical in maintaining and improving safety standards.
<P>

<a name="90324w06.htm_para1">The Offshore Installations (Safety Representatives and Safety Committees) Regulations 1989 specify the powers and functions of work force safety representatives, and set out requirements for their election. Installation managers are required to consult safety representatives, to provide them with information and to ensure that they receive adequate training.

<a name="90324w06.htm_para3">Employers and employees are represented on the Health and Safety Commission Oil Industry Advisory Committee. The Committee has produced an award- winning booklet on work force involvement in health and safety, entitled "Play Your Part". This draws on examples of good practice from across the offshore industry. The Committee has also set up a working group to consider the offshore health and safety agenda for the next ten years. One of the issues which it will discuss is the promotion of greater work force involvement.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the implementation by offshore operators of the recommendations of the Cullen Inquiry into the Piper Alpha disaster.  [77941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 On the recommendation of Lord Cullen, responsibility for offshore health, safety and welfare regulation was transferred in 1991 from the former Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSC carried out a fundamental review of arrangements in the light of the 106 recommendations made by Lord Cullen. Action on most of these fell to the regulator and all were implemented in full.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> Public transport provision in the United Kingdom should not be significantly affected as my Department announced following the Budget that the level of fuel duty rebate payable to operators of local bus services would be immediately raised in line with the increase in fuel duty. This equates to a value of around &#163;50 million per annum. The small increase in gas oil duty should only have minimal impact on train operating costs.

 The Objectives, Instructions and Guidance which we issued to the Franchising Director in November 1997 require him to secure that minimum service levels remain at least broadly comparable to those specified in the current Passenger Service Requirements. Discontinuation of rail services could occur only after comprehensive closure procedures have been exhausted. These powers have been used very rarely and we do not expect that to change.

 At the National Rail Summit last month, we announced that all requests for franchise renegotiations will be judged against the following six criteria: the train operator's current performance; proposed accelerated or new investment; a willingness to commit to a more demanding enforcement regime and higher quality standards; a willingness to give passengers a greater say in the level and standard of services; and value for the taxpayer.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary legislation, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) will have broad powers to make payments, through grants or by contractual agreements, to achieve its objectives, including the creation of new rail links and stations. It will be able to support or oppose planning applications and orders.
<P>

<a name="90324w08.htm_para0">The duties of the SRA will include the preparation of a strategic plan for the development of the railway, including improvements to the network. The SRA will work with other national, regional, and local organisations to promote rail within our integrated transport policy.

<a name="90324w08.htm_para7">I last week tabled amendments to Part X of the Bill, providing for the establishment of a Cultural Strategy Group for London to replace the London Heritage Forum. We intend to bring forward amendments at a later stage to provide for the GLA taking on responsibility for the LPFA. It is our intention that responsibility for the Docklands Light Railway, Croydon Tramlink and the Woolwich Ferry should transfer to Transport for London, and are considering whether specific provisions are needed in the Bill to provide for this.
<P>

<a name="90324w08.htm_para8">In addition, the White Paper raised the question of future responsibility for some London museums currently directly funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and some of the historic properties now managed by English Heritage that were previously the responsibility of the GLC. The White Paper also considered future arrangements for the Theatre Museum and the Museum of Childhood. Following the conclusion of his departmental CSR, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has concluded that there should be no change at the present time to the funding arrangements for these bodies, but that the GLA's role in funding the museums should be reviewed in due course. I last week tabled amendments to enable the GLA to provide funding to cultural institutions, including museums, galleries and libraries.
<P>

<a name="90324w08.htm_para9">I am discussing the future funding of the CYM--and possible arrangements for the transfer of that funding to the GLA--with my colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment and we will make an announcement as soon as possible.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make it his policy to make the savings income of people of pensionable age subject to the 10p tax rate announced in the Budget.  [77893]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w09.htm_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The Chancellor announced that the 10p starting rate of income tax is being introduced to improve work incentives and to help make work pay. The 10p rate will be available to pensioners who pay tax on their earnings or pensions. The Budget has taken 200,000 pensioners out of tax. As a result, around two-thirds of pensioners will not pay tax.
<P>

<a name="90324w09.htm_para0">Savings income is already taxed favourably. Most savers will continue to enjoy the benefit of the lower rate at 20p on their savings rather than the basic rate at 23p (22p from April 2000). And our introduction of Individual Savings Accounts in April this year means all savers--including pensioners--can invest substantial amounts tax-free each year.

 Table 5.1 in the 1999 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report and Financial Statement and Budget Report contained an environmental appraisal of those Budget measures which were primarily environmental or which are likely to have a significant environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="90324w09.htm_para1">The road fuel duty escalator over the period 1996 to 2002 is estimated to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by between 2 and 5 million tonnes of carbon in 2010. Footnote 6 of Table 5.1 explains that this estimate is based on the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions "1997 National Road Traffic Forecast" and the methodology set out in "Energy Paper 65" published by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1995.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The road fuel escalator, which provides for duty increases on road fuels of at least 6 per cent. above inflation, shows the Government's continuing commitment to the environment and to the 'polluter pays' principle. It will help the Government to deliver the UK's share of the EU target to reduce emissions of greenhouse 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1999 : Column: 258</I><P>
gases by 8 per cent. by 2008-2012. Our environmental assessment shows that the escalator, if continued at its present level until 2002, will improve urban air quality and reduce greenhouse gases by between 2 and 5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010. The future of the road duty escalator will be considered each year in the Budget.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w09.htm_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The collection of excise duty is the responsibility of HM Customs and Excise. The annual cost to business of the existing road fuel escalator commitment, inherited from the previous Administration, is estimated to be about &#163;2.5 billion. In addition, Customs estimate that the annual cost of the charges to fuel duties announced in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 Budgets is about &#163;750 million.
<P>

<a name="90324w09.htm_para2">Although it was legislated for under the previous Government, the separate rate for ultra-low sulphur diesel did not come into effect until after 1 May 1997 and has therefore been treated as a change since that date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w09.htm_spnew12"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government do not maintain records of the number of companies which offer critical illness cover. I understand that the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimate that in 1998 some sixty insurance companies offered critical illness insurance cover in the UK.
<P>

<a name="90324w09.htm_para3">To ensure policyholders are aware of exclusions and other terms, the ABI code of practice for the selling of life insurance business, including critical illness insurance, includes an obligation that an intermediary shall at all times conduct business with the utmost good faith and integrity, explaining all essential provisions of the contract and drawing attention to all restrictions applying to the policy. The aim is to ensure that as far as possible the prospective policyholder understands the extent of his insurance cover.

 I am pleased to announce that the Tax Law Rewrite project is making very good progress and continues to enjoy wide support. The Inland Revenue have published a document which reviews the recent progress of the project and outlines its work programme for 1999-2000. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="90324w11.htm_para16">The Steering Committee chaired by Lord Howe of Aberavon carried out a stocktake of the project during 1998. The rewritten legislation has been well received by the main users in the tax community and they are enthusiastic that the project should continue. It is a massive undertaking, but one we are committed to doing well.

<a name="90324w11.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 I have today written to the Chairman of the Treasury Committee outlining the arrangements the Government are making for in-year control of public expenditure.
<P>

<a name="90324w11.htm_para17">The spending control framework announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review establishes a new aggregate, the Department Expenditure Limit, which covers all spending within departments' direct or indirect control. The new arrangements were set out in the 1998 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report (Cm 3978) and the Comprehensive Spending Review White Paper (Cm 4011).
<P>

<a name="90324w11.htm_para18">With effect from 1999-2000 the system of cash limits will be replaced by a single control on each department at the level of the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL). In future, the disciplines of notifying a control limit to Parliament, reporting changes in that limit, and accounting for any breach will apply at the level of the DEL. Changes in DELs arising from transfers between departments or calls upon and benefits to the DEL Reserve will be notified to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90324w11.htm_para19">Details of this and the increased emphasis on the use of End-Year Flexibility to contain pressures on the DEL will be described in the Introduction to the 1999-2000 Main Supply Estimates which will be presented to the House shortly.
<P>

<a name="90324w11.htm_para20">Departments have been encouraged to establish small unallocated provisions within their Departmental Expenditure Limits for 1999-2000 onwards to give them flexibility to manage their budgets and respond to unforeseen pressures in-year. This will help ensure that the three year plans set in the CSR can be adhered to.

 Plans to deal with disasters affecting the central Department are well established and have existed for some years. Their review and modification as necessary to deal with potential Year 2000 problems started in late 1998. The broad approach was agreed in mid-December but required confirmation of some technical issues by relevant suppliers. This confirmation was provided by mid-January. Whilst the Business Continuity Plan was therefore agreed by the target date, there had not been sufficient time to document it by then.

 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> There are many health, safety and environmental standards which apply to the UK forestry and sawmilling industry, the majority of which emanate from European Directives. These have been introduced under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990 among other statutes. Health and Safety standards include those laid down in secondary legislation such as the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations; the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations; the personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations; the Noise at Work Regulations; and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations. While the Government recognise that there may be costs for business associated with higher environmental standards, they do not believe that these costs are significant over the long term in relation to the overall costs of sawmill operations.

<a name="90324w12.htm_para1">Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have Association Agreements with the EU under which they undertake to align their laws in respect of these standards with EU legislation by 2005, and are receiving assistance from the EU and member states to achieve this earlier in the context of intensifying their preparations for accession to the EU.

It will also extend the national minimum wage to those who work or ordinarily work in the UK sector of the continental shelf where the work is connected with the exploration or exploitation of the sea-bed of the UK sector of the continental shelf (or its subsoil) or is work in the UK sector connected with the exploration or exploitation of a foreign sector of a cross-boundary petroleum field.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey), 10 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>263-64</i>, concerning the mortgage market, how he defines unjust interest rates in relation to the provisions on extortionate credit in the Consumer Credit Act 1974.  [77448]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> Under the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, it is for the Court to decide whether any particular credit agreement is extortionate. Among the factors that the Court may take into account are the prevailing interest rates when the credit bargain was made, the financial pressure the borrower was under at that time and the level of payments.

<P>

<a name="90324w13.htm_para0">The research we have commissioned in this area will, amongst other things, look at what indicators can be drawn from past cases on extortionate credit and will also look at types of lending that appear to give rise to problems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w13.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The draft Regulations implementing the Distance Selling Directive will provide a mechanism under which consumers can object to receiving unsolicited direct mail in connection with distance contracts, that is one where consumer and supplier do not have face to face contact up to and including the moment when the contract is concluded.
<P>

<a name="90324w13.htm_para1">My Department is committed to developing a strategy which offers consumers, especially older and vulnerable people in our society, the protection they need to ensure that they receive fair treatment and that they know about their rights. I will therefore seek to ensure that we explain clearly to consumers, especially the vulnerable, how they can object to receiving unsolicited direct mail.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w13.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department will be issuing in the summer a draft of Regulations to implement the EU Distance Selling Directive (97/7/EC). The Directive requires, among other things, that unsolicited direct mail in connection with distance contracts, that is one where consumer and supplier do not have face to face contact up to and including the moment when the contract is concluded, may be used only where there is no clear objection from the consumer. Thus consumers must have the right to register their objection to receiving such mail and have their objection respected. Member States have to implement the Directive by 4 June 2000. The Department is consulting widely over the best means of implementing the Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w13.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have no plans to introduce a statutory mandatory product recall requirement for domestic appliances at the present time. However, the DTI is currently working with business to develop a best practice guide to help companies conduct more effective product recalls. The question of a mandatory product recall power is one of the issues likely to be discussed in Europe in the context of the review of the General Product Safety Directive.

<P>
<a name="90324w13.htm_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There is no central record of cases brought under the product liability provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, which is a civil law process. A search of judgments reported in the Law Reports has revealed two cases brought under the product liability provisions but the judgments concerned preliminary issues. Judgments in the County Court and some judgments in the High Court are not reported.

 The Department issued guidance on origin marking in December 1996 at the time that the Trade Descriptions (Place of Production) (Marking) Order 1988 was revoked. This applies not only to the labelling of clothing but to products generally. The guidance remains an accurate reflection of the current statutory requirements. I have no plans to revise it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w14.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the President of the Council which Government Departments have not yet completed initial business continuity plans for 2000.  [78471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w14.htm_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the summary tables and quarterly returns which on 16 March I placed in the Libraries of the House following my recent quarterly statement on progress across government in tackling the bug. At that time, 18 Government Departments and Agencies had forecast completion dates for their initial business continuity plans in March or later. Of these, eight have still to complete their initial plans. They are: the Department of Trade and Industry (centre), the Radiocommunications Agency, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Debt Management Office, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious Fraud Office, the Public Record Office and the Fisheries Research Services.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w14.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the President of the Council if she will place copies of all Government Department initial business continuity plans for 2000 in the Library.  [78472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w14.htm_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 Information about business continuity plans is included in the latest quarterly returns which I placed in the Libraries of the House following my recent quarterly statement on 16 March. Future quarterly returns 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1999 : Column: 276</I><P>
will provide more detail, in particular focusing on what plans are in place to ensure the continuity of essential services at the Millennium.
<P>

<a name="90324w14.htm_para0">It is for individual Ministers to decide whether or not to publish their complete business continuity plans, according to their judgment of the nature of some of the detail involved. It would clearly be inappropriate for Ministers to publish information that is sensitive or relates to matters of national security.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many widows will be affected by the loss of the widow's bereavement allowance broken down by those aged <i>(a)</i> 50-55, <i>(b)</i> 55-60 and <i>(c)</i> 60 years and over; and what the average amount will be lost not including the effects of the proposed reforms to bereavement benefits.  [76841]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w14.htm_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> Existing claimants will retain their entitlement to this allowance even after 5 April 2000. Women who are bereaved after 5 April 2000 will not be able to claim the allowance.

 The Government have received no representations relating to the work of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission since it was established on 1 March. However, during the passage of the Northern Ireland Bill, we received many representations from interested parties on what the functions and powers of the Commission should be. These were fully debated in Parliament and the Government introduced a number of amendments to the Bill to reflect the representations that had been made.

 The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was formally established on 1 March under the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Chief Commissioner is Professor Brice Dickson, and there are nine part-time Commissioners. The establishment of the Commission is the central feature of the additional protections for human rights in Northern Ireland which are envisaged in the Belfast agreement. The Government believe that it will be a powerful force in developing, through education and research, an active human rights culture in Northern Ireland. One of its early functions will be to advise on a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. How the commission carries out its various responsibilities is a matter for the commission itself to determine.

 Over the past six months I have written to the Taoiseach on a number of occasions in connection with a joint approach to exploitation of Irish Sea stocks. I am delighted to report that the United Kingdom and Irish Governments were able to co-operate at last December's Council of EU Fisheries Ministers. We achieved significant increases in fishing opportunities for haddock for the benefit of all fishermen fishing in the Irish Sea, particularly the Northern Ireland fleet. This was a very welcome development, and I hope that we will continue to find opportunities to co-operate constructively on fisheries issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will investigate the recent reports relating to the conduct of the Chief Inspector of Schools; and if he will make a statement.  [76456]<P>

<P>
<a name="90324w18.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Chris Woodhead has made it clear that he does not accept the allegations made in recent reports about his conduct during the period when he was a school teacher and no evidence has been brought forward to substantiate them. He has also made it clear that he supports the Government's new legislation on improper relationships between pupils and their teachers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the effect on local authority museums' school programmes of the further delegation of funding to schools.  [76640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w18.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Local education authorities are not required to delegate funding for school museum services in 1999-2000, except to grant-maintained schools. From April 2000, we intend to require them to delegate funding for school library and museum services to secondary schools; in the case of primary and special schools, our intention is that any funding for these services which is not delegated should be passed to the schools on an

earmarked basis, which will enable the schools to decide whether to buy the services from their own or another authority.
<P>

<a name="90324w18.htm_para1">We are committed to encouraging museums and galleries to develop their educational role and strengthen their links with schools, and have recently announced that we shall be making &#163;2.5 million available for this purpose over three years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w18.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many civil servants in his Department have been invited to waive the Working Time Directive requirement to work less than 48 hours a week on 17 consecutive weeks; how many civil servants in his Department have refused to waive the requirement; and what is the total cost of compliance with the Directive.  [76810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w18.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 Three members of the Senior Civil Service in the Department for Education and Employment (including the Employment Service) have signed an agreement to disapply the 48 hour limit. Central records are not kept for staff outside the Senior Civil Service in DfEE (including the Employment Service), nor do the Regulations require employers to keep records of the number of workers who refuse to sign an opt-out agreement. The standard terms and conditions of service for staff employed by the Department for Education and Employment (including the Employment Service) are well within the limits set by the Working Time Regulations. Compliance costs are not kept centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment his Department has made of the impact of the single status agreement on the pay of non-teaching support staff.  [76939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w18.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> No assessment has been made. As with other groups of local government staff, pay and conditions of service for education support staff are determined by local authorities in negotiation with staff and the relevant trade unions. The Government traditionally are not involved. However, we welcome the encouragement in the single status agreement of local pay and grading reviews and the commitment to training and development for all staff.

 The pay and conditions of classroom assistants in schools are not governed by regulations but are determined by Local Education Authorities and schools in negotiation with their staff and relevant trade unions.

 It is for Local Education Authorities and schools to determine the qualifications required by classroom assistants working in schools. The Department is working with Local Education Authority representatives and others to develop a national framework of training and qualifications for classroom assistants based on occupational standards/NVQs.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 1999]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to all English Local Education Authorities, including Leicestershire, to urge them to use all of the cash increase in the education SSA for 1999-2000 to support education services. We expect every Local Education Authority of whatever political control to ensure that the increase is spent on education and used in the direct delivery of services. No responses have been received from the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal Groups to the letters which have been sent to the County Council. The Labour Group Leader has indicated that the Labour Group is committed to providing additional resources for education in Leicestershire. Final data are not yet available on actual expenditure in 1998-99 or planned expenditure in 1999-2000 but we will be monitoring the financial returns of authorities to see whether the cash increase in the education SSA has been used to support education.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> My right hon.

 The understanding reached with Spain was not a written document. On 5 October 1998, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and the Spanish Foreign Minister confirmed an understanding reached earlier between British and Spanish officials on the basis for a return to the situation that had prevailed in British waters around Gibraltar between 1991 and 1997, when fishing took place in moderation and the fishermen respected the authority of the Gibraltar law enforcement agencies. They agreed that we should revert to that situation.

<P>

<a name="90324w20.htm_para2">The Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, succeeded in expelling the rebels from Waterloo on 24 February.

<a name="90324w20.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The situation in Freetown is improving, but remains volatile. The picture in the rest of the country is unclear, due to difficulties of access. Rebels are believed to be active in large areas of the north and east; for example, heavy fighting has recently been reported around Kambia, near the border with Guinea. We condemn the appalling atrocities, murder and destruction committed by the rebels. We continue to support strongly the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone and the efforts of the Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, to protect the civilian population. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's announcement on 2 March of a new &#163;10 million package of assistance for Sierra Leone is further evidence of that commitment.

 Moldova enjoys a working, multi-party democracy. International observers regarded the 1998 parliamentary elections as free and fair. There have been no reports of politically motivated killings or disappearances or torture of prisoners by the authorities. There are occasional instances of police cruelty and prisons are generally overcrowded. The Constitution and the law provide for freedom of expression though it is forbidden to publish views which question the country's independence, sovereignty or territorial integrity. The law makes it easy for public figures to launch defamation suits which can lead to self-censorship by journalists. The Constitution provides for judicial independence though in

 Considerable progress on human rights has been made in Romania since the overthrow of the Communist regime in 1989. The UK is satisfied that Romania now adheres to modern European standards of human rights in respect of democracy, the rule of law and protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens. In certain areas, such as the administration of justice, the elimination of corruption and the treatment of minorities and the disadvantaged, further improvement is needed. The UK welcomes the movement towards greater protection of human rights in Romania and seeks to support this process.

The General Affairs Council decided on 22 March that the EU would not change its position on China at this year's UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR). The EU will continue to express publicly its growing concerns about human rights in China at the UNCHR, as well as at bilateral and EU high-level meetings with China. It will remain in close contact with its main partners in pursuit of the common objective of achieving concrete improvements in human rights in China. It will keep its policy under regular review in the light of developments there.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will quantify the economic effects that the removal of the Lan Chile link will have on the people of the Falklands.  [78210]<P>

<a name="90324w21.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We hope that Lan Chile will continue to fly to the Falklands. We have expressed our regret to the Chilean Government over the decision to ask the airline to suspend these flights and have said we do not believe this to be justified. It is not possible to quantify reliably the economic effects that suspension of the flights would have on the Falklands, but without an alternative in place, the impact would be adverse. For example, tourism would be affected as would the ability to buy some Chilean goods and services. Airfreight would no longer pass through Chile.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what encouragement his Department has given to the Government of the Falklands to diversify the islands agricultural base.  [78389]<P>

<P>
<a name="90324w21.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 It is for the Falkland Islanders and their Government to decide whether and how to diversify their agriculture. We encourage them to consider diversification options. They are studying options including alternative livestocks. They are investing in a programme to improve their pasture, which will facilitate diversification, and have secured EU funds for the construction of an abattoir.

<a name="90324w21.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what were the appraisal performance markings awarded to civil servants in 1998 for <i>(a)</i> each agency in his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Department broken down by (i) grade, (ii) gender, (iii) ethnicity, (iv) part-time/ full-time working and (v) disability; and for (1) each agency and (2) the Department whether the Cabinet Office's four fifths rule for detecting potential adverse impact was applied to the appraisal markings of civil servants in the 1998 report round.  [78148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w21.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The information requested is set out in the tables. In the Cabinet Office the appraisal performance marks were analysed by our statisticians who reported that the differences by gender and ethnicity were not statistically significant. The Department is keeping the situation under review. It is committed to a policy of equal opportunity and wishes to ensure that box marking standards reflect that commitment.

<i>Note:</i><P>

The COI has developed its own systems for detecting potential adverse impact in the performance appraisal of its staff. However, retrospective application of the 4/5ths rule confirms that there appears to be no notable bias on the grounds of gender, ethnicity or disability within the limitations imposed by COI's small number of staff.<P>

The COI is a separate department which reports to the Minister for the Cabinet Office. <P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

The Security Facilities Division was until 1 July 1998 an Executive Agency of the Cabinet Office. It has now been integrated with the Department. Although the 4/5ths rule has not been used in monitoring performance standards, the results have been reviewed to ensure equality and consistency in report marking.<P>

Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number. Asterisks are used for percentages less than 1.5.<P>

The Cabinet Office and its agencies have each developed their own appraisal systems. In each case the right hand column indicates unacceptable performance and the left hand column outstanding or excellent performance. <P>

 Information on ethnic origin is collected through voluntary surveys in Departments and agencies. The information is treated in confidence, and to protect the privacy of individual staff in any statistical table, numbers relating to fewer than five people are not disclosed, though this policy is under review.
<P>

<a name="90324w22.htm_para0">Information about the ethnic origin and gender of employees is submitted quarterly by Departments and agencies to Mandate, the Cabinet Office's database of civil service personnel. Aggregate information about ethnic origin and gender is collected annually from those Departments and agencies who do not currently provide Mandate records. A service-wide analysis at 1 April each year is published in "Equal Opportunities in the Civil Service Data Summary". The information for 1998 was published in February 1999. We plan to publish the 1999 Data Summary towards the end of the year.

To ask the Attorney-General for what reason the Crown Prosecution Service did not meet the Government's target of producing an initial Year 2000 continuity plan by January; and for what reason it is not proposed to produce one until August.  [78469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w22.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 From April 1999, the Crown Prosecution Service will be reorganised into 42 geographical CPS Areas. The reorganisation includes the appointment of 42 new Area Business Managers. The Crown Prosecution Service Year 2000 Project Board agreed that the production of Business Continuity Plans should await the appointment of the Area Business Managers as they will have a key role in the production, and operational ownership, of the Plans and business processes which the Plans must support.
<P>

<a name="90324w22.htm_para1">August 1999 has been set as a date for the production of CPS Year 2000 Business Continuity Plans. This is an achievable target which takes account of the re-organising of the CPS in April and will enable Plans to be in place well in advance of the end of the year.

<a name="90324w22.htm_para2"><i>Letter from Sir John Chisholm to Mr. Mike Hancock, dated 24 March 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question about the former Royal Navy Physiological Laboratory (RNPL) which is now part of the Centre for Human Sciences (CHS) Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). The Centre for Human Sciences is currently running a research programme for the Ministry of Defence to determine the pressure and time limits for the safe escape of Navy personnel from a sunken submarine. The programme is also looking at the best treatments to maximise the recovery of those injured whilst escaping.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Goats are being used as the experimental model for this programme because their physiological behaviour in these circumstances approximates very closely to that of humans. In addition, we already have a substantial database of behavioural information from experiments with goats, thus minimising the number of new experiments needed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All proposed research work involving the use of animals is subjected to rigorous internal review. The animals are not immersed in water but are subjected to varying levels of atmospheric pressure whilst in a pressure chamber. They are continuously monitored during the experiment. The work is carried out strictly in accordance with the 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>24 Mar 1999 : Column: 308</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which is administered by the Home Office. During 1998, 124 procedures were carried out using goats (1 animal = 1 procedure; but note that individual animals may take part in several procedures).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition to the statutory controls already in place, the Ministry of Defence has established an independent committee to review arrangements for animal care at DERA sites carrying out work with animals and to advise on best practice. Its independent reports are made to the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the effect the potential removal of the Lan Chile flight to and from the Falklands will have on the proposal to reduce Tristar flights to the islands.  [77991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w22.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We regret the Chilean Government's decision to ask Lan Chile to suspend flights to the Falklands and do not believe this to be justified. We hope the Lan Chile will continue to fly to the Falklands. The reduction in the number of RAF Tristar Airbridge flights to the Falkland Islands was one of a range of efficiency proposals identified by the Strategic Defence Review. It represents a rationalisation of the use of Tristar aircraft, following technical improvements that allow them to carry an increased payload. Final arrangements for the implementation of this measure are still under consideration.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> The Defence Clothing & Textiles Agency (DCTA) is bound by EC Regulations which require all contracts with a potential value of more than &#163;160,670 to be advertised in the "European Journal". Requirements to the value of &#163;250,000 are also advertised in the MOD Contracts Bulletin. The Defence Suppliers Service publishes a booklet entitled "Selling to the MOD" to assist all companies considering my Department as a potential market for their goods. Seminars, exhibitions and "Meet the Buyer" events are also organised. The DCTA held two separate day conferences for Contractors during 1998 and

<a name="90324w24.htm_para1">Where cheese has been made with heat treated milk there would be no food safety implications.

<a name="90324w24.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 This is an interesting and timely report. It is particularly relevant to the work currently being undertaken by the Social Exclusion Unit following the publication of its report "Bringing Britain together: a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal". The findings of the report funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation will also be useful in taking forward the twin aims of the Government's health strategy for England: improving health and tackling inequalities. These were set out in the green paper "Our Healthier Nation" and the white paper will be published shortly. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report points out, local food projects are just one way of improving access to food which may have long term health benefits in terms of enabling more people to make healthy eating choices. However, the other benefits of improving self confidence, self esteem, and self worth, which all contribute to give people and the communities they live in a sense of well being, are equally important in tackling inequalities and improving overall health.

 Investigations into food poisoning outbreaks are usually undertaken by the local authority and the Public Health Laboratory Service.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 15 March 1999, c. 555-56]:</i> I regret that my previous answer contained inaccurate information relating to the restrictions on National Health Service employment of clinical psychologists and proposals for statutory regulation. The revised reply is as follows.
<P>

<a name="90324w25.htm_para3">Chiropodists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists are regulated under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960. It is an offence 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1999 : Column: 318</I><P>
to pretend to be registered under that Act. In addition, employment in the National Health Service is restricted to those who are registered under the Act. We plan to replace the Act with new legislation to improve public protection, including restricting the use of common professional title to registered practitioners wherever they work.
<P>

<a name="90324w25.htm_para4">NHS employment of speech and language therapists is restricted to members of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. NHS employment of paramedics is restricted to those who have a qualification accredited by the Institute of Health Care Development. We are currently considering petitions to extend the 1960 Act to these two professions.
<P>

<a name="90324w25.htm_para5">NHS employment of clinical psychologists is restricted to those who are eligible for registration as a Chartered Psychologist with the British Psychological Society. The Society manages a voluntary register under the auspices of the Privy Council.
<P>

<a name="90324w25.htm_para6">The Health Bill, currently before Parliament, contains proposals for the strengthening of professional self-regulation.

<a name="90324w26.htm_wqn2"><B> Dr. Godman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what conclusions the Government have drawn from its consultations on proposals for the introducing of Mandatory Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation in Scotland.  [78858]

<a name="90324w26.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Some 86 bodies and individuals to the Consultation Paper on the Mandatory Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation which was issued last year. The overwhelming majority of those responding supported the case for making it mandatory for all local authorities in Scotland to introduce licensing of houses in multiple occupation.




<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 1999 : Column: 323</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para1">The Consultation Paper also sought views on the best way of implementing mandatory licensing and the scope of any licensing scheme. In the light of the responses to the consultation paper, we believe that mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation should be introduced initially by means of an Order under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 although it may be desirable to introduce new primary legislation in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para2">We envisage that any licensing scheme should be based on a definition of a house in multiple occupation as a house which is the only or principal residence of a specified number of persons who are not all members of one family or one or other of two families. We also envisage that there would be a staged implementation of the licensing by progressively reducing the number of specified persons so that the largest houses in multiple occupation would be licensed first but, over time, all houses in multiple occupation would be included in the scheme. The activity to be licensed would be the letting of premises as a house in multiple occupation but we believe that the definition should be extended to include other situations where occupancy rights in houses in multiple occupation are granted, outside of conventional lets.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para3">We have also given careful consideration to the views of consultees on the need for exemptions from the proposed licensing scheme and we believe that the only categories of houses in multiple occupation that should be exempted are those owned by local authorities (since local authorities will be bodies responsible for enforcement) and residential and nursing homes which are already subject to registration and enforcement by the local authority or health board.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para4">The Consultation Paper sought views on a number of possible modifications of licensing procedures linked to the use of the powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. There was strong support for the proposal to extend the period during which an application for a new licence might be considered by the local authority to ensure that applicants have sufficient time to undertake remedial works specified as licensing conditions before a licence is granted. There was also support for granting an authorised officer of a local authority, with the approval of the Court, the power to enter and search premises where there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is being let as a house in multiple occupation but without a licence. We believe that both of these changes should be incorporated into the proposed Order and that account should also be taken of the suggestion, made by some consultees, to exempt women's refuges from the public notification procedures in the 1982 Act to help safeguard the anonymity of this particular type of house in multiple occupation.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para5">We consider that a licensing system along these lines would give increased protection to tenants without penalising those responsible landlords who are already providing satisfactory housing. We hope that the Scottish Parliament will give early priority to these proposals and their detailed implementation would be taken forward in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and other relevant interests.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para6">From 1 July 1999, this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
<a name="90324w26.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if <i>(a)</i> he, <i>(b)</i> civil servants in his Department or <i>(c)</i> special advisers in his Department have (i) had sight of drafts of Select Committee reports, in whole or in part, or (ii) been informed of conclusions of Select Committee reports prior to their publication by the Select Committees.

<P>
<a name="90324w26.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 On 26 November 1998, the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> newspaper printed what it claimed were extracts from the then unpublished report of an inquiry into "The operation of multi-layer democracy" by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee. This provoked widespread media coverage and comment on that and subsequent days, and I was approached for comment by many journalists.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para7">Inquiries established that the Committee had made its report to the House on 18 November. By 26 November the report was with the printers, and it was published on 2 December 1998. I received protests from members of the Committee about the way in which the contents of the report were being reported. My own initial comments reflected those concerns.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para8">I made it clear to those members of the Committee to whom I spoke that my only concern was to assess the accuracy of the press reports by then appearing in many newspapers. A member of the Committee supplied me with extracts from the report which confirmed that the extensive quotations contained in the media coverage were accurate but not complete. In particular, the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> had not chosen to report the Report's single conclusion, that

<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para9">Neither I nor anyone acting on my behalf made any attempt nor had any opportunity to influence the Committee's consideration of the report nor the terms of the report itself. Neither did I nor anyone acting on my behalf comment on the report in advance of its publication other than in response to the publication of extracts from a leaked copy by the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>.
<P>

<a name="90324w26.htm_para10">Neither I nor ministerial colleagues in the Scottish Office nor our parliamentary private secretaries have seen drafts of any other Select Committee reports, nor of parts of reports including their conclusions, before publication. Nor to the best of my knowledge have there been any other occasions on which such material has been given to civil servants or special advisers in my Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w27.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Official Veterinary Surgeons (OVSs) are qualified veterinary surgeons. The veterinary undergraduate course is approximately five years and is extensive and intensive. It incorporates training in microbiology, pathology, veterinary public health and zoonotic disease. In addition, and before commencing as OVSs, veterinary surgeons are required to undertake the OVS accreditation course. This provides refresher training in meat hygiene and inspection, animal welfare and relevant legislation.
<P>

<a name="90324w27.htm_para0">The MHS also launched its Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme in April 1997 as a mechanism for addressing the training and professional development needs of OVSs. In partnership with various training providers, the MHS provides at least two days training per year to facilitate CPD to ensure that the skills and knowledge of OVSs are up to date. OVSs must undertake a minimum of a further three days CPD obtained from other sources such as the Veterinary Public Health Association/British Veterinary Association Conferences and other commercially provided CPD.
<P>

<a name="90324w27.htm_para1">Training in enforcement, assertiveness and other management skills continues to form part of the MHS's ongoing training programme for OVSs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w27.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 does not bind the Crown. Therefore, in the context of the trial, the licence requirements contained in the Act do not apply to the Minister. The trial is taking place with the agreement of landowners as part of a wide-ranging approach to dealing with an increasing and urgent bovine TB problem. It is being conducted by Ministry staff in designated areas in accordance with the recommendations of the Independent Scientific Group chaired by Professor Bourne, which take account of welfare concerns.

[66496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90324w27.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The reformed fruit and vegetable regime emphasises the importance of maintaining and improving quality. Actions to achieve that objective may attract financial assistance within agreed operational programmes. We expect that such programmes will have received in total some &#163;6.5m in the UK in respect of 1998.

In addition, the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate continues to assist the sector to achieve the standard required by EU legislation.

<a name="90324w27.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1999]:</i> All primates imported into the UK are required to undergo six months in quarantine. Following arrival in the quarantine premises, the Veterinary Surgeon or Medical Supervisor appointed to the premises completes reports on the health of the animals on arrival. During 1998, all primates imported from China, Mauritius and the Philippines were reported as being found healthy on arrival. There were no primates imported into the UK from Indonesia during 1998.

 I have no plans to introduce such a requirement, which would seem to be of minimal value in relation to roll-on/roll-off vessels.

 I presume my hon. Friend is referring to the voyage by the 'Cap Afrique' on 2 March. In the light of prevailing conditions, and after discussion with the master of the vessel, MAFF inspectors at the quayside were of the view that they did not have grounds for serving a notice prohibiting transport under Article 18 of the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997. A MAFF veterinarian accompanied the animals on the voyage and concluded that the animals were transported in compliance with the 1997 Order. I am placing a report in the Library.

<a name="90324w28.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 1999]:</i> The total EAGGF allocation for the South West Objective 5b area is &#163;30.14 million. Of this 89.5 per cent. has been committed to projects. &#163;6.33 million has been spent by projects to date. The unspent balance is &#163;23.81 million. Advances of EAGGF funds are paid when expenditure trigger points are reached. So far &#163;1.94 million has been received and a further payment of 9.26 million euros (approximately &#163;6.59 million) is being processed by the Commission.

 The independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides has considered new scientific information and has identified a possible risk of harm to the unborn child if the mother is exposed to high levels of the fungicide tridemorph while working with the compound.
<P>

<a name="90324w28.htm_para0">The Government's first priority is human safety. We therefore acted on 19 March to impose, with immediate effect, stringent measures designed to minimise the risk of harmful exposure. These include engineering controls and protective clothing as well as restrictions on the maximum dose and the way in which it may be applied to the crop. We are also requiring those companies that market the pesticide to mount an active information campaign to inform pesticide users of the issues and the action which they should take.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what response the Government have made to the House of Lords European Communities Committee report of Session 1998-99 on EC regulation of genetic modification in agriculture (HL 11).  [78923]<P>

<P>
<a name="90324w28.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government have welcomed the Report as making an important contribution to the intense debate on the regulation of GMOs in agriculture through the presentation of a balanced and considered perspective on the key issues surrounding the application of biotechnology in agriculture and food production.

<P>

<a name="90324w28.htm_para1">The Government's response in particular welcomes a number of the Committees's recommendations. It makes the point that vigorous and wide-ranging assessment of risks to the environment and human health must continue to form the foundations of the regulatory process and that the Government are committed to ensuring that risk assessment provisions are strengthened and extended to include indirect and delayed environmental monitoring on the grounds that this will allow a clear picture to be built up of the environmental effects of GMOs, and enable the assumptions in the risk assessment to be verified.
<P>

<a name="90324w28.htm_para2">The response further welcomes the Committee's recommendations on labelling and makes it clear that the Government are pressing the European Commission to develop further proposals on thresholds for adventitious contamination and a list of materials from GM crops that will not require labelling.
<P>

<a name="90324w28.htm_para3">Finally, the response states that the effective and timely revision of Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs is a major priority for the Government. It offers the opportunity to reinforce the existing legislation to secure full protection for human health and the environment, while providing a stable and predictable regime which will maintain UK and EU competitiveness in the commercial exploitation of biotechnology and genome research. The European Parliament adopted its first reading Opinion in February 1999. The Government welcome the Opinion, and support the Parliament's call for moves to reach a common position shortly.
<P>
