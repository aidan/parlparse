<a name="91027w01.htm_para2">The income data for the individual Good Causes (except the Millennium Commission) exclude interest for the period from 1 October 1999 to the end of the Licence. It is not possible to calculate the future allocation of interest between the Good Causes, because this will depend on the rate at which the Distributors draw income from the NLDF. The estimated total interest for all the Good Causes from 1 October 1999 to the end of the Licence is shown separately.

<P>
<a name="91027w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 1999]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has issued no such guidelines. Since 1991, the BBC has had statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system and Television Licensing carries out the day to day administration as agent for the Corporation. However, I understand that the practice of issuing new licences to expire 12 months from the end of the month preceding that in which they are issued follows previous Home Office practice.

For reasons of proportionality, it is my Department's policy only to consider advertising for posts which are of widespread public interest and/or with annual remuneration of above &#163;10,000. The majority of appointments to my Department's public bodies do not fall within this definition.

 Under the Broadcasting Act 1990, it is the duty of the Independent Television Commission to draw up and maintain a code covering advertising on television. Appendix 1 of the Commission's Code of Advertising Standards and Practice includes detailed regulations which ensure that television advertisements aimed at children do not mislead or exploit or encourage unsafe or dangerous behaviour. The regulations also prohibit the advertising of certain types of product during childrens' programmes. The Code was revised last year following consultation with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, the television and advertising industries, viewer and listener groups and other bodies.

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 1999]:</i> The House of Commons Refreshment Department is committed to a policy of encouraging "healthy eating" throughout all its cafeterias and dining rooms, ensuring that customers are given a sufficiently wide choice of foods to be able to modify and regulate their own diet. Regular promotions are held in conjunction with the 



<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1999 : Column: 866</I><P>
House of Commons Occupational Health Service to help educate customers and to assist them in making healthier food choices.
<P>

<a name="91027w02.htm_para0">The availability of low fat foods is an important part of this approach to the promotion of a balanced diet, and the Refreshment Department has for several years adapted its recipes and cooking methods to make use of healthier alternatives wherever possible. A "healthy eating" dish is publicised on daily cafeteria and dining room menus, in addition to which fish is offered on most menus and can generally be served without sauce or added fat. Skimmed and semi-skimmed milk is available throughout the Department, as are butterless vegetables, lean meats, un-dressed salads and reduced fat dressings, low fat yoghurts and sandwiches, and a wide range of fruit and vegetables. In addition there is usually a vegetarian option in all outlets which tends to be more healthy and lower in fat.
<P>

<a name="91027w02.htm_para1">The Department aims to ensure that adequate choice is available for customers wishing to follow a low fat diet and plans to continue to develop its policy of encouraging a rounded approach to healthy eating and a balanced diet.
<P>

<a name="91027w02.htm_para2">In fulfilling this policy, the Refreshment Department liaises closely with the medical and lay staff of the House of Commons Occupational Health Service, as well as with staff of the Gymnasium. Many senior managers and chefs of the Department have received some formal education or training in nutrition and dietetics, but further advice and guidance on specific issues is taken from external dieticians, the Health Education Authority or other professional bodies.

<P>
<a name="91027w02.htm_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what initiatives and policies have been subjected to a gender impact analysis in his Department.  [94497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As an employer we monitor the impact on women of our recruitment, appraisal and promotion processes. To help women balance the demands of work and home, we have a range of policies including support for childcare, career breaks of up to five years and a policy that all posts (with very few exceptions) are available for part-time working and job-sharing.
<P>

<a name="91027w02.htm_para3">We are continuing to make use of consultations, research projects and disaggregated statistics to identify the impact of policy on women. Specific examples of these include the recent consultation of various women's organisations on smoking in taxis and the development of a public transport gender audit. We are also requiring the inclusion of policy appraisal statements in each Ministerial policy submission. Other initiatives include the requirement to promote social inclusion (including meeting the transport needs of women and other social groups) in the Department's assessment of local authorities' provisional Local Transport Plans.




<P>

<P>

<a name="91027w02.htm_para4">Our policies are subject to evaluation and will pick up differential impacts on specific groups, particularly where they are disadvantaged. Some policies do have intentional differential gender impacts; for example, the priority afforded to pregnant women and lone parent households (the majority of which are headed by women) in the allocation of council housing.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proportion of offenders who committed vandalism causing train accidents in 1998-99 are being prosecuted; and what action he is taking to ensure that train operators and Railtrack provide adequate security.  [95172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive reported that in 1997-98 there were 1,098 reported railway accidents caused by malicious action, including 512 incidences of damage to the cab driver's window. The figures provided by the British Transport Police for the same year show that they dealt with 6,419 reported incidences of 'stone throwing' or 'Line of Route' offences, such as obstructing the line, of which 718 were either charged or cautioned, or no crime was found to be committed.

<a name="91027w02.htm_para5">Train operating companies are expected to follow the crime prevention strategies in our guidance 'Personal Security on Public Transport--Guidelines for Operators', including measures such as CCTV, improved lighting and the availability of trained staff. My Department also encourages train operators to join the 'Secure Station' and 'Secured Car Park' schemes where they apply for accreditation by meeting agreed standards on crime prevention measures.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what concessions he obtained from the United States Government in return for the rights recently given to Federal Express to deliver freight from Prestwick Airport to third countries.  [95331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 In granting fifth freedom rights from Prestwick to US cargo carriers, we have said to the US Government that we would expect it to give favourable consideration to equivalent applications for extra-bilateral rights to UK carriers. Although United Kingdom airlines will not benefit directly from the granting of these rights at Prestwick, there will be significant economic benefits accruing to the region. In the longer run, UK airlines and airports will gain when we have achieved our wider goal, which is the liberalisation of the overall market.

<a name="91027w03.htm_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what representations he has received and what research he has commissioned on the likely effect of the periodic review of water prices in England and Wales on those employed <i>(a)</i> directly and <i>(b)</i> indirectly within the water industry; and if he will make a statement;  [95553]
<P>
<UL>(2) what representations he has received and what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> evaluated and <i>(b)</i> commissioned, on the implications of the loss of further jobs in the water industry in England and Wales for (i) safety, (ii) customer service standards, (iii) continuity of supply and (iv) environmental standards; and if he will make a statement;  [95554]
<P>
(3) what discussions he has held with <i>(a)</i> the Director General of Ofwat and <i>(b)</i> other organisations over likely job losses in the water industry in England and Wales as a result of the periodic review of water prices; and if he will make a statement.  [95555]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department has received representations about possible job losses in the water industry, from some water companies, from Water UK, from employees of water companies and from the union, UNISON. My Department has not undertaken or commissioned research on employment in the water industry, nor discussed this with the Office of Water Services.
<P>

<a name="91027w03.htm_para1">The examination of the water industry's costs and efficiency assumptions is a matter for the Director General of Water Services. He has a statutory duty to secure that water companies properly carry out their functions and are able to finance them. These functions must be carried out in full compliance with all legal requirements, including drinking water quality (regulated 



<P>
<P><I>27 Oct 1999 : Column: 872</I><P>
by the Drinking Water Inspectorate), health and safety (regulated by the Health and Safety Executive), environmental standards (regulated by the Environment Agency) and customer service and continuity of supply (regulated by the Director General himself). In conducting his periodic review of water price limits the Director General is expecting companies to improve on efficiency savings that they have already achieved. It will be for water and sewerage undertakers to ensure that they maintain the necessary staff and other resources to meet these obligations in full.
<P>

<a name="91027w03.htm_para2">The Government believe that it is possible to deliver substantial quality improvements and reductions in customers' bills, for the benefit of consumers. The environmental and water quality improvement programmes will create significant new employment opportunities.

<P>
<a name="91027w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Review of the Guidelines for Aggregates Provision in England has commenced and it is expected that a paper on the main issues will be published for public consultation early in the New Year. Following consideration of the responses, a revised draft of the guidance will be published for consultation later in 2000.

<P>
<a name="91027w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As part of the Government's Thames 2000 initiative to revitalise passenger transport on the Thames, London River Services (LRS) took over key central London piers from the Port of London Authority (PLA) on 1 April this year. LRS has been in discussion with Thames riverboat operators about the arrangements to transfer the licence agreements reached with the PLA to LRS.
<P>

<a name="91027w04.htm_para0">LRS hope to be able to reach agreements with all the Thames riverboat operators on the transfer of licences. Indeed, the majority of operators have now signed new LRS licences. However, I am aware that some operators are still in negotiation with LRS about contractual arrangements, and I understand that the possibility of legal proceedings has been raised. In view of this it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.

<P>
<a name="91027w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Railtrack and London Underground are continuing to work together to explore the options for linking the sub-surface Underground lines with the national rail network in a Public Private Partnership.
<P>

<a name="91027w04.htm_para1">Subject to the outcome of the discussions currently underway, Railtrack would submit a priced bid for the sub-surface railway PPP contract and the integration schemes next year. As with the two deep tube PPPs, no bid will be entertained that does not contribute significantly to Tube safety.

 The Mayor and Transport for London will take over PPP contracts designed to secure the efficient maintenance and improvement of the Tube network. These will be contractually binding, but they will have built into them flexibility for the Mayor to make adjustments over time, to deliver changing performance requirements. The Mayor, through Transport for London, will have the necessary controls to ensure that the Tube plays its full part in a properly integrated strategy for

<P>
<a name="91027w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Public private partnership is an area in which the UK is leading the way. The London Underground PPP is a bespoke arrangement to cater expressly for the needs of our Underground.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for London Underground. However, I understand that two extra District Line trains ran each peak period during the closure of the Circle Line service. Demand in out-of-peak hours did not require the additional services.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the number of non-resident parents (NRPs) who do not pay child maintenance following an assessment by the Child Support Agency. You also asked how many of these non-resident parents are in receipt of Income Support(IS)/Job Seekers Allowance Income Based (JSAIB) or a Disability Benefit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The most recent figures available show that at the end of May 1999 there were 863,960 NRPs with a full maintenance assessment and that 98,620 (11.4%) were known to be paying nothing at all. Included in this latter figure are 1,520 individuals on an Incapacity/Disability Benefit. As recipients of IS/JSAIB have nil maintenance liability, they will not therefore be included in the category of payers or non-payers. A contribution to maintenance may however be payable and may be deducted at source by the Benefits Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When an NRP refuses to cooperate with the Agency in calculating a maintenance assessment we may impose a punitive Interim Maintenance Assessment (IMA). This may be for a much higher amount than would otherwise be due and is intended to encourage the NRP to provide the information needed. At the end of May there were 78,340 IMAs in force with 45,560 NRPs not making any payment. The very lack of information that led to the IMA prevents us knowing the precise number in receipt of Incapacity/Disability Benefit though we are aware of 240 such cases.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am very keen to improve compliance levels and to this end CSA has entered into partnership with Deloitte Touche. Working together, we will develop a strategy to increase the number of maintenance payments made on time and reduce the build up of arrears. The Agency will introduce effective compliance and enforcement procedures that will get rid of the 'soft touch' image it has acquired with some people. Furthermore, appropriate earlier contact with NRPs, by telephone, letter or face to face will encourage natural compliance. These measures will generate improvements in the short term and contribute to a sound base for achieving maximum benefit from the Child Support Reforms.</FONT></UL>

The Coroner recently recorded a verdict of suicide. Managers will arrange to discuss the report with any of the other members of staff involved who request it.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what controls are available and how often they have been exercised in the last five years over the <i>(a)</i> manufacture, <i>(b)</i> sale, <i>(c)</i> possession and <i>(d)</i> use of ball-bearing pellet guns.  [95367]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There are two basic categories of guns designed to fire small ball-bearings (BB guns).
<P>

<a name="91027w05.htm_para4">The first is the ball-bearing repeater pistol. These guns usually have a muzzle energy of less than one joule. Under the definition of "firearm" given in section 57 of the Firearms Act 1968, guns with a muzzle energy as low as this are not classed as firearms because they are not lethal and are incapable of inflicting more than trivial injury. As such, they do not come under the control of the Firearms Acts.
<P>

<a name="91027w05.htm_para5">The second category consists of BB rifles. These are air rifles which are capable of firing ball-bearings as well as the more normal waisted pellet. Being low-powered airguns, there is no requirement for them to be held on a firearm certificate but in all other respects they come under the control of the Firearms Acts.

<P>

<a name="91027w05.htm_para6">There are no controls under the Firearms Acts on the manufacture of low-powered airguns but their sale to, possession and use by young people is controlled by the Acts, as is the use of such weapons by adults.
<P>

<a name="91027w05.htm_para7">For the purposes of the legislation, airguns capable of firing ball-bearings are classed simply as "air weapons". For this reason, it is not possible to distinguish between

convictions for offences in which guns firing ball-bearings were used and those involving guns capable of firing only the conventional waisted pellet.

<P>
<a name="91027w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government recognise that people in rural communities have different policing needs from those who live in urban areas, although they suffer from most of the same sorts of crime as urban areas. Rural communities can also suffer the twin problem of the lack of an obvious police presence and longer response times to emergency calls.
<P>

<a name="91027w06.htm_para0">That is why the partnership approach between the police and the local community is the most effective means of tackling crime in rural areas. We encourage farm and country watch schemes as means by which members of the public can help themselves and the police to engage in a positive way in the fight against crime.
<P>

<a name="91027w06.htm_para1">As farm and country watch schemes are run in conjunction with local police forces, the Home Office does not keep records of such schemes.

 Most police forces can, from time to time, face unexpected demands on their resources. We would normally expect forces to meet the additional costs from within their existing budgets or from their contingency reserves.

<P>
<a name="91027w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under the first round of the Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) initiative, Crime Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales have been invited to prepare final proposals on 376 bids for new and extended CCTV schemes with a potential capital cost of &#163;68 million. The main priorities for the first round of the initiative have been to tackle vehicle crime and serious crime problems in housing areas, but shortlisted schemes to the value of over &#163;1.5 million are specifically directed at rural crime. Final decisions will be announced later in the year.
<P>

<a name="91027w06.htm_para2">The priorities for future rounds of the initiative have not yet been set, and increasing the emphasis on rural crime is one of the options that will be considered.

 Information is not collected centrally on the number of persons granted bail who are returned to court for breaching bail conditions. Information is available on those granted bail who fail to appear for trial; the most recent figures are published in "Criminal statistics England and Wales 1997".
<P>

<a name="91027w06.htm_para3">At magistrates courts in 1997, out of 549,900 bailed defendants, 64,600 (11 per cent.) failed to appear for trial; and 44,200 defendants (68 per cent. of those who failed to appear) were proceeded against for failing to surrender to bail.
<P>

<a name="91027w06.htm_para4">At the Crown court in 1997, out of 72,000 bailed defendants, 5,400 (8 per cent.) failed to appear for trial. Bench warrants were issued against 4,000 defendants (74 per cent. of those failing to appear).
<P>

<a name="91027w06.htm_para5">Research undertaken in 1996 to provide a detailed picture of the extent and nature of offending on bail, particularly in relation to police conditional bail, found that 9 per cent. of those given conditional bail by courts in parts of Northumbria and Greater Manchester were detected in breach.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussion his Department has held with <i>(a)</i> the retail trade and <i>(b)</i> other appropriate agencies in relation to the new voucher system set out in the Asylum and Immigration Bill; and if he will make a statement.  [95685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 A seminar about the proposed voucher system, at which many of the major retail groups were represented, was held in June. Officials have also had discussions separately with some of the retail groups and with security printing companies, various banks, other Government Departments and local authorities. Meetings were also held recently with the asylum authorities in Berlin, where they have had experience of asylum seekers being issued with vouchers with which to obtain essential living needs since 1993.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions his Department has held with member authorities of the Local Government Association outside London in relation to the dispersal of asylum seekers from London; and if he will make a statement.  [95687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Asylum Support Project Team has been working very closely with the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government for the past 12 months, concerning the new asylum support arrangements and in particular the new dispersal schemes. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary wrote jointly with Sir Jeremy Beecham to the leaders of all local authorities in England in November 1998 encouraging them to participate in a voluntary dispersal scheme. Since then, officials have issued consultation documents and held discussions with a variety of local authorities around the country. These discussions continue and further meetings are scheduled.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what numbers are proposed for the new agreed dispersal programme for asylum seekers in each local authority area in the north-east.  [95878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 No firm decisions have yet been made on the number of asylum seekers to be sent to any given region within the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many placements in the north-east of England have been made under the Refugee Allocations Project; how many have been allocated to each local authority area; and what the costs of such allocation have been.  [95877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Refugee Arrivals Project assists about 75 newly arrived asylum seekers a month to access private rented accommodation in the north-east of England. Most of the accommodation is situated in the Newcastle local authority area, and it is that authority which pays the housing benefit entitlement to the landlords. The other costs involved are the transport costs from London to the north-east and the payments of income support by the Benefits Agency. No records of these costs are kept by the Home Office.

 It is an operational matter for Chief Constables to determine the number and location of police cells and stations. Chief Constables are best placed to judge these matters, in consultation with the local community where appropriate. It would not be right for Ministers to intervene in operation decisions.

<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the costs incurred to date by <i>(a)</i> police authorities and <i>(b)</i> local authorities in setting up procedures aimed towards the obtaining of anti-social behaviour orders.  [95450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 lays down no specific procedures which must be followed when considering applying for an anti-social order, other than that the police and local authority must consult each other. Where there is behaviour which is giving rise to concern, both agencies are already likely to be in touch with each other. Information about the cost of any additional consultation, or any other procedures which the police or local authority decide to establish, is not available centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w07.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 New advances in technology are being regularly introduced for police use. The Home Office has responsibility for approving technological devices for road traffic law enforcement by the police. The Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) has a programme of work on road policing, to support all United Kingdom police forces and road traffic law enforcement agencies, specifically the Driver Vehicle Licensing Authority, the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Highways Agency, and the Government Office for London. PSDB do this by providing technical, operational and policy support as well as experimental research and development of technology applicable to traffic law enforcement and road safety.

assess the usefulness of the new technologies being developed by manufacturers. The police must be satisfied that any new device is a genuine technical advance in helping law enforcement. All devices must also be tested rigorously by PSDB or the Forensic Science Service to ensure that evidence provided by the device is accurate and will give reliable evidence.

<P>
<a name="91027w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 Responsibility for the subject in question has been delegated to Mr. G. P Fraser of the Roads Service. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.
<P>

<a name="91027w08.htm_para0"><i>Letter from G. P. Fraser to Mr. John D. Taylor, dated 25 October 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked our Chief Executive to respond to your recently tabled Parliamentary Question about, inter alia, the present volume of traffic on a section of Saintfield Road, Belfast and associated issues. In the absence of our Chief Executive, I am replying.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is assumed that your question relates to the volume of traffic on Saintfield Road near its junction with Beechill Road and not Buckhill Road as stated in the question. The latest traffic figures available for this location relate to surveys carried out in 1998. These show that the 2-way average 24-hour flow on Saintfield Road is approximately 30,000 vehicles at the Ivanhoe Inn with a peak hour 2-way flow of 2,700 vehicles.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As regards the maximum acceptable volume of traffic at this location, I should explain that there are many factors that have an influencing effect on road capacity and it is not possible to quote an 'acceptable' maximum volume of traffic for any particular road. For most urban roads, it is the junctions that act as the constraint on traffic capacity rather than the road links between them. However, the theoretical design flow capacity for a 4-lane undivided carriageway, such as Saintfield Road, is 1,700 vehicles per hour in each direction. On this basis, current traffic flow on this section of Saintfield Road is below the theoretical design capacity.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked what is the estimated increase in volume of traffic if all present planning application for housing developments in the Carryduff area were approved. At present we are not in a position to determine the estimated increase in traffic generated by proposed developments in the area as the developers for the major applications have not yet completed Transportation Impact Assessments for their respective developments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As to plans to improve Saintfield Road between Beechill Road and Carryduff, Roads Service has no proposals at present to carry out any major road improvements on this section of road. We are, however, currently introducing "Quality Bus" measures in the Saintfield Road corridor between Carryduff and Belfast. These measures include bus lanes, bus stop infrastructure, improved traffic signal control and traffic management arrangements. The introduction of a "Park and Ride" site in the corridor is also being pursued.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, you asked what area plans are proposed for the Carryduff area. Colleagues from the Department's Planning Service have advised me that the Carryduff area will be included in the proposed

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to respond to your recently tabled Parliamentary Question about the provision of a bridge across Strangford Lough and planned investment in roads in the Ards Peninsula over the next 10 years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department of the Environment considered the proposal to construct a bridge across Strangford Lough as recently as September 1999 following a request from a local interest group. The span across the lough between Portaferry and Strangford measures approximately 0.6 miles and the cost of constructing a bridge at this location is estimated to be in the region of &#163;25M-&#163;30M, depending on detailed design requirements. The Department considers that such an investment would not represent value for money compared to other higher priority road schemes which are required across Northern Ireland.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As regards planned investment in roads in the Ards Peninsula over the next 10 years, approximately &#163;180K is scheduled to be spent on minor road improvements during the 2-year period 2000/01-2001/02. The level of funding for future road programmes over the next 10 years is unknown, but assuming it is maintained at current levels, some &#163;0.9M will be spent on minor road works in the Ards Peninsula over that period. While the Department's 5-year Major Road Works Programme 1999/2000-2003/04 does not include any schemes in the Ards Peninsula, the 6-15 year Forward Planning Programme includes 4 schemes in Newtownards (total value approximately &#163;5.2M). This programme is, however, currently under review and, even if these schemes are retained, the timing of their implementation will depend on the availability of funding.</FONT></UL>

 Gun salutes are fired by the Army to honour various anniversaries connected with members of the Royal family. As the Crown and Armed Forces remain excepted (i.e. non-devolved) matters under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, it is felt that it might be more appropriate for future salutes to be fired at a location other than Stormont, which is effectively transferred to the

(RSL) bids in May 1998. These discussions will continue until the BVRAAM competition concludes around the end of the year. Discussions have been held with the US Air Force Departments of Acquisition, International Affairs, and Armaments Co-operation in Washington D.C. and with the Air to Air Joint Systems Program Office at the US Air Force Base Eglin, Florida. The MOD is not currently involved in discussions with any other US Government Departments regarding this matter.

<P>
<a name="91027w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The UK does not earmark specific forces for UN peacekeeping operations, and therefore the issue of replacing UN-designated units on deployment does not arise. We updated our declaration of forces potentially available to the UN in June in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU makes clear that declared forces may not be available at the time of a UN request because of other commitments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The value of work to be undertaken in Turkey for the Turkish and British Rapier missile procurement programmes is around &#163;30 million. There are no security implications concerning the manufacture of these components outside the United Kingdom. The technology involved is not sensitive and the prime contractor, Matra BAe Dynamics, is responsible for meeting the MOD's contractual specification and for ensuring continuity of supply.

<a name="91027w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 As part of its support for King Abdullah of Jordan on his accession to the throne, and in response to a request from His Majesty, the Government announced in March that we had agreed to supply Jordan with Challenger 1 Main Battle Tanks as they come out of service with the British Army over the next few years. Up to 288 Challenger 1s will be supplied.
<P>

<a name="91027w09.htm_para0">The Challenger 1s currently in service with the British Army have a current average book value of &#163;750K each but, on leaving service, that value will reduce to zero. The tanks will therefore be supplied to Jordan at no cost. However, agreement has been reached with Jordan that the Jordanian Government will meet the MOD's additional costs arising out of the Challenger 1 transfer programme.

 At around 1700 hours on 15 October a single empty Scammell Crusader tank transporter travelling east on the A303 towards Stonehenge broke down due to engine failure. The civilian and MOD police were informed shortly afterwards and I understand that civilian police assistance arrived at around 1800 hours. The civilian police directed traffic at the scene of the incident. Due to the volume of traffic, the recovery vehicles, a Scammel Commander and a Seddon Atkinson tractor and trailer, did not arrive until around 1900 hours, and the broken down tank transporter was removed at around 1930 hours.

 The cost to date of the operation to clear buried wartime ordnance at Winterbourne Gunner carried out between November 1998 and July 1999, Operation ABBOTT, is some &#163;500,000. This amount relates to the clearance operation, compensation paid to freehold and tenant farmers for loss of harvest and payments made to DERA Porton Down. Negotiations continue with DERA Porton Down over the cost of disposal of the remaining items. The final cost of the operation will not be known until the disposal programme, scheduled to finish in the financial year 2002-03, has been completed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department has already undertaken a preliminary assessment of the RAND review of the scientific literature on pyridostigmine bromide (PB), as it pertains to Gulf War illnesses. The report does not present

<P>

<a name="91027w09.htm_para1">The report calls for more substantial research into the effects of PB. MOD is currently funding research into possible interactions between PB and the vaccines given to UK troops in the Gulf (initial results show no untoward health effects). We are also conducting a neuromuscular symptoms study (one of the areas specifically mentioned in the RAND paper). The MOD welcomes new proposals for research into Gulf veterans' illnesses and would look favourably on any proposals recommended by the Medical Research Council who act as our independent assessors and advisers.

 As my right hon.

The new payments take effect from 26 May this year and so will apply to the widow of Staff Sgt Balaram Rai killed in Kosovo in June.
<P>

<a name="91027w10.htm_para0">The announcement is the result of the first stage in our examination of Gurkha pensions and gratuities. The increase remains firmly within the conditions set out in the 1947 Tri-Partite Agreement between India, Nepal and the UK and follows increases that have been implemented recently by the Indian Government. To take account of the fact that the UK is the home base for British Gurkhas I have introduced a UK element to substitute for the Indian State Government payments which are variable throughout India. This will bring payments for all deaths attributable to service up to British Army rates.
<P>

<a name="91027w10.htm_para1">We are also looking at Gurkha pensions, still within the context of the Tri-Partite Agreement, and I hope to report on this by the end of the year.

 The major public service pension schemes do not hold information disaggregated on this basis, with the exception of the Teachers' Pension Scheme which can identify some 3,500 widows receiving a pension at one half rate; 60 at one third rate; and 31,700 receiving a widow's pension at the rate of some other fraction of their husband's pension. A widow's pension at a rate of between half and one third would result if the scheme member's service straddled the point at which public service pension schemes raised the rate of widow's pension from one third to one half, in 1972, and the member did not pay the maximum additional contributions fully to upgrade the entitlement in respect of previous service.

[95640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w13.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The administration of the National Numbering Scheme is a matter for Oftel. Oftel has not carried out any specific research into the adjustment costs associated with the planned changes to telephone codes. The changes to geographic codes have been made in response to the views of consumers and businesses following "Phoneday" in 1995 in order to meet additional demand for numbers. In order to minimise the costs to businesses, Oftel has given long periods of notice of changes and put in place parallel running for old and new numbers and "changed number announcements". This enables businesses to plan for the future.
<P>

<a name="91027w13.htm_para6">This Department has no proposals to assist charitable organisations with their exceptional costs in making the change. Grants may in certain circumstances be awarded to bodies in the health sector under Section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, through a scheme administered by the Department of Health.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government have had extensive discussions with industry about the impact of climate change levy, which was announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget Statement on 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 173-90.
<P>

<a name="91027w14.htm_para0">The Government have made clear that they wish to design the levy in a way which maximises its environmental benefit while seeking to protect competitiveness. They have been concerned to develop the best possible understanding of business's perspective in discussions over recent months, in order to inform their decision on the levy for the Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="91027w14.htm_para1">The Government have said that they recognise the special circumstances of energy intensive sectors of business in this context including their energy usage and exposure to international competition. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) has been leading the discussions with a number of key trade associations representing energy intensive sectors to develop negotiated agreement. Under these agreements, sectors which are to be subject to Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulation would earn significantly reduced rates of the climate change levy in return for commitments to targets for energy efficiency and/or emissions reduction. The DETR has been conducting detailed negotiations with an initial ten trade associations. Some initial offers of targets have now been made. The period for these discussions has been extended from mid-October to 20 December in order to give the trade associations more opportunity to consult their members.

<a name="91027w14.htm_para4">To some extent, underspends resulted from the timing of submission by contractors of their invoices for services provided to the New Deal. In addition, the numbers of people entering New Deal programmes were lower than had earlier been projected on the basis of the Government's unemployment assumption at the time.

move on from the New Deal Gateway into one of the four options. The Gateway performed much better in 1998-99 and some 55 per cent. of entrants were leaving New Deal without needing to move first into an option. Fewer young people into options has the effect of reducing expenditure on option provision, allowances and Follow-Through.

<P>

<a name="91027w14.htm_para7">The Government are committed to ensuring their policies are fair and inclusive, of high quality and flexible. This aim is contained in guidance (published 1998) which helps Departments consider the impact of their policies on women and other groups, and is a cornerstone of the Modernising Government White Paper. It is for individual departments to consider how to make use of this guidance. There is no formal requirement to carry out a gender impact assessment for every policy or regulation, and the absence of a separate document does not mean that gender impact was ignored during policy making.
<P>

<a name="91027w14.htm_para8">The Women's Unit in the Cabinet Office is working with the Home Office, and Department for Education and Employment to produce more comprehensive guidance for departments on equality impact assessment--to sit within the consolidated guidance described. In addition the Women's Unit is developing a framework for gender impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="91027w14.htm_para9">The Government have introduced a wide range of policies clearly designed to meet the concerns, priorities and circumstances of women. These include the National Minimum Wage, Working Families Tax Credit and the Childcare Tax Credit, Sure Start and the National Childcare Strategy, the New Deal for Lone Parents and increases in Child Benefit. These measures help women make real choices in their lives.

It also provides advice and contact points on statutory requirements, for example the Human Rights Act, good practice in consultation and other impact assessment tools like regulatory impact assessment.

In the meantime we remain deeply anxious at the plight of the many thousands of East Timorese refugees in West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia. We have made it clear to the Indonesian Government that we expect them to ensure the safety and security of the refugees. I raised this with the then President Habibie on 8 September. Over 18,000 East Timorese have so far been repatriated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but there is an urgency to get the refugees moving in much larger numbers. To this end, we are providing financial support and working closely with UNHCR who have established an office in West Timor. We have also fully supported international efforts to ensure that those guilty of human rights abuses in East Timor are brought to justice. We co-sponsored the resolution adopted on 27 September at the Special Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which called for an International Commission of Enquiry to be set up. The Commission is to provide the UN with its conclusions by 31 December.

<a name="91027w16.htm_para1">Mr. Bingham already has a Residence Permit, valid until September 2000. It is his application for a Permanent Residence Permit which is under review. This process has been complicated by the various legal difficulties to which Mr. Bingham has been subject. The Governor is satisfied that the Falkland Islands Executive Council has handled the consideration of Mr. Bingham's applications for permanent residence status properly and impartially.

<P>
<a name="91027w16.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The use of capital punishment figures prominently in the human rights dialogues with the Chinese which we hold both bilaterally and with the EU. The Chinese Government are in no doubt about our strong opposition to the use of the death penalty. We have regularly raised our concerns about China's population policy in the EU and the bilateral human rights dialogues, and at higher levels. We believe that coercion has no place in family planning and our bilateral aid programme does not include funding for population programmes.

<a name="91027w16.htm_para2">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary was able to discuss human rights in China with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, when they met on 20 October, and my right hon.

Specific issues, including capital punishment and the Chinese birth control policy, are also addressed through the regular high level human rights dialogue between us, which we remain convinced is the best way to secure progress over the longer term.

<a name="91027w17.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Government neither intend nor expect to remove all badgers in the proactive areas of the badger culling trial. Given the operational constraints deliberately imposed on welfare grounds--principally restricting the method of capture to cage trapping, and limiting the capture period--the Independent Scientific Group established that around 80 per cent. of the badgers in an area could be captured. In other words, one fifth of the badger population would be expected to remain in place. The statistical experts in the Scientific Group have designed the trial specifically to take account of such factors, and are satisfied that the results it yields will be robust.

<P>

 MAFF has policy responsibility for control of injurious weeds, of which ragwort is one, under the Weeds Act 1959. Under its provisions, MAFF may investigate complaints from any occupiers of agricultural land who consider that their land is threatened by ragwort spreading from land nearby. It seeks to resolve disputes between neighbours about control of injurious weeds primarily through persuasion and good advice.

<a name="91027w18.htm_para1">However, where such approaches are ineffective, the Weeds Act empowers MAFF to give occupiers of land formal written notice requiring them to take control measures. If they fail to do so MAFF may enter onto the land with an accompanying agricultural contractor, carry out the controls, and then recover the costs of the work, as a debt due to the Department.
<P>

<a name="91027w18.htm_para2">In the case of any persistent offenders, MAFF will continue to give careful consideration to bringing a prosecution under the Act. However, past experience has been that use of the powers of entry and recovery of reasonable costs incurred in taking direct weeds control action is sufficiently effective.
<P>

<a name="91027w18.htm_para3">There has been some doubt about the policy for enforcement of the Weeds Act where land is used to graze horses and is threatened by ragwort growing nearby. Each complaint about injurious weeds will be dealt with on its own merits. However, MAFF has policy responsibility for farmland and for farmed animals, rather than animals kept for non-agricultural businesses or for recreation. MAFF will not normally investigate complaints about weeds threatening land used for horses, ponies or donkeys. Higher priority will be given to protecting farm livestock.
<P>

<a name="91027w18.htm_para4">MAFF supported the Country Landowners Association national awareness campaign to help eradicate ragwort, which came to an end during August. That campaign helped horse owners understand what they can do to protect their own animals, as well as their neighbours' from this poisonous weed.

Applications for approval for the commercial planting and food use of this crop within the Community are still being scrutinised by the EC Commission and member states and no conclusions have yet been reached.

My officials are in contact with him about these charges which will be consistent with the Government's better regulation principles and take full account of the circumstances of industries which have not previously been subject to Integrated Pollution Control regulations.

We consider it regrettable that there is as yet no sign of this happening, as we consider that the review will be an important opportunity to press for improvements to the rules in this area.

 The Fisheries Council met in Luxembourg on 26 October. I represented the UK together with John Home Robertson, Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="91027w18.htm_para7">The Council had extensive discussions on two draft regulations. The first, revising the market regime for fish and aquaculture products, and the second, reforming the structural funds in the fisheries sector in the context of Agenda 2000. I stressed that the fishing sector needed to be economically, as well as biologically, sustainable and that this needed to be reflected in the market and structural measures to be applied. It did not make sense to sustain excessive capacity in relation to the available fish stocks; and import arrangements needed to be adjusted to meet the actual market circumstances. The Council will resume discussion on both proposals at its next meeting on 22 November.

<a name="91027w18.htm_para8">The Commission reported that it hoped to take up contacts with Morocco shortly to begin negotiations on a successor agreement to the current EC-Morocco Agreement which expires on 30 November.

There was an initial discussion of a draft Council regulation on improving the dialogue with the industry. This was remitted for further examination.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the annual estimated manning costs of Derbyshire's magistrates courts will be in the three years immediately after the completion of the Private Finance Initiative for the county's courts; and what were their running costs on the same basis in 1996, 1997 and 1998.  [95482]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91027w19.htm_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Cleaning and care-taking costs for the three years mentioned are 1996-97--&#163;114,461; 1997-98--&#163;116,656; 1998-99--&#163;123,572. The cost of providing security cover is separately provided by the private sector: 1996-97--&#163;86,500; 1997-98--&#163;92,595; 1998-99--&#163;105,037. These costs include cash carrying duties that cannot be separated from guard duties.

 The Lord Chancellor wrote to the President of the Law Society on 23 July. The letter set targets for the Law Society to achieve; these are that the number of unresolved cases on the Office's books should be down to 6,000 by 31 December 2000; and following this, 90 per cent. of cases should be dealt with within three months of receipt and 100 per cent. within five months. For the three months to date the backlog has been reduced by 1,700 cases ahead of target. I am encouraged with the progress that the Office has made towards reducing the backlog of complaints. I do recognise, however, that there is a long way to go for the Office to reach the targets set by the Lord Chancellor.

 The Government are committed to ensuring their policies are fair and inclusive, and focus on public service users, not providers. This aim is contained in guidance (published in 1998) which helps Departments consider the impact of their policies on gender, ethnicity and disability. In addition to considering impact the guidance encourages consultation with women's groups and others where appropriate and action to deal with any differential impact if this appears appropriate. My Department applies the principles enshrined in the guidance in developing its policies. For example in developing the Community Legal Service (CLS), a wide variety of views is being canvassed. For the CLS website we are investigating how access can be facilitated for people with disabilities or who do not use English as a first language. In developing the Quality Mark for
