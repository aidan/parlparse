This has been through a combination of four national conferences and over 25 regional follow-up events for industry organised by the Competent Authority, the creation of a dedicated REACH website within the Health and Safety Executive&#146;s website, and a national Helpdesk to provide advice and technical information for businesses (contactable by telephone on 0845 408 9575, or e-mail at ukreachca@hse.gsi.gov.uk). In addition, the Government have placed notices in specialised trade press, various online website links and e-newsletters, and an article in the February edition of the Employers&#146; Bulletin sent out by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to over 1 million UK businesses. These activities will continue as REACH begins to be implemented in the coming months. Industry also has a role to play in REACH awareness-raising through the supply chain.</p>

 Environmental Stewardship, the agri-environment scheme funded through the Rural Development Programme for England, has flood management as a secondary objective, in support of its five primary objectives for wildlife, landscape, resource protection, the historic environment and access. The scheme does not fund flood management measures but can support complementary measures, such as the creation of water meadows and ditch restoration. During the application approval process, Natural England is advised by the Environment Agency as to whether there are any flood management benefits to the application, but the critical deciding factor will be whether the proposal meets the primary objectives.</p>

Further details of the values of working time applied in transport appraisals are set out in table 1 in the transport analysis guidance unit linked to above. A copy of the table follows.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Darling) announced in the Budget that the Government would work with energy suppliers to increase their spend on social programmes designed to help those vulnerable to fuel poverty. The Government reached individual agreements with each of the six largest suppliers in April to increase their collective spend to at least &#163;150 million a year by 2010-11.</p>

If it is purely used to offset bills and equally distributed among the poorest households, then it could help to remove up to 100,000 of these from fuel poverty. Other scenarios may bring different benefits&#151;for example, energy efficiency measures may benefit fewer but will be permanent. Energy suppliers will be free to determine how they target the additional spend within certain parameters currently being developed by Ofgem.</p>

Around 11 per cent. of the fuel poor pay for their gas via prepayment meters and around 20 per cent. of the fuel poor use prepayment meters for their electricity.

2. Estimates are given for financial years. For example, estimates for 2010 relate to the financial year 2010-11.<br>
3. Estimates account for the state pension reforms in the Pensions Act 2007.<br>
4. Estimates do not take account of the effect of the private pension reforms in the current Pensions Bill, such as personal accounts and auto-enrolment.<br>
5. Pensioners are defined as single people or couples containing at least one person of qualifying age for pension credit, including those in residential care.<br>
6. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the increases in state pension age between 2024 and 2046. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with (women&#146;s) state pension age.<br>
7. Entitlement to any income related benefit is defined as entitlement to at least one of pension credit, housing benefit or council tax benefit.<br>
8. Projections are designed to illustrate the impact of benefit policy under a set of reasonable assumptions. They are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes. Estimated numbers and proportions have been rounded to the nearest 0.5 million and 5 per cent. respectively.<br>
9. Projections for proportions entitled to individual benefits have been calibrated to National Statistics estimates for past years, which adjust Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. The National Statistics are published as a range; the projections have been calibrated to the mid-point of that range.<br>
10. There are no corresponding National Statistics estimates to calibrate projected proportions entitled to any income related benefit, so these estimates are subject to greater uncertainty.<br>

 At present, only a married woman may claim a state pension (of up to &#163;54.35 a week, at current rates) on the basis of contributions made by her husband. This will change after April 2010 when those provisions in the state pension scheme that are still unequal as between men and women begin to be equalised. This will mean that a married man whose wife was born on or after 6 April 1950 (and who will therefore reach pension age herself after April 2010) will be entitled to such a pension on the same terms as a married woman.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has not made a formal assessment of the contribution that industrial logging makes to poverty alleviation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, experience from other countries tells us that, while logging activities can contribute significant revenue, their contribution to poverty reduction tend to be marginal unless local communities are closely involved in decision making about the use of forests and the distribution of benefits from forest exploitation. This is why the UK Government have been sponsoring the Roundtable process to develop alternative models for forest management and financing in the DRC. These will be presented to Congolese and international partners during a conference in Kinshasa on 23 and 24 June. One of the proposals to be presented is the introduction of community-based forestry management in the DRC which puts local communities at the centre of the decision making process for forest use.</p>

The recent establishment of a national committee to agree a standard methodology for forest land-use zoning is an encouraging sign that the rights of forest-dependent people are being taken seriously.

 The UK Government do not believe that a moratorium on all logging in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is either desirable or enforceable. The DRC is a desperately poor country emerging from civil war and it needs to be able to exploit its natural resources in a .sustainable way to drive reconstruction and the provision of basic services. Sustainable logging practices from countries like Mexico and Guatemala show that governments and communities can derive substantial benefits from logging activities. A blanket moratorium would also prevent the emergence of small-scale logging businesses which are an essential element of community-based forest management.</p>

The GoI has recognised it holds primary responsibility for the welfare of its people and is working to address the humanitarian situation inside the country. To that end, the GoI last week allocated $40 million to the World Food Programme, to assist in the provision of food for internally displaced people. The UK is also encouraging the GoI to take a lead in providing financial support to Iraqi refugees in the wider region, and we are seeing some progress being made.

Currently refugees who have been interviewed in the region have said they do not wish to return to Iraq because they believe it is unsafe to do so. The UNHCR, who lead on refugee issues, has also made it clear that the situation in Iraq does not currently warrant mass refugee return. Therefore, security must be the Iraqi Government's top priority, to allow displaced people to feel safe enough to return home.</p>

However, there has been much ODA engagement with the business community, both large and small, on the free to use CompeteFor system. 18,000 suppliers are registered currently giving eligibility to apply for any opportunity on the system and ODA estimate approximately 10,000 opportunities from the ODA supply chain alone being advertised on CompeteFor.</p>

The &#145;Know Your Limits&#146; campaign started in June 2008, and aims to raise the public&#146;s knowledge of units of alcohol to ensure that everyone has the information they need to estimate more accurately how much they drink. The Government will also build on the &#145;Know Your Limits&#146; campaign to raise awareness of the risks of harmful drinking, and will target information and advice towards people who drink at harmful levels, and their families and friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="80612w0017.htm_para6"><a name="08061288000160">The Government will also continue to take tough enforcement action against those individuals who exhibit unacceptable behaviour while intoxicated. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 brought in a range of additional measures to tackle alcohol related crime and disorder, including directions to leave which enable the police to ban a person from a locality for a maximum of 48 hours. The Government have also funded four alcohol arrest referral pilots which target alcohol related offenders with the aim of providing interventions to drive home messages about alcohol and risks and to promote behaviour change. The pilots will be extended to a number of other areas by the end of 2008.</p>

 Table 1 shows the numbers of small claims in the county courts of England and Wales in 2007, broken down according to whether the claimant was represented and whether the defendant was represented in each case. The data were sourced from the main administrative system in the county courts (CaseMan) which holds the details of legal representatives, but not whether these were barristers (counsel) or solicitors. Representation details can be added, amended or deleted from CaseMan at any stage during a case's progression through the court.

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para4"><a name="08061288000803">Based on these figures it can be calculated that 32,163 (60 per cent.) of the 53,226 small claims hearings in 2007 involved at least one party which had legal representation. Claimants were not legally represented in 28,362 (53 per cent.) of cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para5"><a name="08061288000804">HM Courts Service (HMCS) records its centrally received user complaints in one of 10 categories. These relate to the stage of the court process which prompted the complaint, rather than to the type of case being heard. It is therefore not possible to identify complaints that explicitly relate to small claims cases. However, Table 2 shows a breakdown by category of all complaints received centrally by HMCS in the last three financial years. These figures cover all areas of HM Courts Service business, encompassing over 1 million small claims among a total of over 4 million cases per year across civil, criminal and family justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para6"><a name="08061288000805">During 2007, county court bailiffs recovered an average of 89.5 pence in the pound from correctly directed warrants of execution (i.e. where the creditor supplied the correct address) across all cases in the county courts of England and Wales in 2007. Data are not currently available for small claims alone, or on the recovery of monies other than through the actions of county court bailiffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para7"><a name="08061288000806">During 2007, there were an average of 28 weeks between the date of issue and the date of hearing for small claims (whether for specified or unspecified amounts) disposed of at hearing in England and Wales. The equivalent figure for 2000 was 29 weeks, although there were changes in the data collection method during the intervening period meaning that the comparison should be treated with caution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para8"><a name="08061288000807">There were 1.194 million claims issued in the county courts of England and Wales for specified amounts of &#163;5,000 or less during 2007. Of these, 382,000 (32 per cent. of the total) were issued at named local county courts, rather than via the Money Claims On-Line (MCOL) service or the County Court Bulk Centre (CCBC). There were 92,000 defences entered in response to these locally-issued claims, with 11,000 of these defences incorporating a counterclaim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para9"><a name="08061288000808">In addition, there were 107,000 claims issued via MCOL or the CCBC which were transferred into local county courts after either a defence or a counterclaim was received. Most of these claims will relate to specified amounts of &#163;5,000 or less, and therefore the total number of defences issued for all claims of this type (regardless of the issuing route) is around 200,000. However, please note that a single claim can name more than one defendant, and can therefore lead to more than one defence being entered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="80612w0022.htm_para10"><a name="08061288000809">During 2007, there were 49,000 small claims hearings in claims involving specified amounts of &#163;5,000. These claims may have originally been issued in 2007 or in earlier years. Information is not available on whether these hearings took place in open court or in chambers.</p>

The extent to which a responsible person is considered to be complying adequately with the requirements of the legislation and managing the risk on their premises is a matter of judgment, based on the professional experience and expertise of the individual fire safety audit officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_505"><a name="80612w0023.htm_para0"><a name="08061288001077">In the event of non-compliance, there are a range of measures that can be taken to improve fire safety on all premises covered by this legislation. The two main measures available to enforcing authorities (primarily fire and rescue authorities) are enforcement notices, which require changes to be made over a specified period of time; and prohibition notices, which effectively shut premises down until improvements are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_506"><a name="80612w0023.htm_para1"><a name="08061288001078">In the event that a responsible person does not act to improve fire safety in response to an enforcement or prohibition notice from the Fire and Rescue Authority, or, in any event, if failure to comply with the requirements of the Order places persons at risk of death or serious injury in case of fire, they are liable to prosecution in the courts. The level of penalty to be applied as a consequence of prosecution is a matter for the courts, subject to a maximum of an unlimited fine and/or two years&#146; imprisonment in the Crown court, or a fine of &#163;5,000 in a magistrates court.</p>

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_507"><a name="80612w0023.htm_para2"><a name="08061288001081">Since 2005, the principal mechanism for multi-agency cooperation in preparing for emergencies has been the local resilience forum, based mainly on each police area rather than districts<sup>(1)</sup>, and bringing together the emergency services and other category one and two responders as defined in the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="80612w0023.htm_para3"><a name="08061288001082">All local resilience forums are required under the Act to carry out assessments of the risks of emergencies in their areas. Many<sup>(2)</sup> local resilience forums have a collectively agreed multi-agency flood response plan; and nearly all of the main category one responders within them either contribute to these plans or take account of flooding incidents in their own emergency response plans. Most of the plans that exist had already been reviewed in the period following the summer flooding; and multi-agency plans are being further reviewed following the issue of new guidance from Government in February this year. The Government specifically wrote to all LRF chairs in February and again in May 2008 asking LRFs to let us know how the new guidance was being embedded at a local level. The replies we have had in to date give a clear indication that many LRFs have been very active since the floods last year. In particular, it seems evident that significant effort has gone into identifying the lessons of 2007 and improving local risk assessments, plans and their general state of preparedness (mostly through better activation procedures and clarity over roles and responsibilities).</p>

 None. The Local Authority Business Growth Incentives scheme is not a scheme for the award of contracts. It is designed to give local authorities an incentive to encourage local business growth, which it does by paying a non-ringfenced grant to authorities where business growth exceeds a certain level, as measured by changes in the business rateable value base.</p>

 The Government are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all learners, and that learning serves the needs of the whole community, including older people both within and outside the work force. Our strategy for World Class Skills and our reforms of wider adult learning are designed to ensure that everyone, whatever their age or background, has the opportunity to improve their skills, prospects and quality of life. We will continue to work closely with our ministerial colleagues to respond to the consultation on the Equality Bill&#151;&#147;A Framework for Fairness&#148;&#151;to ensure that everyone, in every community, can lead healthy and fulfilling lives by participating fully in work, education and society as a whole.</p>

The Regulations mean that further education and training providers are not allowed to set age limits for access to training unless they can show objective justification why there is a real need to apply such limits. The Government have decided that all courses at Further Education and Higher Education institutions are covered by the age regulations, whether they are specifically vocational or more general in nature. This ensures that there is a unified and consistent approach to age-related practices and policies in relation to all such provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="80612w0026.htm_para1"><a name="08061288001733">I must stress that the Regulations do not bar providers from offering age-related fee discounts.

The guidance makes it clear that age related practices, such as age related fee concessions, may be objectively justified where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. It is for providers to produce evidence of such objective justification if called upon to do so, or to take their own legal advice if necessary. Guidance on objective justification is also available on page 30 of the ACAS guidance on the Age Regulations.&#148; [<i> Official Report</i>, 16 May 2007, col. 35WS.]</p>

 Our January 2008 grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England provided sufficient funding for recruitment by 2011 of 60,000 new students. This increase builds on our consistent track record of growing student numbers to record levels. But we are not simply concerned with recruiting younger students. Our development of new models for the funding and design of higher education (HE) courses will also enable us to grow the number of mature students entering HE part-time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="80612w0026.htm_para2"><a name="08061288001738">As part of this strategy for growth, we have asked the Funding Council over the next six years to support 20 new HE centres with around 10,000 student places, under our new University Challenge initiative. This will allow more students to gain access to HE locally. We are also committed to a steep increase in the number of people studying for foundation degrees. Our ambition to provide 100,000 foundation degree enrolments by 2010 will support young people and adults in employment to develop higher level work-related skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="80612w0026.htm_para3"><a name="08061288001739">We believe that there will be demand for the new places we are creating. Improvements to the student support package for full-time students in England announced last July will further encourage more young people to go to university. For young people, we know that the best way to increase participation in HE is to raise level 2 achievement in schools at age 16 with an increase in young people attaining five GCSEs at grades A* to C to 62 per cent. from 37 per cent. in 1997. New study options for young people at age 14, the Aimhigher Programme and HE institutions&#146; own outreach activity working directly with schools all help to raise aspirations and achievement across the board.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 June 2008]:</i> The Government are committed both to increasing the number of people studying science, technology, engineering and maths at all levels, and to working with the science and engineering industries to improve skill levels in those industries. My Department works closely with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), and funds STEMNET&#151;the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network&#151;to raise awareness of these subjects and engagement among young people. This includes support for the science and engineering ambassadors scheme which has already enabled over 18,000 specialists to work directly with schools and colleges, offering mentoring, career guidance and positive role models. We recently announced that STEMNET would work towards having 27,000 ambassadors in place by 2011.</p>

skills their businesses need to thrive both now and in the future. Our White Paper &#145;World Class Skills&#146; was published last summer. It set out how we will shape the skills system around the needs of customers&#151;employers and learners&#151;to meet the challenge of competing in the global economy. Since then we have pressed ahead with making the skills system more demand led. This includes improving and expanding Train to Gain to help employers identify and address their skills needs. Since national roll-out began from April 2006, Train to Gain has engaged nearly 90,000 employers, enabled over 450,000 employees to begin learning programmes, and over 210,000 to gain new qualifications. We are working with Sector Skills Councils to develop sector compacts, earmarking Train to Gain funds specifically to support the skills those sectors need. Funding for the Apprenticeship programme is being increased, and the programme reformed, so that more employers and employees benefit from high-quality work-based training. National Skills Academies have now been approved in nine sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="80612w0027.htm_para6"><a name="08061288001901">On higher skills, our recent consultation paper &#145;Higher Education at Work&#146; has launched a national debate on what more needs to be done to meet the need for more&#151;and more employable&#151;graduates, and raise the skills of those already in the work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="80612w0027.htm_para7"><a name="08061288001902">A key aim in taking all these actions is that employers and the skills system get better at responding to future strategic challenges and opportunities&#151;such as a low carbon economy, renewable energy, and the Olympics&#151;focussing on the medium and long term as well as on immediate skills needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="80612w0027.htm_para8"><a name="08061288001903">Over the next three years we will be investing &#163;2.3 billion on the modernisation and renewal of the Further Education estate, supporting investment in specialist new facilities in colleges and training providers, to build the capacity needed to meet our skills priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="80612w0027.htm_para9"><a name="08061288001904">We are also taking action to make sure the employment and skills system is much better joined up. In April the new UK Commission for Employment and Skills started work. We are publishing today new proposals for more integrated employment and skills services that are more responsive to the needs of individuals and employers, with plans to ensure that delivery systems work more closely together, driven by those who know best how to shape services to meet local needs.</p>

Recently completed evaluations show that a wide spread of industry sectors are accessing the service. We will continue to monitor that distribution through ongoing evaluation.</p>
