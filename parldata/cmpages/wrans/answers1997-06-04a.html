To ask the Secretary of State for Health by what means his Department makes available its publications in <i>(a)</i> Braille, <i>(b)</i> audio tape and <i>(c)</i> large print; and how this is publicised. [1671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Publications for those with special needs, including people who are sensorily impaired, are generally distributed through agencies that have regular contact with such people. The Department sends mail shot samples and bulk orders on demand to these specialist agencies.
<P>

<a name="70604w01.html_para0">This is backed up by distributions via public libraries, Citizen's Advice Bureaux and other advice centres, local authorities and patient waiting areas in family doctor surgeries and hospitals.
<P>

<a name="70604w01.html_para1">Where an advertising campaign is associated with the topic concerned, the special versions of a publication may be offered through press advertisements. The publications are also available via the Department's literature response lines.
<P>

<a name="70604w01.html_para2">The Department is in the process of building its own direct mail database which will allow precise targeting of agencies and individuals who will act as channels through which this kind of information can be passed to the end user.
<P>

<a name="70604w01.html_para3">The Department's Internet site is being used increasingly to publicise the existence of its publications, including those for people with special needs, and additional publicity routes, such as public information kiosks, are currently being investigated.
<P>

<a name="70604w01.html_para4">Examples of the types of publication available are given in the following list:

<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what steps he took to comply with the consultation requirement of the Osteopaths Act 1993 in respect of the nomination of the General Osteopathic Council; [1836]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reason principals and vice-principals of osteopathic training institutions are excluded from membership of the General Osteopathic Council; and when the decision was made to exclude them; [1837]
<P>
(3) if directors of companies engaged in the registration and training of osteopaths are excluded from membership of the General Osteopathic Council; and if he will make a statement. [1838]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The nominations exercise leading to the appointments of the Chairman and members of the first General Osteopathic Council was conducted by the previous administration.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the Chairman of the General Osteopathic Council is a lay member; and if he will make a statement. [1776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Chairman of the General Osteopathic Council, Mr. Simon Fielding OBE, is one of the eight lay members of the Council. Under the transitional provisions of the Osteopaths Act 1993, a lay member of the initial Council is defined as 'a person not appearing to the Privy Council to be a practising osteopath'. Although originally qualified as an osteopath, Mr. Fielding has not been able to practise as an osteopath since September 1988, as a result of injuries sustained in a violent assault. Under the transitional provisions described above, he therefore qualified for appointment as lay member of the Council.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received regarding the composition of the General Osteopathic Council. [1834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We have received several letters of support from osteopathic organisations for the Chairman and members of the new General Osteopathic Council, and expressing appreciation of their work towards full implementation of the Osteopaths Act.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to make the General Osteopathic Council more representative of the profession. [1835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Osteopaths Act 1993 makes provision for 12 osteopathic members on the General Osteopathic Council. Arrangements to fill the current vacancy in the osteopathic membership of the Council will be commenced shortly.

<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the link between the E4 gene and increased risk of neurological damage; and if he will make a statement. [2116]

<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The APO E4 allelle is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, this risk is not absolute with only half of those with Alzheimer's disease having E4 and not everyone with E4 developing Alzheimer's. APO E4 is not the only risk factor associated with the disease. There is considerable medical research ongoing in this field including work sponsored by the Medical Research Council which receives its grant-in-aid from the Department of Trade and Industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hopkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the key business targets for the Medicines Control Agency for 1997-98. [2255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We have today placed a copy of the 1997-98 key business targets of the Medicines Control Agency in the Library. We shall, of course, be reviewing the Agency's plans and targets for the longer-term.

<a name="70604w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Prisoners (HIV/AIDS)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what combination therapies are available for prisoners being treated for HIV/AIDS. [1155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The issue of which therapies to prescribe in combination for individuals with HIV/AIDS is a matter for the treating clinician in consultation with the patient, and taking into account clinical circumstances. Clinical Guidelines outlining the circumstances in which combination therapies would be suitable have recently been published. They are "The British HIV Association Guidelines for Antiretroviral Treatment of HIV Seropositive Individuals", and "The PACT (National Association of Providers of AIDS Care and Treatment) Framework for Antiretroviral Therapy," copies of which are available in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list those areas of the European convention on human rights which he proposes to incorporate into UK law; and if he will make a statement. [1580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We propose to incorporate all the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the convention and the First Protocol to it. Some of the provisions in the Convention, such as those relating to the composition of the European Court of Human Rights, are purely procedural and therefore of no domestic relevance.

<a name="70604w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Assisted Prison Visits</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was his Department's total expenditure on assisted prison visits for people in receipt of specified benefits for the latest year for which figures are available; how many individuals were assisted by such payments; and if he will make a statement. [1569]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 The total cost of assisted visits to prisons in England and Wales for 1996-97 was &#163;3,824,324.
<P>

<a name="70604w01.html_para5">It is not possible to specify the actual number of individuals who received assistance. The Assisted Prisons Visits Unit computer system records only the number of claims forms received and paid (or rejected) but a person eligible for payment under the scheme is entitled to a maximum of 26 assisted prison visits each year.

<P>
<UL>(2) on how many occasions between September and November 1996 the named day-to-day care person appointed under section 6(5) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to be responsible for the welfare of the protected animals being held in the Dog Toxicology Unit at Huntingdon Life Sciences, notified personal licence holders that they were concerned for the health or welfare of an animal, in accordance with the procedure laid down in section 6(6)(a) of the Act. [1762]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 These figures are not recorded.

[1765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 Nineteen of the current licences are rated as mild, 27 as moderate and two as substantial. The classification of individual procedures is not recorded on the central database.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many of the project licences authorising the carrying-out of scientific procedures at Huntingdon Life Sciences have been issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. [1764]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 There are currently 48 project licences issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 at that establishment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on how many occasions between September and November 1996 the Home Office Inspectorate visited Huntingdon Life Sciences, under section 18(2) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; how many of these visits were to monitor scientific procedures in the 



<P>

Dog Toxicology Unit; what reports were made to him in accordance with section 18(2)(e); and how many animals were considered to be undergoing excessive suffering and dealt with in accordance with the procedure laid down in section 18(3) of the Act following these visits. [1760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 Six inspectorate visits were made to the establishment in that period. Dog Toxicology Units were visited on three occasions; on two of these, the performance of regulated procedures was observed. One visit involved two Inspectors.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what grounds an exemption was granted under section 10(3) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to allow the use of non-purpose bred dogs in scientific procedures in 1995. [1740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The grounds were that suitable dogs were not available from designated sources.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the source and breed of the 66 non-purpose bred dogs acquired from non-designated sources in the United Kingdom used in scientific procedures in 1995. [1741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 The dogs were provided by their owners who gave informed consent. A range of crossbred and pedigree animals was used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 For all publications, consideration is given at an early stage to the needs of the blind and partially sighted.
<P>

<a name="70604w02.html_para0">My Department has produced the fire safety publication 'Fire Safety in the Home' in Braille, on audio tape and in large print. These are publicised in a catalogue made available to all fire brigades in England and Wales which can order supplies for free distribution to the public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many inspections were carried out by his Department's inspectors under the 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 1997 : Column: 176</I><P>
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 at each of the Ministry of Defence establishments conducting animal experiments under the Act in each year since 1993. [1877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Two Ministry of Defence establishments are designated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In each respective year since 1993, the Inspectorate has carried out three, two, six and five visits to one establishment and seven, six, 13 and 13 to the other. In the first five months of 1997, one and four visits (respectively) have been carried out.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in what circumstances reports arising from Home Office inspections under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 are available to the public. [1878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 The role of the Inspectorate is to advise the Secretary of State. Section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 prohibits the publication of any information which has been given in confidence. Reports from visits of inspection are not therefore made public.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
1. We will ensure that our workforce is equipped with the skills necessary in a modern, competitive economy.
<BR>
2. We will reform Britain's competition laws because we know more competitive markets are a spur to firms to become more competitive.
<BR>
3. We will cut unnecessary "red tape" and simplify government to reduce burdens on business.
<BR>
4. We will legislate on late payment because we know late payment hurts small firms and thriving small firms will be the foundation of a more competitive Britain.
<BR>
5. We will set a deadline for the completion of Europe's Single Market, clearing away trade barriers and unfair state aids, to give Britain's business access to the world's largest market.

<a name="70604w04.html_para4">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions requesting various statistics about the North London District of the Employment Service. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.

You asked a number of questions about our North London District and I thought it would be helpful if I answered them in turn in one reply.
<BR>
It may help if I first of all explain that North London District was created as part of the boundary review, which saw the introduction of the district structure to the Employment Service, in April 1994. This and the fact that we only keep information regionally for three years unfortunately means that we can only provide the material you require going back to 1994. However, I hope the data given below is helpful.
<BR>
I should explain that the information on number of warning letters issued to job seekers for not actively seeking employment is not recorded. It may, however, be helpful to explain that since August 1992 it has not been a requirement for warning letters to be issued in every case of inadequate job search. Since this date warning letters have only been issued if Jobcentre staff consider a job seeker genuinely not to have understood what was required of them. The number of referrals to Adjudication Officers for not Actively Seeking Employment and for Refusal of Employment have only been recorded since April this year. Prior to this only the number of decisions made were recorded.

The statistical data you asked for in relation to the number of people attending Restart interviews and their results are detailed in the table below. You asked for the results to be broken down in the same way as the Answer of 18 December 1990, Official Report, column 148. It may help if I explain that the range of employment and training opportunities offered has altered and increased since 1991. Training for Work has replaced the Employment Training programme, and the Enterprise Allowance scheme, has been replaced by Business Start-up. The numbers shown for Business Start-up reflect the actual number of people who have opted for self-employment whereas, under the Enterprise Allowance scheme the number of people attending a seminar was measured.
<BR>
It may help if I explain how the figures above are made up. In the year 1994/95 for example, 6,502 people went into Jobclubs in North London and 5,975 left of which 2,746 went into jobs and 787 into "other outcomes": ie there were 3,533 positive outcomes in total. However, it does not follow that the other 2,442 simply left Jobclubs and returned to unemployment. The Employment Service is only allowed to score as results people who leave a programme and find a job within 13 weeks of their time on the programme ending. People who have been in Jobclubs may well find jobs shortly after that, because their experience in the Jobclub has helped them improve their employability, but in such cases these would not be included in our Jobclub figures.
<BR>
You asked for similar information about Jobplan, Restart and Workwise courses. It may help if I explain that although we keep records of the number of referrals made to the Benefits Agency where clients fail to attend or complete courses we do not keep records on the outcome of these referrals. I should also explain that we did not keep records of the number of referrals made to the Benefits Agency in 1994/95 and that in 1996/97 we only recorded the number of referrals made up to the end of September prior to the introduction of JSA. Subject to that, the tables below show the information that you requested for the North London District since 1994. You will want to note that the Workwise programme was not introduced until April 1995.

<a name="70604w04.html_para8">You asked for details about the numbers of clients applying for Income Support under the hardship rules. It may help if I explain that this is the responsibility of the Benefits Agency, who have provided the table overleaf which provides most of the information you asked for. I understand from the Benefits Agency that they do not keep records of the number of Income Support hardship claims for clients who refused suitable employment. This information may be included in the data relating to availability for work and those not actively seeking work.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>

When studying the table you will need to take the following points into consideration:
1. Income Support (General) Regulation 8(3) relates to a person who is not treated as available for employment and the Adjudication Officer is satisfied that, unless Income Support is paid, the claimant or member of his family (if any) will suffer hardship.
2. Income Support (General) Regulation 10A(2) relates to a person who is not required to be actively seeking employment and is either pregnant, or one member of a couple is pregnant, is responsible for a child or young person or receives the disability premium and the Adjudication Officer is satisfied that, unless Income Support is paid, the claimant or a member of his family (if any) will suffer hardship.
3. Prior to April 1994 data was collated jointly for Restart and Jobplan.
4. Information has been provided by the BA's Central Data Unit and is subject to amendment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The pupil:teacher ratios (PTRs) within schools are calculated by dividing the total number of pupils on school registers (counting each part-time pupil as 0.5) by the total number of qualified teachers (adjusted to reflect the part-time working of some teachers).
<P>

<a name="70604w05.html_para0">Class sizes are calculated by dividing the numbers of pupils being taught together in classes at a particular point in the school timetable by the number of teachers, qualified or unqualified, deployed in such classes. Average class sizes are normally calculated for those classes involving only one teacher.
<P>

<a name="70604w05.html_para1">Both measures are derived from information collected from the annual count of pupils and teachers in schools in January each year.

<i>Notes:<P>

</i>(3) The position at 31 March in the year after completion comes from service records collected for the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme (TSS). Qualified students who obtain a teaching appointment in an institution that is not covered by the TSS are shown as "never in service". For example, those who take up appointments in the "old" university sector, in the independent sector without TSS membership, or outside England and Wales.<P>

(4) A considerable number of newly qualified teachers take a year or more before starting teaching. Data from teachers qualifying in 1993 indicate that around 8 per cent. were not in service in March 1994, but were in service one year later.<P>

(5) Including less than 100 teachers who entered service following completion of ITT who had already left by 31 March of the year following completion.<P>

(6) Any other sector or institutions with TSS membership, eg some independent schools, further education.<P>

 Research commissioned by the Department identified savings alongside changes to the quality of local services.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your Question about the enforcement of UK qualification requirements for masters and officers of large privately-owned commercially-operated yachts.
<BR>
It may be helpful if I summarise the background. Until recently, masters and officers on vessels of this kind were required to comply with the deck officer qualification requirements in UK merchant shipping regulations. Many people working in the professional yachting industry, however, found it impossible to obtain the necessary certificates because they had come to professional yachting from leisure yachting and could not meet the requirement to have worked on merchant navy vessels for a minimum specified period. In consequence, the regulation were not being observed. This resulted in substantial variations in the standards of competence of officers working on these vessels.
<BR>
Therefore, in consultation with the industry, sail training organisations and the Warsash Maritime Operations Centre, the Agency has developed an alternative qualification. This is the Deck Officer Class 5 (or 4) with command endorsement and is limited to yachts and sail training vessels. It requires a base qualification of the Royal Yachting Association/Department of Transport certificate of competence Yachtmaster Offshore (or Ocean) with commercial endorsement. This is more readily obtainable by those who work in the professional yachting industry and, when allied with a number of additional mandatory training modules, provides the knowledge and experience which we and the industry consider necessary for the safe operation of these large yachts. It can be seen that the MSA has worked closely with industry and other interested parties to develop a qualification which will be relevant to the operation of these vessels. You should also be aware that this Code and the associated qualifications for the Masters and Officers will be adopted by the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Isle of Man and, in due course the British Virgin Islands.
<BR>
Our approach on enforcement will be to allow our recognised classification societies to carry out the survey and certification of vessels classed with them. The enforcement of these requirements will in general be through our usual practice of inspecting both ships and the service providers to ensure that the standards are being complied with. However we would envisage further discussions with the industry and all other interested parties on the details of the enforcement regime to be employed in view of the distribution of the vessels throughout the world.

I am sorry I cannot comment on the new EU VAT Directive which falls outside my areas of responsibility. May I suggest that you direct this enquiry to HM Custom and Excise.

 The Government will appoint an anti-drugs supremo to co-ordinate our action against drugs across all Government departments and key agencies.

One of the "drugs czar's" first tasks will be to review urgently the existing drugs strategy and put forward proposals for tackling the problem with renewed vigour. This will build on action already underway at both national and local level, including legislative proposals to break the links between drugs and crime, and the work of Drug Action Teams across the country.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many pigs were included in the consignments exported on <i>(a)</i> 15 May and <i>(b)</i> 19 May; what factors led him on 16 May to issue a notice under the Welfare of Animals During Transport Order 1994 preventing the export from Dover of a consignment of pigs; what steps he plans to take to ensure regular compliance in the future with the health and welfare laws governing the export of live animals; and if he will make a statement. [1273]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A total of 2,919 pigs were exported on the MV Caroline on 15 May and 1,583 on 19 May. Officials delayed the 16 May consignment by serving a notice because they were not satisfied with the information given as to the destination. This is part of the Government's overall policy of applying the highest possible standards to this trade and of pressing the other Member States to do likewise.
<P>

<a name="70604w10.html_para0">The Government strongly prefer meat to be exported on the hook rather than on the hoof. Where animals are exported live, the public must have full confidence that the strictest possible welfare rules are being applied to this trade. We will not compromise on these standards.
<P>

<a name="70604w10.html_para1">A consultation letter has gone out to interested parties seeking suggestions and comments by 18 June. I have commissioned an urgent review of the arrangements for ensuring that animals are rested, fed, watered, cleared as fit and certified prior to export in accordance with the law.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 21 May, <i>Official Report</i> columns <i>95-6,</i> (1) which of the typical selection of identified landfill sites, where checks in respect of ground water quality have been or will be carried out, have a chalk base; [1509]
<P>
<UL>(2) if the part of Beddingham landfill site where carcases of cattle infected by BSE were disposed of was lined to prevent seepage into the chalk below; what other classes of waste have been permitted for disposal in that section of the site; and what monitoring of that section of site has been carried out subsequent to the disposal therein of the carcases referred to; [1510]
<P>
(3) if Beddingham landfill site is one of the typical selection of identified landfill sites where checks in respect of ground water quality have been or will be carried out. [1511]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70604w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 June 1997]:</i> The Environment Agency has responsibility for the safe regulation of landfill sites in England and Wales under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The Agency has advised that the Beddingham landfill site is licensed to accept industrial, commercial and household waste; there was no sub-division of the site to keep these different waste streams apart; and that the carcases landfilled there (fewer than 10) were deposited in an unlined area of the site with a chalk base.
<P>

<a name="70604w10.html_para2">The Environment Agency monitors ground water quality in the vicinity of licensed landfill sites to check for leachate contamination as part of their statutory duties. It is understood that there are ten boreholes at Beddingham where regular monitoring of groundwater is undertaken by the operators of the site.
<P>

<a name="70604w10.html_para3">The Agency has carried out a qualitative assessment of all the sites concerned taking into account the number of carcases buried, the degree of containment and the proximity of water sources. It has carried out a further more detailed quantitative assessment of a selection of sites. This includes a chalk based site but not Beddingham itself.
<P>

<a name="70604w10.html_para4">The Agency presented its quantitative assessment to the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee for comments. The Agency is preparing to publish the final results of the assessment very shortly. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House.
