<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many pig farmers were offered aid under the Outgoers 1 Scheme; on what basis tenders were assessed; and if he will make a statement.  [159829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS)--Outgoers, closed for applications on 2 March, and all applicants were informed of their success or otherwise on 23 March. There were a total of 1,237 bids in the UK as a whole (England 650, Northern Ireland 510, Scotland 53, Wales 24). A total of 205,327 sow places were offered, greatly exceeding the target of 120,000 sow places.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para0">As was made clear from the beginning, successful bids under PIRS--Outgoers would be assessed on a value for money basis. To achieve this, bids were assessed using a value for money criteria agreed by MAFF and the devolved authorities in advance of opening the bids. This was done in order to avoid any accusations of manipulating the criteria to achieve a specific result.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para1">The criteria defined what would be judged as value for money in terms of cost per sow place. It was agreed that bids greater than 125 per cent. of the average (the top 10 per cent. and bottom 10 per cent. of tenders were removed while calculating the average figure) tender bid in terms of &#163; per sow place would be rejected. The highest tender to be accepted was calculated at &#163;237 per sow place, giving a maximum payment of &#163;142 per sow place (the full 60 per cent. allowable was paid to successful applicants).
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para2">The final result of PIRS--Outgoers was a total of 432 accepted bids (England 315, Northern Ireland 87, Scotland 20, Wales 10), with an average tender of &#163;185 per sow place (average payment of &#163;111 per sow place). A total or &#163;10.6 million has been offered to the successful applicants.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para3">Payments are now being made to the first claims under PIRS--Outgoers from successful applicants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Watts: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what the estimated cost is to each British family of the measures taken to eradicate <i>(a)</i> foot and mouth disease and <i>(b)</i> BSE in Britain.  [156268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> It is, at present, too soon to carry out an estimate of the cost of measures taken so far to eradicate foot and mouth disease to each British family.




<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 2001 : Column: 404W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para4">The total cost of the BSE crisis to the UK up to and including 2000-01 was approximately &#163;3.5 billion. This figure relates to various financial measures, and not solely eradication measures. To calculate a more specific figure, relating solely to eradication measures and the average cost per family, would involve disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what advice he has given to the operators of landfill sites about the precautions they should take to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease.  [153822]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> The disposal of carcases during the foot and mouth outbreak takes place in accordance with the detailed 'Best Practice' protocol prepared by the Environment Agency, MAFF and the Environmental Services Association. This protocol provides in-depth advice to landfill site operators, in order to minimise the risks of disease spread.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para5">My Department authorises the disposal of carcases under the Animal By-Products Order (1999) for each and every landfill site. The Environment Agency is responsible for modifying the waste management licences to allow the burial of carcases, and each licence modification refers to the 'Best Practice' protocol.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baldry: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what compensation will be available to livestock farmers who have been unable to move stock to slaughter as a consequence of their being in foot and mouth exclusion zones.  [155657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2001]:</i> Compensation is not generally payable for consequential losses caused by foot and mouth controls, for example those caused by movement restrictions. There are no plans to make such payments in response to the current outbreak, but the situation will be kept under review.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para6">The Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme was opened to applicants on 22 March 2001. As with the Pig Welfare Disposal Scheme in Norfolk and Suffolk last year, this voluntary slaughter scheme is intended to help resolve serious animal welfare difficulties arising from disease control measures which cannot be alleviated by movement under licence or in other ways. It is not a market support measure. The Government will meet the costs of transport, slaughter and disposal of animals under the scheme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if <i>(a)</i> he, <i>(b)</i> ministerial colleagues and <i>(c)</i> his officials were in discussions with timber merchants with a view to supplying pyres for the disposal of carcases for foot and mouth in the three months prior to 19 February.  [155268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the reply given to the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on 23 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 50W. Ministers were not involved in any such discussions with timber merchants.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Tredinnick: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reason the Government have prevented chemists and other parties from offering advice on the efficacy of homoeopathic Borax in the prevention of foot and mouth disease.  [157709]




<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 2001 : Column: 405W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> Products that are presented for the treatment or prevention of disease in animals, or which have that function, must be authorised under the terms of the Marketing Authorisations for Veterinary Medicinal Products Regulations 1994 before they can be legally sold or supplied in the United Kingdom. This ensures that such products are properly assessed and are demonstrated as being safe, of consistent good quality and effective when used in accordance with the label instructions.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para7">Some pharmacies have advertised the homoeopathic product Borax 30 as a preventative measure against foot and mouth disease. However, this product has not been authorised under these regulations. We have received no scientific evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness against foot and mouth disease and we have not assessed its safety or quality.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Tredinnick: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he has had with homoeopathic vets concerning the use of homoeopathic Borax in the prevention of foot and mouth disease.  [157707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> My officials have been in correspondence with the Veterinary Dean of the Homoeopathic Faculty in London on the use of the homoeopathic product Borax. In this correspondence we have stressed that foot and mouth disease is a notifiable disease and, if suspected, must be notified to the local MAFF Divisional Veterinary Manager.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Tredinnick: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what evidence he has assessed on the <i>(a)</i> safety and <i>(b)</i> quality of homoeopathic borax in the prevention of foot and mouth disease.  [157711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him on 24 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 257W.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Tredinnick: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the Government will issue advice to farmers on the use of homoeopathic borax in the prevention of foot and mouth disease.  [157708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> Advice regarding the use of the homoeopathic product Borax has been given to farmers via the MAFF foot and mouth website, and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate website.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make it his policy to offer financial compensation for residents of properties who have been subject to extreme inconvenience and disruption from prolonged burning of carcases adjacent to their homes.  [157714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> Compensation is payable for the market value of animals slaughtered to control foot and mouth disease. It is not payable for the consequential losses caused by foot and mouth controls, or for any inconvenience caused to residents by the cremation of animal carcases.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn10"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many <i>(a)</i> farmers and <i>(b)</i> others are prevented from (i) sending or (ii) receiving mail due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak; what mechanisms he intends to put in place to 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 2001 : Column: 406W</I><P>
ensure that such persons will be able to vote by post at the forthcoming local elections; and if he will make a statement about the implications of the foot and mouth outbreak for those who wish to vote by post.  [156811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2001]:</i> There is no reason why farmers on infected premises should be prevented from sending and receiving mail. Movements on and off an infected premises are licensed by the State Veterinary Service. These licences would set out the cleansing and disinfection arrangements that should be followed and might specify a prescribed route so as to minimise the risk of spreading disease. In some cases arrangements have been made for mail to be left at, and collected from, the farm boundary.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para8">The new rules on absent voting allow for postal votes on demand. The Home Office has made large quantities of postal vote leaflets (including application forms) available to electoral registration officers. They have been encouraged to publicise the availability of postal votes, particularly in areas affected by foot and mouth disease to ensure that no one is disfranchised.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Leigh: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what recent research he has commissioned on the risk associated with grain exports being a source of infection for foot and mouth disease.  [156742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2001]:</i> A general risk assessment of the grain trade spreading foot and mouth disease have been carried out and posted on the MAFF website http://www.maff.gov.uk/. Grain that is now available for export will have been harvested in the summer of 2000 (or earlier). It could not have been infected at the time of harvest as foot and mouth disease was not present in the country at that time. The grain is stored under conditions which would effectively prevent surface contamination, and is protected during transport in covered vehicles. In addition, no movement of grain is permitted from UK farms where foot and mouth is suspected or has been confirmed. There is therefore no reason why grain exports should not continue.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has for sheep to be ear tagged; and if he will make a statement.  [159379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> The Sheep and Goats Identification (England) Order took effect on 1 September 2000. This legislation requires all sheep and goats born after 1 January 2001 or first moved off their holding of birth after that date to be permanently identified with an eartag or tattoo identifying the animals' holding of birth.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para9">In my right hon. Friend the Minister's statement of 27 March he indicated that, once we were beyond the current difficulties, we would be looking at a range of issues surrounding the operation of the livestock sector to see if more could be done to minimise disease risks still further. This work will include consideration of the identification and tracing of sheep.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn13"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what recent representations he has received concerning meat imports from countries within the EU where foot and mouth has been diagnosed; and if he will make a statement.  [158963]




<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 2001 : Column: 407W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> I have received a number of representations concerning the importation of meat from EU countries in which foot and mouth disease has been diagnosed. These countries are France, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands and in all cases, import restrictions were placed on products derived from foot and mouth disease susceptible species in line with Community legislation. Restrictions have now been lifted in respect of France and the Republic of Ireland.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn14"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what role tag markings play in tracing animal movements from auction marts to farms during the foot and mouth crisis.  [154284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Cattle have a unique individual identification displayed on their eartag. When an animal moves an entry must be made in the farm register recording the animal's unique identity where it has moved to. This information must also be sent to the British Cattle Movement Service at Workington, for entry on the Cattle Tracing System database. Movements of cattle via auction marts can therefore be traced by reference to farmer's records, to auction mart's records and to those held at the BCMS.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para10">Sheep and goats born after 1 January 2001, or moved off the holding of birth after that date are required to be identified by means of an eartag (or tattoo). There is no requirement for markets to record eartag details. Sheep, goats and pigs when they move within Great Britain are required to be identified by a temporary paintmark which identifies the premises from which the animal last moved. Markets are required to keep records of all batches of sheep, goats and pigs moving through the market and their temporary mark.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many livestock in Wales he estimates will be slaughtered owing to foot and mouth disease outbreaks; and how many have been slaughtered to date.  [155017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 As of 10 April 2001, a total of approximately 84,600 sheep, 7,800 cattle, 500 pigs and 17 goats have been slaughtered in Wales.
<P>

<a name="10427w01.html_para11">The Government have published independent research on the epidemiology of the foot and mouth outbreak. The reports support the view that this outbreak will last several months and that there will continue to be new cases throughout that time. The epidemiological forecasts foresee the outbreak lasting at least until June and possibly beyond July. However, the Chief Veterinary Officer will not make a specific prediction on how long the outbreak will last, nor can we make a specific prediction of the number of animals that will be slaughtered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what virus dissemination prediction <i>(a)</i> models and <i>(b)</i> equipment are in use in connection with foot and mouth disease.  [156920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew16"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry has access to a <i>Gaussion</i> plume dispersion model for modelling spread up to 10 kilometres, and access to a Meteorological Office <i>NAME</i> model for predicting spread over long distances. There is also a collaborative arrangement with the Danish Meteorological Institute and 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 2001 : Column: 408W</I><P>
the Ris National Laboratory using the <i>Rimpuff</i> model and numerical weather prediction models. These models have all been scaled specifically for the biological parameters for foot and mouth disease and validated against previous outbreaks. The output from the UK Meteorological Office is input into MAFF geographical information systems to link with out database of farms and infected premises.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn17"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what the frequency was of contact between his Department, including its regional offices, and suppliers of materials required to deal with the current foot and mouth epidemic in the last 30 years.  [156416]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew17"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer given on 23 April 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column, 50W in connection with a number of related questions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_wqn18"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the potential benefits of the use of homeopathic Borax as a means of preventing the spread of foot and mouth; and if he will publish the scientific evidence he has received on this.  [158498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w01.html_spnew18"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We have not received any evidence of the effectiveness of Borax against foot and mouth disease nor have we received any other scientific evidence to demonstrate its efficacy, safety or quality. Without such evidence which is required for the authorisation of a veterinary medicinal product, no claim for treatment or prevention of disease is allowed under the legislation.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what personnel resources are available within his Department to monitor compliance with United Kingdom legislation in respect of animal exports.  [154665]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2001]:</i> All export consignments of farm livestock and most other animals may only be exported with an export health certificate. The drafting and issuing of such certificates is carried out by staff in MAFF's Animal Health International Trade Unit and Veterinary International Trade Team, and issuing is carried out by all Animal Health Divisional Offices (AHDOs). Local veterinary inspectors certify on behalf of MAFF whether the animals meet the animal health requirements in the certificate, and are fit to travel, after inspecting animals destined for export. Staff from the MAFF portal office also check every export consignment of sheep through the Port of Dover.
<P>

<a name="10427w02.html_para0">Where exporters are required to draw up route plans under Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 (WATO), applications are submitted to AHDOs. If satisfactory, the plans are then stamped and sent to the local veterinary inspectors for issue with the linked export health certificate.
<P>

<a name="10427w02.html_para1">The operations team within the London based Animal Welfare Divisions advises AHDOs whether any new routes comply with statutory journey time limits. They also maintain and monitor a database of transporter authorisations and reported infringements of WATO and arrange non-discriminatory checks on animals in

 Letters explaining the situation were sent to border inspection posts and traders after a Declaration was issued on 5 January 2001 suspending imports of fresh meat and certain products of animal origin from South Africa and Swaziland. Prior to that, on 22 September, the South African authorities suspended issue of export health certificates for live animals, animal products and genetic material from the affected areas, thereby effectively preventing exports.

 Each third country Border Inspection Post (BIP) is under the authority of an official veterinarian who is responsible for carrying out veterinary checks on imports of live animals and animal products. One or more veterinary staff work at BIPs at any one time, according to workload. Checks at live animal BIPs are carried out by State Veterinary Service veterinary staff, assisted by technical and administrative staff from the local Animal Health Divisional Office. Checks at product BIPs are the responsibility of local authorities who employ the necessary veterinarians and support staff.

<a name="10427w02.html_para3">In developing countries my Department provides capacity-building assistance to Governments and institutions to help them monitor logging and enforce forestry laws. For example, last year we initiated a &#163;25 million project in Indonesia which will, among other things, help civil society groups and reformers in the Government tackle the illegal logging problem in their country. We are also co-sponsoring, with the World Bank and other donors, a ministerial-level East Asia Forest Law Enforcement Conference later this year.

 There are indications that there may be food deficits in some parts of Sudan this year. We are monitoring the situation closely, both from London and through our DFID representative at the British Embassy in Khartoum. In terms of the specific areas mentioned, UN assessments have suggested that there may be food deficits emerging as a result of variable agro-climatic conditions, compounded by security related to disruptions to production.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> Fire Service Study 2000 has been developed with full Fire Service and Trade Union consultation and support. In addition, one of the two new working groups currently being formed to handle the final stages of the study will include full Trade Union representation.
<P>

<a name="10427w03.html_para0">The plan to seek bids for airfield support services, which includes the capability currently provided by the Defence Fire Service, is covered by the Airfield Support Services Project (ASSP). This project is looking at the viability of a PFI/PPP solution for the provision of airfield support services to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) world-wide. MOD Trades Unions were consulted in December 1996 on the proposals for a Feasibility Study and again in February 1998 following the outcome of the study. Further meetings were held between Project staff and the TGWU on 29 April 1999 and 17 November 1999. The most recent pan-Trades Unions meeting took place at RAF Brampton on 10 November 2000. Formal consultation on the proposals for the next stage of the process was initiated on 18 April 2001.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> The Government are committed to seeking value for money through Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) by involving private sector management expertise, innovation and capital investment in the delivery of services to the public sector. Against this background, a feasibility study, commissioned in 1995, reported in 1997 that there was significant private sector interest in providing airfield support services and that the private sector had the necessary expertise and ability to provide it.




<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 2001 : Column: 414W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10427w03.html_para1">Further work has established a good case that PFI/PPP arrangements have the potential to provide the Ministry of Defence's requirement for airfield support services, which includes the service provided by the Defence Fire Services, at the greatest value for money. In the light of this, ministerial approval was given in early April 2001 to issue Invitations To Negotiate (ITN) seeking proposals from three Consortia for PFI/PPP solutions for airfield support services.
<P>

<a name="10427w03.html_para2">The ITN will seek bids for both a 15 and 25-year solution and the service provision will be specified in output terms. Bidders will be required to examine the feasibility of the employment of Sponsored Reserves within the project. Bids will be required to demonstrate value for money and provide the manpower and equipment to maintain the required operational capability.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence plans to issue, in July, Invitations to Negotiate (ITN) seeking binding proposals from three consortia for Private Finance Initiative/Public Private Partnering (PFI/PPP) solutions for airfield support services. The PFI/PPP process follows a well-established system and would not always involve announcements to the House, particularly at this early stage of the PFI process.

 CR was first authorised for use by British forces in October 1968, although authorisation for its use in Northern Ireland, in special circumstances only, was not given until October 1973. Strict guidelines govern both deployment and use of CR.
<P>

<a name="10427w03.html_para3">In 1973 CR was available both in aerosol from and for use in water cannon. Subsequently, a wheeled dispenser was introduced in December 1974, a vehicle-based version was deployed in 1976, and a projectile delivery device was authorised for use in 1977.

 Screening for osteoporosis was considered by the United Kingdom national screening committee (NSC) in June 1999. The NSC recommended that screening should not be offered as there was no simple, reliable test for osteoporosis that would meet its criteria for a screening programme. At present there is a comprehensive approach for the prevention and treatment of this disease (hormone replacement therapy, diet, exercise and the use of specific drugs) which can be directed towards the general population.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> BCG vaccine has been in limited supply for some time due to severe manufacturing problems encountered by the sole United Kingdom licensed source. As a result, we had no alternative but to request that health authorities suspend their routine schools immunisation programme for 10 to 14-year-olds from September 1999. This allowed us to maintain supplies of the vaccine for all those at a higher risk of tuberculosis (TB).
<P>

<a name="10427w04.html_para0">In July 2000, we advised that there was a sufficient supply of vaccine to initially restart the routine schools programme in the London area, where the highest rate of TB in the country currently occurs, in addition to the continued use for those in higher risk categories.
<P>

<a name="10427w04.html_para1">On 24 March, we announced that the routine schools BCG programme could begin again in schools across the country.
<P>

<a name="10427w04.html_para2">The 1994-95 school BCG programme was delayed in some areas because of the measles/rubella campaign.

[159484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I have made no such estimate. Our draft Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2001 are designed to benefit recruitment agencies, employment businesses, their clients and those seeking employment through them. They will remove unnecessary restrictions on organisations in the recruitment industry, including the IT sector, and the services they can offer, while protecting the interests of work seekers and vulnerable groups. I recognise that the IT sector plays an increasingly important role in the recruitment industry.

The Foreign Secretary spoke to Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on 21 and 28 March, and to Nabil Sha'ath on 27 March.

This has been sent to all States Parties and will come under discussion at the next negotiating session which begins in Geneva on 23 April. The UK has played a leading role throughout these negotiations as we have had responsibility for the section of the text on compliance measures--the core of the future Protocol. We welcome the appearance of the text and are currently assessing its overall content. A successful outcome by the time of the BWC Review Conference remains a possibility but will depend upon the reaction to the text from all countries involved over the coming months.

 The Government's policy on recycling is set out in Waste Strategy 2000, published last May. We have now set statutory performance standards for each local authority under the best value regime which will triple the recycling of household waste to 25 per cent. in 2005-06 and announced in last year's spending review significant extra funding for local authorities to help meet those targets. In Waste Strategy 2000, the Government also set a target of reducing the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill by 2005, to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998.
<P>

<a name="10427w07.html_para1">We continue to implement EC legislation and voluntary agreements on producer responsibility on a range of materials including packaging. The landfill tax will continue to rise and the aggregates levy will come into force in April 2002, both of which provide incentives to find alternative uses for materials.

 Such decisions are matters for Railtrack. However, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) will consider better access to the network, particularly for those with disabilities, when assessing bids for replacement franchises.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what powers are available to local authorities to use their planning powers to specify the tenure of housing in a new development; what plans he has to review those powers; and if he will make a statement.  [159430]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government's policy on planning for affordable housing is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3: "Housing" and Circular 6/98, "Planning and Affordable Housing". This states that planning policy should not be expressed in favour of any particular form of tenure and that the term "affordable housing" encompasses both low-cost market and subsidised social housing. Based on their own assessments of need in their area, and development plan policies which state their intention to seek an element of affordable housing in suitable developments, local planning authorities may negotiate with developers for the types of affordable housing that will best meet local housing needs. We have no plans at present to revise the guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many claims have been made to the Vaccine Damage Payment scheme in each of the last five years; and how much compensation has been paid by the scheme since June 2000.  [158459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Vaccine Damage Payment (VDP) scheme, which has been in place since 1979, provides a one-off payment to people severely disabled as a result of vaccination against certain diseases. The scheme is not intended as compensation but is designed to ease the burdens of those suffering from vaccine damage and their families.
<P>

<a name="10427w07.html_para3">The number of claims to the scheme in each of the last five years is in the table. On 27 June 2000 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced an increase in the VDP for new cases from &#163;40,000 to &#163;100,000 as well as other enhancements to the scheme. This included top-up payments to all existing cases so that they are put on an equal footing in real terms with new claimants. 825 such payments have been made totalling &#163;55.7 million. Since June 2000, one new award has been approved and is awaiting payment of &#163;100,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will set out his Department's policy in relation to the application of a cap on rebates to appropriate personal pensions from 2002 onwards.  [159396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Age-related rebates to appropriate personal pensions are capped for two reasons. First, the cap restricts the cost to public funds. Secondly, the cap also discourages those approaching pensionable age from making what could be inappropriate pension arrangements, given the short amount of time they would have to benefit from investment growth in a money purchase scheme.
<P>

<a name="10427w07.html_para4">We have increased the cap which will apply to age-related rebates in respect of earnings from April 2002, so that all those who are currently unaffected by the cap (that is those who will be up to age 50 in April 2002) will remain unaffected by it.

<BR>
At times of contract procurement and subsequent re-competition, it was CCTA's practice to issue as much information as possible to potential bidders about the actual or potential users of the schemes, the nature of the goods and services which may be procured through them and the total annual value of orders that are likely to be placed. Neither the existing procurement directives nor the EC's draft proposals on framework contracts specifically require individual users of such contracts to place information about their orders through the OJEC procedure (though some may do so voluntarily). However, CCTA expected individual users of GCat and S-CAT to comply with the obligations placed on them by open government policies/legislation (e.g. the Code of Practice on Access to Official Information and the Freedom of Information Act 2000) as appropriate.
<BR>
Details of the rationale for using framework contracts and catalogues for routine purchases are contained in the Comprehensive Spending Review of Efficiency in Civil Government Procurement Expenditure issued in April 1998, and the case for greater co-ordination and aggregation of Government spending is contained in the Gershon Review of Civil Procurement in Central Government issued in April 1999. I assume that copies of these reports are already available through the H of C Library.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what forecast he has made of annual Exchequer revenues deriving from climate change levy to be paid by the hotel and restaurant industry.  [159382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 It is not possible to say what the precise effect of the levy will be on any one particular industry. The impact of the levy and the associated reduction in NICs will depend on a number of factors, including: the future energy consumption by firms; the level of employment in those firms; what use they make of electricity generated from 'new' renewable sources of energy; and the extent to which they take advantage of the proposed introduction of a system of enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments. The hotel and restaurant industry stands to benefit from the exemption of electricity generated from 'good quality' combined heat and power plants.

 An Inland Revenue Press Release published on 29 September 2000 provided details of the letter which was issued throughout October 2000 to around 250,000 women who had previously elected to pay reduced rate National Insurance contributions. The letter informed them of changes to the structure of employee National Insurance contributions introduced from April 2000 and advised them to consider their elections in light of these changes but taking into account their own particular circumstances. A dedicated helpline was set up to provide further information and assistance and some 63,000 telephone inquiries were received.

[158919]<P>

 Asylum seekers are eligible for free treatment by a General Practitioner (GP) and hospital care on the same basis as anyone else eligible to receive National Health Service treatment.

<a name="10427w09.html_para0">The National Asylum Support Service is responsible for destitute asylum seekers and, where they give consent, is able to pass their names and addresses on to the health authority responsible for the area to which they are dispersed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10427w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The projected cost of the Warnings Index Redevelopment Project has risen to allow for additional terminals at ports and Immigration Service offices as part of the expansion of Immigration and Nationality Directorate. While there has been delay to the date of expected completion of redevelopment, this has not added to expected payments from Home Office to ICL as it is a fixed price contract.
<P>

<a name="10427w09.html_para1">The original cost estimate for Information System/Information Technology (IS/IT) for the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) was &#163;6 million in 1999-2000 and 2000-01, for a 'day one' system when NASS started on 1 April 2000 and subsequent enhancements.
