<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60317w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No birds in the UK have been vaccinated against avian influenza. Although vaccination offers potential disease control benefits, at the current level of risk, available vaccines are too limited to provide a fully effective or efficient solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60317w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In the event of an avian influenza outbreak, we would control the disease by culling all birds on any infected premises and dangerous contacts. Depending on veterinary risk assessment advice, additional strategies could include a cull of flocks in the immediate area to prevent the spread of disease. These arrangements are described in Defra&#039;s published Animal Disease Contingency Plan.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of <i>(a)</i> cetacean strandings and <i>(b)</i> cetacean by-catch (i) inside and (ii) outside the 12 mile zone following the 12 mile fair trawl prohibition.  [28004]</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60317w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11 November 2005]:</i> We have recently published on the Defra website a report on Defra-funded research conducted by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) on by-catch observations and mitigation work in the UK bass pair trawl fishery. A copy of this report will also be placed in the Library of the House. Since the introduction of the 12 mile pair trawl prohibition, no pair trawl activity has taken place within-12 miles. As the SMRU report outlines, common dolphin by-catch in this fishery has reduced from 429 animals in the 2003&#150;04 season to 139 in the 2004&#150;05 season.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60317w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">In addition, we have in place observer schemes to monitor by-catch in other fisheries which may be responsible for by-catch both inside and outside 12 miles. The first report from this work also being conducted on our behalf by SMRU is due in spring 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60317w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Strandings data is obtained under the Defra-funded Cetacean and Turtle Strandings Scheme, carried out by the Natural History Museum in partnership with the Institute of Zoology and Scottish Agricultural College. Cetacean strandings have shown a steep decline this year in the area covered by the 12 mile pair trawl prohibition. Between 1 January and 18 July 2005, there were 68 common dolphin strandings in Cornwall, Devon and Dorset compared with 178 for the same period in 2004.

 Under the existing Eurocontrol Multilateral Agreement for Route Charges, the United Kingdom has exempted all military flights flown in UK airspace.

However, as a result of the SES Implementing Regulation, where a member state chooses to exempt a class of aircraft, the state is responsible for reimbursing the air navigation service provider for the service they provide.

Notes:<br>

1.Personal dental service (PDS) schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding general dental service (GDS) data, PDS registrations are estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15 months. There will be a break in the registrations series at the point at which PDS schemes were introduced as the proxy registrations build up. Falls in registration rates will be particularly pronounced in the financial year 2004&#150;05, when the majority of PDS schemes were introduced.<br>

2.Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations, for example, dental access centres, and is therefore not directly comparable with 2004 and 2005 data.<br>

Notes (general):<br>

Finished admission episodes<br>

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episodes statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is, the data is ungrossed.<br>

Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality<br>

PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT and general practitioner (GP) practices and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 DFID has not provided direct assistance to the education sector in Afghanistan, with the exception of very limited support (&#163;47,000) for primary education of refugees in 2001&#150;02.

Since 2002&#150;03 the operating budget for education as a whole has risen by 250 per cent.. Overall civil service numbers have remained stable, but there has been a major increase in the number of teachers, who constitute one of the largest portions of the civil service. DFID&#039;s contribution to the ARTF, to which we are the biggest donor, has thus played a big part in increasing the number of children in school since 2002.

The UK is therefore also supporting the education sector in Afghanistan through its contributions to multilateral agencies. Through donor support to the education sector, over a thousand schools have been built or rehabilitated since 2001, which has enabled the enrolment of 5.6 million children, 37 per cent. of them girls.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister strongly encourages local authorities to establish rent deposit schemes and did fund the National Rent Deposit Forum (NRDF) in 2005&#150;06 to enable the Forum time to develop an on-going strategy to sustain the organisation. Officials have also met with the NRDF and provided advice on possible ways forward, for example merging with other homeless charities, generating additional income and /or extending its membership base. I understand however that the NRDF has decided to close. This is a time when the number of rent deposit schemes has increased and been mainstreamed within housing advice and homelessness prevention. Recent local authority homelessness survey returns summarised in Survey of English Local Authorities About Homelessness Policy Briefing 13&quot; which is available on the ODPM website showed that 87 per cent. of responding local authorities have established rent deposit/bond schemes as part of their homelessness prevention services. It is unfortunate that as a membership organisation that should exist on the basis of services it offers to members the NRDF was not able to benefit from the increase in rent deposit schemes.

Local planning authorities themselves are expected to plan for land uses that are appropriate in the light of all the

relevant circumstances, including known or suspected contamination and, when determining planning applications, be satisfied that the site concerned is suitable for the new use and that the development does not create unacceptable risks. Planning conditions may require that land is remediated in the course of development to an appropriate standard, taking account of its intended use, and that, if necessary, is properly maintained subsequently. The Environment Agency is likely to be consulted on the redevelopment of former landfill sites and may require specific applications for authorisations within the pollution control framework it operates. The Building Regulations 2000 include requirements to protect buildings from the effects of contamination.

 In 1998 when the Patten Commission was conducting its investigation, only 8.3 per cent. of regular officers were from the Roman Catholic community. In less than five years under the temporary 50:50 provisions Catholic composition among regular officers has risen to 19.45 per cent. with 2,172 recruits having been selected for appointment on a 50:50 basis. In the same time female composition has also risen from 13 per cent. to 20.21 per cent. Our goal is to increase Catholic representation to 30 per cent. by 2010&#150;11; the date envisaged by Patten to achieve this aim. I am pleased to say that we are very much on target to reach this goal with a further interim target of 23.5 per cent. set for March 2008.

It has varied between competitions, but has included press, television, billboard, cinema and online advertising, all designed to reach groups currently under-represented in the police service. The responses from all communities have been extremely positive and the results have exceeded expectations. In an effort to adapt the volume of applicants to the number of recruits that can actually be appointed to training, television advertising has now been eliminated, and the number of press insertions reduced.

Section 47 of the 2000 Act was last renewed by the Police (NI) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2004 allowing for their continuation until 28 March 2007.

 Since 1997, the Government have placed an increasing emphasis on addressing the causesand effects of offending behaviour. The 1998 comprehensive spending review (CSR) provided the first large scale, discrete investment in prison regimes, to allow prisoners to address offending behaviour and helpwith rehabilitation. This has been reinforced in subsequent spending reviews. Since 2002, partnerships with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, which have transferred the budgets and policy responsibility from the Prison Service, have put provision of prisoners&#039; health care and education on a par with that of the rest of society, to ensure equality and continuity of care and opportunity inside and outside of prison.

The Youth Justice Board (also established as one of the outcomes of the 1998 CSR) has concentrated resources and efforts across the criminal justice system to help address the specific issues and problems associated with juveniles in a positive and constructive way. The new commissioning arrangements currently being designed and implemented in the new National Offender Management System, will allow regional offenders managers to similarly positively address the issues of adult offenders, both in custody and when held under community sentences.

 The Government are wholly committed to reducing inequalities experienced by people because of their race. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act requires all Government Departments to publish Race Equality Schemes which lay out how they will incorporate measures to tackle inequalities as part of their policy development and service delivery. Individual departments, with whom responsibility for complying with the duties lies, are currently carrying out a detailed assessment of their own compliance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the safer cells programme.  [57763]</p>








<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60317w29.html_spnew5"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The continued introduction of safer cells across the prisons estate is based on a policy set out in December 2003 by the Prison Service Investment Board (PSIB). This states that for new accommodation in existing public prison establishments, all Category A, Category B and local prisons would be fitted 100 per cent. with full specification safer cells; Category C prison establishments would be fitted 25 per cent. with full specification safer cells; while RTUs (&#039;ready to use&#039;) and MTUs (modular temporary units) would not generally be fitted with full specification safer cells and risks would be managed operationally. The PSIB further agreed that, for refurbished accommodation in local prison establishments, consideration should always be given to include safer cell provision in all business cases commissioned by the Estates Planning Committee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60317w29.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_213">Some issues around ventilation in safer cells were raised during the independent evaluation of safer cells, carried out by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science in 2003, as a result of which the Prison Service has developed an alternative safer ventilator design. The evaluation concluded that safer cells have much to commend them. Three prisoners stated to evaluators that being in a safer cell had prevented them from killing themselves.
