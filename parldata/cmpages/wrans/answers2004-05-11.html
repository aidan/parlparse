<a name="40511w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Department Annual Report</h3>





<p><a name="40511w01.html_wqn0"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 To ask the Leader of the House how much the production of his Office&#039;s latest annual report cost; how many copies were printed; how many copies of it were sold at its cover price; to whom copies of the report have been provided free of charge; and how many copies were provided free of charge.  [171151]</p>








<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My office does not produce an annual report. Its functions are included in the Privy Council Office&#039;s Departmental Report, details of which can be found on the Department&#039;s website (www.privy-council.co.uk/output/page40.asp).

<p><a name="40511w01.html_wqn1"><b> Michael Fabricant: </b> 
 To ask the Leader of the House what percentage of the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;crockery, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cutlery and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;glassware procured by his Office over the last five years is of British manufacture.  [170804]</p>








<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The Office of the Leader of the House of Commons was established in June 2003. Since then only a small amount of crockery and glassware has been purchased, and no cutlery. All the crockery was of British manufacture.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w01.html_para0">
In line with current Government policy the decision to purchase goods for the Office is taken on value for money grounds: restricting purchases to British-only goods would not necessarily achieve this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w01.html_para1">
As a trading nation the UK has commitments under both EC and WTO procurement rules to ensure our access to export markets, and a &#039;Buy-British&#039; policy would make UK companies less competitive by closing down likely export markets. One of the five principles underlying the EC Treaty is one of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality and this would also exclude a &#039;Buy-British&#039; policy. In these days of global markets it is increasingly difficult to determine whether goods are British.

<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Government has already taken steps in respect of the financial assistance payable to Sinn Fein and the PUP, in line with the recommendation of the Independent Monitoring Commission. The IMC&#039;s recommendations made no mention of parliamentary facilities. We hope the next report on paramilitary 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2004 : Column 196W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 To ask the Leader of the House how much has been paid to Sinn Fein since the decision by the House to pay allowances to Sinn Fein hon. Members who have not taken the oath.  [171739]</p>








<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Since 8&nbsp;January 2002, Sinn Fein Members have been able to claim against the incidental expenses provision, staffing allowance and additional costs allowance. They can also claim certain free travel for themselves, their families and their staff; they can use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centrally-provided computer equipment on loan without charge, and they can draw on centrally purchased stationery.

<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We are working with the UN Secretary-General&#039;s High Level Panel to improve the UN response to all threats to global and human security. The UN&#039;s International Tribunals and the International Criminal Court have shown that there is no impunity for the perpetrators of crimes against humanity. We also need to do more to develop an international consensus in favour of humanitarian intervention where it is justified.

<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The UK welcomes Prime Minister Sharon&#039;s proposed withdrawal of all settlements from Gaza and four from the West Bank. We hope it will go ahead. As the Prime Minister said on 19&nbsp;April, it is a statement of fact that final status negotiations cannot ignore the reality on the ground. But all final status issues, including borders and refugees, can be decided only by negotiations between the parties.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on bilateral relations with Iran.  [171843]</p>








<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 Our policy towards Iran is one of constructive but critical engagement. We aim to support Iran&#039;s efforts to reform while continuing a robust dialogue on matters of concern such as Iran&#039;s nuclear programme, human rights record, and attitude to the fight on terrorism and the Middle East Peace Process. Ministers are in close contact with Iranian leaders on all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these issues of concern; I last met my Iranian counterpart in London on 22&nbsp;April.


</p>







<p>17. <a name="40511w01.html_wqn8"><b> Julie Morgan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what support he has offered to President Khatami to reduce use of torture and repression in Iran.  [171845]</p>








<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We remain seriously concerned at human rights violations in Iran, including the alleged use of torture. We welcome the statement by the head of the Iranian judiciary on 28&nbsp;April that torture is forbidden and that confessions extracted through torture are not legal. We hope this will be reflected in practice throughout Iran. Ministers have raised human rights concerns with their Iranian counterparts bilaterally on many occasions and we have done so through the EU/Iran Human Rights dialogue. The EU has made clear that its relations with Iran can move forward only if Iran takes action to address our concerns in areas such as human rights.

 We respect the outcome of both referendums and the right of the Greek Cypriots to say &quot;no&quot;. However, we hope they will take time to reflect on the decision they made and consider whether it was the right one.

<p>
<a name="40511w01.html_para3">
The reunification of Cyprus remains the Government&#039;s objective. But there is no immediate prospect of a resumption of talks. We await the UN Secretary General&#039;s report on his Good Offices mission to Cyprus, which we expect later this month.

<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The Foreign Secretary has discussed the political transition process with Ambassador Bremer during his visits to Baghdad, but the handing over of sovereignty to the Iraqi Governing Council has never been coalition policy. The coalition is committed to handing over sovereignty on 30&nbsp;June to an Iraqi Interim Government, whose structure and composition will be decided by the UN Secretary-General&#039;s Special Adviser, Lakhdar Brahimi after consultation with a wide range of Iraqis.

<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The most recent published findings of the Iraq Survey Group were contained in the report of the leader of the Group, Charles Duelfer, on 30&nbsp;March, a copy of the unclassified version of which was placed in the Library of the House. There is nothing that I can add to the Written Statement made by my right hon.

<p><a name="40511w01.html_wqn13"><b> Mr. Best: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress has been made with investigations into Iraq&#039;s mass graves following the recommendations of the UK forensic team which visited Iraq last summer.  [167870]</p>








<p><a name="40511w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 Since the recommendations were made the UK has seconded four UK forensic experts to the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) who have been leading CPA efforts on mass graves. A Mass Grave Action Plan has been produced, which details how to deal with the hundreds of reported mass grave sites. A centralised system for reporting potential sites has been set up in co-ordination with the Human Rights Ministry. Around a quarter of reported sites have been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessed. Training seminars have been held in anthropology, archaeology, surveying, crime scene management and scene searching to build Iraqi capacity to undertake mass grave exhumations. A full equipment list for exhumations has been completed and equipment is on order. In addition, the Government has funded a forensic NGO, Inforce, to produce standard protocols and operating procedures to enable Iraqis and international teams to undertake this work to the same standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w01.html_para4">
Unfortunately, the mobility of the forensic team was severely restricted by the upsurge in violence and kidnappings in Iraq in early April. Security problems have been a major hindrance to them in doing their jobs, which include an unusually high level of travel outside of Baghdad. We have therefore withdrawn them temporarily from Iraq. The forensic team will be able to continue some of this work from outside Iraq. We hope they and other teams will be able to resume work on mass grave sites in Iraq shortly.

<p>
<a name="40511w02.html_para3">
While the Government have actively encouraged, and worked towards, the development of a partnership approach between the various agencies and organisations which deal with tackling child abuse on the internet in the UK, how this issue is dealt with by other jurisdictions is a matter for each individual country to consider. The Government have promoted the success of multi agency co-operation to tackle child abuse on the internet, using examples such as the Task Force on child protection on the internet, in speeches, at conferences, in the international fora it operates within, through ministerial and officials&#039; visits overseas, and to the many visitors it receives with a relevant interest in this issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w02.html_para4">
There are a variety of mechanisms to assist in furthering international co-operation between law enforcement agencies on this issue. This may be through the provision of equipment and training to overseas law enforcement by UK agencies, or by the development and hosting of specialist training courses or conferences. For example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and National Crime Squad recently co-funded a conference for international law enforcement experts, NGOs and officials concerning child abuse and the internet. The National Crime Squad is also engaged in a global initiative with partner countries currently comprising Canada, USA, Australia and Interpol which seeks to establish new and imaginative ways of combating and reducing child abuse on line, seeking to produce a virtual police presence which will ultimately make the internet a safer place.

A problem for all law enforcement agencies is the identification of children featured in child abuse images.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the deprivation indicators for the electoral&nbsp;wards in the City of Newcastle as designated in 2003.  [171157]</p>








<p><a name="40511w05.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 There are 37 indicators underpinning the Index of Multiple Deprivation. These fall into seven&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate dimensions of deprivation (income, employment, health, education, barriers to housing and services, crime and living environment). Further details on these indicators can be found in the full report on the Indices of Deprivation 2004, which is available at www.odpm.gov.uk/indices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w05.html_para1">
While the Indices of Deprivation 2000 was produced at ward level, the new Indices&#151;The Indices of Deprivation 2004&#151;have been produced at Super Output Area, lower layer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w05.html_para2">
A decision was taken to explore another base geography for the Indices to overcome the problems associated with frequent ward boundary changes and the inconsistency in the size of wards. This new base geography is intended to be more stable over time and more consistent in size. The decision to use Super Output Areas was taken after an extensive period of consultation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w05.html_para3">
Super Output Areas cover between 1000 and 3000 people and are, in most cases, smaller than wards. They allow us to better identify small pockets of deprivation and provide a richer picture of local variations in deprivation. They will also help to ensure that the Government continues to focus its efforts on tackling disadvantage at those areas most in need.

 The research and development activities undertaken at AWE are designed to ensure the safe stewardship of the UK&#039;s stockpile of Trident warheads and our ability to maintain the capability necessary to meet the policy described in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. As indicated in Paragraph 3.11 of the Defence White Paper of December 2003 (Cm 6041&#150;1), this includes the need to take appropriate steps to ensure that the range of options for maintaining a nuclear deterrent capability is kept open until decisions are required on whether to replace Trident. This policy is consistent with our international treaty obligations. Research and development activities fall under four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principal headings: computer simulation; hydrodynamics; high energy density plasma physics; and materials ageing.

<p><a name="40511w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 All food for use by the armed forces is sourced through a central food supply contract with a bespoke price list. Sea bass is not currently listed and is not supplied under the contract.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2004 : Column 218W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w07.html_para0">
Defra supports the sourcing of sea bass from sustainable fisheries and handlining, as an relatively low impact method of fishing, can play a part in ensuring fisheries remain sustainable. However, the last report in 2003 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas on sea bass advised that the level of exploitation of the stock at that time was sustainable and did not recommend closure of the offshore pair trawl fishery. There are currently no restrictions at a United Kingdom or Community level on the method of fishing that can be used to target bass. In addition, to address the dolphin bycatch problem associated with the pair trawl fisher, Defra-funded trials of a separate grid device to reduce dolphin bycatch are currently taking place, with the co-operation of the fishing industry.

<p><a name="40511w08.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 No. A significant proportion of the Department&#039;s IT provision has been outsourced in recent years as part of wider initiatives to make greater use of the private sector in the provision of public services. The Department&#039;s policy is that when services already delivered under outsourcing arrangements are re-competed or rationalised, in-house bids should not normally be invited because the associated requirement for substantial reinvestment in management, training and support systems makes it unlikely that an in-house option would represent value for money. Where no in-house bid is invited, an estimate of the costs of a public sector option or a &quot;status quo&quot; option would normally be made, in order to provide a value for money benchmark.

<p><a name="40511w08.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) requirements are defined in terms of aircraft performance, which is the product of many factors, including weight, drag, and engine thrust. At current engine thrust and drag values, the Short Take Off/Vertical Landing variant of the JSF is some 3300 lbs overweight to meet its stipulated overall performance levels. Work is in hand in the United States to examine options to ensure that the overall performance requirements are met, addressing all possible options including a significant reduction in aircraft weight. This work will not mature in detail until early 2005, although an interim assessment of likely outcome in summer 2004 will enable performance against the United Kingdom&#039;s Key User Requirements to be preliminarily evaluated at that time.

Recent press comment has focused on speculation concerning the Royal Marines. Morale in the Royal Marines remains very good. The Royal Marines continue, as is usual, to focus on their professional preparations for a full range of training and operations. Media speculation does however, have a considerable impact on the morale of young Service families, particularly, as happened on this occasion, when wives and children are accosted by journalists outside schools.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers preventing racial harassment have been introduced since 1997; and how many times these powers have been used in Sittingbourne and Sheppey.  [170457]</p>








<p><a name="40511w12.html_spnew0"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Prior to 1997 the Race Relations Act (RRA) 1976 already prohibited discrimination on racial grounds. The RRA did not specifically refer to harassment, but it was clear from case law that racial harassment was a type of detriment capable of amounting to the kind of less favourable treatment prohibited by the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w12.html_para0">
As part of its fulfilment of its obligations under the EC Race Directive the UK amended the Race Relations Act 1976 (by virtue of the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003) so as to make it unlawful to harass a person, on grounds of race or ethnic or national origins, in the areas of activity covered by the 1976 Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w12.html_para1">
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created new and separate offences where the offences of causing fear and violence or of causing harassment, alarm or distress under the Public Order Act 1986, or the offences of harassment or putting in fear of violence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 were racially aggravated.

 When use of a mobile phone while driving amounts to some other offence, such as failing to exercise proper control, it has always been enforced as that. Such enforcement will continue when appropriate. The specific new offence of using a hand-held mobile phone while driving is designed to provide a simple, objective method of enforcement and prosecution, which does not depend in the same way on judgments of a driver&#039;s degree of control of a vehicle or carelessness. The Association of Chief Police Officers have welcomed it as such. How offences are enforced is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police.

However, if the issue requires the ACMD&#039;s consideration it can be raised as an agenda item at either the full Council meeting of the ACMD or at the meeting of the ACMD&#039;s Technical Committee. Previously, the ACMD have acted on this issue as highlighted through its recommendation that Gammahydroxybutrate (GHB), which is viewed as a &#039;date rape&#039; drug be made a controlled drug under Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Furthermore, under s.61 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 it is an offence to administer a substance with the aim of stupefying/overpowering a person to engage in sexual activity.

<p><a name="40511w13.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Girls&#039; education and school attendance in Nepal is a serious challenge. Around 25&nbsp;per cent. of girls of primary school age are out of school, and only 3.25&nbsp;per cent. of fully trained teachers are female. With other donors, DFID is planning to help the Government implement their Education for All basic and primary education programme. The main aim of the programme will be get an additional 477,000

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what study he has made of the role of children in Haiti in highlighting domestic violence.  [171700]</p>








<p><a name="40511w13.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 While DFID has itself made no study of the role of children and domestic violence in Haiti, the UK Government welcome the concern expressed for the countries 2.7&nbsp;million children. Haitian children have seen their standards of health, education and protection, already among the lowest in the world, drop even further following the violent events earlier this year. The prevailing insecurity in Haiti continues to make children especially vulnerable to abuse and violence within the community and family structure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para1">
In recognition of this, the UK has provided &#163;500,000 in support of the United Nations Children&#039;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), as part of a &#163;1.9&nbsp;million emergency assistance package approved in April. This is in addition to funds channelled through the EC for emergency assistance to the Haitian population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para2">
UNICEF&#039;s primary goal in Haiti, as elsewhere, is to protect and strengthen the rights of children. This is done through a series of activities tailored to local requirements, such as: awareness raising campaigns to discourage and prevent violence against children (particularly street children and domestic servants), the resumption of schooling and support to community groups for women and children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para3">
Given the evolving humanitarian situation, the UK has adopted a flexible approach with respect to its funding, enabling UNICEF to allocate UK resources to immediate priorities for children. In addition, the UK has ensured that its emergency strategy has informed and complemented that of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), for the benefit of Haitian communities.

DFID&#039;s Civil Society Challenge Fund has also funded a project (&#163;190,000, over five years) on Victims of Violence in Haiti which aims to support women through the constitution of a medical/psychological unit for victims of domestic violence.

 The problems facing Ethiopia are immense. Almost one-half of its 70&nbsp;million people live below the national poverty line.

<p><a name="40511w13.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID&#039;s Public Service Agreement indicators for health in Africa are linked to internationally agreed targets. DFID is one of a range of organisations which have made a commitment to these targets&#151;others include national governments, other bilaterals and multilaterals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para8">
Targets to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health are particularly ambitious and challenging for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Many countries are seriously off- track and on current trends neither of the goals will be met by 2015.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para9">
Child mortality has multiple and complex causes. Four diseases are responsible for nearly half of all child deaths, and malnutrition is an underlying cause for many of the rest. But other factors, such as economic decline, inequality, inadequate education for girls, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, and in some countries the HIV/AIDS epidemic plays a role too. Several African countries have also experienced conflict and civil unrest, which restrict progress in reducing child mortality rates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para10">
There has been little movement in rates of maternal mortality since 1990 and very recent progress is not easy to assess, due to lack of accurate data. Improving access to skilled care during delivery, and emergency obstetric care, where necessary, are key to reducing maternal mortality. The main constraints are weak and under-resourced health systems, in particular, the lack of appropriately skilled staff. Inadequate financing for health is a key constraint; current levels of spending in low-income African countries are way below what is needed to achieve the health targets. Addressing the broader determinants of poor health, and increasing health spend and the coverage and utilisation of interventions proven to reduce child and maternal mortality are both needed in order to make faster progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para11">
DFID is stepping up efforts to tackle the child and maternal health targets and is working with partners to make progress on increasing access to effective health services, including comprehensive reproductive health services, particularly for poor people. DFID is working to tackle the shortage of skilled health workers and also contributes to interventions in other sectors: education, transport, and sanitation, which are also needed to bring improvements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w13.html_para12">
Effective action requires, above all, political will to act. Great gains are likely when commitment to targets is translated into national poverty reduction strategies and budgets.

<p><a name="40511w15.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 A woman in Africa is over 100 times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than is a woman in a developed country. Many millions more suffer ill health and long-term disability as a result of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. We now know that almost all deaths as a result of pregnancy and childbirth are avoidable when proven health interventions are available and women are able to use them. Improved coverage of skilled care at delivery and access to emergency obstetric care when necessary are key to reducing maternal mortality. In addition, over a third of maternal deaths could be avoided if effective family planning services and affordable, safe, legal abortion services were available and accessible. At present the health systems in most Africa countries are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too weak and under-resourced to deliver these interventions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w15.html_para1">
The Department for International Development is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working with partners to identify and address constraints to progress with skilled attendance, and to support work to strengthen health systems that increase coverage and utilization of health services, including addressing issues such as human resource constraints and access to medicines.
</p>


<p>

In addition, in an increasing number of countries, DFID&#039;s health assistance is provided through sector budget support or indirectly through general budget support.

In relation to the provision of information, the Department has for some time run a comprehensive outreach programme of events where officials and judicial office holders explain the appointments process and answer any questions.

 Nuclear material unaccounted for (MUF) is a recognised feature of accounting for nuclear material and is caused primarily by the uncertainties inherent in the techniques used to measure nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) describes standards for the measurement uncertainty expected for closing a nuclear material balance in its Safeguards Glossary, and it publishes International Target Values (ITV) for uncertainties on measurements performed on nuclear material. These are used to determine whether a facility&#039;s measurement system meets international standards and are periodically updated by international experts to reflect currently achievable measurement capabilities and to incorporate newly developed measurement techniques and instruments. The values currently used were set in 2000 and were published by the IAEA in April 2001 as a Safeguards Technical Report (STR-327). This report is available from the IAEA in hardcopy only.

<p><a name="40511w19.html_spnew1"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Specific research into the effects of late payment has not been carried out because this government has always recognised that late payment of debts can have serious effects on the cash flow of smaller companies, which is why we had a manifesto commitment to introduce a Late Payment Act to allow small businesses to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">claim interest on late payment from other business or public sector bodies, allow creditors to claim a fixed sum of compensation to cover debt recovery costs should late payment happen. Compensation entitlements are: &#163;40 for a debt of up to &#163;999.99, &#163;70 for a debt of between &#163;1,000 and &#163;9,999.99 and &#163;100 for amounts over &#163;10,000.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w19.html_para0">
This package of measures has had a positive effect on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;payment times. The Grant Thornton European Business Survey showed that the average time taken in the UK to settle accounts in 1997 was 49 days. By 2002 this had fallen to 41 days. By comparison, the average settlement time in our European neighbours was 50 days.

 Member states are required to report irregularities detected in their own resources, agriculture and structural funds budget sectors to the European Commission and to the European Anti-Fraud Office. These figures are reported every year in the Commission&#039;s annual &quot;Fight against Fraud&quot; report. Reported irregularities may include suspected fraud cases, but the Commission does not publish an estimate of fraud. Irregularities rose during 2002 mainly because the heavy audit activity required at the closure of the 1994&#150;1999 Structural Funds programming period led to the detection of a higher number of errors than is usually the case. Any money found to have been paid in error is normally recovered by the paying agency concerned.

 The Government strongly supports measures to reduce fraud against the Community budget. The European Anti-Fraud Office, which was an initiative of the Chancellor, is now up to complement and is doing a good job in tackling fraud, especially in cross-border cases which require investigations in several member states. The Government played an active part in negotiating the new Financial Regulation, a major reform which introduced new levels of accountability. Better financial control regulations in the Structural Funds, and simplification of agricultural payments will also reduce the opportunities for fraud.

<p class="tabletext">The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. There have been some changes in the underlying surveys and improvements in the methodology so caution is required when making direct comparisons between years.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The table shows, for the UK, for 1993 to 2002/03, average original income received by all households and for each income quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of households are estimated to lie. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Original income is defined as income before government intervention i.e. from sources such as earnings, occupational pensions and investments. It does not include cash benefits such as the State Retirement Pension, Incapacity benefit, Working Families Tax Credit, child benefit or housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="40511w25.html_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The IMD is being implemented across the EU and will come into force in the UK on 14&nbsp;January 2005. The Government has consulted widely on the regulatory regime, publishing a public consultation document including draft regulations and a draft regulatory impact assessment in October 2002. Officials attended a wide range of meetings, working groups and conferences to consult on implementation. The FSA has carried out extensive public consultation on its rules.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w25.html_para1">
In implementing the Directive the Government and the FSA have worked closely with the industry to design a regulatory regime that takes account of market practice, and does not load the industry and ultimately the consumer with unnecessary costs. Both the Government and the FSA have been concerned to minimise the impact on smaller firms and sole traders. The Government also largely implemented the exclusions permitted in the Directive for travel insurance sold as part of a package, and for extended warranties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w25.html_para2">
Application fees have been set by the FSA according to the volume of business that a firm undertakes, so are cheapest for the smaller firms. The FSA have developed an approach to authorisation that is as streamlined and straightforward as possible. In terms of the wider costs to firms, the FSA have published detailed cost benefit analyses, based on surveys of firms&#039; costs and asked for comment. Where these have revealed that the costs are thought to be disproportionate and/or under-estimated, the FSA have responded in their final decisions. The UK has the largest insurance industry in Europe. Implementing the IMD is a key step in completing the single market in financial services, and will enhance consumer protection in an important sector of financial business. The UK market for selling insurance is competitive with many players giving customers wide choice, and this will continue in the new regime. Already thousands of firms have applied to the FSA for authorisation for the new regime.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2004 : Column 278W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w25.html_para3">
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 set up the FSA as the single regulatory body for a range of financial services, including the regulation of insurance. The Government therefore decided the FSA, as the single financial services regulator, was the most appropriate body to regulate insurance mediation. For many firms this will simplify and streamline regulation compared to the alternative of a separate regulator for insurance mediation. Intermediaries selling a range of other financial services products, such as pensions, mortgages, or investments, as well as general insurance, will come under the FSA as a single regulator, minimising compliance costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40511w25.html_para4">
The Directive requires the regulation of a range of insurance mediation activities. The activities to be regulated are introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance; concluding contracts of insurance; and assisting in both the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim. The Directive applies to such activities in relation to contracts of insurance. The FSA application pack notes that shortened terms have been used in the pack in four instances. One of them is &quot;insurance business&quot; and refers to &quot;insurance mediation activity in respect of non-investment insurance contracts.&quot; Further details of the FSA&#039;s regulatory regime can be found on their website at www.fsa.gov.uk

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what assessment has been made of the average earnings of <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women in Hampshire. (171634)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Average earnings are estimated from the 2003 New Earnings Survey (NES) and are provided for full-time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period, by their place of work. This is the standard definition used for NES tables. The NES does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The 2003 NES estimates that the total average weekly earnings of full-time adult employees in Hampshire were &#163;549,10 for males and &#163;399.50 for females. Please note that these estimates relate to the administrative county of Hampshire, which excludes the unitary authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">More detailed information on earnings in each of these areas is available in the published tables from the 2003 NES. The relevant estimates can be found in table A22.5 for males and A23.4 for females, and are available on the National Statistics website at: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labour/NES2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Region/NES2003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Region.pdf</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The NES, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in Great Britain. It is a 1&nbsp;per cent. sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The New Earnings Survey publication criteria ensures that all estimates are undisclosive and of reliable quality. A number of estimates have been removed from the published tables for these reasons.</p>

By making a repayment electronically direct to a bank or building society account, the customer is able to have earlier use of the money than if a cheque had been sent through the post.

Friend the Secretary of State announced on 21&nbsp;April 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 21&#150;22, we have published the latest monthly pension credit progress report with information up to the end of March. The report, which is available in the Library, is accompanied by tables showing the number of pension credit households and corresponding individuals in each constituency in Great Britain.

<p>
<a name="40511w29.html_para10">
Children&#039;s Fund partnerships in 2003&#150;04 had an over-allocation built in to their budgets. This was to ensure that underspends built up in the programme overall would be used up. However, this has now resulted in a projected overspend in the programme. To keep the programme overall within its financial limits this year the Department for Education and Skills held a mid year review of expenditure. This identified underspends in the programme and as a result revised budgets were agreed to some partnerships for the remainder of 2003&#150;04. Decisions at the mid year review were revisited where they compromised partnerships&#039; ability to meet contractual obligations, or were likely to cause unplanned staff redundancy or premature closure of services.

As such, the allocation for the Newcastle-upon-Tyne partnership has been reduced from &#163;1.25&nbsp;million to &#163;1.215&nbsp;million.

 The primary purpose of the national health service cancer plan is to save more lives. Reducing waiting times is key to achieving this. The ultimate goal in the NHS Cancer Plan is to offer patients a maximum one-month wait from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment. Where patients wait longer, this should be because of the needs 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2004 : Column 308W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of the diagnostic process or their personal choice, not because of in-built delays in the system of care. We hope to achieve this goal by 2008. There is a series of milestones towards this goal: By 2005, there will be a maximum one-month wait from diagnosis to treatment for all cancers. By 2005, there will be a maximum two-month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for all cancers.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Lay summary&#151;</i>It is recognised that human embryonic stem cells offer a great potential for therapies for many diseases such as diabetes. These stem cells are derived from embryos which are created for in-vitro fertilisation treatment, but which are not suitable for treatment. If stem cell treatments are to reach their full potential we need to derive stem cell lines which are genetically similar to the recipient so they will not be rejected. This may require the application of techniques such as nuclear transfer and parthenogenic activation. Nuclear transfer involves the transfer of genetic material from adult skin cells to eggs which have had the cell&#039;s nucleus removed. Parthenogenic activation involves an egg being artificially stimulated by chemical or electronic means in order to make the egg start embryo development. The present application is to undertake some of the initial studies that are needed to understand methods that will develop this technology.</p>

<sup>(36)</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information for groups of patients not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) prior to 1999 is not available.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCA data covers all prescription items that were dispensed in the community in England. It does not include items dispensed in hospitals or private prescriptions.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information for groups of patients not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a 1 in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed in the community. The information for children and hence adults is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. To reflect this the figures have been rounded appropriately. (Figures over 100,000 are rounded to the nearest 10,000. Figures over a million are rounded to the nearest 100,000, and figures over 10&nbsp;million are rounded to the nearest million.) Rounding applies to exemption data only. The total number of SSRI prescriptions is an actual figure (not an estimate) and has not been rounded. The number of items dispensed to adults was estimated by subtracting the estimates for children from the total SSRI items. Hence, rounding also applies to the adults.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to rounding, the sum of the components may not equal the total items.<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data on exemption categories for SSRIs is only available from 1999. The exemption data for children and adults for 1999 and 2000 is not strictly comparable with data for 2001 onwards. Exemption data for children and adults from 2001 is based on a 1 in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. Exemption data for 1999 and 2000 is based on those dispensed by chemists and appliance contractors only and excludes those dispensed by dispensing doctors. No exemption figures for dispensing doctor for 1999 and 2000 are available but the figures presented are the best estimates of the total figure for children and adult prescriptions. This does not apply to the total number of SSRI prescription items&#151;data for all years includes all items dispensed in the community (including dispensing doctors).<br>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are defined here as children aged under 16 and young people in full-time education aged 16,17 or 18.<br>





6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption data is identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and relies on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case.<br>

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSRIs are defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) paragraph 4.3.3.<br>

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data in the table is in thousands.<br>

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of prescription item: Doctors write prescriptions on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>
