<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50613w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The new Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) was created on 18 April 2005. RCPO is accountable to the Attorney-General and responsible for the prosecution of HM Revenue and Customs cases in England and Wales. The director of RCPO, David Green QC, meets regularly with the Law Officers to discuss the work of the new department. These discussions cover matters of policy and strategy arising from new developments in the law, and also the progress of the department&#039;s most serious cases, including complex VAT frauds.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50613w01.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Corruption is a symptom of poor governance. DFID supports a range of governance reforms to tackle corruption, for example through programmes to improve public financial management and judicial and parliamentary oversight. DFID has also provided technical and financial support to dedicated anti-corruption commissions in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Malawi and Zambia. We are also working with our G8 partners to tackle corruption, for example through the G8 transparency initiative, which focuses particularly on budget and procurement reform. Nigeria is a pilot country.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50613w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 In December 2004, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that 700,000 people living in developing countries were receiving antiretroviral treatment for HIV compared to 400,000 in June 2004. Reductions in the prices of antiretroviral combination therapy have been a key element in this increase. Competition from generic versions of HIV drugs has been important in reducing drug prices, along with action by pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices for proprietary medicines. The UK supports the rights, consistent with international agreements on trade and intellectual property, of developing countries to make informed decisions on the purchase and use of generic HIV drugs to meet their treatment needs.

 UK foreign aid to Botswana between 1997 and 2003 was worth &#163;28.3 million, either channelled through bilateral aid or multilateral institutions such as the European Union, United Nations and the World Bank. DFID&#039;s programmes focused on capacity building and policy development in areas such as animal production and range management, support to civil society and HIV/AIDS. UK aid to Botswana has declined over time owing to DFID&#039;s commitment to give 90 per cent. of its bilateral aid to low income countries, with only 10 per cent. going to middle income countries like Botswana.

 DFID resources are not spent on direct counter-terrorism measures. Under the International Development Act (2002), development assistance must be used for the purpose of furthering sustainable development in countries outside of the UK or improving the welfare of the population of such countries.

Many of the structural factors that increase the risk of terrorism also matter for development: unmet political and economic aspirations, lack of jobs for skilled labour, weak states and poor governance. DFID support to poverty reduction, good governance, social inclusion and education in many poor countries helps to reduce the risk of terrorism.

 The UK Government are committed to the goal of 100 per cent. debt relief for poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. We continue to press for the rapid and full implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. This initiative is delivering real benefits to some of the world&#039;s poorest countries. To date, over $70 billion in debt relief is being provided to 27 countries, including 23 in Sub-Saharan Africa, reducing their debts by around two-thirds on average, and freeing up resources for spending on poverty reduction.

<a name="50613w03.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_18">The UK goes beyond the HIPC Initiative and writes off 100 per cent. of bilateral debts for HIPC countries and holds in trust any debt service payments received from HIPC countries that have not yet qualified for debt relief, to be returned for spending on poverty reduction once they qualify.

At present, many donors have joined the UK in providing 100 per cent. bilateral relief, but multilateral institutions currently provide relief at around half this level. The UK has therefore launched a major new initiative for relief of 100 per cent. multilateral debt. We have committed to pay our share (10 per cent.) of debt service payments owed to the most concessional lending arms of the World Bank and African Development Bank on behalf of eligible countries, and are lobbying other countries to join us in providing full relief. Canada (paying 4 per cent.) and the Netherlands (2.6 per cent.) have already announced that they will participate. We are also urging the IMF to consider options for financing its share of 100 per cent. relief.

 The Cotonou partnership agreement, signed in June 2000 between the European Union and the African Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP), foresees the negotiation of a series of World Trade Organisation (WTO) compatible trading arrangements between the parties&#151;Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). The Cotonou agreement also states that alternatives should be provided to ACP countries that do not want to join these EPAs with the EU. In any alternative, the ACP countries should receive no worse market access to the EU than their existing situation. The ACP have requested a review of alternatives to take place in 2006, rather than 2004 as anticipated in Cotonou. Since it is the EU that will have to present the alternative options, DFID will work with other UK Government Departments and the European Commission to ensure that alternatives are presented for any countries that do not want to be part of the EPAs.

<p>
<a name="50613w03.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_22">The primary alternative to EPAs is a reformed generalised system of preferences (GSP), a non-contractual trade arrangement which the EU already offers to all developing countries, not just the ACP.

As responsible nuclear submarine operators, the MOD keeps submarine and nuclear safety under continual review. This process identified a theoretical safety concern that potentially weakened the submarine safety justification for these vessels. It was decided that further work should be conducted to restore full confidence in the safety justification before these two submarines returned to normal operation. At no stage did this issue take the form of a fault or defect within these submarines and the decision to limit their operation was in line with the MOD&#039;s requirement to maintain the highest safety

 Studies have been carried out which attempt to relate the presence of roadside advertisements and other potential distractions to road accidents.

The placing of roadside advertising alongside the motorway but sited on private land is a matter for the local planning authorities.

One of the intentions behind the proposed changes is a reduction in the scope for abuse of postal votes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on permitted activities on land for which Single Farm Payments are made; and if she will take steps to classify paragliding and hang-gliding as permitted activities.  [2693]</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="50613w09.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight:  </b> 
The Department has issued guidance on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and non-agricultural use of land which balances the need for diversification opportunities with the necessity to abide by EU rules on eligibility of land under the Scheme. The guidance is built around the degree to which non-agricultural use impedes or is inconsistent with normal farming activities. It specifies that paragliding and hang-gliding events may take place on up to 28 days during the 10-month period that farmers must declare, for SPS payment purposes, that they have the required amount of eligible land at their disposal. In addition, such events may take place at any time during the remaining two months of the year. There is no restriction on individual paragliders and hang-gliders, though payment to the farmer will depend on observance of set cross-compliance conditions, which apply for the whole calendar year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the reasons are for the rule that any animal must be slaughtered within 48 hours of sale; if she will <i>(a)</i> extend this period by a further 24 hours over weekends and <i>(b)</i> include reference to lairage; and if she will make a statement.  [2876]</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="50613w09.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw:  </b> 
The 48 hour rule states that animals should be slaughtered within 48 hours of arrival at the slaughterhouse and not within 48 hours of sale. This rule was introduced on the basis of veterinary advice following the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001. It strikes a proportionate balance between the need to prevent potential disease spread and the ability of slaughterhouse operators to run their businesses efficiently. The veterinary risk remains unchanged, and therefore there are no proposals to amend the rule.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50613w09.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_55">The rules applicable to a lairage depend upon whether it is within or outside the slaughterhouse as licensed by the Meat Hygiene Service. If within then the lairage is considered as if part of the slaughterhouse. If not then the lairage is considered as if it were any other piece of agricultural land, in which case the rules for moving livestock applicable to such land apply.

 Negotiations on the draft Rural Development Regulation are expected to reach a conclusion at the Agriculture Council on 20&#150;22 June. We expect that an animal welfare measure will&#151;as now&#151;be among the options available to member states; although not as part of a combined agri-environment and animal welfare measure. The England Rural Development Programme has not made use of the option to make payments to farms in return for a voluntary commitment to apply higher standards of animal welfare. Decisions on whether to do so in future will be taken as part of the process of designing a successor Rural Development Programme, and will be taken in the light of responses to a consultation this autumn, and bearing in mind the importance of ensuring that legal animal welfare requirements are fully adhered to.

 The Government welcome these new guidelines, on which there has been extensive consultation.

Defra is committed to supporting the production of transport biofuels. They have potential for UK agriculture as they can be produced from mainstream crops and we are keen to develop such new market opportunities for farmers. We are working with the National Farmers Union, the Country Land and Business Association, biofuel trade associations, individual farmers and companies to develop markets and promote uptake. The potential of biofuel crops are promoted at farmer&#039;s seminars and conferences. In 2004, Defra and the British Association for Biofuels and Oils produced a booklet The facts on biodiesel and bioethanol&quot;. Copies were distributed in a farming magazine and at seminars. The Single Payment Scheme brochures and Defra&#039;s website give guidance on claiming the Single Payment and the Energy Aid Payment for biofuel crops.

 Figures on the visibility of fly-posters on streets for each local authority are not available from 1997. However, the annual Local Environmental Quality Survey of England, conducted by ENCAMS on behalf of Defra, provides statistics on the extent of fly-posting on a regional basis since 2001&#150;02. This is a measure of the percentage of sites (covering streets and highways, public open spaces and waterside areas) that have significant levels of fly-posting present, so as to be clearly visible to the public. The statistics for all areas combined show that the percentage of transects with unsatisfactory levels of fly-posting has fallen from 2 per cent. to 1 per cent. nationally.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="50613w11.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight:  </b> 
Game management has played a significant role in creating and maintaining some of the typical habitats of the uplands, especially in northern England. The major influence has been management for driven grouse shooting, which has taken place for the past 150 years. The areas of such habitat are extensive and of national or international importance for their vegetation and breeding birds. It is noteworthy that some 75 per cent. of our heather moorland are classified as areas of national and international importance for wildlife both plants and animals. However, large areas of the English uplands managed for game (red grouse) designated as SSSI/SAC/SPA, are in unfavourable condition due to past poor management practices such as overgrazing, intensive burning and drainage.

 The system of litter abatement orders was reviewed in Defra&#039;s Living Places&#151;Powers, Rights, Responsibilities&quot; consultation published in October 2002. Responses to the consultation indicated that most local authorities are able to negotiate a solution before a litter abatement order is lodged. The principle behind the procedure is sound, but the use and application of litter abatement orders needs to be communicated to residents more effectively.

The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) have been contracted by Defra, for some time, to provide sales data for store cattle and this contract was due to end on 31 March 2005.

UKTI provide support and advice on how to trade internationally but do not make commercial judgments for a company. Specific advice on agent&#039;s validity or appropriateness is ultimately a commercial judgment for the company.

This would benefit the EU&#039;s security of supply but would also have a very positive effect on the Russian economy and environment. During our EU presidency we aim to re-invigorate the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue to promote investment energy efficiency, network development and energy trade.

<a name="stpa_141">An important part of our engagement with energy producing and transit countries is through the multilateral Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), which promotes the rule of law in energy trade, investment and transit between its contracting parties and thereby improves security of energy supply. ECT signatories comprise all of Europe, all the former Soviet Union and others. Since 1999 members have been negotiating a Protocol intended to supplement existing ECT provisions on energy transit by offering negotiated access to pipelines and grids. However, differences between the EU and Russia on key outstanding issues have prevented the Transit Protocol from being concluded. As part of our EU presidency union, the UK will work closely with all relevant parties to try to conclude the Transit Protocol negotiations, although success remains dependent on the EU and Russia being able to resolve their differences.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the future costs of ensuring the secure status of <i>(a)</i> nuclear installations to the end of their decommissioning and <i>(b)</i> nuclear materials until they are no longer useable in a malevolent fashion; and what measures have been put in place to ensure such future security.  [2082]</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="50613w22.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Security measures are the responsibility of those licensed to run nuclear installations. The licensees bear the cost of these security measures. For those sites for which the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency is responsible, these costs are included in the lifecycle baselines prepared by each site. These are updated annually and summaries posted on the NDA website. The 2005 summaries will appear on the website in November. Security is regulated under the Nuclear Installations Security Regulations 2003 (NISR2003), implemented by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security; the Security Regulator. NISR2003 will cease to apply, and cease to be appropriately enforced, only when an installation no longer requires to be licensed. In practical terms this means that strict security compliance will be required for the lifetime of each nuclear installation. As to what measures are in place, it is not Government policy to discuss the details of security measures at nuclear installations, as this information could potentially be of use to terrorists.

The total cost of these interventions, including fracture treatment, is not available. However, data is available on the costs associated with medicines dispensed by community pharmacists for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

 The PEACE II Programme was originally intended to end in 2004. All projects were assisted on a time limited basis and as such no European funding has been withdrawn. We are pleased that an extension to PEACE II has been secured and that its wider work can continue. Further funding is now available to play care clubs and will be administered jointly by the Training for Women Network and Playboard. However, as the resources available annually are approximately half previous levels, there are inevitably limits on the number of activities that can be assisted.

Our aim is to secure a radio system that meets the needs of the FRS and provides value for money for the taxpayer. The imperative is to run a fair and open competition under EU procurement procedures. Some &#163;9 million has been spent on work to replace high risk items of brigades current radio systems to ensure that they continue to be operationally effective until they can be replaced by Firelink.

 English Partnerships is undertaking a review of sites on the register of surplus public sector land they maintain on behalf of Government. As at March 2005 there were 713 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added to the Register as they are identified as surplus by landowners in central government and removed once they receive expressions of interests after a site has been marketed. A list of the sites, as at March 2005, can be found on the English Partnerships website at: http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C904340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf English Partnerships will publish a quarterly update of sites on the Register.

 On behalf of the European Union, the Dutch ambassador in Bogota (in his capacity as local EU presidency) recently raised with the Colombian Government the EU&#039;s concerns over these specific threats to Justice and Peace, a non-governmental organisation that seeks to defend human rights. The presidency sought assurances that measures would be taken to protect the people concerned. The British embassy also hosted a meeting between Justice and Peace and the diplomatic corps shortly after the threats became public to demonstrate support for Justice and Peace. We regularly raise specific human rights cases, either unilaterally or as part of the EU, with the Colombian authorities. We also urge the Colombian Government to implement the recommendations arising from successive annual reports from the Colombia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and have offered our assistance to achieve this.

 The Government do not hold such information. The most useful information on this subject is available from the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Member states are required to report cases of irregularities, including possible fraud, to OLAF. The Commission publishes the resulting figures in its annual Fight Against Fraud&quot; report. These figures include cases of suspected fraud, but OLAF has not until now published separate figures for fraud. The figures for irregularities for 2003 and the previous four years can be found in the annex to the latest report (COM (2004) 573 final, 30 August 2004), available at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti&#095;fraud/reports/commission/2003/en.pdf

The new EC staff regulation of May 2004 introduced measures to protect whistleblowers. The Commission evaluated the effectiveness of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) thoroughly in 2003 and the European Court of Auditors&#039; report on OLAF, which will further review OLAF&#039;s performance and achievements, will be published shortly.

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2005]:</i> At the Association of Chief Police Officers&#039; conference on 19 May, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made it clear that he did not believe that the current structure of 43 forces was the most efficient and effective arrangement for organising policing in England and Wales. He also made clear that he had no blueprint for force amalgamations, but that the initiative for such amalgamations should ideally be driven locally. To inform the way forward, my right hon. Friend has commissioned Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine the issue of force structures. As well as looking at the case for structural changes, Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary will also be examining the case for greater collaboration and co-operation between forces.

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2005]:</i> The Government has not completed any legally binding agreements for the supply of goods and services in respect of either the Identity Cards themselves or the National Identity Register. Clause 42 of the Identity Cards Bill authorises the expenses of the Secretary of State in connection with the carrying out of his functions under this Act, to be paid out of money provided by Parliament. Consequently the Secretary of State cannot enter into such legally binding agreements until the Bill has completed the parliamentary process and has received Royal Assent.

 Effective and responsive policing at neighbourhood level as well as robust partnership working are both essential parts of our strategy to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour and to sustain the confidence and trust of the public in all parts of the country.

<a name="stpa_264">In accordance with this, we are committed to working with the police and other partners at national and local level so that, by 2008 every area in England and Wales, rural as well as urban, will benefit from visible and responsive neighbourhood policing teams. The dedicated teams will be led by police officers and involve special constables, community support officers, volunteers and neighbourhood wardens among others.

<a name="stpa_265">In addition, the Rural Policing Fund was introduced part way through 2000&#150;01, when &#163;15 million was made available to enhance the policing service in rural areas at no cost to the metropolitan forces. The fund is currently &#163;30 million per annum benefiting 31 forces. This fund enables rural forces to focus on local crime hot-spots and provide a physical presence to deter criminals and troublemakers.

<a name="50613w41.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_266">In terms of fear of crime, whilst it is statistically lower in rural areas, the impact of crime can be greater in small communities, particularly among older people. Comparative statistics between older residents still however produce lower fear of crime rates in rural areas than urban. Work to reduce further the fear of crime is a key component of the Home Office&#039;s public service agreement which looks to increase confidence in the Criminal Justice System and reduce antisocial behaviour and the fear of crime.

 There are no plans to publish the confidential policy advice contained in the strategy unit report on drugs.

It sets out the range of policies and interventions to reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs by 2008. We have achieved a great deal across the strategy. Class A drug use among young people is stable. Where there was once virtually no drug treatment, 154,000 people are now being helped and waiting times are at their lowest ever&#151;down 75 per cent. since December 2001. Where previously little attempt was made to break the link between drugs and crime, there is now the Drug Interventions Programme doing just that. Crime is falling, and falling faster in areas operating the programme, with over 1,950 drug-misusing offenders entering treatment in April 2005&#151;

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the potential impact the introduction of the identity card scheme may have on civil liberties; and what measures he is taking to protect confidential information.  [2402]</p>








<p><a name="st_405"><a name="50613w42.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The ID card scheme is being designed to help support civil liberty and human rights by fostering a more inclusive society and allowing people to feel part of the community by easily demonstrating their identity and entitlement to reside in the UK, whatever their heritage. There will be very strong controls in place, including full auditing of all on-line checks to deter abuse of the scheme and ensure that any complaints can be fully investigated. The Register will be designed in such a way to ensure that data is stored in a highly secure manner. In addition, the design of the scheme will ensure compliance with legislation such as, among others, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 & 2005, the Race Relations Act 1976 & 2004 and the Gender Recognition Act 2004. The Government published their response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights interim report on 8 February 2005 which explains in detail why the scheme is in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Council of Europe&#039;s Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report published on 8 June 2005,
</p>


<p>
<a name="50613w42.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_271">The issuing of some form of identifying document to all residents does not seem to me to be objectionable in principle, nor does the right to private life guaranteed by the Article eight of the Convention preclude it. I carry an identity card myself and find it more useful than annoying.

<p>
<a name="50613w42.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_272">The information which may be recorded on the National Identity Register is strictly limited by Schedule one of the Identity Cards Bill, and only Parliament would be able to change the information to be held. Unauthorised disclosure or modification of information held on the Register is subject to a criminal offence under clauses 29 & 31 of the Bill. The vast majority of checks on the Register will be made with the consent of the individual under clause 14 of the Identity Cards Bill. There are provisions for accrediting authorised users of the verification service. Even with an individual&#039;s consent, this clause only allows a limited amount of information from the Register, for example name, address, date of birth, residential status and status of the card, to be verified. Compulsion to carry the card is strictly prohibited in the Bill and clause 18 precludes any organisation from requiring the production of an ID card as sole proof of identity before the move to compulsion (so called compulsion by the &#039;back door&#039;). Clause 15 only allows regulations to be made establishing a requirement to make use of the ID cards scheme a condition of provision of public services which have to be provided free of charge or social security payments should the scheme become compulsory. For all types of public services identity checks, rules need to be approved by Parliament on a case by case basis. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Jun 2005 : Column 159W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Circumstances where information can be provided without consent are strictly regulated, as outlined in Clauses 19&#150;23 of the Bill.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of best value legislation on the administrative burden faced by police forces.  [1372]</p>








<p><a name="st_426"><a name="50613w45.html_spnew0"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Best Value legislation was introduced in 1999 by virtue of Section 1(1 )<i>(d)</i> of the Local Government Act 1999. The legislation put a statutory responsibility upon police authorities to achieve continuous improvement through application of the Best Value approach, carrying out structured Best Value Reviews (BVRs) of all aspects of police service delivery. Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has conducted a significant number of inspections of BVRs each year since the introduction of Best Value. All HMIC Inspection reports and recommendations to police forces and authorities have been published on the HMIC website. A report summarising the work carried out and identified good practice has been submitted to the Police Minister on an annual basis. To the best of HMIC&#039;s knowledge, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of the overall impact of Best Value legislation within policing therefore it is difficult to fully quantify the direct benefits to the Police Service or whether the legislation has significantly improved or increased the bureaucratic burden on police forces and police authorities. HMIC has an expectation forces and police authorities should be proactive in securing continuous improvement giving due regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Best Value is one of the many tools that is considered within this process and HMIC has worked with the Service to ensure that, wherever possible, the full benefits of the approach are realised while avoiding the potential downside of excessive bureaucracy.

 An annual published breakdown by force area of those who have died during or following contact with the police for each of the last five years, is attached at annex A. Prior to 1997, the Home Office did not collect the statistics by force area. The breakdown is not structured to provide specific information on those with mental health problems. However, since 1997 there have been some deaths of those detained by the police under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983, and these figures are listed separately in the tables at annex A.

Key elements of the reform programme include: ensuring every community in England and Wales benefits from neighbourhood policing by 2008; building a stronger customer service culture within the service; strengthened accountability arrangements and a greater role for local people in determining how their communities are policed; further reductions in bureaucracy; ensuring greater national consistency on issues such as IT; consideration of whether we have the right policing structures to meet present and future challenges; and further modernisation of the workforce to enable the service to deliver these changes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many second phase Sure Start&#039;s children&#039;s centres are planned in each local authority during 2006&#150;08; and how much funding will be provided to each local authority for this purpose.  [1812]</p>








<p><a name="st_443"><a name="50613w47.html_spnew0"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 A total of &#163;947 million funding has been made available to local authorities in the second phase of the children&#039;s centres programme. This comprise of &#163;405,523,772 capital and &#163;542,205,843 revenue. The capital allocation is to contribute to the funding of new children&#039;s centre places to be created in phase two, whereas the revenue allocation is to fund both new and existing centres created in phases 1 and 2. Local authorities will develop their children&#039;s centres by building on existing provision such as Sure Start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and primary schools which have already benefited from a number of funding streams. The following table sets out the funding allocated to each local authority.

 The Education Act 2005 requires local authorities to hold a competition whenever they plan to establish a new secondary school, including a school which is replacing one or more existing schools. This means that if a school is closed, and a new school established in its place, the local authority must invite potential providers to bring forward proposals. A local authority or potential provider may apply to the Secretary of State to publish proposals for a new school without a competition in exceptional circumstances, for example where it is intended to replace a weak or failing school as part of a collaborative restart. In considering such an application, the Secretary of State would have regard to the extent to which the local authority or independent provider&#039;s proposals would contribute to the quality and diversity of provision in the area.

 The responsibility for maintaining adequate and appropriate school provision rests with local authorities and Ministers have no direct involvement in decisions to reorganise schools. The Government introduced statutory procedures under the School Standards and Framework Act (SSFA) 1998 to ensure that the views of local people, and those directly affected by school organisational changes, are heard. These procedures include a requirement on local authorities to consult locally and publish statutory proposals should they wish to proceed with closure, or other significant change to education provision. School Organisation Committees are independent of local authorities and Ministers, and take decisions about school closures when local objections to statutory proposals have been made. I understand that Education Leeds is currently consulting on proposals to reorganise primary school provision across the area and that further decisions will be necessary from the Council&#039;s Executive Board before the question of issuing statutory notices arises.

 In his March 2005 Budget, the Chancellor announced that in 2008&#150;09, an additional &#163;150 million of capital will be provided to renew primary school buildings in England, which will rise to &#163;500 million in 2009&#150;10. This funding is additional to the annual investment in schools of &#163;6.3 billion which we will provide by 2006&#150;07, and is to support our aim of rebuilding or renewing up to half of all primary schools in England in around 15 years from then.

<a name="stpa_324">I am still considering this programme, including issues such as criteria, and I aim to announce further details later this year.

Like Building Schools for the Future, our primary schools programme will drive reform of the primary system and improvements in educational standards, provide good places for teachers to teach and pupils to learn, which are used by the community, and which are well designed and built on time and at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer.

 To date, about 69 per cent. of all maintained secondary schools are designated as specialist schools (2,176 schools, including 24 special schools). We expect about 80 per cent. of all maintained secondary schools to be specialist by September 2006. As set out in the Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners, published in July last year, we intend that every school which is up to standard should be a specialist school.

Details about further opportunities for specialist schools to take on a second specialism will be published in due course.

 The National Literacy Strategy, combined with developments in the Foundation Stage, have transformed the nature of teaching, learning and achievement in primary schools over the last seven years. Compared to 1997, around 96,000 more children each year are being helped to reach the expected reading level for their age.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50613w57.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_342">The Strategy have continually evolved to ensure that it benefits from the latest developments in this area, and the time is now right to renew the literacy framework, to accelerate and build on this success. Synthetic phonics is already at the heart of early literacy teaching for every child under the Strategy, and the debate centres not on whether to teach phonics, but how to do so. As part of the renewal of the literacy framework, we have appointed Jim Rose to make recommendations on best practice in the teaching of early reading and synthetic phonics in primary schools and early years settings, covering content and pace of learning. He will also make recommendations on the best support for children with significant literacy difficulties to enable them to catch up with their peers, and the relationship between such targeted intervention programmes with synthetic phonics
</p>


<p>
<a name="50613w57.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_343">Mr. Rose&#039;s recommendations will draw on an examination of both academic research and classroom best practice in schools and early years settings, as well as recent reports by the Education and Skills Select Committee, Ofsted and the Clackmannanshire study. He will provide an interim report in November 2005 and make final recommendations early in the new year. Decisions on who will work alongside him as he conducts his review will be made shortly, in agreement with Mr. Rose.
