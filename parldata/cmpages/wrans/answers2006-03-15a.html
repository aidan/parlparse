<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Through engagement with the IADB and the World Bank, DFID is supporting greater involvement of civil society and local communities in IFI programmes and processes, such as consultations around development and evaluation of IFI country strategies. In Brazil, the UK is helping local communities give their own assessment of the impact of the Federal Government&#039;s conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Familia. This programme provides a monthly cash benefit to a current total of 8.7 million poor families across the country, which is conditional on children attending school and immunisation programmes. The UK is also contributing to a programme to enhance the capacity of indigenous people&#039;s organisations throughout Amazonia. Indigenous leaders meet regularly, receive training together, and consider how to promote their entitlements to services and to strengthen social cohesion in Amazon communities.

 Latin America has high levels of persistent and severe poverty and inequality. According to 2004 national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, 42.9 per cent. of the population of Latin America live in poverty and 18.6 per cent. live in extreme poverty. The levels of extreme poverty are higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people.

<a name="stpa_12">DFID&#039;s strategy for Middle Income Countries (MIC) provides the framework for how DFID works to reduce poverty and inequality in Latin America. DFID&#039;s main financial contributions to Latin America are through direct contributions to the multilateral institutions (the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations). As recommended by the MICs Strategy, DFID uses its bilateral programme (&#163;11 million in 2005&#150;06 and &#163;12 million in 2006&#150;07) for Latin America to maximise the effectiveness of our multilateral contribution by working to enhance the overall impact of the international system in the region. DFID&#039;s assistance to Latin America from 2004&#150;07 is set out in the Regional Assistance Plan, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.

<p><a name="qnpa_3">(4) which 20 non-governmental organisations working in Latin America received the highest amount of grant from his Department for microfinance or microcredit projects in each year since 1997.  [58036]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60315w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Lack of access to affordable credit is a persistent constraint to livelihoods of the poor in Latin America. For both formal and informal small scale enterprises, which are the main employers of the poor in urban and rural areas, limited forms of formal collateral exclude them from access to borrowing from the formal financial sector. Microfinance institutions have an important role to play in meeting this gap for small enterprises and producers. However, microfinance institutions can also have high transaction and operation costs and frequently rely on external, often donor, financing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">Many donors, including the International Financial Institutions, are working on instruments that will guarantee loans to the poor, as well institutional models that will enable larger financial institutions to extend financial services to poorer communities and small enterprises. In the meantime, microfinance institutions continue to play a crucial role in meeting the demands of the poor for financial services tailored to their particular needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">If microfinance remains reliant on donor grants, it will always be limited and not reach the scale possible through involvement of the private sector. By combining the strengths of microfinance non-governmental organisations (NGO)s (microfinance expertise, community presence, commitment to serving very poor people) and those of banks (financial resources, information technology, payment systems), massive increases can be made in providing microfinance to the poor. The experience of ICICI Bank in India, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and Bancosol in Bolivia clearly demonstrate this. ProFund Internacional (ProFund), based in Costa Rica, targets the small and microenterprises (SMEs) of Latin America and the Caribbean. Major shareholders of ProFund include the InterAmerican Development Bank, IFC/The World Bank Group and CDC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">Globally, DFID has supported microfinance and financial sector projects in 25 countries. In Latin America, DFID is working closely with partner governments to improve the institutional framework within which microfinance institutions operate. DFID&#039;s Regional Assistance Plan for Latin America aims to improve the impact of International Finance Institutions (particularly the World Bank and Inter American Development Bank (IADB) on poverty and inequality. This includes working with the IADB and the World Bank to strengthen the access of poor and excluded people to local and national markets, including access to micro-credit. In Nicaragua, DFID is providing $150,000 to an International Finance Corporation initiative to support the microfinance industry to develop new products and lending models specifically targeted at the small enterprise sector. In Bolivia, DFID is in dialogue with the new Government 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Mar 2006 : Column 2249W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
on the institutional structure for microfinance, informed by an analysis of models for credit services to poor rural producers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">Microfinance has often tended to be a component of wider DFID projects. For example, the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) Alternative Development project in the Lower Huallaga Valley, Peru (completed in 2004), which worked with farmers to increase their incomes from alternative livelihoods and avoid a reactivation of the illegal cultivation of coca. A similar project in San Martin region of Peru included microfinance and supported small-scale production, agro-processing and environmental education to improve incomes and employment of poor producers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">DFID&#039;s fund allocations are determined by country and region rather than by sector. The overall budget for microfinance and the proportion allocated for Latin America is therefore not readily available.

<a name="stpa_21">DFID has Partnership Programme Arrangements (PPAs) with six international NGOs for their programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean.

 There has been some slippage on progress towards Target 4 of DFID&#039;s Public Service Agreement Objectives and Targets for 2003 to 2006. Progress with the current round of trade negotiations is the main influence on this target, and this depends on the actions of the EU and others within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). After the failure of the Cancun WTO Ministerial in September 2003, there was no likelihood of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) being completed by 1 January 2005. Thus the original target, which was always challenging, was unachievable. However, the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005 delivered enough progress to keep the prospect of concluding the DDA in 2006 alive. The Government are therefore pressing for an outcome to these trade talks which delivers real gains for developing countries.
