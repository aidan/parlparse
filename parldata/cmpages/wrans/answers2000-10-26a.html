<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many new regulations on business were introduced by his Department in the financial year 1999-2000.  [134771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 My Department was responsible for 172 regulations affecting business in this period. Of these, 135 had no cost impact on business and 18 reduced businesses' costs. Sixty-three of them were Orders licensing businesses as public telecommunications providers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will establish an inquiry into the privatisation in 1988 of the Virgin Group and the subsequent re-sale in 1989 of a 25 per cent. stake in that company to the Pony Canyon Company.  [134618]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Goggins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the Government's plans for reforming the merger regime.  [135684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 In August last year the Government published proposals for reforming the UK's system of merger regulation and invited interested parties to comment on them.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para0">When I launched the consultation I set out key principles which a reformed regime should reflect. In particular, it needed to provide effective and proportionate control of mergers which had harmful effects; be clear, transparent, consistent and fair; and impose minimum burdens on those using it. I proposed two fundamental reforms to the current regime. First, the framework for decisions should be clarified, focusing it more clearly on competition; and secondly, ministerial involvement in merger decisions should be minimised. In addition, I put forward a number of more detailed proposals for reform covering issues such as the status of the independent competition authorities, exceptional interest cases and timetables.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para1">We received 60 representations from a broad range of companies, competition lawyers, trade unions, business and consumer organisations, regulatory bodies and a number of individuals. There was a broad support for minimising ministerial involvement and moving towards a competition-based test. Respondents also provided useful views on other aspects of the regime.




<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 154W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para2">I am publishing today the Government's response to this consultation, which summarises the views received and sets out proposals for the future.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para3">In summary:
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>responsibility for making decisions in merger cases should be given to the independent competition authorities; the Secretary of State should only become involved in the small minority of cases which raise defined exceptional public interest issues;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w01.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>decisions should be made by the competition authorities against a competition-based test rather than against the current public interest test;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w01.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the division of responsibility between the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the Competition Commission (CC) should remain unaltered: the OFT will conduct the first stage, preliminary investigation into a merger and the CC will carry out a second-stage, in-depth inquiry if merited;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w01.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the system of voluntary notification for all mergers, which business clearly values, should be retained;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w01.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wherever possible timetables for investigations should be tightened.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w01.html_para9">We intend to define national security in the legislation from the outset as an area raising issues of exceptional public interest. In addition, we intend to give the Secretary of State a reserve power to define further specific exceptional public interest criteria where ministerial involvement in the mergers process may be necessary, although there are no current plans to make any such orders. This power will be subject to the approval of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para10">There are a number of more detailed issues set out in the document, including the specific form of the competition test and of the qualifying thresholds, and alternative approaches to develop the Competition Commission's procedures for identifying remedies. The Government would welcome further views on aspects of these. While the principles underlying the reforms are clear, today's announcement represents a further stage in consultation, not the end of the process. We will continue to develop the detail of the proposals, consulting with interested parties where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para11">The Government intend to introduce legislation designed to implement the measures set out in the document as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para12">However, in light of the broad support among consultation responses for the thrust of the reforms, I have been examining ways of making progress towards operating the current regime consistently with the principles underlying the reforms, so far as is possible within the existing framework. I am now, therefore, adopting a new policy in relation to the advice I receive from the Director General of Fair Trading.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para13">First, I confirm I will continue to refer cases to the Competition Commission primarily on competition grounds.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para14">But I wish to go further, in advance of legislation.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para15">My policy from today will be to accept the advice I receive from the Director General of Fair Trading on whether or not to refer merger cases to the Competition Commission, save in exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para16">I do not expect exceptional circumstances to arise often. It may be appropriate for me to intervene, for example, where a merger raises national security issues or where 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 155W</I><P>
there are other unusual circumstances, such as where there is a material change after the submission of the DGFT's advice, or where the advice of the DGFT conflicts with the views of sectoral regulators.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para17">I think that it is right that the role of the Director General of Fair Trading should be emphasised in this way. This policy currently covers only my decisions following the advice of the DGFT on reference decisions (including undertakings in lieu). I intend to review in 12 months time the position in relation to my decisions following advice from the Competition Commission after a full inquiry into a referred merger.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para18">Today's announcement reflects my view that the Director General is best placed to assess competition issues in individual cases. As previously, it will be for the Director General to decide on the process he thinks best serves him in the formulation of his advice. Departmental officials will continue to assist in this process where the Director General of Fair Trading considers this appropriate.
<P>

<a name="01026w01.html_para19">Lastly, I want to take what action I can to reduce the burdens of the current system on business. To this end I propose to exempt small firms from paying merger fees. I am publishing draft proposals for doing this today and seeking interested parties' views on them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what grant money has been paid to the coal industry since his announcements offering &#163;100 million to the industry.  [134977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 On 27 July, I announced that the UK Government had formally applied to the European Commission for its approval to pay operating aid to United Kingdom coal producers over the period to July 2002. The European Commission is still considering our application, so no grant money has yet been paid to the coal industry under this scheme.

<a name="01026w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 An offer of RSA has been made to Nissan in an effort to ensure the Micra project for its Sunderland plant. The offer was made subject to European Commission approval under the Motor Vehicle State Aid Framework.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, if his Department will launch an inquiry to establish whether the New Millennium Experience Company has fulfilled its duties under section 221 of the Companies Act 1985 to maintain certain specific accounting records, with particular reference to maintaining a record of assets and liabilities.  [134429]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As is known already, the National Audit Office are inquiring into the New Millennium Experience Company Limited. The findings of the inquiry are expected to be published in early November and will be considered by the Public Accounts Committee. Accordingly, it would be both premature and a wasteful duplication of resources for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to appoint inspectors at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) of 20 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 142W, regarding Robert Maxwell, when he expects to receive a report from the inspectors appointed on 8 June 1992 under the Companies Acts to investigate the affairs and membership of Mirror Group Newspapers plc; and what has been the cost to date of the inspection.  [134879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The inspectors have not completed their inquiries and so have not yet submitted their report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Although I am hopeful that these inquiries will be completed shortly, the inspectors are independent and I am unable to say when this is likely to be. The cost of the inspection to date (excluding Value Added Tax) is &#163;7,946,344.

<a name="01026w02.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Joint Force Harrier Programme</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of the merging of the Royal Air Force's and Royal Navy's trade structures resulting from the Joint Force Harrier programme; and if he will make a statement.  [134255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Joint Force Harrier (JFH) initiative does not require the aircraft engineering trade structures of the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy to be merged. For the present, Royal Air Force Harrier squadrons and Royal Navy Sea Harrier squadrons will employ engineering personnel of their own services, organised within their existing trade groups and specialisations. It would not be practicable, nor is it desired, to introduce new trade structures for JFH that do not align with wider RAF and RN arrangements.
<P>

<a name="01026w02.html_para0">However, the desirability of converging aircraft engineering trade structures has been recognised, and the training and employment of aircraft engineering personnel is under review at many levels within MOD departments on a tri-service basis. The potential for JFH to act as a sounding board and catalyst for this is clear, especially 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 157W</I><P>
after collocation in 2003 when RAF and RN engineers will be working alongside each other at RAF Cottesmore and RAF Wittering.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the cost is to <i>(a)</i> the Royal Air Force and <i>(b)</i> the Royal Navy of the Joint Force Harrier programme; when the programme is expected to be completed; and if he will make a statement.  [134249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Joint Force Harrier programme is being managed by Royal Air Force Strike Command (STC), under the auspices of Air Officer Commanding No. 3 Group. Under current plans (as agreed by the Joint COS), the programme is due to be completed in the summer of 2003, when the FA2 Sea Harrier squadrons based at RNAS Yeovilton will have relocated to RAF Stations Cottesmore and Wittering. Work is already under way to prepare the two sites for the arrival and collocation of the Royal Naval elements. The present budget for the additional capital works (and other relocation-related costs) is approximately &#163;11 million, the costs of which are being borne by RAF Strike Command.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of the joint force Harrier programme on the operational capability and engineering efficiency of the RAF's GR7 and the Royal Navy's FA2 Harriers; and if he will make a statement.  [134251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The advances made in Joint Force Harrier (JFH) operational capability have already been demonstrated on the world stage. In the first six months of its existence, No. 3 Group of RAF Strike Command which own JFH and, in particular, its embarked RAF Harrier GR7 and Navy Sea Harrier FA2 squadrons, have made major contributions to Operation Palliser (Sierra Leone) as well as the recent Mediterranean deployment by the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible. As an international means of power projection, an aircraft carrier with fully integrated JFH units embarked is a considerable national asset and one which has already proved its potent deterrent value. The benefits have also been significant in the supporting areas where a slim, but truly joint staff organisation allows for rapid planning and execution of integrated operations. This arrangement also benefits exercise planning and will lead to more integrated--and therefore considerably improved--use of training opportunities.
<P>

<a name="01026w02.html_para1">At station and squadron level, the engineering efficiency of JFH units will not be affected in the short term, as the units remain at their current air stations. In the longer term, direct engineering efficiencies are limited by the significant differences between the Harrier GR7 and the Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft and their systems. However, maximum use is being made of collocation in 2003 to develop integrated support facilities for RAF and RN aircraft, an example being a combined facility for the repair and test of Pegasus engines. In the longer term, convergence of trade structures is expected to deliver a more flexible and deplorable workforce. Within RAF Strike Command, the Joint Force Harrier Role Office now discharges a number of engineering functions that were previously split between a number of departments and commands. This Role Office is built as a lean, joint organisation and provides key support to joint force Harrier staffs and other departments.




<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 158W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01026w02.html_para2">For the future, JFH will take part in the development of new support concepts and technologies associated with the Future Carrier Borne Aircraft (FCBA). These are intended to deliver significant through-life savings compared to current Harrier and Sea Harrier aircraft by large reductions in the engineering effort required in service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how the single service identities of the RAF's Harrier GR7 and the Royal Navy's Harrier FA2 are maintained within the joint force Harrier programme; and if he will make a statement.  [134250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In the Joint Force Harrier (JFH), single service ethos and identity will continue to be fostered within the individual communities. In tandem, a joint force ethos is developing. Both RN and RAF JFH squadrons will wear the uniform and ranks of their parent service and will be commanded by officers from the relevant service. Each service element of the JFH remains under full single-service command, including terms and conditions of service, disciplinary matters, and individual career development. These arrangements are planned to continue up to, and beyond, the Future Carrier Borne Aircraft/ the future aircraft carrier (CVF) era. Higher Command initiatives, such as the Armed Forces Overarching Personnel Strategy underpin the implementation of JFH. The integration of RAF and RN personnel as 'one company' is a clearly stated objective, and HQ 3Gp of RAF Strike Command sponsors a number of Working Groups that address various subject-related topics. In particular, the CVS/JFH Integration Working Group receives comprehensive debriefings after JFH operational and exercise detachments; from these reports 'best practice' is identified and adopted (after full consultation has taken place with the relevant single-service authorities).

<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service personnel are connected by the ARMYMAIL electronic mail system supplied by Bull Information Systems Ltd.; at what cost; and if he will make a statement.  [133729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2000]:</i> The ARMYMAIL electronic mail system was renamed the Electronic Messaging Service (EMS) in response to the wider tri-Service Defence community it now serves. The purpose of EMS is to provide a managed electronic mail interconnection service between separate information system communities in the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Subscription to EMS is on a communities-by- communities basis, and hence the number of potential users of the Service is the total number of users within each of the connected communities. There is currently a total of almost 82,000 members of the subscribing communities with the Army, RAF and MOD civilian organisations, including Defence agencies. The total cost of the service, paid to Bull Information Systems Ltd., is approximately &#163;2.1 million per annum, based on the current usage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what percentage of <i>(a)</i> the Royal Air Force's 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 159W</I><P>
annual budget is allocated to its Harrier GR7 and <i>(b)</i> the Royal Navy's budget is allocated to its Harrier FA2; and if he will make a statement.  [134248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 On 1 April, following the re-organisation of Royal Air Force Strike Command (STC), budgetary responsibility for both the RAF Harrier GR7 and the Navy Sea Harrier FA2 transferred to Joint Force Harrier (JFH) under the command of No. 3 Group at STC. The Group's resource budget for the operation of the Joint Harrier fleet for financial year 2000-01 is approximately &#163;330 million, which equates to 8.2 per cent. of the RAF Strike Command budget. While this includes the majority of costs relating to the Harrier FA2, some minor support costs are continuing to be borne by the Royal Navy pending the collocation of the Joint Force Harrier fleet in the summer of 2003.
<P>

<a name="01026w02.html_para3">In addition, further costs relating to the Harrier fleet are accounted for elsewhere in the Department--for example, RAF Personnel and Training Command and the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO), who are, respectively, responsible for the production of trained manpower and equipment support.

 Responsibility for security in magistrates courts rests with the Magistrates Courts Committee. The Lord Chancellor's Department has supported the issue of guidance to Magistrates Courts Committees on preventing violence to staff, magistrates and courts users. Where bids are received the Magistrates Courts Committees paying authority to install security equipment in court buildings, the Department treats them as a high priority for capital funding allocations. The Department also has a programme for the installation of secure docks where a need has been identified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Bristol City Council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para1">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter-fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para2">BFI reports a lack of senior management accountability in Bristol City Council. Management information was found to be poor with no effective means of measuring and monitoring performance at a corporate level and the council was unable to reconcile information between different accounting systems. BFI states this led them to question the integrity of the data used to claim DSS subsidy.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para3">Inspectors found serious deficiencies in the council's administration of benefits and efforts to counter fraud which require immediate attention. The report notes serious concerns about weaknesses in the assessment, control and payment of benefit. The BFI concluded that the council had no effective assurance that claims were calculated correctly from the outset.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para4">The classification of overpayments and recovery of debts was considered to be poorly managed across sites with no specific policy for the recovery of Housing Benefit overpayments. The council could not provide details of debts recovered.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para5">In the area of counter-fraud activities, the BFI raises concern about the limited resources being deployed and the general poor quality of investigations. Despite this, the council has had some success in prosecuting benefit cheats.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para6">More positively, Inspectors found that Bristol City Council keeps the public informed about access to benefits and has a well designed claim form. A formal and structured training and development programme is operated for staff and implementation of the Verification Framework in 1999 had been well managed.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para7">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of Nottingham City Council was published on 5 October 2000, during parliamentary recess. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para8">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as their respective counter-fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para9">Inspectors found the council's staff committed to battling against arrears of work and striving to overcome long-term problems associated with a shortfall in staff resources and deficiencies in management and control.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para10">The report identifies some effective work in the benefits processing area, but also several areas of deficiency. The BFI considered the council needed to introduce a structured regime of checking to gain necessary management assurance about security, accuracy and quality in benefit administration. The report states that the council's management needs to be more actively involved and that security concerns and audit recommendations should be addressed promptly.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para11">The BFI found counter-fraud work was particularly weak, despite a steer from council members in 1997 that there was support for effective action to be pursued against fraudsters. To address this, the BFI recommends a thorough review of all counter-fraud operations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of Burnley Borough Council was published on 5 October, during parliamentary recess. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para13">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as their respective counter-fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para14">The BFI reports that, at the time of the inspection, the council was providing a poor service to claimants, particularly in the time taken to process many claims. The report identifies weaknesses in the council's application of the Verification Framework (VF) and a failure to ensure all appropriate references had been made to the Rent Officer.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para15">The report notes that little action had been taken by the council to address potential problems associated with private landlord cases which make up a high proportion of the claims case load and represent one of the highest risk areas. BFI identified that the council needs to 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 163W</I><P>
introduce effective liaison arrangements with its local landlords and for relevant information to be collected so that risks can be assessed.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para16">Inspectors report that the work of the counter-fraud section was not managed effectively and there was a need for the council to use its fraud database to analyse risk categories and prosecute offenders where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para17">During the inspection, the council was planning to clear arrears of work and recruit and train additional staff. The BFI considered work backlogs needed to be tackled as a matter of urgency. A reduction in delays for processing claims and tightening the application of the VF in the areas specified in the BFI report could, inspectors say, greatly improve the service provided to claimants, and, at the same time, tighten the gateway to benefits.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council was published on 12 September 2000, during parliamentary recess. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para19">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as their respective counter-fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para20">The BFI report found that Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council performed well in some areas and that staff were both helpful and committed to raising the standard of benefit delivery and counter-fraud work. However noticeable differences in performance and procedure were identified between the two sites of Neath and Port Talbot.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para21">Inspectors considered that some good counter-fraud practices had been introduced, such as a prosecutions panel. However, the BFI found that the council did not make effective use of the statutory powers for inspectors given by the 1997 Fraud Act. As well as identifying a need to improve investigation techniques, the report notes a lack of performance targets for investigators.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para22">Inspectors state overpayments recovery was a particularly weak area with no specific overpayment policy and no targets for staff. There was no management information collected which could have helped the council to prevent overpayments occurring. Finally, because classification of overpayments were poor and essential procedures are not followed, the BFI raised doubts about the validity of the council's subsidy claim.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para23">More positively, inspectors found the council has elected member support for its counter-fraud efforts. It has recently introduced the Verification Framework, which will provide a minimum set of standards for ensuring verification checks are made on claims.

<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para26">The BFI reports that the council has a strong client side team to manage its contracted out benefit administration and counter fraud work. However, the complex management framework and associated organisational arrangements has led to inefficiencies and delays in processes. The report notes that significant work will be required by the council before it can give an assurance that the right amount of benefit goes to the right person in every case.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para27">Inspectors found levels of verification being applied to claims did not meet the minimum standards of the Verification Framework (VF) and recommend full implementation of the VF.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para28">Inspectors considered the council's benefits claim form required enhancement so as to reduce the number of requests made to claimants for further information. The BFI also recommends formal liaison arrangements should be introduced with private sector landlords. Inspectors report there is potential for the council to make greater use of statutory powers for the recovery of overpayments from private landlords and for registering debts with the court.
<P>

<a name="01026w03.html_para29">The report notes the council's strong counter-fraud stance which is supported by elected members. BFI states performance in fraud investigations would be improved if the council set targets for investigations and monitored outcomes.

<a name="01026w03.html_para30">Inspectors noted a number of good practices and initiatives such as the council's work with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Region's Rough Sleepers Unit and work undertaken to improve liaison arrangements between the Benefit Service and the Housing Department.

 Following advice from the Meteorological Office, the annual review of the Cold Weather Payments scheme has now been completed. Amending regulations were laid on 6 October 2000 and will come into force on 1 November, in time for the beginning of the winter period.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The prescription information is from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, ie by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.<P>

2. The net ingredient cost (NIC) is the basic cost of a drug. This cost does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.<P>

3. Most of these items were prescribed by general practitioners; the main exception being Amoxycillin which dentists prescribed almost 1 million items.<P>

 There are no plans at present to offer stakeholder pensions for new or existing local government staff who are subject to the Local Government Pension Scheme. The scheme contains no restrictions on access and will not have to provide a stakeholder pension arrangement for its employees. The legal obligation of local authority employers to provide stakeholder pensions for employees not subject to the Local Government Pension Scheme will be a matter for them to consider under the provisions of the Stakeholder Pensions Regulations, which came into force earlier this month.

<P>
<a name="01026w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 "Reaching Out" was published in February 2000. The Government accepted all of its 81 conclusions.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para10">A key conclusion was that there should be new co-ordination arrangements. The Regional Co-ordination Unit (RCU) was established in April. In line with the report's recommendation, the RCU is an inter- departmental unit based in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It reports to me, with day-to-day direction from my noble and learned Friend the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Lord Falconer of Thoroton.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para11">The Unit has prepared an action plan identifying the key areas in which we need a new approach to developing and implementing Government policy with regional implications.

<P>
<a name="01026w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity met for the fifth time in Nairobi in May. Parliamentary business prevented my attendance, but the United Kingdom fielded a strong delegation who played a key part, including by helping to agree a challenging programme of action on a range of issues. This is vital if we are to succeed in our aim of safeguarding the world's biodiversity, and the Government will play its full part, together with a wide range of other stakeholders and our partners in other countries, in putting these necessarily ambitious plans into practice.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para12">Sixty-eight Parties to the Convention, including the UK, signed the Biosafety Protocol and a work plan was agreed for the first session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Protocol, which meets in Montpellier in December. UK chaired negotiations on the operations of the Convention led to agreement on a comprehensive package of reform to improve its effectiveness, including preparation of a strategic plan for adoption at the next COP, to be held in April 2002 in the Netherlands. An administrative budget of $18.64 million was agreed for 2001-02: the UK's contribution for the biennium will

be $0.911 million, an increase of 15.3 per cent. on 1999-2000, reflecting increased activity under the Convention.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para13">A four year cycle was adopted for Parties' national reports, to include an across the board assessment of implementation using a standard format which should facilitate global stocktaking. Optional biannual reports on priority issues were also invited: for COP6 these will cover forest biodiversity, alien species and benefit- sharing.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para14">Four ad hoc technical groups were set up, on marine and coastal biodiversity (2), drylands and forests. On inland water biodiversity, co-operation with the Ramsar Convention was encouraged. The COP decided to integrate fully the issue of coral bleaching into the marine and coastal biodiversity work programme which, along with the programme of work on forest biodiversity, envisages co-operation with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Work programmes on dryland and agricultural biodiversity were also adopted, as was one on the role of indigenous and local knowledge, with due emphasis on the participation of the holders of such knowledge.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para15">An expert panel will be re-convened on access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing, and its findings will be considered by an open ended working group. This will draft guidelines for legislation and contracts for the exchange of genetic material and the means to protect traditional knowledge. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) were invited to explore further the relationship between the Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and the Convention.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para16">The 'ecosystem approach', which is intended to underpin the Convention's work, was elaborated and enshrined in 12 guiding principles for use by Parties. Further work was initiated to improve indicators of biodiversity and programmes for monitoring and assessment, with an increased emphasis on work at the national and regional levels. An international co-ordination mechanism for the Global Taxonomy Initiative was established, along with supporting pilot projects. COP also called for further work on the case for the April 2000 Gran Canaria Declaration, which urged development of a global strategy to conserve plant biodiversity.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para17">The COP agreed further development of the clearing house mechanism, designed to share information on activity under the Convention, in particular by building the capacity of developing countries to participate. A global initiative on education and public awareness was endorsed, and action encouraged at national level. Discussions on environmental impact assessment promoted the sharing of good practice; further work was foreseen on liability and redress; and a programme of work was established on incentive measures.
<P>

<a name="01026w06.html_para18">Among the recommendations endorsed by the COP on the sustainable use of biodiversity were the identification of indicators and incentive measures for use by relevant sectors. The tourism industry was encouraged to work with all stakeholders to develop sustainable tourism, and countries were urged to apply interim principles for the control of alien species.

 As part of the Government's programme of regular five-yearly financial, management and policy reviews of non-departmental public bodies and bodies similar to them, my Department has initiated a thorough review of Encams, the umbrella body through which we fund the Tidy Britain Group and Going for Green. The review will consider the case for continuing DETR funding of Encams' work programme in England, and whether Encams is the most appropriate body to carry out the functions funded by DETR. If appropriate it will then consider what changes may be necessary to the current strategic and financial relationship between the Department and Encams, to improve the value for money of any future funding. The review will be carried out by my Department's In House Policy Consultancy, which will consult widely with those organisations having an interest in Encams' activities.
<P>

<a name="01026w07.html_para0">We have also set in hand a review of the Environmental Action Fund (EAF) which will consider the effectiveness with which the &#163;4 million per year of the EAF is spent on promoting sustainable living in England, examine the aims, terms, conditions and administration of these financial resources and, if appropriate, make recommendations for change to make sure that these resources are targeted most effectively. The review will be carried out by Quadrangle Consulting, who will consult widely with organisations having an interest in the work of the Fund.

 On 21 February this year, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the Government's conclusions on the recommendations of the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC. In addition to a range of measures designed to improve BBC efficiency and accountability, the Government introduced a new funding formula which provides for changes in the licence fee of RPI plus 1.5 per cent. for each year from 2000-01 to 2006-07. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 177W</I><P>
This formula will enable the BBC to provide a strong and distinctive schedule of benchmark quality programmes and remain at the forefront of the development of digital broadcasting services.
<P>

<a name="01026w07.html_para2">Application of the RPI figure of 3.3 per cent. for the year to September 2000, plus 1.5 per cent., to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &#163;109.00 for a colour licence and &#163;36.50 for a black-and-white licence. The new licence fees will come into force on 1 April 2001. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course.

The House achieved over 90 per cent. capacity for performances of opera and ballet in the main auditorium in the first season after re-opening, and ticket prices have been reduced in many areas. A broad and innovative programme of education work has involved over 100,000 school children, as well as young people and adults from all backgrounds. I applaud the artists, board and management of the House for their commitment to producing excellent work for the widest possible audience.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The report of the Review of the Criminal Justice System was published in March, taking forward an important element of the Good Friday Agreement. The Review undertook a fundamental examination of the justice system in Northern Ireland, and the report cogently addresses a wide range of issues, backed up with extensive research. It emphasises the centrality of human rights, the need to safeguard and entrench the legal system's independence, and the importance of joined-up delivery and enhanced co-operation between the justice agencies and the wider community.
<P>

<a name="01026w08.html_para2">I welcomed the report and initiated a consultation process on its recommendations. The period of consultation ended on 29 September, and I am grateful to all those who submitted their views.
<P>

<a name="01026w08.html_para3">Overall, the consultation elicited a wide and positive range of responses. Inevitably with such a comprehensive report reservations on some of the proposals have been expressed, and we will wish to consider further the particular recommendations on which comments have been made. But there has been a wide measure of agreement on the overall shape of the proposed reforms, and a consensus among most respondents that the report represents the broad way forward.
<P>

<a name="01026w08.html_para4">The Government fully endorse the general approach taken in the report. Informed by the consultation exercise, we have now put in hand the detailed work needed to prepare legislation and an implementation plan. As the Prime Minister has said, these will both be published next April.

The Government intend and are willing to devolve responsibility for policing and justice functions, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. We need first to pave the way by completing the implementation of the policing reforms and giving practical effect to the decisions made on the Criminal Justice Review. Thereafter, devolution will follow as soon as practicable.

We are working to inspire schools and partners in the sports sector to deliver the two hours aspiration through the Sports Strategy. Recent research confirms that the most popular out-of-school hours learning activity was participating in sport. This is particularly encouraging. Additionally, the Teacher Training Agency has allocated an indicative target of 399 primary PE Initial Teacher Training places to providers for the academic year 2000-01. This represents 3 per cent. of the overall primary target of 13,100 and shows a commitment to the recruitment of specialist PE teachers in primary schools.

These issues will remain a matter between employers and staff.

 The size of primary classes has gone down in each of the past two years after rising steadily throughout the previous 10 years. In January 1997, the size of the average primary class was 27.5. By January 2000 it had fallen to 27.1. The Government are well on target to deliver their pledge to limit the size of infant classes to 30 pupils, and 300,000 children have already benefited. &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge, and allocations so far to York LEA amount to some &#163;1.4 million. This has helped to reduce the size of the average Key Stage 1 class in the Vale of York to 24.2--the figure in January 1997 was 24.5. The size of the average Key Stage 2 class in the constituency has fallen to 27.1, from 27.2 in January 1997.

<a name="01026w10.html_para4">The size of the average secondary class in January 1997 was 21.7. In January 2000 it was 22.0, when the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary classes was 17.1.

It makes clear that there is a continuing and important role for LEAs in deciding--with their schools--how funding is distributed at local level. We are keen to hear views on the options set out in the Green Paper--there will be three months for responses which we will consider carefully before making any decisions.

 The specialist schools programme has grown from 181 schools in May 1997 to a network of 535 schools and we have plans for 1,000 specialist schools by 2004. Unlike under the previous Administration, there is now a substantial budget for specialist schools and a clear programme of expansion. Currently, around 19 per cent. of secondary pupils attend specialist schools, compared with 6 per cent. in May 1997. That percentage will increase to over 30 per cent. by 2004. There is no permanent upper limit on the number of specialist schools that there can be in any area, nor on the number of pupils. However, in order to ensure that all parts of the country have an opportunity to benefit from the expanded programme, my Department wrote in July to LEAs indicating to them that where 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 193W</I><P>
specialist schools were already educating over 30 per cent. of their pupils, we would not want to receive further applications until we had ensured a fairer spread in other parts of the country. This does not mean that in the future, subject to resources being available, no further bids will be considered.
<P>

<a name="01026w11.html_para3">The LEAs where currently over 30 per cent. of pupils attend specialist schools are: Bath and North East Somerset, Milton Keynes, Northamptonshire, North Somerset, Northumberland, Rutland, West Berkshire and Wigan. I have indicated to those LEAs also that, in exceptional circumstances, where applications have already been prepared, we would be willing to consider them. While we have received no formal applications from schools in these areas in the current Technology and Language College competitions, we have had discussions with six schools which were planning applications and are discussing with each whether we could support their application coming forward. We have so far agreed that two of these should submit an application. The costs incurred by bidding schools are not known but, as these cases demonstrate, our arrangements provide for schools to draw our attention to exceptional circumstances such as a nearly completed application, including where the sponsorship has been raised.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what guidance he gives to headteachers and governors about the provision of subsidised milk in schools and the entitlement of pupils to receive free school milk.  [134397]<P>

<P>
<a name="01026w12.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Schools and local education authorities are not obliged to provide milk for their pupils, but where they do so it must by law be supplied free of charge to those children whose parents are in receipt of either Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. The Government issued guidance in September 1996. The Government encourage schools that do not provide drinking milk to consider doing so and to make use of either the EU School Milk Subsidy Scheme or the Welfare Food Scheme. These schemes are administered by the Intervention Board, on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Department of Health respectively, and it is for them to issue guidance as they consider necessary.

<a name="01026w13.html_para1">Parliament will be asked to approve secondary legislation under the Act.

In the document on scope there are draft Orders on regulated activities; when regulated activities are and are not being carried on by way of business; persons who will be exempt from the requirement for FSA authorisation; the exemption of appointed representatives of an authorised person; and activities which will not be exempt regulated activities under Part XX of the Act. In the document on the framework for promotion of financial services there are draft Orders on financial promotion and on the promotion of collective investment scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the Government have taken to consolidate the UK's national criteria against which the Government assess licence applications to export arms and dual-use equipment with those of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports; and if he will make a statement.  [135683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Licences to export arms and other goods controlled for strategic reasons are issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, acting through the Export Control Organisation of the DTI. All relevant individual licence applications are circulated by DTI to other Government Departments with an interest, as determined by those Departments in line with their own policy responsibilities. These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.
<P>

<a name="01026w13.html_para4">In the Foreign Secretary's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms) on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column 27, he set out the criteria which would be used in considering advance approvals for promotion prior to formal application for an export licence, applications for licences to export miliary equipment, and dual-use goods where there are grounds for believing that the end-user will be the armed forces or internal security forces of the recipient country. As my right hon. Friend said then, the Government are committed to the maintenance of a strong defence industry as part of our industrial base as well as of our defence effort, and recognise that defence exports can also contribute to international stability by strengthening collective defence relationships; but believe that arms transfers must be managed responsibly. We have since taken a range of measures designed to ensure the highest standards of responsibility in our export control policies. These include the adoption during the UK's Presidency of the EU of a Code of Conduct on Arms Exports; the publication of Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls which are among the most transparent of those of any arms exporting country; the ban on the export of equipment used for torture; the ratification of the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel landmines and the passage of the Land Mines Act; and our many efforts to combat illicit trafficking in and destabilising accumulations of small arms.

<P>

<a name="01026w13.html_para5">Since the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on 8 June 1998, all relevant licence applications have been assessed against the UK's national criteria and those in the Code of Conduct, which represent minimum standards that all member states have agreed to apply. The criteria in the EU Code of Conduct are compatible with those which I announced in July 1997. At the same time there is a large degree of overlap between the two. It is clearly in the interests of Government Departments involved in assessing licence applications, British exporters and other interested parties that the criteria which are used should be set out as clearly and unambiguously as possible.
<P>

<a name="01026w13.html_para6">With immediate effect, therefore, the following consolidated criteria will be used in considering all individual applications for licences to export goods on the Military List, which forms Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994; advance approvals for promotion prior to formal application for an export licence; and licence applications for the export of dual-use goods as specified in Annexe 1 of Council Decision 94/942/CFSP when there are grounds for believing that the end-user of such goods will be the armed forces or internal security forces or similar entities in the recipient country, or that the goods will be used to produce arms or other goods on the Military List for such end-users. The criteria are based on those in the EU Code of Conduct, incorporating elements from the UK's national criteria where appropriate. As before, they will not be applied mechanistically but on a case-by-case basis, using judgment and commonsense. Neither the fact of this consolidation, nor any minor additions or amendments to the wording of the two sets of criteria used before, should be taken to imply any change in policy or in its application.
<P>

<a name="01026w13.html_para7">An export licence will not be issued if the arguments for doing so are outweighed by the need to comply with the UK's international obligations and commitments, by concern that the goods might be used for internal repression or international aggression, by the risks to regional stability or by other considerations as described in these criteria.

<a name="01026w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 New Year's Eve is regarded as a special occasion and licensing justices and the magistrates' courts may, on receipt of application, grant special orders of exemption under the Licensing Act 1964, allowing licensed premises and registered members' clubs to remain open beyond the normal permitted hours. There is no limit on the extension which may be granted. This has been the practice on every New Year's Eve in the years before the Millennium. All licensees and registered members' clubs wishing to apply for extensions should do so as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="01026w14.html_para1">This year 31 December falls on a Sunday. Permitted hours for pubs, nightclubs, restaurants and registered members' clubs in England and Wales on a Sunday normally end at 10.30 pm. The Magistrates' Association and the Justices' Clerks' Society have jointly issued guidance to the licensing justices and magistrates' courts suggesting that an extension to 12.30 am on New Year's Day morning would normally be appropriate. Magistrates will be able to determine what is appropriate for their local area and may determine a later time. Where extensions are granted, this will help people to enjoy a festive New Year as they have done in the past under similar procedures.
<P>

<a name="01026w14.html_para2">Because of the unique nature of last year's Millennium celebrations, permitted hours were extended nationally by amending the Licensing Act 1964 using a deregulation order, approved by Parliament, which came into force in July 1999. The Government had originally proposed applying this arrangement to all future New Year's Eves, but limited it to Millennium Eve after concerns expressed by the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee. The Millennium arrangements worked well; and the Government wanted to make a further deregulation order for this New Year's Eve, to provide a more typical test of the national extension. But in March the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee said in its Ninth Report (1999-2000 Parliamentary session, 15 March 2000) that they would be highly unlikely to support any further licensing deregulation ahead of general licensing reform. To bring an appropriate deregulation order into force before next New Year's Eve, under the timescales dictated by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 for mandatory public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, would have required the Government to initiate the process by the end of March. In July, the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee agreed to give consideration to a further proposal in respect of New Year's Eve. By then it was too late, consistent with the requirements of the 1994 Act, to bring forward a similar order which could come into effect for this New Year's Eve. In reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) on 20 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 329W, I made it clear that the timescales for statutory public consultation and the subsequent parliamentary process were dictated by the 1994 Act, and it was now unlikely that the process could be completed in time for next New Year. We examined whether, with the co-operation of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee and colleagues in both Houses, it was possible to obtain an Order in shorter time than that initially envisaged. We concluded that if we had done so it would have been open to legal challenge with an uncertain outcome. We have therefore decided against taking that course. We intend, however, to prepare such an order to 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 205W</I><P>
apply to New Year's Eve next year, which will then provide a further test of the success of a standard national exemption.
<P>

<a name="01026w14.html_para3">We remain wholly committed to the general reform of licensing law as described in the White Paper "Time for Reform", published in April this year, which would include provision for the Secretary of State to set appropriate opening times nationally for licensed premises for any special national celebrations.

Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) on 29 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 255W, which set out the background to the radical overhaul of asylum decision-making processes that this Government have undertaken. The Asylum Process Project/Vantagepoint Report was part of this process.
<P>

<a name="01026w15.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary agreed in principle that the fundamental changes to the process suggested in the report should be pursued, but it was never the intention that this should be done in isolation. Many changes had already been put in place, prior to the completion of the report, as part of our strategy to speed up processes across the asylum business as a whole.
<P>

<a name="01026w15.html_para3">Substantial improvements have already been made. IND has made almost 81,000 asylum decisions so far this calendar year, compared with less then 25,000 during the same period last year, an increase of 225 per cent. Decisions continue to outstrip intake and the backlog of initial decisions has fallen for eight consecutive months. The backlog is now 75,680. We remain on course to clear the backlog down to frictional levels by spring 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what contracts have been entered into with local authorities' regional consortia to provide accommodation for asylum seekers; how many units are to be provided by the regional consortia in <i>(a)</i> 2000-01 and <i>(b)</i> 2001-02; how the actual level of provision required differs from previous estimates given to local authorities; and if he will make a statement.  [134866]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Three contracts have been entered into by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) with Regional Consortia for provision of accommodation to asylum seekers. These are: with Glasgow City Council on behalf of the Scottish Consortium; with the North East Consortium; and with the Yorkshire and Humberside Consortium. The number of units that these contracts will provide is commercially confidential. During negotiations, the number of accommodation units to be provided under the contracts was discussed in the context of what was reasonable for Consortia to provide and what NASS's needs were likely to be.
<P>

<a name="01026w15.html_para4">The National Asylum Support Service recently revised some of the assumptions used to forecast accommodation requirements, based on its operational experience to date, with the result that the year's national forecast is now 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 210W</I><P>
some 44,000 bedspaces rather than 65,000. That revision did not alter the number of accommodation units provided under either of the two contracts already signed (with Scotland and the North East) or the one that has just been signed (with the Yorkshire and Humberside Consortium).
<P>

<a name="01026w15.html_para5">Where it has not yet entered into contracts with Regional Consortia, NASS is taking the change in assumptions into account when continuing negotiations. NASS will not contract for more accommodation than it judges necessary.

 It is the Government's current intention to exercise the order-making power to clause 65 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill so as to disapply the provisions of Part IV of the Bill in respect of Northern Ireland parties for an initial period of four years. However, before coming to a final view on this matter the Government will undertake a further round of consultations with the main Northern Ireland parties.

Members of the public can also obtain a free copy by calling a telephone response line. Already, since 1 October there have been over 18,000 such additional requests.

 The competition invited young people to explore the underlying principles of the Human Rights Act 1998 through the creative medium of their choice. It was managed on our behalf by the Citizenship Foundation, at a cost of &#163;23,113. A total of 7,234 schools and youth groups were invited to participate, all of whom received an information pack about the competition and the Human Rights Act. 280 formal entries, involving over 1,000 young people, were received. These included poetry, drama, posters, collages, songs, board games and websites. The advertisements that used the winning poem cost &#163;307,103 which also resulted in additional coverage by the media of the Human Rights Act launch. The standard of competition entries was high, and showed an impressive understanding by young people of the rights and responsibilities culture the Human Rights Act will help to develop. The competition as a whole played a valuable and successful part in our work to raise awareness of the Human Rights Act.

 The Government fully accept that the progress of scientific research; the development of new medical and veterinary drugs and technologies; and consumer and environmental safety continue to depend on the use of animals. Nevertheless, we are committed to ensuring that animals are used only where fully justified and where there are no alternatives. We will continue to work with the scientific community, industry and responsible animal welfare organisations to achieve this and to ensure that the costs and benefits of the use of animals in scientific research are fully explained.

 Non-human primates are used in regulatory testing to help ensure the safety of medicines and are also used for other important areas of fundamental research aimed primarily at better understanding the causes of disease in humans and developing potential new treatments. They contribute, for example, to programmes of work relating to Parkinson's disease, visual impairment, stroke, diabetes, disorders of reproduction and vaccine development. The 1986 Act requires that non-human primates are only used in scientific procedures if no other species is suitable.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para4">In deciding whether to grant a licence for any regulated procedure, the 1986 Act requires that the likely benefits of the programme be weighed against the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned (the cost/benefit assessment) and that there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed or refine the procedures to minimise suffering (the 3Rs). We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para5">The 1986 Act does not make provision for controlling the overall number of procedures. While we can ensure that the number of animals used in each programme of work is minimised, we cannot dictate how many applications for new project licences will be submitted, nor how many will satisfy the requirements of the cost/benefit assessment.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para6">The effectiveness of the Act cannot be judged by the overall number of procedures as the primary purpose of the Act is to reduce suffering.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para7">In addition to the rigorous application of the 3Rs we have gained the endorsement of Government Departments of the principle of data sharing and agreement that United Kingdom regulatory agencies should encourage industry to extend the scope for sharing animal test data in the field of regulatory safety testing. An inter-Departmental concordat has therefore been developed as a first step in this process and should enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals.

<a name="01026w17.html_para8">The use of alternatives is already widely encouraged. Indeed, the use of animals in procedures is prohibited by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in cases where a scientifically valid alternative is available.

<a name="01026w17.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what funding has been made available by his Department to projects in (1) England to combat incompetent and dishonest builders as part of crime initiatives;  [134853]
<P>
<UL>(2) Leeds to combat incompetent and dishonest builders as part of crime initiatives, and in what form.  [134852]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 As part of the Reducing Burglary Initiative, the Home Office has provided funding for a project in Leeds which is primarily aimed at reducing 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 217W</I><P>
distraction burglary (burglary artifice). One element of the project, however, is the creation of a 'check-point' scheme which will contain a list of approved contractors who provide a reliable service at a reasonable cost. &#163;131,000 has been identified specially for this element of the project.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para9">Matters relating to the construction industry generally and moves to improve the service offered to the public by builders are a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I support work currently being undertaken by his Department to tackle the problem.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w17.html_wqn4"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), 14 April 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 292W, if he will provide a breakdown, by major category, of the weekly unit cost of housing an asylum seeker at Oakington reception centre <i>(a)</i> at present and <i>(b)</i> when the centre is operating at full capacity; and if he will provide a breakdown of the costs incurred in establishing Oakington reception centre.  [134855]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Oakington was set up in March 2000 with an initial capacity of 144 beds. Asylum seekers were taken in on a carefully phased programme. The set up costs to date amount to about &#163;5 million and are expected to reach &#163;6 million.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para10">In September (the last full month for which figures are available), the average daily population was 101 and the weekly unit cost was &#163;2,700. Occupancy has since increased rapidly and is now 176 resulting in a reduction in the unit cost which will continue to fall as the population increases to full capacity. When operating at full capacity, the cost would be &#163;800 per person.
<P>

<a name="01026w17.html_para11">These figures are higher than those given in the reply to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) on 14 April. The first figure in that reply was based on the cost of an available space. It appears that the second figure may not have included all the costs of the establishment.

<P>
<a name="01026w18.html_wqn0"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the new agenda for reform of the police, discussed at his meeting with the Prime Minister on 26 June; and if it has been discussed with representatives of the police force.  [134861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Calls for a Royal Commission or reforms of policing by other means have come from a number of police sources. On 9 October, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, held a seminar with the leaders of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities, the Police Superintendents' Association, the Police Federation and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Its purpose was to identify the areas in which the police service itself felt there was a need for change and development to meet future requirements. Further discussions with police representative bodies will take place over coming months to explore in more detail a wide range of issues identified 



<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2000 : Column: 218W</I><P>
at the seminar. As was made clear to seminar participants, the Government have no pre-set agenda but are interested in making any improvements which will help achieve our objective of crime reduction.

<P>
<a name="01026w18.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) when the criminal conviction certificate, criminal record certificate and enhanced criminal record certificate will be introduced; and if he will make a statement;  [134473]
<P>
<UL>(2) what information from a person's criminal record will be disclosed on the enhanced criminal record certificate; and if he will make a statement;  [134472]
<P>
(3) what information from a person's criminal record may be disclosed to potential employers and external immigration agencies; and if he will make a statement;  [134474]
<P>
(4) what information from a person's criminal record will be disclosed on the criminal record certificate; and if he will make a statement;  [134471]
<P>
(5) if a fixed penalty fine for a speeding offence will appear on the criminal conviction certificate, criminal record certificate and the enhanced criminal record certificate; and if he will make a statement.  [134475]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01026w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau will issue to individual applicants, on request, one or more of three different levels of certificate, according to the circumstances of the job or position in question:
<P>

<a name="01026w18.html_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A criminal conviction certificate (CCC), which will show all convictions which are not 'spent' under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w18.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A criminal record certificate (CCC), which will contain details of both spent and unspent convictions, and cautions, reprimands and final warnings, recorded at national level and will be issued only where the job or position requires this level of disclosure;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w18.html_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An enhanced criminal record certificate (ECRC), which, in addition to the information in a criminal record certificate, will contain relevant information from local police records, and will be issued only where a further restricted group of particularly sensitive jobs or positions so require.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01026w18.html_para3">Data on convictions will, in the main, be drawn directly from the Police National Computer. Fixed penalties are not recorded there, but it is possible that the police might consider that information about such a case, drawn from local police records, was relevant to the job for which the person had applied and should be included in an ECRC.
<P>

<a name="01026w18.html_para4">The immigration authorities of overseas countries will be able to ask potential emigrants from Britain for a criminal conviction certificate, but the CRB will not provide criminal record certificates or enhanced criminal record certificates for emigration purposes, except in certain circumstances where it can be demonstrated that the emigrant is being considered for a post for which such certificates would be issued if it were in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="01026w18.html_para5">Detailed planning is continuing, but at present it is expected that the CRB will begin issuing CRCs and ECRCs from around July 2001, and CCCs from around July 2002.
