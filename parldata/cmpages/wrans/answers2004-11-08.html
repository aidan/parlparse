 In July 2002, our Common Land Policy Statement set out proposals for addressing the main barriers to the sustainable management of common land. One of our key aims is to enable commoners to manage their own activities more effectively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the purpose was of the action against Frontline Technologies Limited (European patent UK MO 0 664 061); what the cost to the Government was of the case; how much of this was borne by the Department; and what the outcome of the case was.  [190292R]</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="41108w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 October 2004]:</i> My Department issued proceedings against Frontline Technology Limited to challenge the validity of European Patent UK MO 0 664 061 which covers the process of exchanging student data over a wireless network using portable computers and transceivers in an educational environment. The patent encompasses a wide range of school activity including, for example, wireless electronic pupil registration and attendance management systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41108w06.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_36">These proceedings were primarily brought because the patent restricted schools&#039; access to a full range of technology. Additionally, my Department assessed the potential additional costs to schools for licence fees, based on Frontline Technology&#039;s published terms and scale of charges, to be substantial over the life of the patent to 2013.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41108w06.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_37">The costs of the litigation are subject to negotiation between the parties and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to cite a figure for those costs. However, the litigation costs incurred to date are a fraction of the potential cost that schools could have incurred by way of licence fees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41108w06.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_38">The written judgment of the patent court (Deputy Judge David Young) was handed down on 17 June 2004. My Department substantially won its case thus giving greater freedom to schools to buy wireless products and services of their choice, reducing costs for schools and stimulating the wireless technology market through greater competition. Frontline Technology Limited has applied to amend its patent by way of a statutory procedure. My Department is challenging the scope of the proposed amendment.

 The Government made it clear, in &quot;Keeping Children Safe: The Government&#039;s response to the Victoria Climbi&#233; Inquiry Report and Joint Chief Inspectors&#039; Report Safeguarding Children&quot;, that in the short to medium term, the training materials commissioned to accompany the booklet &quot;What To Do If You&#039;re Worried A Child Is Being Abused&quot; would include a section on child protection registers. In the longer term, as the Integrated Children&#039;s System becomes widely used, it will allow staff to identify those children who, for example, have been the subject of inquiries into whether they are at risk of suffering, or have suffered, significant harm, have been the subject of a child protection conference, or are the subject of a child protection plan. The child protection register will therefore no longer be necessary. It can then be discontinued as a separate register at a date to be agreed when the Integrated Children&#039;s System has been fully introduced across England and Wales.

 The Government are very keen to encourage individuals to take out private pensions. We have introduced stakeholder pensions, a low charge, flexible and portable pension arrangement as an alternative option to personal pensions, which can be costly and inflexible.

1. Numbers of calls are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

2. Table 1 does not include calls to the pension credit application line.<br>

3. In both tables, the numbers of calls answered, abandoned and engaged (blocked) are not calculated on precisely the same basis and in some cases the rows will not add up to exactly 100 per cent.<br>

4. The number of calls to the application line which received the engaged tone or a recorded message was high in August as a result of the telephone system being down for a time.<br>

5. The number of calls received by the application line is a measure of the total number of calls from customers made to the application line number 0800 99 1234. The number of calls answered within 30 seconds is a measure of all calls answered in application line sites and excludes any calls abandoned by the customer.<br>

6. The number of calls to the application line abandoned includes only calls abandoned after the customer has received the recorded message.<br>

 Although it is difficult to accurately calculate the numbers of people displaced in Darfur, Western Sudan, the latest United Nations Humanitarian Profile estimates that approximately 1.6 million people are internally displaced within Darfur as a result of the crisis. The regional breakdown of this figure is 218,000 in North Darfur, 539,000 in South Darfur, and 653,000 in West Darfur.

 It is very difficult to provide accurate monthly figures of mortality in Darfur in 2004, given that there was very little access to large proportions of the Darfur in the early part of this year. The latest projections provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) indicate that between 35,000 and 70,000 deaths occurred between March and September. In presenting these figures, WHO stated that further work was needed to estimate what proportion of these deaths were due to different causes, though it perceived that most were due to diarrhoeal diseases exacerbated by malnutrition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41108w11.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_82">The large variation in these figures is due to the fact that they are based on the findings of the WHO&#039;s retrospective mortality survey, which only covered North and West Darfur. Assessment in South Darfur was hampered by insecurity. The WHO found that between 15 June and 15 August, the crude mortality rate was 1.5 deaths per 10,000 per day in North Darfur and was 2.9 deaths per 10,000 people per day in South Darfur. Based on the numbers of internally displaced persons at the time, WHO estimated that between 6,000 and 10,000 people were dying per month.

Notes:<br>

Data for 1997 is currently only available from a different survey which is discontinuous with the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). Data from ASHE will not be available until later 2004 following a QA process.<br>

The table provides data on the average gross weekly earnings for full time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay for the pay period was unaffected by absence, who worked in North Southwark and Bermondsey, Camberwell and Peckham and Dulwich or West Norwood, for the years 2001 to 2004.<br>

The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, (ASHE), carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes.<br>

The ASHE replaces the New Earnings Survey (NES) from October 2004. The main difference between the ASHE and NES being that estimates are weighted to population totals from the Labour Force Survey.<br>

Gross weekly earnings for Adult Full-Time Employees whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.<br>

ASHE results for 2004 have been produced on 2 separate basis. Firstly a similar basis to 2003 for comparison purposes labelled as 2004exc and also including a range of new supplementary surveys designed to improve the coverage labelled 2004inc, which is our best estimates of the level of earnings in 2004.<br>

 Public service delivery is at the heart of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. Putting people at the centre of the Department&#039;s work is a vital component in our vision for better quality service. Justice for all is as central to the objectives of this Government as is education for all and health care for all. So since the creation of the Department for Constitutional Affairs in June 2003 we have been working to make sure that the Department delivers for the people who use its services&#151;especially in our justice system, where people seeking redress either against crime or against civil injustices are at the centre of what the system exists to achieve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41108w26.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_195">That means offering particular support to victims, to witnesses and to jurors. It means improving and reforming our justice system and our legal system to make sure that they offer the best possible help to those who make use of them. It means making our courts work better so that the public&#039;s confidence can be raised. A vital part of that will be the creation in April next year of a unified courts administration&#151;for the first time, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Nov 2004 : Column 529W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
bringing all courts together administratively. It means making sure, for example, that the market for legal services is working as well as it should be. It was for this reason we established a far-reaching review of legal services headed by Sir David Clementi, which will report shortly. It is also why we have established a fundamental review of our legal aid system. The new consumer strategy review within the DCA will also help to make sure that we put people first in all that we do.

<p>
<a name="41108w26.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_196">We believe that these and a range of other steps are contributing to the quality of public service, which this Department is committed to deliver, and to people&#039;s confidence in those services. There is a great deal more to do. But we believe that we have made a good start.

 A major public awareness campaign is being planned by the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) to address the full range of issues posed by implementation of a national health service care records service (NHS CRS) and to ensure that NHS patients know their rights and how information about them can be used within the health service. This campaign will commence in 2005 and will run for a number of years. To maximise the impact of the campaign, relevant information will be made 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Nov 2004 : Column 538W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
available to NHS staff and to the public record in each local health community in the months running up to the go-live date for the NHS CRS.

<a name="stpa_204">The campaign will comprise written materials in various languages, web resources, and training tools and a media pack for health communities to use according to their local circumstances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41108w28.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_205">A key component of the NPfIT relates to the access controls that will protect data. Patients will be able to restrict who may see different elements of the data that is held about them and may choose to opt-out of having any data shared through the new systems. The Data Protection Act 1998 also provides patients with the right to object to the processing of data that can identify them where this may cause them substantial damage or distress. The NPfIT is considering how this right should apply to implementation of the NHS CRS.

 The General Medical Council (GMC) is currently in the process of consulting on proposed guidance for United Kingdom doctors undergoing revalidation, which it intend to introduce from July 2005.

We have supported this through central investment in pilot work across a number of national health service trusts over recent years. We have disseminated the lessons we learned across the NHS.
