We encourage partner governments to ensure that as wide a range as possible of stakeholders participate in the consultations on national poverty reduction strategies, including groups representing disabled people. Issues of social exclusion and targeted interventions for excluded groups will be addressed in the discussions our Country Offices will have with governments on developing 10 year plans for education.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60503w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID has engaged extensively with the pharmaceutical industry as part of our work to increase access to medicines in developing countries. In January 2005, we published a set of recommendations for the industry, that specifically looked at pricing policies, investment in research and development for diseases affecting developing countries, and ways of working in developing countries. These recommendations built on existing good practice in the industry. Many companies have made significant progress in making their medicines more available and affordable in developing countries.

To date, our discussions have focused on major communicable diseases such as HIV, malaria and TB, and on neglected tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness. However, discussions with the industry have also emphasised the degree to which treatments for non-communicable diseases such as cancers really should also be the subject of differential pricing offers given the significant public health needs in developing countries. There are in fact higher rates of cervical cancer deaths in Ghana than in the UK.

 The Department has had discussions with both the horticultural and farming industries on this subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_11">The horticulture sector is making efforts on a number of fronts to reduce carbon emissions. Under the new Climate Change Agreement, growers will be entitled to an 80 per cent. discount on the levy provided they meet prescribed energy saving targets. Under the new Energy Scheme, it is possible for businesses to claim capital allowances on items such as thermal screens and insulation, variable speed pumps, certain heating equipment (including combined heat and power plant) and lighting. In addition, both Defra and the Horticultural Development Council carry out research 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 May 2006 : Column 1561W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
into energy efficiency issues and the Carbon Trust (funded by Defra) provides advice and organises free energy services to assist in the identification of energy saving steps that can be implemented in nurseries.

<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_12">The Government are very much aware of the link between farming and the environment. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFFS) was launched in England in 2002 and sets out the basis for a new relationship in which Government works in partnership with the farming industry in England to make farmers more market, and less subsidy focused, while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_13">Achievements under SFFS include: CAP reform which, by breaking the link between subsidy and production, means there is no incentive to overproduce; the cross compliance element of the Single Payment Scheme where subsidies are linked to the delivery of environmental and animal welfare standards; the launch of Environmental Stewardship to which all farmers are eligible to apply to earn payments for undertaking environmental management of their land; and the launch of the Rural Developments Service Farm Advice Unit which oversees delivery of technical and environmental advice to farmers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_14">In addition, the Department is working closely with the agricultural industry to reduce it&#039;s contribution to climate change. The Department has set up the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory to monitor, and where possible anticipate, changes in agriculture and at farm level, and to asses consequent implications for the environment. A Stakeholder Advisory Group has been set up with the aim of advising priorities for the work of the programme, providing feedback on emerging results and their implications, identifying new and emerging areas on which the Observatory could usefully focus their work and to provide a channel of communication with a wider stakeholder community. Further information can be found on Defra&#039;s website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/observatory/background.htm
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_15">A vital element of Defra&#039;s policy on agriculture and climate change is to raise awareness within the industry of the issues and possible actions to be taken.

 The agriculture and forestry sector contributes 7 per cent. of UK greenhouse gas emissions.

 The Department is in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss a whole range of issues related to bio-energy, including the impacts on biodiversity. Most transport biofuel feedstocks will be grown in rotation as part of a mix of several crops on the farm. Production from a mix of feedstocks and replacing crops for food would have a neutral effect on biodiversity. Any replacement of spring sown break crops with winter oilseed rape would have a negative effect on crop diversity and farmland birds. If arable crops replaced natural-regeneration set-aside, this would reduce habitat diversity. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for bioethanol production without significantly affecting biodiversity.

In particular, the amendments would enable potential successors to a tenancy to carry out diversified activities on a holding with the consent of the landlord, without jeopardising the right to succession to the tenancy.

<i>[holding answer 26 April 2006]:</i> The national Market Towns Initiative (MTI) was launched in FY 2000&#150;01 and provided &#163;32 million to Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), and &#163;5 million to the Countryside Agency (CA) to support community-led market town regeneration in the regions. The initiative was therefore not established as a national funding programme, but as a means of enabling regional partnerships to target towns in their region according to regionally agreed selection criteria. The aim was to provide support to 100 towns but, by the time the national initiative ended in FY 2003&#150;04, over 230 towns had benefited.

Currently only one RCC, the West Midlands RCC, is working at full capacity and it has an established system for monitoring consistency and timeliness of sign setting to support the Agency&#039;s goal of demonstrably improving the accuracy of VMS.

 The total overall spend on all adult programmes for 2004&#150;05 was reported in the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC) Annual Report and Accounts as &#163;2,999 million. Our planned funding for the LSC&#039;s major programmes only for adults for 2005&#150;06 is &#163;2,942 million and for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;2,946 million. Estimated spend on smaller programmes and experience of the previous two years suggests final funding for adults will be in the order of &#163;3.2 billion each year. On 1 October 2005 the Government set out their priorities for post-16 education and training. This established our priorities for the learning and skills sector and the impact on funding in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. While overall spend on adult learning will remain broadly constant the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training. We have consistently said that public funding alone cannot and should not pay for all the training necessary in a competitive economy. To support this shift, there has to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 May 2006 : Column 1593W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
be a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners so we do not accept that withdrawal of LSC funding means that courses automatically have to close. Where provision is valued by learners, where it is high quality, and where learners and employers are prepared to pay more, we expect colleges to consider providing courses on a full-cost recovery basis.

 There are no plans to amend the provisions for people who live with close relatives.

 The target for financial savings from the Department in the Spending Review 2004 was not linked directly to particular functional groups but rather illustrated categories of activity that would be planned to contribute to the total from changes planned in the Department.

These assumptions are subject to change as plans develop to ensure that we maintain and improve customer services and achieve our PSA and efficiency targets.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to his Answer of 1 February 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 547&#150;8W, on European public procurement law, what changes the two new European Commission public procurement directives made to public procurement procedures in the UK; and what estimate his Department has made of the financial effects on small and medium-sized enterprises of these changes.  [66949]</p>




<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60503w16.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> The new procurement directives, simplify, clarify and modernise public procurement procedures. These were implemented in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2006. There are new provisions on framework agreements, competitive dialogue for complex procurements, central purchasing bodies and electronic procurement methods such as e-auctions and dynamic purchasing systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w16.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">The directives allow contracts to be reserved for supported factories and businesses, and provide greater clarity on the extent to which social and environmental issues can be incorporated into procurements. There is also a requirement for the mandatory exclusion of companies that have been convicted of offences related to fraud and corruption. The rules applying to purchases by utilities now incorporate an exclusion mechanism where a sector is subject to normal competition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w16.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_137">Concerning the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the new directives, and the regulations that implement them, apply rules directly to purchasers rather than to suppliers. There are, therefore, no compliance costs to business from these new rules. The new procurement methods that the rules provide for, including electronic systems, together with the simpler and clearer rules generally, reduce the burdens of the procurement process and should encourage suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in public procurement opportunities either directly or as sub contractor.
