Government have concluded that the best course is to proceed with plans for the modernisation of the underground, to create a 21st century tube which will be publicly run and privately built. I will today be asking London Underground to move quickly to progress negotiations, subject to the requirements to ensure safety, so that work can start as soon as possible. In doing this, and as a result of the discussions with Bob Kiley, London Underground plan to make a number of changes to deliver better public sector control, particularly in the area of safety.

Such widening will be a key element in meeting our objective to reduce road congestion on the inter-urban network and in large urban areas in England below current levels by 2010 by promoting integrated transport solutions and investing in public transport and the road network.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A strategy for improvements to this section of the A5 was developed following the publication of the Inspector's Report on the Public Inquiry into the Hinckley and Bosworth Local Plan. This strategy indicated the need for improvements to the road as a result of development proposals identified in the Plan and preliminary consultation, undertaken in June 1999, identified a number of possible improvement schemes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The enclosed leaflet sets out the broad programme although there have been a number of changes since it was published in March. Work is likely to start in the Autumn on two developer-funded schemes, the provision of roundabouts at Nutts Lane and Sketchley Lane, and we hope to start work this financial year on improving signing at Hinckley Railway Bridge and on the traffic signs at Stretton House Bends. Other developer funded schemes, including Dodwells roundabout and proposals at Wolvey Road and the M69 junction, are less advanced and will be dependent in part on the developers' timescales.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>More recently, work has started on the preparation of the Route Management Strategy for the trunk road corridor between the M1 and the A38 in the Midlands, including this length of the A5. This was mentioned in Gwyn Drake's letter to you of 19th January. This will look at the corridor as a whole and will recommend a range of highway improvements for inclusion in future works programmes. It will also review some of the improvements identified in the preliminary consultation, such as the pedestrian and cycle path on the north side of the A5 between the M69 and the Longshoot junction, and enhancements including "no waiting" restrictions, a 40 mph speed limit and street lighting. Public consultation is expected to start early in 2002, with the final strategy being published June.</FONT></UL>

 Draft Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) is drawn up by the Regional Planning Body for each region and includes proposed rates of housing provision. Once the RPG has been confirmed by the Secretary of State following public examination, the presumption is that the rates of housing provision are carried through into structure plans or Unitary Development Plans. The housing provision for each region is no longer set as an inflexible long-term target for housebuilding based on a 'predict and provide' methodology but is expressed as an annual rate of provision for additional dwellings which is subject to regular monitoring and review. The level of housing provision is monitored by the regional planning body with the expectation that it will be reviewed every five years, or sooner if necessary.

<a name="10705w02.html_para0">RPGs for East Anglia and the south-east were issued in November 2000 and March 2001 respectively. The regional planning body in the west midlands is currently preparing new draft RPG.

 The Secretary of State has introduced a wide-ranging programme of modernisation for local government. We are committed to supporting the capacity of local government to deliver on this programme. The development of best practice is seen as an important element of such support.
<P>

<a name="10705w02.html_para3">We have strengthened the Improvement and Development Agency, particularly through the creation of the Performance Support Unit, and we continue to support the Local Government Improvement Programme. We have enhanced the Audit Commission's role in audit and inspection, particularly through the Best Value Inspection Service. The IDeA and the BVIS have key roles in sharing best practice.

<a name="10705w02.html_para4">The DTLR offers help to local authorities directly through (among others) its Modernisation Team, a group of senior staff with local authority experience who work in every region of the country to support councils as they introduce modernisation.
<P>

<a name="10705w02.html_para5">The Department is involved in many other initiatives. Examples include the introduction of Local Public Service Agreements. Local PSAs provide councils with the opportunity to discuss with Government Departments new ideas for improving services and try them out. Ideas that work will naturally be of interest to other councils.

 A public inquiry will be held this September into the appeal by Rockingham Speedway against some of the conditions imposed by East Northamptonshire council in its permission of October last year. In addition, the council has resolved to take enforcement action to ensure compliance with other conditions. However the Department is not aware of any grounds to suggest the council's consideration of this case requires investigation.

 The RAF, like several NATO air forces, currently has a shortfall of experienced fast jet pilots. The opportunity to recruit former Royal New Zealand Air Force pilots (who become surplus to requirements as a result of the New Zealand Government's decision to reconfigure their armed forces to undertake peacekeeping duties) is therefore of interest to the RAF. Details of the personnel directly affected by the restructuring have yet to be released by the New Zealand Defence Staff. The RAF are closely monitoring the evolving situation and senior British officers have been in contact with their opposite numbers in Wellington to highlight employment opportunities in the RAF.

 The operational advantages offered by systems such as Link 16 are well recognised. The capability is already fitted in some aircraft types and it will be fitted more widely in our aircraft and ships. As with any defence equipment capability, decisions have to be made about priorities. Link 16 is not currently planned to be fitted to Tornado GR4 or Harrier GR7 aircraft as we have higher operational priorities.

 The Prison Service is keen to work with outside contractors to provide increased and better quality employment opportunities for prisoners, where local circumstances permit. However, the primary aim of regimes for prisoners is to address their offending behaviour and improve their employability so as to reduce the risk that they will re-offend on release. It is important that regimes provide a mix of offending behaviour, drugs treatment and educational programmes and resettlement activities as well as work and vocational training.

 The Declaration of Commitment adopted by 189 delegations at the 26th Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly sets out a global consensus on future actions necessary to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The Declaration does not clearly identify those individuals and groups at highest risk of infection because of blocking action by a group of states.

Other countries must follow their example.

<a name="10705w09.html_para3">Progress is being made against all targets although current trends are not enough to achieve all of them in every region of the world. The income poverty target looks as if it will be met, thanks notably to progress in the large countries of Asia, but some countries are moving less fast. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has stagnated for most of the past decade though some African Governments have made significant progress in reducing poverty.

Industrialised countries must work for a stronger commitment in global institutions and agreements to the systematic reduction of poverty. Development assistance needs to increase and be deployed more effectively on building national capacity to meet the IDTs. Globalisation must be managed if its effects are to benefit the poorest people in the poorest countries. DFID's approach to this is set out in our White Paper published last December, a copy of which is also in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="10705w09.html_para7">DFID is widely seen as playing a leading role in the drive towards the international development targets.

 The fixed term directive is due to be implemented by 10 July 2001, but provides that member states may take up to an extra year to implement if they encounter special difficulties. The public consultation on the implementation of this directive in the UK closed on 31 May and the responses have shown that there are particular difficulties with the implementation of the directive in this country. In particular, the relative lack of existing legal provisions on fixed term contracts in the UK has made it difficult to establish how they are used. We shall therefore be taking extra time to implement the fixed term directive and have notified the European Commission accordingly. Before deciding to take extra time to implement the Directive, we consulted with 



<P>

 Decisions on the provision of transitional financial assistance for rural sub-post offices will be taken in the context of advice from the Postal Services Commission which we expect to receive in the autumn in line with the recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit report. Earlier this year, a new Government fund, with a funding allocation for the current financial year, was announced to help with the costs of relocating and refurbishing rural post offices. Universal banking services is a Post Office based approach which will ensure that those benefit and pension recipients who wish to continue to collect their benefits in cash, in full, across a post office counter, will be able to do so.

<a name="10705w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The rule that pensions and other benefits should be reduced when the beneficiary is in hospital has been in force since the National Insurance Scheme was introduced. There is no reduction during the first six weeks in hospital. Thereafter the amount of Retirement Pension is reduced by 20 per cent. of the basic pension rate for those with a dependant and by 39 per cent. for all other cases. (40 per cent. prior to 9 April 2001). The amount of Retirement Pension reduces to 20 per cent. after 52 weeks. No one receives less than 20 per cent. of the basic State Pension.

<P>

<a name="10705w12.html_para4">The Department's consultation paper noted that, while some users would pay lesser charges or cease to pay charges as a result of the draft guidance, better off users might reasonably be expected to pay higher charges.

<a name="10705w13.html_para1">In addition, local primary care services will be able to provide appropriate support to children and families suffering any adverse psychological problems resulting from measures taken on farms to eradicate foot and mouth disease. The Department for Education and Skills has also issued information on the implications of foot and mouth for schools, in order to help minimise the impact on pupils' schooling. This includes guidance on making arrangements for attendance recording, educational trips games fixtures and national tests. The Department for Education and Skills also worked closely with the GCSE/ A-level awarding bodies to allow special considerations to apply where students' participation in exams or completing coursework was affected.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2001]:</i> There will be an inquiry, when the disease is finally over. We have always said we are keen to learn the lessons from this outbreak. The precise nature and scope of the inquiry will, as such, be a matter for the Prime Minister.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2001]:</i> All cloven-hoofed animals, including deer, are susceptible to foot and mouth disease. Wild deer tend to show mild or unapparent disease, resembling the disease in sheep, although some species (eg roe deer and muntjak deer in the UK) may be severely affected.

<P>

<a name="10705w13.html_para3">Deer can be carriers of the foot and mouth virus, and could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However, the Department's current veterinary risk assessment indicates that the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of foot and mouth disease is very low. There are therefore no plans at this stage to control wild deer populations, although as more information becomes available about the epidemiology of the disease in areas where there are wild deer, the risk assessment will be updated.
<P>

<a name="10705w13.html_para4">As of 2 July more than 60 samples have been submitted to the Institute of Animal Health for testing from various parts of England and Scotland. All have tested negative for evidence of the foot and mouth virus, antigens or antibodies.

<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what circumstances she has contingency plans to authorise a programme of vaccination against foot and mouth.  [1492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2001]:</i> The Government would be prepared to authorise a programme of vaccination based on the advice of the Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Veterinary Officer. At an earlier stage of the outbreak, their advice was to vaccinate cattle in Cumbria and Devon provided the campaign had the substantial support of farmers, consumers, veterinarians, and the food trade. That level of support was simply not

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment the Government have made of the implementation of animal welfare standards during the culling of livestock during the foot and mouth disease outbreak.  [2195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All animals culled during the current foot and mouth disease outbreak were required to be killed in accordance with the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (WASK). These regulations are enforced outside slaughterhouses by veterinary officers of the State Veterinary Service. To the best of our knowledge the vast majority of animals were dealt with humanely and in compliance with WASK. The few cases brought to our attention where it was alleged that animals had not been dealt with humanely have been investigated and appropriate action taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the extent to which the current foot and mouth virus type is spread by <i>(a)</i> air and <i>(b)</i> movements of people and vehicles.  [347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Analyses have been completed for the first 1,706 infected farms, and epidemiological investigations are continuing on the most recent cases to determine the source of infection and method of spread. Seven farms are considered to have been infected as a result of windborne spread over several kilometres. This low number is thought to be because only 10 pig herds have become infected during the epidemic.
<P>

<a name="10705w13.html_para5">Short distance aerosol spread cannot be distinguished from other causes of local spread within 3 km of infected premises, which accounts for 81 per cent. of cases. In these cases there are often a number of possible means of spread such as using common facilities, contaminated roadways and movement of people and farm vehicles. In addition, however, 83 cases have been specifically associated with lorry movements or movements of people.

and mouth disease were negative after 24 hours, but were subsequently found to be positive.  [38]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is correct that a laboratory test which is negative or inconclusive at 48 hours may give a positive result at 96 hours. This is because some samples may contain a very small amount of virus and it can take a second passage of 48 hours in inoculated cell cultures for the virus to be amplified to a level where it will give a clear result. Each cell passage takes 48 hours&#151;ie 96 hours in total.
<P>

<a name="10705w13.html_para8">Of a total of 1,551 tissue samples which have tested positive for foot and mouth disease virus, 1,310 were confirmed in less than 24 hours and 241 were found to be positive after 24 hours. It is not possible to provide similar data for blood samples submitted together with tissue samples because when tissue samples were found positive the testing of the blood samples ceased.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many farms in Worcestershire are still on form D restrictions around farms now known not to have foot and mouth disease as a result of laboratory tests.  [44]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information is only available for Hereford and Worcester. As at 2 July, 119 farms are under form D restrictions, contiguous to 66 infected premises. Of those 66, 43 were tested, of which 30 returned negative laboratory results. These 30 cases remain designated as infected premises.
<P>

<a name="10705w13.html_para9">An infected premises is one where foot and mouth disease has either been diagnosed by a vet on the farm, supported by convincing clinical evidence, or where disease is found after testing. However, a negative laboratory result does not necessarily mean that the disease was not present and does not change the status of an infected premises confirmed on clinical diagnosis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the number of premises infected with foot and mouth disease as a result of allowing animals to enter the West Midlands via Penrith, Longtown, Welshpool and Ross markets.  [40]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The relatively widespread distribution of infected premises has been due to the movement of infected sheep through markets and the subsequent mixing and further sales through dealers and markets before 23 February. Without this widespread dissemination the number of infected premises would have been considerably smaller.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many rural tourism businesses have <i>(a)</i> applied for and <i>(b)</i> been granted relief from business rates in connection with the impact of foot and mouth disease.  [133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w13.html_spnew13"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The data provided by the local authorities which administer the rate relief scheme do not distinguish between different classes of business, so the question cannot be answered in precisely the terms of the question. The background is that local authorities have powers to grant rate relief to businesses suffering financial hardship. Normally, the Government meet 75 per cent. of the cost of this and authorities the remaining 25 per cent., but in order to alleviate the problems of foot and mouth disease, central Government agreed to pay 95 per cent. of the cost: to 151 rural authorities; for the three months April&#151;June; and for the properties with a rateable value (RV) of &#163;12,000 or less.
<P>

<a name="10705w13.html_para12">The Local Government Association has provided us with the results of the most recent survey, which showed that 46 worst affected local authorities, have received 4,832 applications for rate relief. 41 authorities have so far approved 1,589 cases; in many cases local authorities are still considering applications. Many are also deferring ratepayers' payments. In conjunction with colleagues in other Government Departments, I shall be monitoring the take-up of this scheme.

 Products that are presented for the treatment or prevention of disease in animals, or which have that function must be authorised under the terms of the Marketing Authorisations for Veterinary Medicinal Products Regulations 1994 before they can be legally sold or supplied in the United Kingdom. This ensures that such products are properly assessed and are demonstrated as being safe, of consistent good quality and effective when used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The manufacturer of any such products may apply for such authorisation. No such application has been made for Borax. The onus for providing evidence that supports the need for research into the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies, including Borax, against foot and mouth disease lies with the manufacturer.

<P>

<a name="10705w14.html_para0">Foot and mouth disease virus can be excreted in milk before animals show clinical signs of the disease. Unpasteurised milk is therefore a potent source of infection, and any milk produced in an Infected Area is required to be heat treated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Nuclear power plays a role in helping the UK to meet our climate change targets. The Government believe that existing nuclear power stations should continue to contribute to the electricity supply and to the reduction of emissions, as long as they can do so to the high safety and environmental standards that are currently observed.
<P>

<a name="10705w14.html_para1">Nuclear output is however expected to decline from around 2005 onwards, as the older stations begin to close. Electricity generation is therefore likely to become more carbon-intensive unless other low or zero carbon energy sources can be developed. There are currently no proposals for new nuclear power stations in the UK, largely due to nuclear's inability to compete on cost grounds with other types of generation. Issues related to waste disposal and public acceptability would also need to be resolved before industry put forward any proposals for approval. The Government will shortly be publishing a consultation document on radioactive waste policy. 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2001 : Column: 282W</I><P>
Internationally, the industry is addressing disposal issues through its research and development programmes into current and future technology, recognising that they need to be addressed effectively if nuclear power is to remain an option in the future.
<P>

<a name="10705w14.html_para2">The Government announced on 25 June that the performance and innovation unit is undertaking a review of the longer term, strategic issues, including those of climate change, surrounding energy policy within the context of ensuring secure, diverse and sustainable energy supplies at competitive prices.

<P>
<a name="10705w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No. Samples of blood taken for testing are potentially contaminated with foot and mouth disease virus, which is a specified pathogen controlled under the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO). No one may possess a specified animal pathogen or material which contains a specified pathogen unless they are licensed to do so under SAPO and have the necessary facilities to ensure the safe containment of the pathogen concerned in relation to the risk it poses.

 The number of veterinary surgeons employed by the state veterinary service at 1 January each year since 1979, is given in the table. The hon. Member may wish to know that since this date the state veterinary service has changed several times. The Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), which previously formed part of the state veterinary service, became the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) in April 1990. The CVL figures are incorporated in this return for the years 1 January 1980 to 1 January 1990. From 1990 the figures do not include the CVL. The Veterinary Investigation Service became part of the VLA on 1 October 1995 and is not included in these figures from that date. In 2000, there were 99 veterinarians employed by VLA. Much of the information presented here previously appeared on 27 February 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 323&#150;24W.
<P>

<a name="10705w14.html_para5">Of the 286 full-time equivalent veterinarians employed by the state veterinary service, 220 are employed as field veterinary officers. The work of these officers is supplemented by about 100 Temporary Veterinary Inspectors (TVIs) from the private sector in normal times.

 Data are not collected on the number of hospital doctors who leave the National Health Service. The number of unrestricted principals or equivalents (who most people will have as their general practitioner) who left the NHS for any reason between 1996&#150;97 and 1999&#150;2000 is in the table. Doctors who 'left' include resignations, retirements and short-term career breaks. Some of these doctors will 'rejoin' the NHS at a later date.

 Total expenditure by my Department on lifelong learning will increase from &#163;11.6 billion in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;14.7 billion in 2003&#150;04, an increase of 18 per cent. in real terms. We are also seeking to expand the investment made by individuals and employers in lifelong learning through Individual Learning Accounts and other measures. This is against a background of a forecast increase in total Government expenditure on education in the UK from 4.8 per cent. to 5.3 per cent. of GDP over the same period.

 Widening participation is a key goal for this Government. We want half of all young people to have the opportunity to benefit from higher education by the end of the decade. In this spending review the Higher Education Funding Council for England have allocated &#163;550 million to widen participation over the next three years. In addition the Excellence Challenge will put &#163;90 million into schools and further education colleges. We shall continue to consider what further steps we need to take to tackle the barriers that inhibit the widening of participation in higher education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10705w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 A range of measures is in place to encourage suitable people into teaching. Improved funding for schools and increased starting salaries have helped to bring about an extra 12,600 teachers in maintained schools in England between January 1998 and January 2001. But greater expectations and extra resources in the system have created more teaching posts and vacancies still exist. Training bursaries worth &#163;6,000 have been introduced to attract more graduates into teaching, with new style golden hellos of &#163;4,000 for those who go on to teach in shortage subjects. London weighting allowances have been lifted by 30 per cent and recruitment and retention allowances of up to &#163;5,085 are now available to schools. We will also attract experienced teachers back to the profession and welcome back bonuses of between &#163;2,000 and &#163;4,000 are planned. These measures are set against a backdrop of increasing funding for schools, which has risen by &#163;540 per pupil since 1997, and more resources for increasing the numbers of teaching assistants and improving working conditions generally. Grants have been made available to schools, through local education authorities to ensure that all school staff have better working conditions and ready access to the equipment they need to work effectively. The Government have invested more than &#163;5 billion in school buildings since 1997, and &#163;7,8 billion in England over the next three years is the biggest schools capital spending programme in decades.

But we cannot guarantee that every parent will secure a place for their child in their favourite school. Where they do not, they have a right of appeal. During 1999&#150;2000, the latest year for which figures are available, 34 per cent. of all appeals were decided in parents' favour. Parents can ask for their child to stay on a waiting list for their favourite school, although the school is not obliged to keep one.

This funding will improve the quality and coverage of drug education programmes in schools, provide funding for every school to have access to an LEA drug adviser and will fund drug education training for teachers and Connexions advisers. In addition to this specific funding, schools will receive &#163;15 million in 2001&#150;02 to support personal, social and health education and citizenship, which they can choose to spend on programmes to tackle drug misuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reason newly qualified teachers <i>(a)</i> who trained and qualified in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and <i>(b)</i> from countries within the European Economic Area are allowed to teach in maintained schools in England without having to sit the national numeracy test.

<a name="10705w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The requirements for achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not include passing a national numeracy test. That is a matter for the devolved Administrations of those countries to decide.
<P>

<a name="10705w19.html_para2">Teachers who are nationals of other countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) are entitled to be awarded QTS in this country on the basis of teaching qualification status recognised elsewhere in the EEA. Similarly, those teachers would not have to pass a numeracy test to teach in this country.

 The National Curriculum for Physical Education has an aspiration that all pupils should receive two hours of physical activity a week. Officials are considering with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport how we could assist schools in delivering a two-hour entitlement to all children, as set out by the Prime Minister on 11 January this year. This commitment was included in our Green Paper, "Building on Success". We are also consulting with Ofsted, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, PE associations and teachers. The QCA have published examples of best practice on their

website, from schools that are already providing two hours or more PE and school sport. School sports co-ordinators, of which there will be 1,000 by 2004, are already working with families of schools linked to specialist sports colleges to help schools meet this entitlement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what discussions Ministers from her Department have had with the adjudicator in connection with the timing of the announcement about closing Bownham Park School, Stroud; and if she will make a statement.  [2226]<P>

<a name="10705w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2001]:</i> Ministers from this Department have had no discussions with the adjudicator in connection with the timing of the announcement about closing Bownham Park School. Ministers were informed on 6 June that the Office of the Schools Adjudicator would be announcing its decision on 8 June. The Office of the Schools Adjudicator is independent of the Department and Ministers have no role to play in what decision the adjudicator makes on a particular proposal.

Table 4 shows the proportion of lone parents of working age in employment.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Registrar General for England and Wales has been asked to reply to your recent question asking what measures have been taken to ensure that the volunteers who distributed the 2001 Census forms have been adequately remunerated. I am replying in his absence. (1738)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Most of the 70,000 Census field staff were paid for the work carried out by them under the terms of their contractual agreements with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in full and on time. However, there have been problems with making final payments which have lead to delays in settling claims for payments and other outstanding expenses.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the light of these difficulties ONS has written to Census District Managers explaining the situation, and individually to the field staff concerned, to apologise for the delay and to ensure that they are aware they can contact ONS directly. Arrangements to complete these payments as a matter of urgency are now in hand. ONS has made interim final payments to those affected and has introduced special pay runs to minimise any further delays in making payments. Extra staff have been drafted in to the payroll operation to make sure the remainder of the claims are processed as quickly as possible. All staff will be paid the amounts due to them.</FONT></UL>

 The launch of National Statistics in June 2000 marked the largest overhaul of official statistics in the United Kingdom for over 30 years, putting in place new arrangements to deliver statistics that command the trust and confidence of the public.

<a name="10705w22.html_para2">The Office for National Statistics, led by the National Statistician, is central to the Government's drive to improve the nation's statistical service. All of its public access databases and publications are within the ambit of the new arrangements, as set out in the "Framework for National Statistics".
<P>

<a name="10705w22.html_para3">Within the new arrangements, the Statistics Commission&#151;independent of both Ministers and the producers of National Statistics&#151;monitors and advises on the quality and integrity of National Statistics. The Framework Document also tasked the Statistics Commission to review the need for statistics legislation after two years (from 2000) and report back to Ministers, and keep the legislative framework under review thereafter.

In addition, there are many part-timers still in employment covered by public service schemes who may be eligible for back-dated access to their scheme.

<a name="10705w23.html_para0">'A New Commitment to Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy Action Plan' was launched by the Prime Minister in January 2001. It sets out the Government's vision to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest of England, so that within 10&#150;20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live. Our aim is to deliver economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality schools, decent housing, and better health to the poorest parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="10705w23.html_para1">This approach will focus main Government programmes explicitly on deprived areas and will require all sectors to work in partnership. The strategy is being spearheaded by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, a cross-cutting unit based in DTLR and staffed by officials from across Whitehall and the public sector, with secondees from the private and voluntary sectors.
<P>

<a name="10705w23.html_para2">In respect of European Programmes, we are looking to the Regional Development Agencies. They have the main responsibility for regional economic development, and are key members of partnerships which deliver both domestic and European Funds to the programme areas. We are keeping the RDA role under review as the European programmes develop.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to review the sentencing policy of individual judges whose sentencing he has reason to believe does not reflect the severity of the cases heard.  [1352]<P>

 It would be improper for the Lord Chancellor to intervene in, or comment on, the sentence imposed in an individual case since to do so would undermine the independence of the judiciary. Within the statutory limits laid down by Parliament, the appropriate sentence in each individual case is entirely a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, who has heard the evidence, listened to the arguments and given in open court his reasons for the sentence imposed.

 The current guidance given to judges on appointment advises them against engagement, in any capacity which might undermine, or be reasonably thought to undermine, their judicial independence or impartiality. A statement about the position of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was made by the Senior Law Lord in another place on 22 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, <i>House of Lords</i>, columns 419&#150;20, setting out the general principles on the participation of the Lords of Appeal in the business of the House of Lords. There are no plans to review the guidance.

 The Government continue closely to monitor the situation of the OSS. Progress has been made in clearing the backlog of cases received by OSS prior to 1 January 2000. There is also evidence that in complaints received after that date, the OSS is beginning to achieve the quality and turnaround time targets that were agreed with the Government in December 2000.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) if he will initiate a study into the likely consequential effects of establishing a human rights commission on the existing arrangements for upholding laws relating to <i>(a)</i> equal opportunities, <i>(b)</i> sex discrimination, <i>(c)</i> racial discrimination, <i>(d)</i> disability rights and <i>(e)</i> child protection;  [1721]

<a name="10705w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government have not ruled out the possibility of a Human Rights Commission. We already have several commissions, however, for example the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Rights Commission, and there may be a case for a single, over-arching human rights commission, with a divisional structure, to cover all these areas. The Government would welcome representations on that possibility. During the last Parliament, the Joint Committee on Human Rights issued a consultation document, seeking views on what form a human rights commission might take. We will consider very carefully any recommendations the reconstituted Joint Committee makes following this consultation.

This is part complete: there is a demonstration version dealing with criminal cases which has been well received by users improving how they operate; and developing the rest of the software is expected to delay full implementation until toward the end of next year, representing an overall delay to this part of the project of 15 to 18 months.

Payments made to date amount to &#163;10 million (ex VAT) of which &#163;7.8 million (ex VAT) are for office automation services delivered to the courts to an acceptable standard, and for which the question of recovery does not arise.
