 Latest retail sales figures from the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) published earlier this month show an expected decrease for May following on from an increase in April. The SRC indicates this was a consequence of an extra bank holiday, the royal wedding and warm weather in April. Latest business surveys such as the Bank of Scotland June Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) indicate that the Scottish economy has been growing in the first five months of the year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) continues to back the Government's consolidation plans and advise against changing course.</p>

 A fixed penalty notice can be issued for any offence in respect of a vehicle that has been made a fixed penalty offence by order of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Fixed penalty offences are kept under continuous review and additions are made as appropriate.

Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May), takes into account information about HuT's activities in other countries including the position taken by foreign governments.</p>

               <a name="11063067000188"> However, the basis on which groups can be banned in other countries is not necessarily the same as the basis on which groups can be proscribed in the UK. A group can only be proscribed in the UK if the Secretary of State believes it is "concerned in terrorism" within the meaning of the Terrorism Act 2000. Some countries ban all political groups; other countries ban groups that are considered to be seditious, extremist or otherwise unacceptable. Germany, for example, has banned HuT on grounds relating to holocaust denial and anti-Semitism.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time, the principal offence is the more serious offence From 1 June 2000, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These figures have been included in the totals.
<sup>(2)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(4)</sup> The number of defendants found guilty in a particular year may exceed the number proceeded against as the proceedings in the magistrates court took place in an earlier year and the defendants were found guilty at the Crown court in the following year; or the defendants were found guilty of a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against.
<sup>(5)</sup> The Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into force on 1 May 2004.
<sup>(6)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.

However, I understand that it is the ICO position that if insurance companies were selling personal data to claims management companies without clearly informing the individuals concerned, this would breach the first data protection principle and therefore be in breach of the Act. The ICO is discussing with the Association of British Insurers the industry's practice in relation to referral fees.</p>

 As indicated in my answer of 10 June 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 511-12W, discussions are continuing with officials in HM Revenue and Customs on the impact of civil litigation funding and costs reform on insolvency litigation.

 The UK Government do not have emergency oil reserves as such.

In the event of a supply disruption, obligations on individual oil companies are lowered so that they can make these stocks available to the market.</p>

The Department for Education has not made its own assessment, but I am aware of the research that has been carried out by other organisations.

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Period life expectancy at age 65 is an estimate of the average number of years a 65 year old would survive if he or she experienced the area's age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout the rest of his or her life. The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a 65 year old living in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those currently living in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.

 It is for national health service commissioners to determine and secure the services necessary to meet the health care needs of their local populations, taking account of local and national priorities. When considering any reconfiguration of accident and emergency services, commissioners should ensure that the public can continue to access high quality care. Any such decisions should also be assured against the Secretary of State's four tests for service change, which are that proposals must demonstrate: support from general practitioner commissioners; strengthened patient and public engagement; a clear clinical evidence base; and support for patient choice.</p>

 The Department issued guidance entitled “Changing for the better” in 2008 on the process underpinning changes to acute NHS services. This guidance set out, that under section 242 of the NHS Act 2006, national health service organisations must make arrangements that secure the involvement of people in the planning and development of services. This guidance was strengthened in 2010 through the Secretary of State's four tests, which included the requirement that commissioners must demonstrate evidence of strengthened patient and public engagement.

Any action taken prior to death where the patient lacks capacity must be in their best interests in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Although it is therefore not possible to say categorically whether a specific action or decision will always be in every patient's best interests, anything that places the person at risk of serious harm or distress is unlikely ever to be in the person's best interests.</p>

 There is a national framework organised by the police for driver awareness courses, which enables motorists to attend courses near where they live.

I welcome the choice of the vast majority of English and Welsh police forces to take part and would encourage the few forces that are not yet participating to follow this approach.</p>

 There is no specific proposal to increase the fixed penalty of £200 issued by the police for using an uninsured vehicle. However, as stated in the Strategic Framework for Road Safety we will consider the level of this along with other motoring offences and fixed penalties. At the same time we are keen to see the courts make full use of the range of penalties for this offence. We do recognise there is a strong case for better correspondence between penalties and the cost of purchasing insurance.</p>

 Research commissioned by the Department for Transport considered the use of safety equipment, such as steering technology, on articulated lorries combined with semi-trailers over 16.5 metres long. Various options for such equipment were included in the Department's consultation on whether or not to allow an increase in the length of articulated lorries. The Government are now analysing the consultation response and will make an announcement later in the year.</p>

 As part of the Government's measures to address climate change, the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) ensures a growing proportion of UK road transport fuels are from sustainable renewable sources. The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase the efficiency of compliance. The value of individual renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) is determined by the market and depends upon the relative cost of supplying biofuel and fossil fuels. RTFCs for the obligation period 2010-11 have sold at 15p to 24p at auction. We continue to monitor the market value of RTFCs and consider that to date the RTFO has met its objective of driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK.</p>

 The Government encourage the European Patent Office's (EPO) work-sharing activities through its seat on the EPO's Administrative Council. The UK has encouraged the EPO to get involved in foundation project work-sharing schemes with the other four biggest Intellectual Property Offices (the United States, Japan, China and South Korea). In addition to these, the UK has encouraged the EPO's involvement in a number of schemes with USPTO and JPO exclusively:</p>

            <a name="11063067001487"> 
            <p class="tabletext">JP First, launched April 2008, in which the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) examines early applications which have also been filed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the EPO, so that the other offices can make use of the work of the JPO when they examine cases.</p>

               <a name="11063067001451"> Another important international work-sharing scheme is the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) which allows applicants at a first office to benefit from accelerated processing of their application at a second office in exchange for behaviour which makes processing easier for the second office. The Intellectual Property Office of the UK signed its first PPH agreement with Japan in July 2007, and encouraged the European Patent Office to do likewise. The EPO signed a trilateral PPH agreement with Japan and the US which came into effect in January 2010.</p>
