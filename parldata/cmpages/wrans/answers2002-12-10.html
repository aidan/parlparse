<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We remain in regular contact with the US authorities over the situation of the British detainees at Guantanamo Bay. We have had no indication from the US authorities concerning Mr. Abbasi's return to the UK. Mr. Abbasi is not being offered access to legal representation at Guantanamo Bay.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary regularly raises our concerns in relation to Kashmir with the Governments of India and Pakistan, including during his most recent visit to the region on 18 to 20 July, and in his meetings with Indian Foreign Minister Sinha on 30 and 31 October in London, and with new Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri on 2 December in Bonn.

 We frequently raise human rights issues with the Iranian authorities at all levels. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed the subject with the Iranian Foreign Minister on 2 December.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia) are agreeing a roadmap for progress towards a comprehensive settlement by 2005. They will be meeting on 20 December to review progress. When the roadmap is published, we will work with the international community to implement it. A conference of the parties involved in the peace process should be a key element of that roadmap.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on allied action in the event of Iraqi attack against allied airplanes in the no-fly zone.  [84339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Since late 1998, Iraq has waged a systematic campaign to shoot down allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. This is contrary to international law and inconsistent with UN resolutions. We only take action to protect our aircrew. UK and US pilots are authorised to respond to Iraqi attack in self-defence.

<P>
20. <a name="21210w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on UN plans for a settlement in Cyprus.  [84340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 I understand the United Nations has tabled today to the two leaders in Cyprus an adjustment to their proposal of 11 November for a settlement to the 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2002 : Column 179W</I><P>
Cyprus problem. We fully support the United Nations' efforts to secure a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in Cyprus.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para2">We now have within grasp an historic opportunity to reunite Cyprus, and to invite a reunited Cyprus to accede to the EU at the Copenhagen European Council this week.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para3">I urge the two leaders not to let this opportunity slip between their fingers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Lyons: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his policy is on the removal of Turkish troops from Cyprus as part of a settlement.  [84357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government support the UN proposals for a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus, which allow for there to be between 1,000 and 9,999 troops from both Greece and Turkey on the island. It is of course for the two sides in Cyprus to agree a settlement, but we believe the UN proposals to be workable and fair.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what advice his Department provides to UK nationals of the Greek Cypriot community wishing to claim compensation for loss of land incurred as a consequence of the 1974 invasion; and if he will make a statement.  [85380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The proposals from the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive settlement of Cyprus include arrangements for compensation to those who lost land in 1974. Her Majesty's Government are strongly urging both sides to settle on the basis of the UN plan. When, and if, a settlement has been agreed Her Majesty's Government will ensure that UK citizens who may qualify for compensation are properly informed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his policy is with regard to the granting of compensation to those Greek Cypriots who lost land as a consequence of the 1974 invasion; and if he will make a statement.  [85381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government fully support the UN proposal for a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus Problem. Our aim is for a reunited Cyprus to be invited, at the Copenhagen European Council, to accede to the EU. We are urging both sides to come to a settlement before 12 December.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para4">The UN proposals contain provisions on the four core issues, including property and territory, which involve difficult compromises on both sides. While it is for the two sides in Cyprus to agree on details, the Government are of the view that the UN Secretary-General's proposals protect the interests of both sides and are a basis for agreement.

21. <a name="21210w01.html_wqn12"><B> David Wright: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 On 15 July, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary told the Chinese Foreign Minister that our position on Taiwan had not changed. We acknowledged the Chinese position that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China, but we conducted discussions with the Taiwanese authorities on WTO-related trade issues.

<P>
22. <a name="21210w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Purchase: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent discussions he has had with the Government of France on relations between the UK and France in West Africa.  [84342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 In September at the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Secretary and his French counterpart, Mr. Dominique De Villepin, jointly hosted a breakfast seminar on XNew Partnership for Africa's Development" (NEPAD) with Foreign Ministers from 10 African countries.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary last met Mr. De Villepin on 7 October to discuss the strengthening of the St. Malo accord and Franco-British co-operation in Africa. The Foreign Secretary thanked Mr. De Villepin for French assistance in evacuating British nationals caught up in the crisis in Ivory Coast.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para6">This discussion also touched on issues such as further practical co-operation in the areas of conflict management, and the implementation of the peace and security aspects of the G8 Africa Action Plan.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para7">Furthermore, the Foreign Secretary has regular exchanges with Mr. De Villepin on a range of African issues, either by telephone or correspondence.
<P>

<a name="21210w01.html_para8">Our two countries are working together in the United Nations and through the European Union to ensure an holistic and strategic approach by the international community to conflict management in Africa. Indeed, we aim to further cement our co-operation in Africa at the Franco-British summit early next year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the situation in Rwanda, the Congo and the Great Lakes region.  [84343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Great Lakes are dominated by the DRC and Burundi conflicts. The Pretoria Agreement (30 July) has seen Rwandan forces leave DRC. The DRC Government must now deal with the anti-Rwandan militia in DRC, and agree a transitional Government with the rebels (MLC and RCD-Goma).
<P>

<a name="21210w02.html_para0">In Burundi, South African and Tanzanian mediation has sought a ceasefire between the Government and the FDD/FNL rebels. Agreement was reached on 3 December with the FDD. Questions remain on how this will be implemented and the implications for the FNL.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on proposals to alter the basic law on Hong Kong, with particular reference to Article 23.  [84344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has published outline proposals&#151;but not yet draft legislation&#151;on implementing Article 23. We have made clear to them that any legislation should be consistent with the principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the two UN human rights covenants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Our High Commission in Dhaka monitor closely reports of human rights abuses in Bangladesh. They have raised allegations of attacks against minorities on several occasions with the Bangladesh Government, both at a senior level in Dhaka and with regional government officials, encouraging them to investigate all allegations fully. This issue was also included in discussions in October between the visiting UK branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and senior members of the Bangladesh Government. The High Commissioner was present.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment his Department has made of the way commercial oil interests would be affected by a war against Iraq.  [84347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 No decision has been taken to launch military action against Iraq. However, if military action were to occur, we do not believe that the loss of Iraqi oil supplies, even for an extended period of time, would significantly disrupt the fundamental balance of supply and demand in the world market.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We continue to have serious concerns about the human rights situation in Tibet. We welcome, however, the releases this year of several Tibetan prisoners, including Ngawang Choepel, Chadrel Rinpoche, Jigme Zangpo and Ngawang Sangdrol. All of these were on the list of individual cases of concern that we have raised with the Chinese Government. We have also welcomed, along with EU partners, the recent visit of the Dalai Lama's representatives to China. We encourage both sides to continue to use dialogue to find a peaceful resolution to the Tibetan issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Although the 16th Communist Party Congress in Beijing last month appointed a new Party leadership, China's new state leadership will not be elected until the National People's congress in March 2002. We have no plans to change our visa regime for Chinese nationals wishing to enter the UK.

 In September my noble Friend Baroness Amos, the Minister for Africa, raised with President Obasanjo HMG's concerns about the harsh sentences imposed under the Sharia penal codes. She emphasised the strength of feeling against them in the UK and reiterated HMG's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances. The High Commission, together with EU partners, regularly raises our concerns about the sentences with the appropriate authorities in Nigeria.

<P>
<a name="21210w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B>

 Good progress has been made in restoring peace to Sierra Leone. Disarmament was completed and the war declared over in January 2002. Credible and peaceful elections were held in May. Nonetheless, much remains to be done to consolidate the fragile peace. The UN peacekeeping mission, UNAMSIL, remains deployed throughout the country. It has begun to withdraw, in a phased process, which should last 18&#150;20 months.

 This would be a matter for the Archbishops' Council's Ministry Division. The Council has no plans to do so.

 Incumbents have ownership as a corporation sole of their parsonage houses, although their power to dispose of their houses is qualified. Their ownership ends on resignation, retirement or with pastoral reorganisation, or on removal from office for disciplinary offences, pastoral breakdown or if they become too infirm to continue in ministry.

 Earlier this year my hon.

There have also been a number of meetings between construction industry trade associations and my officials to discuss concerns about increased premiums in the Industry. We are keen to have the views of all affected industries, including building, construction and roofing, on the forthcoming review of the Employer Liability Insurance scheme being led by the Department of Work and Pensions. This review was announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-budget report and further details will be announced shortly.

<P>

<a name="21210w04.html_para1">The rise in insurance premiums is due to a number of factors, including the rise in the use of litigation, insurance companies clawing back losses from previous years (September 11 effect); a change in risk profiles within industries (effect of asbestos risk and other occupational injuries within construction); and better modelling of individual company risk. We do not yet know, however, which of these effects predominates.

 The Commission has now adjusted its proposal and no longer envisages a distinction between vessels landing over 100 tonnes of cod or hake and others. We are seeking clarification of the Commission's proposals before undertaking the calculation requested.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what arrangements are proposed by the European Commission for 2003 to restrict fishing effort for the capture of cod and landing of cod using static gear as a method of capture in the <i>(a)</i> North Sea, <i>(b)</i> West of Scotland Waters, <i>(c)</i> Irish Sea and <i>(d)</i> ICES Area VII.

<a name="21210w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Commission proposals envisage cuts in the total number of kw/days for each Member State whose vessels fish cod or hake. However, the Commission proposes that it should be left to Member States to determine which vessels should be restricted in their time at sea and thus whether under 10 metre vessels should be subject to controls.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she intends to take to prevent the killing of dolphins in UK waters as a result of fishery bycatch.  [86255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Reducing the incidental bycatch of small cetaceans will require action on the part of all member states involved in the fisheries concerned, not just the UK. Defra has already committed some #140,000 for trials into the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the bycatch of cetaceans in pelagic trawl fisheries. The trial has been resumed in order to refine the system and further assess the grid's effectiveness in protecting dolphins and maintaining fish catch rates. If SMRU's trials are not successful, we will look at other mitigating measures and I do not rule out any approach at this stage&#151;including arguing for restrictions on fishing, gear or seasonal closures.

<P>
<a name="21210w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 OFWAT collects information on the number of properties which have been subject to internal sewage flooding. In 2001&#150;02, there were 4,957 properties flooded in this manner, in 2000&#150;01 7,120 properties, and in 1999&#150;2000, 7,126 properties. The dry winter in 2001&#150;02 contributed to the lower figure in this year.

 The emergency discharge of sewage into the river was made to avoid sewer flooding of properties, resulting from inundation of the sewerage system, following exceptionally high levels of rainfall. Such discharges are permitted under the Water Resources Act 1991 and do not require prior authorisation.
<P>

<a name="21210w06.html_para3">The Environment Agency was informed of the discharge by the water company and inspected the site on 2 December. They found that the water company had provided a screen to minimise the aesthetic effects of the discharge, that the discharge was extremely dilute owing to the volume of water in the system and further diluted by high flow in the river. The Agency is satisfied that the discharge caused no significant environmental impact.

 Reducing the incidental bycatch of small cetaceans will require action on the part of all member states involved in the fisheries concerned, not just the UK. Defra has already committed some #140,000 for trials into the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the bycatch of cetaceans in pelagic trawl fisheries. The trial will be resumed as soon as the commercial fishery restarts, in order to refine the system and further assess the grid's effectiveness in protecting dolphins and maintaining fish catch rates. If SMRU's trials are not successful, we will look at other mitigating measures, and I do not rule out any approach at this stage&#151;including arguing for restrictions on fishing, gear or seasonal closures.

We are not aware of any other established welfare groups who favour relocation as a method of managing foxes. Because of their territorial nature, foxes moved to another area would be likely to fight with any others already established there. This

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to compensate homeowners for the loss in value of their homes, should new airports be built.  [86165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The principal Acts covering compulsory purchase and compensation are the Land Compensation Acts of 1961 and 1973, the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 and the Acquisition of Land Act 1981.
<P>

<a name="21210w08.html_para2">For people whose property is required to allow for a proposed development, compansation is payable on the basis that they should be no worse off in financial terms after the acquisition that they were before. This means that they receive compensation for the value of their property based on its open market value if there had been no proposal to acquire their property compulsorily plus the reimbursement of any actual costs and losses incurred as a result of having to move.
<P>

<a name="21210w08.html_para3">In addition, both owner-occupiers and tenants who are displaced from their home as a result of a compulsory purchase, and have occupied the property as their main residence for a year or more, will be entitled to a home-loss payment. In the case of tenants this is currently #1,500 while owner-occupiers receive 10 per cent. of the value of their property subject to minimum and maximum thresholds which are currently set at #1,500 and #15,000. However, both the flat rate payable to tenants and the thresholds for owner-occupiers are currently being reviewed, including proposals for increasing the payments above the present #15,000 ceiling. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published a consultation document about this on 27 September, inviting comments by 6 January 2003.
<P>

<a name="21210w08.html_para4">People whose property does not need to be demolished may be entitled to compensation to cover depreciation in the value of their land due to physical factors caused by the use of a development, such as noise, smell, smoke and fumes. In this case, compensation for the loss in value would be based upon prices current on the first claim day, which is 12 months after the first use of the public works.
<P>

<a name="21210w08.html_para5">In addition to these rules, the consultation on The Future Development of Air Transport in the South East is seeking views on additional mitigation and compensation measures for people who might suffer noise impacts as a result of an airport development option. These measures are outlined in paragraphs 16.49&#151;16.58 of the main consultation document.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he will take to ensure that the eventual recommendations for aviation based on Birmingham Airport will be consistent with the Government's policies for protection of the environment <i>(a)</i> locally, <i>(b)</i> nationally and <i>(c)</i> internationally.  [86232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The challenge for next year's White Paper is to ensure that airport development is sustainable, that is to say that it achieves a proper balance between economic, social and environmental considerations. Delivering any additional airport capacity will be within the framework of local, national and international policies to protect the environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As reported in XThe Future of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East" (page 70), it is estimated for three new runways at Stansted that no one would be exposed to an exceedence of the limit for PM10 ; and that just over 300 people could be exposed to an exceedence of the limit for NO2 by 2030.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The analysis of the consultation responses will be carried out by a team comprising civil servants and retained consultants, including Arups, Avia Solutions, Halcrow and the Route Development Company. This will enable us to draw on a wide range of expertise covering aviation, surface access, safety and environmental issues. We have asked the consultants to identify any areas of work for other clients which relate to the air transport consultation and therefore might be considered a conflict of interest so that we can ensure they are not involved in appraising these responses. They have also been asked to consult us on any future requests to undertake work which might result in a possible conflict.

 On 18 December 2000 my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) announced new departure noise limits for aircraft departing from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and improved noise monitoring arrangements <i>Official Report</i> columns 11&#150;12W). In accordance with that decision, the new night-time noise limit of 87 dB A came into effect during the night quota period (2330&#150;0600 hours) from 25 March 2ooi; all other aspects of the decision, including the new daytime (0700&#150;2300 hours) noise limit of 94dBA and the requirement for aircraft to be at a height of 1000 feet aal (above airport level) at 6.5 km from start of roll, came into effect from 25 February 2001.
<P>

<a name="21210w08.html_para6">The noise limits (including the old night-time noise limit of 89 dBA which continues to apply 2300&#150;2330 and 0600&#150;0700 hours) apply at the fixed noise monitor positions as determined by my hon. friend.
<P>

<a name="21210w08.html_para7">Included in the announcement of 18 December 2000 was the decision to commence a further review of the departure noise limits and associated noise monitors. The technical work is being carried out by the Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is examining a method for assessing the effectiveness of the current monitoring arrangements and any possible improvements, as well as the scope for any further reductions in the departure noise limits. Our conclusions on the way forward in the light of that study will be announced in due course.

Both of these groups have taken a close interest in the PlusBus scheme, offering support where appropriate, and will continue to do so. To date no representations from other organisations or members of the public have been received on the scheme as it was only launched publicly last month.
<P>

<a name="21210w10.html_para0">My Department is currently undertaking research on behalf of Journey Solutions to assess the PlusBus scheme. The research will measure awareness of PlusBus; examine customer satisfaction with the product; critically review each step of the PlusBus journey; test effectiveness of promotional components; confirm target market; and measure impact on travel patterns. The results of this research should be available by mid 2003. The research will contribute to the Department for Transport understanding about multi-modal ticketing&#151;one of the Transport Direct strategic objectives.

 value for money assessment is carried out on all Design Build Finance and Operate proposals, whether they are promoted by my Department or by a Local Authority seeking Government assistance for their scheme. This consists of the preparation of a public sector comparator, which broadly involves an estimate of the costs of constructing and maintaining the scheme within the public sector over the same length of a Design Build Finance and Operate contract and comparing this with an estimate of letting a Design Build Finance and Operate contract. The costs of both options are then discounted back to today's prices to ensure that the comparison is on the samebasis.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From your question, we assume that you are seeking information on utility companies' works (water, gas, electricity, telecommunications, etc.) which involve trunk road excavations. I am afraid historical information of this type is not held centrally in a form that would be readily available.. It would be time consuming and expensive to collect, involving detailed searching through manual records from a number of different sources. That said, since September we have had a new streetworks system in place that will allow us to collect the number of streetworks excavations per utility within a specific area.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the impact of the decision to award a franchise to South West Trains on the Waterloo to Exeter line on <i>(a)</i> track doubling west of Salisbury, <i>(b)</i> car parking at Salisbury station and <i>(c)</i> the re-opening of Wilton station.  [86228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Stagecoach's initial proposals for a 20-year franchise&#151;submitted in July 2000&#151;included double tracking of the line and car park expansion at Salisbury, but not the re-opening of Wilton station. The Strategic Rail Authority subsequently proposed to place the Exeter line in the Wessex franchise. Consequently, double tracking of the line and the expansion of car parks were excluded from Stagecoach's Best and Final Offer when submitted to the SRA in November 2000. The new approach to the South West Trains franchise, announced on 6 November 2002, includes the route but excludes infrastructure enhancements. Alternative means of pursuing infrastructure projects are being considered by the Strategic Rail Authority.

 The main operator of long distance rail services on the west coast main line is Virgin trains. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) manages this rail franchise, and all of the other rail franchises. The SRA is working with Virgin trains to ensure that an appropriate level of service is provided while the major up-grade of the west coast main line is in progress.

<P>

<a name="21210w13.html_para2">More recently, BAE Systems have acknowledged a delay in the programme for the first flight of Nimrod MRA4. This delay has been caused by a combination of factors arising from the challenging concurrent engineering and parallel working on this highly complex aircraft. The consequences of first flight slippage are being urgently examined, jointly, by the Company and the Department. The results of this work so far indicate that first flight is unlikely before the second half of 2003 and we continue to examine the consequences this may have on ISD. Until this work is completed, it would be premature to speculate on the impact of this slippage on the timescale for the entry into service of Nimrod MRA4.

 GAVI was designed to support research and development (R&D) of new vaccines relevant to developing countries. The first phase of its work was to identify candidate vaccines and stimulate research and innovation, which complemented existing research.
<P>

<a name="21210w14.html_para0">Two potential vaccines, both of which are at an advanced stage of development, were selected for support: against rotavirus (the most common cause of severe dehydrating diarrhoea among children) and pneumococcal disease (a cause of pneumonia and meningitis).

<a name="21210w14.html_para1">GAVI has also developed the concept of Accelerated Development and Introduction Plans (ADIPs), which will manage the support to each vaccine and aim to help demonstrate its efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness, encourage uptake and support its introduction. Competitive bids to run the ADIPs for rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccine were requested and proposals were submitted in October 2002. The GAVI board is now in the process of deciding how to respond to these bids. Once the ADIP contracts are awarded then the support to R&D will start.

<a name="21210w14.html_para2">Of the 28 countries with approved HIV/AIDS proposals from the first round, 20&#151;over 70 per cent.&#151;include some money for highly active anti retro viral therapy (HAART). The first round proposal form did not request specific data from applicants on how much money would be expended on antiretrovirals. However, the Fund estimates that approximately 20 per cent. of money from the first round was allocated to the provision of drugs (some of which will be for antiretrovirals), and 20 per cent. on commodities (some of which will be for HIVprevention).

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> The Prison Service is working to minimise the disruption caused to prisoners and their regime by the population increase.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para5">The rate of positive adjudications of assault has reduced in recent months. This is due in part to prisoners spending more time in their cells but the current assault rate is also depressed pending the introduction of new adjudication arrangements brought in after the removal of added day punishments. Although the population increase has affected staff-prisoner ratios, the operational capacity of each establishment is set to minimise the risks to security, safety and control.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para6">With population close to operational capacity, a greater number of prisoners must be moved to maximise the available accommodation. This increases the number of prisoners being held away from their home area and for some, the greater distance can disrupt family visits. Prisoners held temporarily in police cells are not granted family visits, although the aim is that the time an individual prisoner spends in police cells is kept to a minimum and that prisoners who are particularly vulnerable are accommodated in prisons, wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para7">The Prison Service aims to avoid transferring prisoners that are on or awaiting offending behaviour programmes, however some disruption is inevitable while programmes are relocated away from local establishments which suffer most from increased turnover. The average level of purposeful activity across the estate has fallen slightly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people are on the Sexual Offenders Register; and how many were on the register in 1997.  [85384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w18.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned for, convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of insanity of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act since the date of its implementation to notify the police of their names, addresses, dates of birth and intentions to travel abroad for eight days or longer. The requirements of the Act also apply to offenders who were serving a sentence for a relevant offence, either in prison or in the community, at the date of its implementation (1 September 1997). There is, however, no central register of sex offenders and offenders subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act are not separately identified in criminal statistics.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para8">Information on the number of 'registered' sex offenders in a police area is submitted by police and probation services under the requirements placed on them established by section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para9">As at 31 March 2002, police forces in England and Wales had notified the Home Office of 18,513 'registered' sex offenders.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para10">I am informed by the Scottish Executive that as at 28 August 2002, 1,816 registered sex offenders were recorded by the Scottish Criminal Record Office as being administered by Scottish Police Forces.
<P>

<a name="21210w18.html_para11">The provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 were commenced on 1 September 1997. A Home Office evaluation of the way the Act had been implemented was published in July 2000. This indicated that at 31 August 1998, one year after implementation, 8,608 sex offenders were subject to the Act's requirements. Figures covering the last three months of 1997 are not available.

 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2002]:</i> In the event of a beacon school closing, the local education authority's Standards Fund allocation is reduced accordingly. Any unspent beacon funds held by the school would be identified alongside other grants still held and returned to the local education authority and then offset against future Standards Fund payments by the Department.

<P>
<a name="21210w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04 we are making available to local education authorities, through Standards Fund Grant, #268 million to cover the costs of recruiting extra school support staff and extra administrative help, particularly for small schools, and #37.45 million for the training and development of support staff.
<P>

<a name="21210w19.html_para1">This additional funding should contribute significantly to the transformation of the school workforce, of which school science laboratory technicians, as well as many others who work to support teachers in the classroom, are vital members. We estimate that, during this Parliament, schools should have the capacity to recruit at least an extra 50,000 full-time equivalent support staff, including science technicians. In addition, the new National Network of Science Learning Centres will provide training and professional development opportunities for technicians.

 The Communications Bill gives Ofcom a requirement to produce, publish and from time to time review, a code relating to provision of television services for the deaf and visually impaired and the means by which such services should be promoted. The code will include guidance on the technical standards to be attained for subtitling, signing and audio description as the current code produced by the Independent Television Commission does.

 In total, this Department has received eleven representations in connection with the proposal in the Licensing Bill to extend the licensing requirement beyond Greater London, where it currently applies. Among these representations, only one was from an organisation, which has since met with my officials to discuss their concerns.
<P>

<a name="21210w20.html_para0">Earlier, following the publication of the White Paper on licensing reform in April 2000, we received eight responses from religious organisations; none of these letters took issue with the proposal to create a level playing field for the licensing of churches and other places of religious worship.
<P>

<a name="21210w20.html_para1">The Government are aware of the concerns that some people have about the licensing of churches. We have had discussions about this issue with the Church of England and, along with other faith groups, will seek to ensure that the new licensing system does not impose an unnecessary burden on them while still providing the necessary safeguards for the public.

 The estimated fees in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the Licensing Bill were between #100 and #500 for a premises licence with a subsequent annual charge of between #50 and #150. Fees would be set centrally by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in secondary legislation and would not be made final until that secondary legislation has been brought into force. Any variation in fee levels would most likely relate to the size of the venue so that smaller venues pay less than large ones.

 The Government has guaranteed that sport will continue to receive its current 16 2/3 per cent. share of the funds the Lottery raises for good causes until the end of the current licence period in 2009 at the very least. Sport has benefited significantly from the creation of the newer good cause of health, education and the environment through, for example, the #750 million PE and sport in schools initiative by the New Opportunities Fund (NOF). My Department,

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment has been undertaken of the impact of the Government contract with Marine Odyssey Inc. for commercial salvage on an historic wreck upon the prospects for future UK accession to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage.  [82988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w22.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is not envisaged that there will be an impact, as this agreement is a unique pragmatic solution to a situation in which the archaeological heritage is at risk. It enables the Government to ensure that the site is excavated responsibly. Although the UK is not currently bound by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, the Government has stressed from the beginning that the project must as far as possible be developed in line with the rules contained in the Annex to the Convention, which are seen as representing best practice for maritime archaeology.

 English Heritage has this year become the Government's advisors on underwater heritage, and they have become involved in this project by chairing an independent Archaeological Review Group which is scrutinising the Project Plan to ensure that it complies with appropriate archaeological standards.

origin. This is a devolved matter; the protection and management of wrecks in the waters of the devolved administrations is a matter for the relevant First Minister.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para0">No distinction is made in the protection or management of wrecks in English waters based on whether or not they are of UK origin.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para1">In England, the policy has long been for English Heritage to be granted powers to provide assistance in relation to archaeological sites which are situated below the mean low water mark. The National Heritage Act 2002 extended these powers with effect from 1 July 2002, and DCMS is in the process of drafting directions in consultation with the devolved heritage agencies and English Heritage.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para2">Formal transfer of responsibility is expected to take place shortly, which will mean that English Heritage will be able to perform the functions for underwater archaeology that they can for land-based archaeology, for instance giving grants, contributing towards the costs of research, and providing educational facilities and services, public information and advice, and entering into certain agreements.

 The Government will consider the development of the RDA pilots before taking a decision on the general roll-out of RDA-led management and coordination of business support. However, outside the pilot areas, RDAs have been given additional funding and flexibilities which will enable them to work with SBS and other business support providers to improve the coherence and quality of services for small businesses. In the north-east, for example, the RDA has launched a new strategy to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the business support infrastructure.

 The Government believes that the availability of financial products is essential to ensure access to wider mainstream services and is an important component in tackling social exclusion. There are a number of ways in which access to financial services can be improved and providers each have a different contribution to make. The Government has not set targets for growth in particular sectors &#151;it is ultimately for consumers to decide which services are most appropriate for them.

Universal banking services, using the post office network, will build on and extend the accessibility of bank accounts to areas without bank branches or ATM machines.

<a name="21210w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I attended the ECOFIN meeting on 3 December.ECOFIN discussed a Presidency proposal on the taxation of savings. The proposal confirmed the agreement at the Feira European Council that the ultimate objective of the EU should be exchange of information on as wide a basis as possible. And it confirmed the rejection at Feira of an EU-wide withholding tax, which would have had severe implications for the London bond market.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para6">ECOFIN discussed the Commission's negotiations with the third countries named in the Feira conclusions, and in particular the negotiations with Switzerland. The Presidency proposed that Switzerland should implement the OECD standard of exchange of information on request, and that the Commission should hold further discussions with them on this. The ultimate objective would be automatic exchange of
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para7">information.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para8">Under the Presidency proposal, Switzerland would be required to apply a withholding tax until moving to automatic exchange of information. The rate would be 20 per cent. for the three years from 2004 and 35 per cent. thereafter. Austria, Luxembourg and Belgium would be required to apply a similar rate of withholding tax until Switzerland move to the OECD standard of exchange of information on request, at which point they would have to move to automatic exchange of information. Austria, Luxembourg and Belgium would have to apply the OECD standard of exchange on request from no later than 2011. The other 12 member states would apply automatic exchange of information from 2004 as agreed at the Feira European Council.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para9">I gave a report on our discussions with Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and the overseas territories in the Caribbean. I made clear that automatic exchange of information would apply in all the territories.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para10">The Commission will hold further discussions with Switzerland, and the Presidency expect to hold a further meeting of ECOFIN later this month.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para11">The Paymaster General (in her capacity as Chair of the Code of Conduct Group) presented the Code of Conduct Group's report on the rollback of harmful tax measures. The Presidency indicated that the Group's report, along with the third component of the tax package, the directive on interest and royalties, would be considered at the additional ECOFIN meeting later this month.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para12">The Presidency invited Ministers to reach political agreement on the draft directive on energy taxation. As a number of other member states continued to have reservations with the text, the Presidency concluded that agreement was not possible at this stage and there would be a further discussion at the additional ECOFIN meeting later this month. The draft directive on VAT administrative co-operation will also be considered at the additional ECOFIN and I stressed that the UK was prepared to be constructive in reaching agreement on this. Ministers discussed a number of financial services issues. ECOFIN adopted conclusions on implementing streamlined legislative procedures (the so-called XLamfalussy model") across the financial services sector. There was a discussion on whether the new 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 2002 : Column 260W</I><P>
procedures should be implemented immediately or delayed pending further discussions with the European Parliament. The Presidency called a vote to decide this. There was a simple majority in favour of immediate implementation, which the UK supported.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para13">The Commission presented its proposal for a revised directive on investment services. I expressed UK disappointment at the Commission's late amendment to the text on pre-trade transparency. This change would be anti-competitive and would deliver a poor deal for the retail investor. I also stressed that late changes such as this, which flew in the face of consultation results, were likely to undermine market confidence in the consultation process and the Lamfalussy arrangements.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para14">Ministers noted Commission reports on corporate governance and progress on the Financial Services Action Plan and efficiency and integration indicators.
<P>

<a name="21210w22.html_para15">ECOFIN noted the President of the European Court of Auditors presentation of the Court's annual report for 2001 and adopted conclusions on the streamlining of economic policy co-ordination processes and on the use of structural reform indicators.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w24.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 By raising production costs and so constraining supply, higher oil prices tend to depress GDP growth, simultaneously pushing up inflation and unemployment. The UK differs from most other major industrialised economies in that it is a small net exporter of oil. Potential GDP losses therefore may be partly offset by increased UK incomes deriving from North Sea production due to the improvement in the terms of trade.
<P>

<a name="21210w24.html_para0">In practice, the overall economic effects from rising oil prices are difficult to estimate as they depend largely on second round impacts on wages and other prices, as well as movements in business and consumer confidence.

 Care leavers in Battersea can obtain housing assistance from the London borough council for Wandsworth. Help is available through the housing providers that work with Wandsworth, such as Shaftesbury Homes and Aruthusa, NACRO and the Wandsworth Independent Living Scheme. The council also offer specialist services for the black minority ethnic community, offenders and young parents. Care leavers wishing to access these services can do so by contacting their social worker or Wandsworth's homeless persons unit. Alternatively the Connexions service personal advisers help those leaving care who may become homeless in Wandsworth through working with voluntary organisations such as Grenfell, Threshold and Patchwork Housing. Advice on services which are available to young people between 16 and 18 years of age is best obtained by an individual setting out their detailed circumstances to the agencies listed.

 My Department does not intend to regulate the use of agreed medical experts. The Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), allows parties in civil proceedings to instruct a single joint expert. To regulate this further would incur unnecessary costs and defeat the objectives of the CPR&#151;to make civil disputes easier, quicker and cheaper to resolve.

 To assess pre-action behaviour and the effect of the protocols, the Civil Justice Council and the Law Society jointly commissioned research by the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies and the University of Westminster. The report, XMore Civil Justice?", which was published on 25 April 2002, focused on three specific areas of dispute: personal injury, clinical negligence and housing disrepair. The study found that in all three areas there was evidence of a culture change and better communication between opposing sides, which has increased the number of claims settling without going to court.

<i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]:</i> Bereavement benefits were introduced from April 2001 and, for the first time, extend the help available to both men and women. For information on the judgment referred to, which concerns benefits which pre-date bereavement benefits, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given to the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) on 27 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 320W.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to extend the deadline for claiming bereavement payments; whether the change will be retrospective; and if he will make a statement.  [86612]<P>

<P>
<a name="21210w28.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We want bereaved people to claim and receive the help that they and their families are entitled to when they need it&#151;immediately after the bereavement. Most people do; more than four fifths claim within four or five weeks of their loss. However, we acknowledge that not all bereaved people find it possible to claim as promptly as the current rules for the lump-sum Bereavement Payment require. We are therefore extending the time limit for claiming Bereavement Payment and aligning it with the period over which a person can receive Bereavement Allowance&#151;namely 12 months. We see this as a sensible alteration that will simplify the scheme for everyone while remaining compatible with underlying benefit entitlement rules.
<P>

<a name="21210w28.html_para3">We laid amending regulations on 24 October 2002, which will give effect to this change for claims in respect of deaths that occur on or after 1 April 2003.

 The term Xmental health problems" covers a wide variety of symptoms. Where those symptoms impair a child's normal functioning to the extent that they amount to a severe mental disability, the child may be entitled to Disability Living Allowance <sup>1</sup> . The additional benefits which, subject to the normal entitlement conditions, are available to families with disabled children who qualify for Disability Living Allowance are shown in the table. The Family Fund Trust, which is funded by government, also provides grants to families of severely disabled children in order to ease the stress of their day-to-day life.

 As set out in the report, XAn Organisation with a Memory", international research demonstrates that significant numbers of adverse events occur in healthcare systems across the world.
<P>

<a name="21210w28.html_para5">In the United Kingdom, the Department has commissioned a programme of research into patient safety, which seeks to build upon and complement international work in this area. The programme is led by Professor Richard Lilford at the University of Birmingham. Work already completed includes systematic reviews of existing international research and examining the nature of errors in primary care. A number of studies are currently under way looking at obstetric injury, errors in accident and emergency units and the operating theatre, and errors resulting in litigation. Professor Lilford is working closely with the National Patient Safety Agency. Further information is available from the University of Birmingham patient safety research programme website at www.publichealth.bham.ac.uk/psrp.

<a name="21210w28.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 At the present time, we do not know what proportion of national health service patients are affected by adverse events in British hospitals. However, as reported in XAn Organisation with a Memory", a report of an expert group on learning from adverse events chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, it is estimated that errors may occur in 10 per cent. of hospital admissions. This is in line with research carried out in other countries including New Zealand, Canada and Denmark.
<P>

<a name="21210w28.html_para6">The Government established the National Patient Safety Agency in July 2001 to improve the safety of NHS patient care by promoting an open and fair culture and by introducing a national reporting and learning system for adverse events. It is planned for the reporting and learning system to be rolled out across the NHS from summer 2003. The system will, in time, enable us to understand the true nature and extent of adverse events in the NHS and prevent them being repeated.

<i>Key notes:</i><P>

1. Three month vacancy information is at 31 March 2002.<P>

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents).<P>

3. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<P>

4. Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey, March 2002.<P>

5. Staff in post data are from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September 2001.<P>

6. Staff in post data exclude staff employed by health authorities, as vacancy information was only collected from trusts, PCTs and special health authorities.<P>

7. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest 10.<P>

8. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<P>

<i>Other notes:</i><P>

9. Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts.<P>

10. Due to rounding, calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<P>

11. Figures may not match previously published data due to a different method of rounding used on the staff in post data.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to provide pharmacies with broadband connectivity; and if he will make a statement.  [83902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There are no specific plans to provide broadband connectivity to pharmacies. Hospital pharmacies will have access to the broadband networking arrangements for hospitals being put in place as part of the national health service modernisation programme. Community pharmacists are of course part of the NHS Xfamily", but apart from those participating in the electronic transfer of prescriptions pilots do not make use of the national NHS network.
<P>

<a name="21210w29.html_para1">The broadband networking plans set out in the Government's X21st century IT" strategy document focus on the needs of NHS trusts and general practitioner practices. As stated in the strategy document, it is anticipated that the trials will continue to grow and involve a sizeable number of GPs and pharmacists with a natural migration into rollout. This project will create greater connectivity to NHSnet for pharmacists allowing the access to the benefits that this service provides. We will review the need for broadband access to pharmacies as the strategy develops.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the number of children with tooth cavities in <i>(a)</i> Lancashire and <i>(b)</i> the north-west of England; in each of the previous five years.  [85330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The British association for the study of community dentistry (BASCD) carries out surveys to monitor the dental caries experience of five, 21 and 14-year-old children. The survey of five-year-olds is carried out every second year and the surveys of 12 and 14-year-olds are carried out every four years.
<P>

<a name="21210w29.html_para2">The number of children with tooth cavities for five, 12 and 14-year-old children by health authority in Lancashire is shown in table 1 for the years 1995&#150;96 to 2000&#150;01 and for the north-west region in table 2. The percentages of children with dental caries are taken from the BASCD survey results and the number of children with caries are estimated by applying these percentages to estimates of the total population of these children.

 We have received representations from a number of health professionals, including general practitioners, about the current shortage of the injectable contraceptive depo-provera which has been caused by production problems. Departmental officials have been in regular contact with the manufacturer of this product to assist rapid action to alleviate the shortage and are aware that limited stocks are now available. Normal supplies of this product are expected to be available from 16 December.

<a name="21210w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Department, working with commercial partners from the media and broadcasting industries, has recently run four pilot projects exploring health applications of digital interactive television. The different projects were chosen to explore a variety of different types of digital television service and different digital TV platforms. Information was broadcast on health conditions, healthy living and local health services using text-based material, video-on-demand and a mixture of scheduled programmes and text-based information. A range of transactional services such as booking appointments with general practitioners was also explored.
<P>

<a name="21210w31.html_para3">Following the completion of these pilot projects, a programme of work will begin to develop a version of NHS Direct for digital TV and to make it available nationwide. Working with commercial partners, the Department and the NHS will develop a service that will enable people to have easy and fast access at home to trusted information and advice on health, health care and the NHS. Such a service will complement the already very successful NHS Direct telephone helpline and the NHS Direct online website. The Department will also continue to explore the more transactional uses of digital TV.
<P>

<a name="21210w31.html_para4">The process of selecting commercial partners will begin early in the new year with the Department issuing an invitation to tender to develop and run an NHS Direct information service on digital TV. The Department's intention is, in time, to provide this service across all digital TV platforms.

 Potentially any herbal remedy could put health at risk if taken in sufficient quantity. The proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products is under negotiation in Europe. The current proposals would ensure that traditional herbal remedies registered under the scheme were accompanied by systematic information about dosage and other information relating to the safe use of the product.

<a name="21210w33.html_para7">The General Medical Council's education committee has the general function of promoting high standards of medical education and co-ordinating all stages of medical education to ensure that students and newly qualified doctors are equipped with the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for professional practice. As pre-registration house officers, all doctors, including those who will eventually become GPs, are expected to have training in the psychological and social factors that affect patients. As senior house officers, all doctors are expected to develop medical knowledge and skills of assessment of the mental state of patients.

<a name="21210w34.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]:</i> The national health service has clear incentives to reduce the time that people wait for discharge; not least because this frees up capacity to treat more patients who are waiting for treatment. The access and capacity targets and the monitoring of performance ensure that this is given a high priority. The provisions in the Community Care (Delayed Discharges) Bill will ensure that there are financial incentives for social services to play their part in providing community services where delays are their responsibility. In addition, from April 2004, the NHS will be introducing a new system of financial flows that will ensure that acute trusts do not benefit financially where patients are re-admitted to hospital within a set period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action his Department has taken to reduce waiting times for admission to accident and emergency departments from ambulances.  [85764]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21210w35.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Government are committed to bringing down waiting times for all accident and emergency (A&E) patients, no matter how they arrive at the A&E department. By the end of 2004, virtually all patients should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours of arrival at A&E.
<P>

<a name="21210w35.html_para0">If for any reason a patient who arrives by ambulance is not transferred in to A&E within 15 minutes, the patient is nevertheless then treated as having arrived at A&E for the purposes of measuring performance against the four hour target.
<P>

<a name="21210w35.html_para1">Where local delays occur they can be addressed through emergency care networks&#151;which bring together all local participants in the emergency care system to iron out problems and spread good practice&#151;and the emergency care collaborative, a new national programme aimed at reducing waiting times for all A&E patients.
