To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what monitoring arrangements are in place for air pollution across the United Kingdom; and how this information is publicised.  [85845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 On behalf of the United Kingdom Government and the devolved Administrations DEFRA monitors air pollution in the United Kingdom through a national network of air quality monitoring sites, the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory and numerical modelling techniques.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para0">There are three national automatic air quality monitoring networks: <i>(a)</i> the automatic urban network consisting of 96 sites, <i>(b)</i> the automatic rural network consisting of 22 sites and <i>(c)</i> the hydrocarbon network consisting of four sites. There are also seven national non-automatic networks that measure a wide range of pollutants. DEFRA operates two of these networks in co-operation with local authorities.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para1">Current and historic monitoring information, including hourly updates of air quality from the automatic networks, is published on the UK Government's and the devolved Administrations' air quality website (www.airquality.co.uk). This site also provides detailed information about DEFRA's and the devolved Administrations' air pollution monitoring arrangements. Air quality information is also provided through a freephone service (0800 556677) and on Teletext, page 155.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para2">In addition to the national monitoring networks described above, there are also a large number of monitoring sites operated by local authorities. Local authorities generally publicise this information in the air quality review and assessment reports, which they prepare under part IV of the Environment Act 1995.

 The Secretary of State has not issued any directions under part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to local authorities requiring air quality monitoring to be undertaken.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para3">The Department offers advice on air quality monitoring to local authorities via centrally funded helpdesks and our statutory local air quality management guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the individual measures against which air quality is assessed in the United Kingdom what the level of each was in <i>(a)</i> each city of greater than 100,000 population and <i>(b)</i> each local authority area in each of the last 30 years in which these have been recorded.  [85846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Air quality in the United Kingdom is assessed against targets for safeguarding people's health and protecting the environment from air pollution. These targets were published in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, first published in 1997 and revised in January 2000. The strategy includes health-based standards for benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide lead particles, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and low-level ozone. It also includes policy objectives for each pollutant to be achieved between 2003 and 2008. On 5 August 2002 the United Kingdom Government announced tighter objectives in England for particles, benzene and carbon monoxide and introduced a new objective for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para4">The United Kingdom Government and the devolved Administrations monitor levels of the pollutants in the United Kingdom through a national network of air quality monitoring sites, the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory and numerical modelling techniques. Details the air quality targets and all air quality monitoring data&#151;including cities and local authorities&#151;are published on the United Kingdom Government's and devolved Administrations air quality website www.airquality.co.uk

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the <i>(a)</i> bathing and <i>(b)</i> non-bathing beaches in the United Kingdom which are (i) measured and (ii) not measured for (A) beach and (B) water quality standards, indicating in each case for which measurements are taken whether they pass these standards; what plans there are to strengthen the monitoring and standards of these beaches; and if she will make a statement.  [85848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department's publication XBathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC) Detailed Summary of 2001 Survey Results&#151;United Kingdom" is available in the Library and lists all identified bathing waters and the results of micro-biological and physico-chemical sample testing. The report for the 2002 bathing season will be published early in the new year. General beach quality characteristics are taken into account in the Seaside Awards and Blue Flag schemes administered by ENCAMS (Environmental Campaigns). Lists of beaches are published on their internet site (www.seasideawards.org.uk and www.blueflag.org.uk). The EC Commission has recently published a new draft bathing water directive, which proposes tighter microbiological water quality standards. The proposal will be subject to detailed negotiation among member states and in the European Parliament. Specific questions relating to bathing waters in Scotland and Wales should be directed to the devolved Administrations.

<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn4"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of how many small businesses will be affected by proposals contained in her Department's review of bird registration; and how many such businesses depend upon trade in species listed in Schedule 4 of the Act.  [85895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Many users of the current registration system fit the definition of a Xsmall business". Business users range from people who trade in significant numbers of Schedule 4 birds annually to those breeding just one or two birds. In the consultation process, we have endeavoured to contact as many such users as possible in order to ensure that their views are properly reflected in the review process.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn5"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason no changes were made to the bird registration scheme following the consultation on Review of Bird Registration and CITES Licensing Fees undertaken in July 1999.  [85896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No changes were made to the bird registration scheme because the 1999 consultation related solely to the question of what fees should be payable for registering a bird and obtaining any relevant CITES permits.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn6"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the costs of implementing her Department's bird registration scheme were in <i>(a)</i> 1991, <i>(b)</i> 2000 and <i>(c)</i> 2001; and what she estimates they will be this year.  [85897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The costs for the scheme in the financial year April 1991 to March 1992 were #309,769. Costs in the financial year April 2000 to March 2001 were #355,822 and April 2001 to March 2002 were #441,557. The forecast for April 2002 to March 2003 is #456,712.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para5">The apparent large increase in costs between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 is mainly due to an improved approach to cost attribution but also reflects a significant increase in enforcement effort.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn7"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many <i>(a)</i> birdkeepers, <i>(b)</i> zoological gardens/bird parks, <i>(c)</i> birdkeeping magazines, <i>(d)</i> falconry centres, <i>(e)</i> police wildlife liaison officers, <i>(f)</i> ornithologists and birdwatchers, <i>(g)</i> conservation organisations, <i>(h)</i> bird watching magazines and <i>(i)</i> raptor groups have been consulted by her Department during its review of bird registration; and what criteria her Department used to determine the list of those consulted on the review.  [85898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department set out to consult as many interested parties as possible in conducting the bird registration review. We have therefore consulted all people who currently keep Schedule 4 birds. This includes zoos and bird parks, falconry centres and members of raptor groups. In addition, consultation took place through a number of umbrella organisations such as the RSPB, the RSPCA, the Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the British Bird Council, the British Trust for 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2002 : Column 312W</I><P>
Ornithology, the Hawkboard and the Countryside Alliance. We also issued consultation documents to conservation organisations and publishers of bird magazines and relied on them to cascade information to their members and readers. All Police Wildlife Liaison Officers in England and Wales were consulted. In all over 2,000 individuals and organisations were consulted through these mechanisms. Consultation documents were also available via the Department's website.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn8"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department took in framing the bird registration scheme to the effect on conservation of wild birds.  [85899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 introduced the registration and ringing of certain species of birds when kept in captivity. The objective of section 7 of the Act was to support the conservation of our native wild birds by requiring those holding them to register them with the Department, and to fit them with a ring approved by the Secretary of State. The deterrent effect of this legislation has reduced the illegal taking of birds from the wild.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn9"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what meetings she had with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee during the preparation of her Department's review of bird registration.  [85900]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Joint Nature Conservation Committee were involved in three meetings with my Department during the preparation of this review. The first meeting also involved representatives from raptor groups, the devolved assemblies and conservation bodies. Subsequent meetings involved officials from my Department and JNCC in discussions about a range of possible options for inclusion in the review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn10"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what consideration her Department gave to the views of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee during the peparation of its review of bird registration.  [86120]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Joint Nature Conservation Committee are the main adviser to the Department on all scientific questions arising on bird registration issues. They were therefore consulted fully prior to the issue of the public consultation document, and were involved in a number of the preparatory discussions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn11"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the likely effects of removing bird species from Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 on the ability to secure convictions for possession of these birds.  [86121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The recent consultation process sought views on four possible options for the future of the bird registration scheme. We consulted as widely as possible, and consultees included the enforcement authorities, whose views we greatly value. We shall decide what specific proposals to develop in the light of the responses to the consultation. The possible impact on the ability to 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2002 : Column 313W</I><P>
secure convictions under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 will be one of the factors we take into account in doing so.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_wqn12"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of how removing bird species from Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 will affect the number of these birds taken illegally from the wild.  [86122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 When the current consultation is concluded, the Department will refer to our scientific advisers, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, for assistance in determining whether species should remain on Schedule 4. One of the criteria in determining whether a species should remain will be its vulnerability to illegal taking.
<P>

<a name="21211w01.html_para6">The evidence from the 1994 review showed that the removal of kestrels, sparrow hawks and common buzzards from Schedule 4 had no detrimental effect on wild population levels.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many representations from <i>(a)</i> Lancashire and <i>(b)</i> the north-west of England she has received regarding the loss of cattle-passport slips by the Cattle Movement Service.  [85338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The British Cattle Movement Service has received around 22,000 representations about movement notification failures since May this year from around England, Scotland and Wales. It would be wrong to assume that these involve the loss of cattle movement notification cards by the Department since I am informed that these are recorded on computer on arrival and in many cases where an issue arises a check shows that no notification has been received by the British Cattle Movement Service. It follows that breaking down figures on representations on to a county by county or region by region basis would only be available at disproportionate costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what actions she has taken regarding the loss of cattle-passport slips by the Cattle Movement Service; and if she will make a statement on the loss of the slips.  [85339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) operates to ISO 9001:2000 standards, is registered with the British Standards Institute and its operating practices have received the Kite mark. All documents received by the organisation are scanned and recorded on arrival and great care is taken to avoid any loss.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para0">Some cattle keepers have claimed to have told the BCMS about cattle movements when their computerised records have been cross-checked and deficiencies found as part of the subsidy claims checking process. I understand that the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and the BCMS check these cases very carefully. It is wrong to assume that the BCMS has lost keepers' movement notifications when they have no trace of the document ever arriving at the BCMS site. If keepers

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of differences between <i>(a)</i> the data held on the British Cattle Movement Service Online Tracing System, <i>(b)</i> the data held by the British Cattle Movement Service and <i>(c)</i> the records of cattle keepers themselves; what plans she has to rectify these differences; and if she will make a statement.  [85363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I am assured that there is no difference between the information held on the cattle tracing scheme website (CTS Online) and that held on the main database held by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). The online database is a copy of the main database.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para1">The differences that exist between the Government's central database and on-farm records represent those births, deaths and movements that the keeper has taken steps to record on one but not on the other. Our programme of on-the-spot farm inspections bring these differences to light and we work with keepers to sort their records out. Where serious discrepancies are found, individual animals or, in the worst case, the whole herd of cattle will have a movement restriction placed upon them until the problems are rectified.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the relationship between the Rural Payments Agency and the British Cattle Movement Service; what plans she has to help improve this relationship; and if she will make a statement.  [85364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w02.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) are both constituent parts of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Both are committed to providing consistently high quality services that are valued by their customers. With the legislative requirement to cross-check common agricultural policy bovine subsidy claims against the cattle tracing system, it is essential that they work together to achieve these objectives.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para2">A formal Service Level Agreement exists between the agency and the service and this is constantly reviewed. I understand that they have had a good working relationship in the past and they have liased extremely closely over recent months to ensure that the queries discovered during the cross-check exercise were resolved without referral to the industry where possible. Rural Payments Agency staff working at, and in conjunction with, the British Cattle Movement Service, examined over 150,000 cross-check queries during recent months.

 To help farmers accommodate the change to digital mapping, each is being sent a copy of the relevant maps showing details of the fields after initial digitisation. The field information being noted by RPA's contractors is taken from the Area Aid Application submitted by the farmer concerned and is digitised using the latest digitised maps provided by the Ordnance Survey.

 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 27 to 28 November 2002. Ministers responsible for fisheries and farming issues in Scotland and Wales also attended and, together with the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, joined me at a short bilateral meeting with Commissioner Fischler on Friday morning at which we discussed the Mid-Term Review of the CAP.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para6">On fisheries, the main items discussed by the Council were reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and cod and hake recovery. The Presidency noted the positions of the member states on CFP reform and will now reflect on how to promote agreement at the December Council.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para7">On cod and hake recovery, the Commissioner outlined his revised strategy for securing cod recovery in the light of the recent scientific assessments. He envisages an 80 per cent. reduction in fishing effort for whitefish fishing, 40 per cent. for flatfish, 10 per cent. for industrial fishing and 5 per cent. for nephrops. The UK emphasised its commitment to securing stock recovery. On the other hand we emphasised our commitment to finding a package of measures which would enable sustainable fishing activity to continue while still achieving recovery. We stressed in particular the importance of the burdens resulting from recovery action falling equitably on all fleets whose activities impact on cod stocks. There will be further technical discussion at official level before the December Council.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para8">The Commissioner also made a first presentation of his proposed action plans on the social, economic and regional implications of EU fleet restructuring and on 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2002 : Column 316W</I><P>
how to reduce discards of unwanted fish. These will return to the Council for further consideration after study by officials.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para9">The Council reached political agreement, by qualified majority, on rules for the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified (GM) food and feed. This was a difficult discussion. I eventually voted against the final compromise because it contained provisions regarding the adventitious presence and labelling of GM organisms that are neither practicable nor enforceable. I also had concerns about the legal base on which the proposal rested.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para10">There was a brief discussion of the measures forming part of a package addressing hygiene rules and their enforcement in respect of food of animal origin. Further work is planned at official level before the December Council.

<a name="21211w02.html_para11">The Commission gave its regular report on BSE in the EU and reported contacts with the French Government over its plans in respect of Specified Risk Material (SRM) controls on sheep spinal cord. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary restated our concerns about the proposed French measures and strongly underlined our view that member states should not take unilateral action that goes beyond existing EU legal provisions and scientific advice.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para12">The Council continued its consideration of the Mid-Term Review of the CAP with a discussion concentrating on modulation, decoupling and cross-compliance. I welcomed the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals while noting that the EU needed to start work quickly on the detailed legislative texts which the Commission had promised for January. I recalled our opposition to certain features of the Commission's modulation model, including its unfair redistribution of modulated funds. I gave strong support to the principle of decoupling aid from production which would encourage farmers to focus more on markets and at the same time strengthen the EU's hand in the WTO negotiations.
<P>

<a name="21211w02.html_para13">Under other business, there was discussion of animal welfare in third countries and the situation in Spain following the sinking of the oil tanker 'Prestige'. The Council also approved a state aid to Greek cotton producers.

<P>

<a name="21211w03.html_para2">In parallel to the Government's policy to make a significant impact on the antisocial behaviour, litter, graffiti and noise which spoils the quality of lives in so many places, ENCAMS has developed tools which help their local authority partners to target real local problems. These include a set of posters to challenge people who allow their dogs to foul local parks. Evaluation has shown that a significant improvement has been achieved in areas where these have been used as part of a local campaign. We are encouraging ENCAMS to spread information about successful local campaigns so that lessons learned can help to improve the quality of life for people in other areas too. This fits with efforts by Ministers in DEFRA, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Home Office to give a high profile to tackling quality of life issues nationally while promoting action at the local level in conjunction with the Local Government Associate and other partners.

This contains details on the environmental impacts of the processes under study. Anaerobic digestion can potentially treat a wide range of biodegradable wastes. However in practical terms its application will depend on its cost and performance compared with the other available treatment options.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department's financial and accounting advisers have produced advice on a range of issues affecting British Energy. The company currently makes contributions to a Nuclear Generation Decommissioning Fund owned by the Nuclear Trust whose primary purpose is to pay the legitimate costs of decommissioning British Energy's UK nuclear power stations. The Trust held its first quinquennial review in 2001, taking advice as appropriate, to compare its funds with its assessment of those costs and published its conclusions on 10 December 2001. However, the Trust does not advise the Government on British Energy's decommissioning costs.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w05.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her estimate is of the <i>(a)</i> discounted present value and <i>(b)</i> undiscounted cost of decommissioning British Energy's nuclear facilities; and what percentage of these will be borne by the Government.  [85647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 British Energy's annual report and accounts 2001&#150;02 estimate the cost of decommissioning the company's nuclear power stations as #0.9 billion (discounted) and #4.8 billion (undiscounted). If the proposed restructuring announced by British Energy on 28 November is successful, it represents the best chance of the company meeting these costs itself. The amount Government will pay depends on the company's performance, and it will underwrite these liabilities to the extent that the funds are insufficient to meet these costs when they occur.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w05.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the estimated implication is for <i>(a)</i> public expenditure and <i>(b)</i> revenue receipts over the next five years, of the renegotiated BNFL contracts with British Energy.  [85645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The precise terms of the new contracts between BNFL and British Energy have yet to be agreed. We anticipate that any impact on total Government revenues of the new commercial deal between BNFL and British Energy will be marginal, and entirely consistent with the fiscal projections in the Pre-Budget Report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what quantities of plutonium owned by Swiss customers are held at Sellafield; in what form it is stored; and what arrangements exist for its return to Switzerland.  [86137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The total amount of plutonium to be allocated to any one reprocessing customer is directly related to the total amount of spent fuel that customer has contracted to be reprocessed. BNFL has contracts to reprocess at THORP 422 tonnes of spent fuel belonging to Swiss electricity generators. The total allocation of plutonium allocated to Swiss customers is a commercial and contractual matter for the owners of the spent fuel and BNFL as the provider of the reprocessing service. However, approximately 1 per cent. of each tonne of spent fuel will be plutonium.
<P>

<a name="21211w06.html_para0">Certain Swiss reprocessing customers have already concluded contracts for the manufacture of MOX fuel, making use of their plutonium dioxide, and these contracts are in the process of being fulfilled. Accordingly, plutonium currently held at Sellafield on behalf of Swiss customers is held in three forms: spent fuel, separated plutonium dioxide and fresh MOX fuel. In addition, some Swiss owned plutonium dioxide has already been made into MOX fuel and used in Swiss reactors. All Swiss plutonium is expected to be returned to Switzerland in the form of MOX fuel.

 BNFL have informed me that as part of its work programme to examine the management options for stored separated plutonium, it is carrying out analysis of various technologies under assessment or study worldwide. BNFL's investment in the plutonium fuels related R&D is approximately #2 million per year.
<P>

<a name="21211w06.html_para1">The company is also examining alternative immobilisation techniques and technologies for those stocks which may prove difficult to convert into fuel. These non-fuel immobilisation technologies are currently in a development or exploratory stage, as they are throughout the world. The work being undertaken by BNFL is part of a wider investment in waste immobilisation technologies of some several million pounds each year; this includes an investment in the UK university base of some #2.5 million over five years.

 It is estimated that by 2025 two thirds of the world's population will be suffering water shortages because of lack of water resources especially in Asia and Africa. At present 1 in 5 people lack access to clean water and half of humanity have no sanitation. At the Johannesburg Summit strong commitments were made to better management of water resources and improved access to water and sanitation. My Department is working with its partners to implement these.

<P>
<a name="21211w07.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The humanitarian situation is a matter of concern. But in 2002, good co-ordination and timely action by the Government of Ethiopia, donors and NGOs has prevented crisis from turning into disaster.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para1">The UK has played a significant role and committed #17.3 million to food and non-food humanitarian assistance in calendar year 2002. DFID has also provided nearly 20 per cent. of the EC contribution. We have also actively promoted and participated in continuous dialogue on the situation between Government, donors and NGOs.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para2">On 7 December, a joint Government-UN appeal was launched for humanitarian assistance in 2003. The appeal identifies 11.3 million people as needing more than 1.4 million metric tonnes of food assistance and places a further 3 million under close monitoring. Such massive need has resulted from the impact of widespread drought on a highly vulnerable population with little capacity to cope with shocks.




<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2002 : Column 333W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para3">The scale of need has led to comparison with the famine of 1984. However, as reiterated by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during the appeal launch, no-one anticipates a repeat of the suffering experienced in 1984. A state of war existed in Ethiopia at that time which impeded the humanitarian response. In addition, Government, donors and NGOs have put effective systems of early warning and response in place that were absent in 1984.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para4">But there is no room for complacency. We remain committed to playing our part in responding rapidly to urgent humanitarian need. We also continue to support the Government of Ethiopia in tackling the underlying causes of food insecurity and protecting the vulnerable.

 There are an estimated 130,000 refugees from Karen and Kayah state, living in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border. Some authorities in Thailand have estimated that a total of 1 million people from Burma live outside of camps in Thailand. The situation for all refugees and internally displaced persons remains extremely vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para5">In 2002&#150;03, my Department has so far disbursed funds of #1.3 million for humanitarian assistance to support both refugees and internally displaced people within Burma/Thailand.

 Under the GATS, Governments retain the right and ability to determine their own domestic regulatory regimes including national policies relating to universal service, affordability of cost to the consumer, quality assurance etc.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para6">In addition the UK Government, other WTO Members and the WTO Secretariat consider public services to be outside the scope of the GATS, regardless of the involvement of private sector finance, where the service to the consumer remains a public service.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para7">Thus, a community's ability to control the provision of services in their area is a matter between that community and its government and cannot be compromised by the GATS.

<P>
<a name="21211w07.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our assistance to the Saharawi refugees is channelled through contributions to the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para8">A new global plan for assistance to the Saharawi was agreed by the EC in May this year. This will provide 14.34 million euros (approximately #9 million) of assistance over a 15-month period. This brings the total assistance provided since 1993 to over 95 million euros, including over 79 million euros in food aid programme co-ordinated by ECHO, the World Food Programme and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Nearly 20 per cent. of this funding comes from my Department's budget.
<P>

<a name="21211w07.html_para9">The UK also supports refugees through UNHCR including, but not specifically, Saharawi in camps in Algeria. My Department has recently signed a four-year Institutional Strategy Paper with UNHCR which guarantees the agency core funding for the next four years. For 2002 this contribution is #14 million. As this contribution is unearmarked it is difficult to ascertain exactly how much of the #14 million is spent in the context of this specific refugee situation.

 The only solution to the humanitarian situation in Palestine is through political action, but we should not allow the increased human suffering of the Palestinian people to continue unaddressed. The UN has recently produced a plan of action to help the international community address the most urgent needs. We are supporting a broad range of emergency programmes through UNRWA, local NGOs and the World bank. In October, I agreed an additional #5 million from my Department's contingency reserve to meet the continuing urgent needs of the Palestinian people.

 It is imperative that we help producers in developing countries benefit from international trade, in order to facilitate economic growth and to help contribute to poverty reduction. Thus through the Doha Development Agenda agreed at the 4th WTO Ministerial in November 2001, the UK is arguing for significant reductions in trade distorting policies and greater access for developing country products to OECD markets, particularly for agricultural goods.

Specifically in Ghana, the UK supports feeder roads construction in cocoa growing areas, which has restored access to markets and provided alternative short-term employment for farmers. The UK has also supported a fair trade initiative to market Ghanaian chocolate in the UK.

The humanitarian situation in Angola remains serious. Since the ceasefire, already over-stretched aid agencies have been able to access several thousand more severely malnourished people. The 2003 UN CAP states that 4.3 million Angolans depend on some form of humanitarian assistance and the WFP has raised its caseload figure of people requiring assistance to 1.9 million. However, humanitarian agencies are still unable to reach 200,000 people and 40 per cent. of the countryside due to damaged infrastructure, inadequate road networks and mine infestation. Up to one million people may be cut-off during the upcoming seasonal rains.

This includes #2 million to the International Committee for the Red Cross and Medicins Sans Frontieres, #300,000 to the United Nations Development Programme for demining, #250,000 to assist the International Organization for Migration with the resettlement of internally displaced people (IDPs), and over #2.5 million to the World Food Programme (WFP).

The Chairman's concluding remarks or summings up are now made publicly available on most board discussions, including those on the debt sustainability analyses that underpin decisions on the level of debt relief to the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs). These analyses are prepared jointly by the World Bank and IMF in collaboration with the Governments in the countries themselves.

 My Department places HIV/AIDS high on our list of priorities of countries and is making significant contributions to combating the epidemic. In our bilateral programme alone, expenditure on HIV/AIDS-related work has increased from #38 million in 1997&#150;98 to over #200 million in 2001&#150;02. DFID's overall programme in Africa is set to increase from #640 million to #1 billion by 2006 and HIV/AIDS will remain one of the highest priorities for the region.

 The publication of the White Paper, Time for Reform, in April 2000, was followed by a well-publicised, open public consultation announced in both Houses of Parliament and which resulted in 1,215 responses being received. Copies of the White Paper were specifically sent to those organisations, including a number of district councils, which had written to us with their views during the review that took place prior to publication and which raised issues relating to licensing generally. Salisbury District Council did not fall into these categories. The Local Government Association, with whom we had established a good working

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent question about extending the speed limit south of Bayston Hill on the A49 Trunk Road.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a number of criteria that are used when deciding an appropriate speed limit, including the nature of the road and its surroundings, existing traffic speeds and the accident rate. The speed limit should appear reasonable to most drivers and have the support of the police, who have responsibility for enforcement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 30 mph speed limit through Bayston Hill was introduced in 1997 as part of a traffic calming scheme through the village. The length south of Bayston Hill is much more rural in character, there have been only two incidents in the last three years, resulting in two minor injuries. Most drivers would consider that a reduction in the limit there would be inappropriate for the conditions and it is unlikely that the police would support any change. In the circumstances, it would therefore be difficult for us to justify an extension of the limit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That said, the Route Management Strategy for the A49 between Ross-on-Wye and Shrewsbury, which went out to public consultation earlier this year, is examining the appropriateness of all existing speed limits along the route, including Bayston Hill.

 The structural integrity of Concorde is ensured in service by way of a phased inspection programme designed to detect potential failures. Both visual and non-destructive examination techniques, such as ultra sound scanning, are used in this process. Inspections are repeated periodically, with the frequency depending on the structural location in question. The efficacy of these inspections is continually reviewed by the UK and French airworthiness authorities in co-operation with Concorde's Anglo-French manufacturers.

 London Transport's expenditure on consultants costs has been regularly reported to the House at six-monthly intervals since 13 January 1999. London Transport could not at that stage be confident of the overall requirements or costs of external advice.

However, in accordance with the guidance set out in Government accounting, Treasury were consulted before notification, and a copy of the minute was also separately sent to the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made by his Department of the European Emission Standard Directives on motorcycling; what discussions have taken place; what representations have been received; and what steps have been taken by his Department as a result.  [86089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 EU directive 2002/51/EC provides for two stages of reductions in emission limit values for two and three wheeled vehicles to have effect from 2003 and 2006 together with a number of other measures designed mainly to maintain emissions performance in-service.
<P>

<a name="21211w12.html_para0">The first stage reductions should contribute a small but useful reduction in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions at a reasonable cost to manufacturers. With regard to the second stage reductions, while the Government welcome further measures for reducing motor cycle emissions, they considered that mandating a second stage of emissions reductions before its impact on the industry could be fully assessed was not in accord with the principle of better regulation, as reasserted in the Mandelkern Report and endorsed by heads of Government at the Barcelona European Council. While the UK did succeed in negotiating some relief for small manufacturers, support from other member states and the European Parliament for a review prior to any second stage implementation was not forthcoming. The Government therefore abstained from voting in the EU Environmental Council's third and final reading on this measure.
<P>

<a name="21211w12.html_para1">The Department has been in contact with the UK industry throughout the negotiations and continues to do so in order to revise its regulatory impact assessment to take account of the second stage measures.

<P>
<a name="21211w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Following the loss of the tanker Erika in December 1999, the UK, jointly with Denmark and the Netherlands, took the lead in securing mandatory change to the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) MARPOL Convention to accelerate the international timetable to phase out single hull oil tankers. To ensure unambiguous enforcement through Port State Control in the EU area we have also supported the EU Regulation which has imposed the IMO text in EU member states. At last week's Transport Council it was agreed to invite a proposal from the Commission to accelerate the timetable even further and to consider how the carriage of heavy oil in single hull tankers might be restricted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In October 2000 the Transport Council approved proposals put forward by the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands for a common approach in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to accelerate the existing international timetable for the phasing out of single hull oil tankers. In April 2001, following negotiations in which the UK played a major part, IMO reached agreement on an amending the MARPOL convention under which single hull tankers having no protection would be phased out in order of age between 2003 and 2007. Under the same agreement partially protected tankers would be phased out of EU ports in order of age between 2003 and 2015. At last week's Transport Council it was agreed to invite a proposal from the Commission to accelerate the timetable even further and to consider how the carriage of heavy oil in single hull tankers might be restricted.

<a name="21211w12.html_para8">Shipbuilding and shipowning are long-term commitments. Investment in the newer double hull tankers depends on the stability offered by this timetable.There is no evidence that reducing the size of oil tankers will improve safety. However, at the recent Transport Council, we agreed to invite a proposal from the Commission to accelerate the timetable for phasing out single hull tankers even further, and to consider how the carriage of heavy oil in single hull tankers might be restricted, with a view to reducing the risk of a spill from a single hull tanker even more.

<a name="21211w13.html_para0">The Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) produced a report entitled long-term analysis of oil spill statistics for the waters around the British Isles 1964 to 1995. For this period there was a consistent and continuing decline in the numbers of beach pollution incidents accompanied by a significant reduction in reports of crude oil and tar in the marine environment, reductions in the annual totals of tanker-source pollution and reductions in the annual total number of incidents attributed to the handling and transportation of oil around the UK coastline.

<a name="21211w13.html_para1">Between 1978 and 1999 the ACOPS annual data has reported 12,746 oil pollution incidents.
<P>

<a name="21211w13.html_para2">The recently published ACOPS annual survey report 2001 identified 678 accidental or deliberate polluting discharges from vessels and offshore installations operating in the UK pollution control zone. There was a downward trend identified in the annual number of oil discharges in the open sea (excluding discharges from offshore installations).
<P>

<a name="21211w13.html_para3">Principal pollution incidents during the period 1990 to 2002 requiring a concentrated cleanup included the Braer in 1994 spilling 85,000 tonnes of crude oil, clean-up cost #52 million and the Sea Empress in 1996 losing 72,000 tonnes of crude oil, clean-up cost #39 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on changes in the frequency of monitoring of pollution incidences from shipping in United Kingdom waters.  [85850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) undertakes regular aerial surveillance of the UK Counter Pollution Control Zone through a contract it has with Air Atlantique. In August 2000, the contract was revised and awarded as a MCA/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) joint contract, to provide 600 hours of programmed flying per year for the MCA to monitor pollution from shipping, and 300 hours for the DTI to monitor pollution from offshore installations. In addition to these programmed hours, the MCA has the capability to mobilise these aircraft at short notice to reports of pollution at sea.
<P>

<a name="21211w13.html_para5">Although the allocated hours in the new contract did not change, it provides faster aircraft and has enhanced Side Looking Airborne Radar, which allows the aircraft to scan 20 miles either side of the aircraft, compared with 10 previously. The aircraft can typically survey 32,000 square miles in a five hour period of surveillance, compared with 14,000 square miles in the past.
<P>

<a name="21211w13.html_para6">The aircraft are therefore able to respond quickly to reported incidents over a wider area, increasing the chances of identifying offending vessels and gathering evidence for use in court.
<P>

<a name="21211w13.html_para7">The MCA also commissioned a satellite oil spill sensing trial to assess whether satellites could be used to improve the detection and identification of polluters. Information from this survey was used to target surveillance aircraft to potential incidents in the survey area and surveillance flights were timed to coincide with reports from satellite imaging. The MCA are presently evaluating how this trial can be developed further to enhance their monitoring capability.

 New vehicles to replace Mark 1 rolling stock have been ordered and are being manufactured to allow the withdrawal of all Mark 1 vehicles by the statutory deadline of 31 December 2004. However, it may not be possible to introduce all the new vehicles by this date because of scale of the power supply upgrade that is required. The industry is exploring various options&#151;one of which includes the accelerated installation of TPWS by 31 March 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he plans to issue to clarify the circumstances in which an in-country asylum applicant should be considered to have made their claim within a 'reasonably practicable period' for the purposes of determining whether they are entitled to support by the National Asylum Support Service; whether asylum seekers will be exempt from having to show that they have made their claim as soon as reasonably practicable if they are in-county applicants who <i>(a)</i> suffer from a recognised disability, <i>(b)</i> suffer from a serious physical, mental or psychological illness, <i>(c)</i> are pregnant, <i>(d)</i> suffer from serious trauma, <i>(e)</i> have been subject to human rights abuse, <i>(f)</i> are drug or alcohol dependent, and <i>(g)</i> are over the age of 60; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2002]:</i> Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which comes into force on 8 January 2003, will prevent the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) from providing support unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person applied for asylum as soon as reasonably practicable after arrival in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para0">Case-workers in NASS will receive training on how this new measure should be applied. In addition guidance will also be issued to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para1">I can confirm that in practice, if an applicant makes a claim immediately on arrival at the port then they will be able to access asylum support, provided they otherwise

qualify. If the person fails, without good reason, to make an asylum claim immediately at the port of arrival then support will be refused.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para2">Families with children will, however, receive asylum support even if they did not apply as soon as reasonably practicable.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para3">In addition, those who claim asylum in-country following a significant change in circumstances in their country of origin (provided they make their asylum claim at the earliest possible opportunity following that change of circumstance) will be supported by NASS.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para4">In addition asylum seekers who successfully show that a refusal of support by NASS will result, for example, in a breach of Article 3 European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) will be granted support by NASS.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para5">Local authorities will continue to be able to provide support to asylum seekers under the National Assistance Act 1948 (or in Scotland the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968) but only where they are presently empowered to do so, ie where special needs have been identified so as to engage those provisions.
<P>

<a name="21211w14.html_para6">Whether the particular types of case which are referred to will be eligible for support will depend on whether, on the particular facts of the case, the claim for asylum has been made as soon as reasonably practicable and, if not, whether the case falls within one of the exceptions referred to above.

Official status letters are normally sent out without delay following the decision to grant asylum, except where the asylum claimant is no longer in contact with the Home Office.

 Our policy on the detention of asylum seekers in prison accommodation was set out in our White Paper XSecure Borders, Safe Haven&#151;Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain". We made it clear that, although the routine use of prison accommodation for immigration detainees had ended, there would remain a need to hold small numbers of individuals, including individuals who may have sought asylum at some stage, in prison for reasons of security and control. There has been no change in that policy.

 The information available is on passengers (excluding EEA nationals) admitted to the United Kingdom, rather than on those presenting themselves at ports. A very small proportion of those admitted are granted settlement (permanent residency) on arrival and they are clearly seeking to reside in the UK. However, the vast majority of non-visitors are given limited leave to remain for periods of up to between one and five years. It is difficult to know at the port of entry how many of these will ultimately seek to settle in the UK as once in country, subject to immigration rules, they may extend their leave to remain and subsequently apply for settlement.

<a name="21211w16.html_para1">The Prison Service has a duty of care to all prisoners in its custody, and recognises that self-harm is a particular problem among women offenders. The Prison Service is currently developing several interventions that may help female prisoners reduce and manage self-harm in prison. One such example is at Holloway prison, where all prisoners who have been identified as at risk of suicide/self-harm are offered individual crisis counselling. About 40 per cent of prisoners take up the offer, while others may be referred to alternative sources of help within the prison. Staff report that following counselling women have shown increases in self-esteem, decreases in depression and are less likely to see suicide or self-harm as the solution to their problems.

The number of girls in Prison Service custody is too low for them to be accommodated in juvenile-only accommodation whilst at the same time maintaining proximity to home and providing an appropriate level of educational and recreational services. The Board nevertheless seeks to avoid mixing as far as possible and is supporting the development of under-18 wings within larger women-only establishments.
<P>

<a name="21211w16.html_para8">Occasionally, juveniles are held outside the juvenile estate for the duration of their trial if their case is being heard in a Crown Court without any conveniently located juvenile establishment. In such circumstances, they are held on young offender wings, ie with 18 to 20-year-olds rather than with adults as such. Even more exceptionally, a juvenile may be categorised as Category A and be accommodated in a high security establishment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]:</i> The New Deal Evaluation Database contains information on the characteristics (e.g. gender, age, ethnic group) of participants on the New Deal programme, together with details of their activity while on the programme. Full details can be found in an article entitled XNew Deal Statistics and the New Deal Evaluation Database" in the April 1999 edition of Labour Market Trends, a copy of which is available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many and what proportion of <i>(a)</i> subsidised and <i>(b)</i> unsubsidised sustained employment starts under the New Deal have been in the construction industry in each month since the establishment of the New Deal; and if he will make a statement about the impact of the New Deal on employment in the construction industry.  [85993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
<i> [holding answer 26 November 2002]:</i> We estimate that since April 1998 around 9 per cent. (6,800) of subsidised employment starts in the New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 plus have been in the construction industry. However, the underlying data are not sufficiently robust for a realistic monthly breakdown to be given. Subsidised employment is not an option in the other New Deals.
<P>

<a name="21211w18.html_para10">Information on the industry sector of unsubsidised sustained employment starts obtained through the New Deal is not routinely collected.
<P>

<a name="21211w18.html_para11">In addition to filling construction industry jobs through the New Deal, we have introduced Ambition: Construction, an employer-led initiative which is designed to help unemployed and disadvantaged people gain the specific skills which construction employers require. Ambition: Construction aims to deliver sustainable employment and an NVQ Level 2 qualification in one of the construction trades to 1,000 New Deal participants. Pilot programmes are now running in West London, West Yorkshire, Nottingham, the North West and Coventry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w18.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]:</i> New Deal for Disabled People is the first national programme designed specifically to support people with health conditions and disabilities move into and keep jobs. Since the national extension of the programme began, it has helped over 6,000 people into jobs and almost 28,000 have registered with Job Brokers to actively pursue employment.
<P>

<a name="21211w18.html_para12">Comprehensive evaluation is under way to measure the effectiveness of the programme. This will include qualitative and quantitative research with all key stakeholders. We will be publishing reports on different elements of the evaluation as they become available from early in the new year.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2002]:</i> The Government are determined to tackle unemployment and social exclusion both at home and throughout the European Union. Signing the social chapter has allowed us to influence the broad direction of EU social policy, and to ensure that employment creation has been put at the heart of the Lisbon agenda for economic reform. Since 1997, over 10 million new jobs have been created in the EU, 6 million of which have been taken up by women, and the number of unemployed has fallen by over 4 million. This has provided a route out of social exclusion for many millions of European citizens.

<P>
<a name="21211w19.html_wqn11"><B> Margaret Moran: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many hours training judges receive on domestic violence <i>(a)</i> per year and <i>(b)</i> during the course of their term.  [86425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21211w19.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB) which is an independent body. It is chaired by Lord Justice Waller.
<P>

<a name="21211w19.html_para2">All newly appointed part-time judges are required to attend a residential induction course before they sit judicially. In addition all judges authorised by the Lord Chancellor on the strength of their experience and ability, to exercise an additional jurisdiction such as family law, are required to attend a further residential induction course before they start to exercise the relevant jurisdiction.
<P>

<a name="21211w19.html_para3">Thereafter, both full and part-time judges attend residential continuation seminars every three years in each jurisdiction they are authorised to exercise (i.e. criminal law, civil law and family law). The amount of training time provided on domestic violence in JSB courses and seminars is shown in the table. The number of hours training received by any individual judge will depend upon the number of jurisdictions they are authorised to exercise.
<P>

<a name="21211w19.html_para4">In addition, all full and part-time judges sitting in the Crown court attend an annual one-day circuit seminar on sentencing issues, for which the theme last year was domestic violence. This provided, on average, up to five hours of additional training on this subject in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="21211w19.html_para5">The term of appointment of an individual judge varies according to their age on appointment and their age of retirement, as determined by the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act (1993). It is therefore not possible to determine how many hours training on domestic violence in total a judge may receive during his or her term of office.

The Government recognise that there is still more to be done to ensure that the high standards of child protection are applied in every case.

The issues raised by Victoria's case are wide-ranging, in terms of both policy and practice. The recommendations of the joint chief inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbie Inquiry will provide us with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made and if radical reform is necessary, we will implement it.

 Information has been placed in the Library which gives the number of new cases (diagnoses) and new cases per 100,000 population for each of the infections, by region, for the years 1996&#150;2001. Data are not available at the health authority/primary care trust level.
<P>

<a name="21211w24.html_para7">Diagnoses of HIV were derived from voluntary clinician and laboratory reporting and the sexually transmitted infection (STI) data were derived from statutory reporting of diagnoses made at genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics on form KC60. Data on STIs are only collected from GUM clinics, so STIs diagnosed and treated by general practitioners or in other settings do not form part of the data set.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason silicofluoride chemicals classified as medicinal substances under the Codified Pharmaceutical Directive are, exempt from such classification by the Medicines Control Agency when used as an additive to public water supplies.  [85840]<P>

<a name="21211w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The inclusion of silicofluoride chemicals in a product does not necessarily make that product a medicinal product. Silicofluoride has many different uses and can therefore be subject to a number of different regulatory regimes. For example, various forms of fluoride can be included in oral hygiene products under the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations and some forms of fluoride will be permitted in food supplements through the forthcoming Food Supplements (England) Regulations. The decision as to whether a particular product is a medicinal product is made by the Medicines Control Agency using the definition of that term in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83, relevant legal precedent and its own published guidance. The MCA considers that neither fluoride added to drinking water nor the resulting fluoridated water are medicinal products which require marketing authorisations as medicines.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many consultants employed by the Leeds health authority and its trusts are suspended; and for how long they each have been suspended.  [83482]<P>

<P>
<a name="21211w24.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Neither the former Leeds health authority nor the West Yorkshire strategic health authority employ consultants. However there is only one consultant from all the national health service trusts within the West Yorkshire strategic health authority area who is currently suspended. That individual has been suspended since May 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will define, in reference to the wheelchair services collaborative programme, the phrase 'all teach, all learn' in his Department's press release of 27 November XNHS and wheelchair users unite in initiative to improve services".  [86708]

 Across the national health service 45 services are taking part in the wheelchair service collaborative programme to improve the service that they already provide. The collaborative will operate for approximately 18 months and it is hoped that the services will share their learning and experience in order to make specific improvements.
<P>

<a name="21211w25.html_para0">Every service will have its part to play specifically in sharing good practice in particularly what works well for them and what could be adopted by other services to improve their own. Similarly there will be ideas that they in turn will adopt&#151;hence the reference to everybody teaching and everybody learning.
