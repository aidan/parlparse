<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w01.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I understand that sampling and analysis of groundwater from nine boreholes on the Sellafield site and from one perimeter borehole has indicated the presence of technetium-99. The highest level found at an on-site borehole was 290 becquerels per litre. The level in the perimeter borehole was 0.2 becquerels per litre. An assessment has been made of the potential radiological impact of the presence of technetium-99 in groundwater and the Environment Agency is satisfied that this would be insignificant. The Agency and the Health and Safety Executive are working with BNFL to establish the source of the contamination. The regulators will then need to consider what further measures need to be taken.

<UL>(2) on average how long after a clinical diagnosis of the disease slaughter was completed on the contiguous farms during the foot and mouth epidemic.  [47602]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information regarding the time taken to slaughter on infected premises is presented in two charts, copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20417w01.html_para2">When looking at the charts the following should be taken into consideration:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The charts show the percentage of infected premises culled out, on a weekly basis, within the 24-hour target and the number of infected premises culled out, on a weekly basis, within the 24-hour target.
<P>
<BR>
The 24-hour target policy was based upon the time from which suspicion of disease was first communicated to DEFRA offices, not the time and date of clinical diagnosis. The time to slaughter has been calculated as the difference between this time and date and the time and date by which all animals on each premises had been slaughtered.
<P>
<BR>
Premises which presently have missing dates, negative times to slaughter and times to slaughter greater than 500 hours have been excluded. The charts have been created from the data within DEFRA's Disease Control System Database and they may be subject to change as the data cleansing exercise is carried out.
<P>
<BR>
The charts are based on a majority of data held on DCS and give a representative picture of the times taken to slaughter.
<P>
<BR>
Although a total of 2,026 infected premises (IPs) were reported in the UK, the "time to slaughter" charts do not include IPs that were previously Dangerous contacts or slaughter on suspicion cases. These premises have not been included since, at the time, it would not have been identified that a 24-hour target was to be

<P>
<BR>
The percentage target hit, on its own, does not reflect the number of premises that were having to be dealt with&#151;a 50 per cent. hit may be representing a figure of two cases or 200.
<P>
<BR>
The charts do not give context to the underlying data. They obviously do not give any information regarding the reasons why culls may have taken longer than 24&#150;48 hours, and cannot describe the practical difficulties faced by regional offices attempting to slaughter premises quickly in often extremely difficult circumstances. The count of premises slaughtered does not take into account the number of animals involved (size or herd) or the species.

<a name="20417w02.html_para0">Detailed inventories of chemical weapons and other munitions disposed of to dumpsites at sea are no longer available, as many records were destroyed after the disposals as a matter of routine custom and practice. Where records of the disposals do remain in existence, they have been released to the Public Record Office. Information on the locations of sea disposals of chemical weapons has also been placed in the Library of the House. As to the potential risk posed by chemical weapons, the long-held consensus of international scientific opinion is that munitions on the seabed present no significant risk to safety, human health or the marine environment, provided they remain undisturbed.

 The Insolvency Service will continue to seek to make best use of its existing estate and, wherever possible, to reduce its costs.

 Service personnel who incur extra expense for food or accommodation while on temporary or detached duty in the UK are reimbursed via range of UK subsistence allowances. In the first instance, every effort is made to accommodate personnel in service messes where food and accommodation costs are paid direct by the Ministry of Defence. If service accommodation is used, &#163;1.50 per 24-hour period can be claimed for incidental expenses.

<a name="20417w04.html_para0">If service accommodation is unavailable, the preferred option is to arrange hotel B&B accommodation through MOD's Central Hotel Booking Service (CHBS) that make bookings within a set cost ceiling.

Personnel staying in a hotel may claim a total of &#163;22.90 per 24-hour period to cover additional costs incurred for lunch, dinner and travel, and incidental expenses such as telephone calls or laundry.

 My Department does not fund coaching staff directly. The majority of public funding for sport is channelled through UK Sport and Sport England. Comprehensive information on the number of coaches funded from Sports Council grants is not held centrally. The following tables are drawn from records kept by UK Sport and Sport England.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport which <i>(a)</i> secondary schools in England and <i>(b)</i> local education authorities have received New Opportunities Fund payments to improve sport and physical education facilities; and what the total amount was in each case.

 Local education authorities (LEAs) have received notification of their allocation under the scheme and bids are being developed. The deadline for LEAs to submit their stage 1 applications is the 22 April. Funding allocations are made up of a baseline allocation (based on the size of the school population in the LEA) and levels of deprivation in the area.

<P>

<a name="20417w07.html_para0">The allocation figures for each LEA area are given in the following table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assistance will be provided to those who are unable to take up digital television in Suffolk on the grounds of <i>(a)</i> affordability, <i>(b)</i> access and <i>(c)</i> reception.  [50584]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w07.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Digital Television Action Plan, posted on www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk and agreed by stakeholders, sets out a framework of actions to be taken by Government and industry, in partnership, to enable the take-up of digital television and achieve the tests of accessibility, availability and affordability announced in September 1999. The Government are committed to ensuring that terrestrial analogue broadcasting signals are maintained until those tests are achieved.

<P>
<a name="20417w07.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> The Independent Television Commission is responsible for licensing commercial digital television services in the UK. One specific criterion to which the commission must have regard when awarding the multiplex licence is the capacity of the digital programme services proposed to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests. The Government's consultation paper on media ownership proposed that specific limits should not be placed on the ownership of digital services. Competition law should ensure that there is effective competition between digital platforms and the Government will continue to act to ensure open access to gateways on these markets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w07.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have had no such discussions. The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the television licensing system. As Licensing Authority, it is for the Corporation to set enforcement guidelines for its agent TV Licensing.

 The National Lottery logo is owned by the National Lottery Commission. There is no new logo, although Camelot have been discussing with the commission minor modifications to the current design. Camelot have recently introduced a new corporate logo; that is wholly a matter for them. The Department has not been involved in either matter.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the policy of his Department is towards age discrimination.  [42584]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w08.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Home Office has made a commitment to provide staff of all ages and backgrounds with opportunities to maximise their skills and achieve their potential. This is incorporated into our employment policy on discrimination and is set out in our new equal opportunities statement. Continuing work to promote a diverse work force will include monitoring of recruitment, selection and appraisal statistics to ensure that age discrimination is not taking place.
<P>

<a name="20417w08.html_para1">The Department has recently completed a comprehensive review of its age retirement policy, resulting in a change in age retirement policy throughout the Home Office (including agencies), except for the prison service which is carrying out its own separate review. The new policy, which will come into force on 1 April 2002, will allow staff in all grades below the senior civil service to retire at any point between the ages of 60 and 65.
<P>

<a name="20417w08.html_para2">The Home Office (including agencies but excluding the prison service) has also changed its recruitment policy as of 1 April 2002, to allow the recruitment of staff up to the age of 64 subject to their meeting normal standards of health. Provided that there is an expectation of a reasonable period of employment and a return on recruitment and training, the primary criterion for selection will be the ability of a candidate to carry out the duties of the vacant post. If the most suitable candidate happens to be over sixty years old, this should not prevent a candidate being offered the post.
<P>

<a name="20417w08.html_para3">In making these various changes, the Home Office is implementing the recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) report "Winning the Generation Game".

 My right hon. friend the Home Secretary has an overarching role in monitoring progress against the United Kingdom drugs strategy, taking account of differences in approach where responsibility is devolved. The National Assembly for Wales has devolved responsibility for setting the strategic direction in Wales and monitoring its progress.
<P>

<a name="20417w08.html_para4">Criminal justice policy, however, is not devolved and I am pleased to report that arrest referral schemes and drug testing and treatment orders&#151;both of which aim to help break the link between drug misuse and crime by helping offenders access treatment services&#151;are now available throughout Wales.

 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2002]:</i> The answer to this question can be provided only at a disproportionate cost. However, from March 1973 to 31 December 2001, there were 371 devices in London, and 17 shootings. In the rest of Great Britain there were 583 devices and 34 shootings. A total of 164 arrests were made in London and 261 in the rest of Great Britain during the same period.

<P>
<a name="20417w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2002]:</i> It is not our policy or practice to list the names of those who are the subject of extradition proceedings. I understand from the Attorney-General that the United Kingdom has sought the return of three fugitives under the backing of warrants arrangements in place as between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Those cases involve charges of conspiracy to murder; conspiracy to cause explosions; escape from lawful custody, and unlawful wounding.

<P>

<a name="20417w09.html_para0">Salary scales affect the Commission's ability to recruit, motivate and retain CRMs, and other staff of appropriate standards, against growing outside competition. Discussions have been held within the Commission and with the Home Office concerning the current scales.

<P>

 The Victim's Charter Review and Implementation Group does not include a special representative of road traffic victims. However, RoadPeace, Brake and the Campaign Against Drinking and Driving are each represented on the Road Deaths and Injuries Working Group, a subsidiary group considering the inclusion of road traffic victims within the scope of the Victim's Charter.
<P>

<a name="20417w09.html_para4">The Victim's Charter Review and Implementation Group receive periodic updates on the progress made by the Working Group and fully recognise that the specialist knowledge and experience of the voluntary organisations should strongly influence any emerging recommendations on how best to meet road traffic victims' needs. This is achieved through the subsidiary group.
<P>

<a name="20417w09.html_para5">More generally, the Home Department is setting up a separate and permanent Victims' Advisory Panel in order to advise on all current and future developments for victims.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The specific information requested is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. It is possible to provide figures relating to those with convictions for murder where it might be assumed that a life sentence was involved. The latest available figures show that there have been 59 such referrals since the establishment of the commission. Of these, 31 are awaiting an appeal hearing. Of the 28 appeals against a murder conviction that have been heard, the conviction was quashed in 19 cases, and judgment reserved in one case. Of the eight such convictions that were upheld by the Court of Appeal, one went on to the House of Lords where it was quashed.
<P>

<a name="20417w09.html_para6">Legislation requires the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal against conviction if they think the conviction is unsafe and to dismiss such an appeal in any other case. In each case the Court of Appeal's written judgment sets out the reasons for their decision on the safety of the conviction.
<P>

<a name="20417w09.html_para7">Almost all of those applying to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have their convictions reviewed do so because they are maintaining their innocence.

 There have been no such discussions. Since the establishment in 1997 of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has had no role in the review of alleged miscarriages of justice. The commission is an independent body and it would therefore be inappropriate for the Home Secretary to intervene in this way.

 Arising from recommendations in the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice Review, the Lord Chancellor, in December of last year, appointed Mr. John Simpson as Commissioner for Judicial Appointments for Northern Ireland. The Commissioner will oversee the development of a strategy of equal opportunity and outreach designed to broaden the pool of potential applicants for judicial office. Particular emphasis will be placed on the introduction of measures designed to encourage applications from sectors of the community that have been historically under-represented or where applications have been disproportionately low. All appointments, however, will continue to be made on merit and merit alone. The Commissioner will publish his first annual report to the Lord Chancellor early next year.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement about delays at the Court of Protection; whether they derive from the recent re-location of that service; and whether its filing systems have been affected by the move.  [48734]<P>

<a name="20417w11.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Court of Protection, which is the Judicial 'arm' of the PGO, continues to deal with any work that it receives very speedily. In 2001&#150;02, over 90 per cent. of submissions received from the PGO were processed within five working days. However, there have been recent delays in the PGO (which provides the administrative support to the court) which have impacted on the overall service delivery received by the court's clients.
<P>

<a name="20417w11.html_para4">It is correct to say that the recent relocation of the court and the PGO, which is now complete, has been a contributing factor to the cause of the delays. The PGO is very conscious indeed of the need to improve its services and reduce delay and much work is being done to address this.
<P>

<a name="20417w11.html_para5">All 25,000 plus case dossiers were moved from the PGO's old location to Archway and the new filing system has taken some time to bed down. A pilot of an electronic file scanning system, using bar codes, is about to start which it is hoped will considerably improve the ability to manage records more effectively. This will be a precursor to the development and implementation of the new electronic case record management system ('MERIS') which is due to be operational within the next 18 months and will ultimately reduce reliance on paper dossiers.

 Despite three years of drought and 23 years of conflict, and the recent insecurity and population displacement, widespread famine in Afghanistan has been averted by the early and effective actions of the humanitarian community. Over 6.6 million people have been provided with food aid over the past six months, as well as other essential relief supplies such as tents, clothing and cooking equipment. Pockets of need remain in isolated or insecure areas, but agencies are using every means available to deliver assistance to those in need.

<a name="20417w16.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The humanitarian situation remains fragile in Afghanistan. After 23 years of conflict and three years of drought, as well as continued limited access to some areas of Afghanistan, our assessment is that significant needs will remain for at least the coming year in challenging and volatile operating conditions. The latest assessment by the United Nations and the Afghan Interim Administration estimates that approximately 9 million Afghans, including over 1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), will be in need of assistance in Afghanistan in 2002.

 My Department is in contact with the multilateral institutions about Afghanistan's reconstruction, and is also providing support to the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority, which developed the recently announced National Development Framework, to develop its capacity to manage the process of reconstruction. There are no immediate plans for the development of a PRSP for Afghanistan. However, the design and implementation of a National Development Framework could pave the way for a PRSP in due course.

 The UK is closely engaged with the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) and international partners to develop an integrated framework for security sector reform encompassing the police, military and judicial systems. This includes discussions with Germany, who are acting as the national lead on police training programmes in Afghanistan.

 We are pursuing a wide range of policies to reduce poverty in Africa, including more and better aid and greater coherence among policies which affect African nations.
<P>

<a name="20417w17.html_para1">Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa stands at over &#163;630 million a year and is increasingly provided in the form of assistance to reforming Governments&#151;to enable them to implement nationally-owned poverty reduction strategies. Bilateral aid to Africa has almost doubled since 1997 and is set to rise further.
<P>

<a name="20417w17.html_para2">The UK has been at the forefront of efforts to set up a system for providing debt relief to countries with unsustainable debt levels. So far 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have reached decision point on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and are receiving interim debt relief and three have completed the HIIPC process and are receiving full debt relief; we are working with African countries and with the international community to tackle conflict in the continent, including seeking resolution of existing conflicts as well as finding ways to prevent future disputes; working with the international community and partner countries to tackle key development challenges, including fighting HIV/AIDS, investing in health and education, investing in rural economies and infrastructure, promoting private investment and sustainable development, improved information and communications technology, and improving governance and service delivery; promoting changes in policies of wealthy countries which impact on Africa's development, such as trade and market access, agricultural subsidies, arms proliferation, corruption and bribery by international companies; working with African leaders and institutions to promote closer partnerships between Africa and the rest of the world, and supporting African owned development strategies, including the New Partnership for Africa's Development; and providing funds to, and working with, multilateral bodies such as the World bank, International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the African Development bank, United Nations agencies, and others.

 The situation in Zimbabwe highlights the need for African nations to improve standards of economic and political governance in the struggle to eliminate poverty. The proposed African peer review system has an important role to play. These proposals are being developed under the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is clear that the Zimbabwe elections did not meet the standards already laid down by the Southern Africa Development Community.

 The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is one of the most important initiatives that has come from Africa in recent years.

 Nigeria has a history of poor governance and very high levels of corruption which is the major cause of very high levels of poverty in this oil rich country. Nigeria transferred from military to civilian rule in 1999 amidst considerable optimism for reform. Improvements in the performance of Government and impact on corruption have been slow.

<a name="20417w17.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Much of our work in Sierra Leone aims to strengthen democracy and promote economic recovery. We are providing technical assistance to the National Election Commission to help ensure that May's Presidential elections are free and fair. We are providing long-term support for wide-ranging public sector reforms, working with the police, the Ministry of Defence, the judiciary and the Anti-Corruption Commission to promote democratic values, including greater transparency, accountability and the rule of law. A copy of my speech in Sierra Leone in February outlining our priorities for action will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20417w17.html_para5">Economic recovery is one of the two main planks of the Sierra Leone Government's interim poverty reduction strategy. We are providing technical support to develop this into a full strategy, guiding Government policy and expenditure over the next few years to promote growth and poverty reduction. And we have been successful in pressing for early relief on Sierra Leone's unsustainable international debt under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, a key step towards attracting renewed foreign investment.

 Our priority in Mozambique is to support the development, implementation and monitoring of the Government of Mozambique's own Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty, known as the PARPA. Many of the central themes of the New Partnership for African Development, including the need for local ownership of development processes and for sound policies, better governance and accountability to citizens, are strongly reflected in the PARPA.
<P>

<a name="20417w17.html_para6">The New Partnership for African Development also calls for donors to re-examine their ways of working and, in particular, to focus their resources on agreed priorities and to ensure that funds are increasingly channelled through Government's own systems. In Mozambique, DFID and other key donors have established a common mechanism for disbursing aid funds via the Government's central budget, supported by measures to improve capacity. This is vital to improve accountability and the effectiveness of aid, by ensuring that funds are allocated via the budget to the priority areas set out in the PARPA, and we are committed to increasing the proportion of our Mozambique programme which is channelled in this way.

 The humanitarian situation in Angola has deteriorated further over the last 12 months.

 Work has already begun on consolidating the housing benefit regulations and we plan to lay consolidated regulations before the House as soon as practicable.
<P>

<a name="20417w20.html_para0">Technical amendments will also be made to reflect changes to other benefits. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Consequential changes that support the introduction of the loss of benefit provisions (known as Two Strikes) as contained in the Fraud Act 2001 and the Loss of Benefit Regulations 2001. Two Strikes is designed to be a deterrent against continued abuse of the benefit system by introducing a benefit sanction for those convicted separately of two benefit offences; housing benefit and council tax benefit are both covered by the Two Strikes provisions.
<P>
<BR>
The phased introduction from April 2002 of provisions under the Fraud Act 2001, including the powers for authorised officers from DWP and local authorities to require information from prescribed organisations such as banks and building societies. The information-gathering powers are covered by a statutory Code of Practice, which has been subject to a three-month public consultation and has been laid before both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<BR>
With the introduction of the pension credit, we are making changes to remove the need to re-claim HB every year for pensioners aged 65 and over. For those over 65, we will be making awards for five years. The HB income threshold will also be raised by the maximum amount of the pension credit savings reward, to an expected level of &#163;113.80 for single pensioners in 2003 and we will treat pensioners' capital more generously.

A review of the sale of fair trade products with the primary catering supplier on 13 March (during Fair Trade Fortnight) confirmed that fair trade products, such as coffee and tea, are sold in the Department. This review also confirmed that, while the supplier currently operates ethical, environmentally appropriate procurement policies, they are also working to develop and introduce a specific fair trade strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what payments have been made to individuals following findings of maladministration by ombudsmen with responsibility for agencies under remit of his Department in the last 12 months; and what plans he has to review the powers to increase the level of awards that can be made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Comprehensive details of financial redress paid in cases where the Parliamentary Ombudsman has completed an investigation and issued a formal report are not held centrally. However, based on such records as are available, payments amounting to &#163;155,866.51 have been agreed in 94 cases during the 12 months to 31 March 2002. This figure excludes cases where a statutory resolution has been found.
<P>

<a name="20417w20.html_para6">Each case is judged on its individual merits. Where the Ombudsman finds that maladministration has occurred and that financial redress is appropriate, the general principle adopted is to provide redress which is fair and reasonable in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case. Where the complainant has suffered actual financial loss as a result of the maladministration, or faced costs which would otherwise not have been incurred (and which are reasonable in the circumstances), the general approach is to restore the complainant to the position he or she would have enjoyed had the maladministration not occurred. Where there is not an actual financial loss or cost, careful judgment is used to decide whether financial redress is appropriate and, if so, what constitutes fair and reasonable financial redress. There are no plans to alter these principles.

<a name="20417w23.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The better hospital food programme, announced in the NHS Plan, is a long-term initiative designed to improve the quality, availability of and access to food in NHS hospitals. It is supported by the investment of &#163;38.5 million over four years.
<P>

<a name="20417w23.html_para6">It is increasingly being recognised that ensuring patients, many of whom enter hospital malnourished or over-nourished, receive and can benefit form adequate and appropriate nutrition plays a key part in the overall healthcare they receive and can lead to speedier recovery, reduced length of stay, reduced incidence of post operative complications such as pressure sores and poor wound healing and may lead to reduced expenditure on drugs, particularly antibiotics, used to combat these.
<P>

<a name="20417w23.html_para7">Hospital dieticians have a crucial role to play in ensuring that these benefits are realised through: advising on the formulation of hospital menus to ensure that nutritional standards are delivered for all patients, including those with specific dietary need; monitoring the nutritional intake of patients, particularly those at greatest risk; and advising individual patients on the nutritional values of foods, in order to help them make informed choices about their food intake to meet both their dietary needs and those of their clinical condition.
<P>

<a name="20417w23.html_para8">To this end NHS Estates has been working closely with representatives of the British Dietetic Association who are developing a consensus statement on "Food Service and the State Registered Dietitian" which will cover standards for the professions in a number of key areas: nutritional analysis of recipes and menus; diet coding definitions and standard glossary of terms. This will be a key document enabling standard criteria to be applied across the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20417w23.html_para9">Additionally, an ad hoc working group which includes nutritional experts, representatives of the British Dietetic Association, NHS dietitians and nurses is devising principles for nutritional screening which will facilitate the measurement of both under and over nutrition on entry to hospital. This will allow early intervention of clinical and dietetic staff to address problems which, unchecked, may lead to prolonged ill health. In addition research will be undertaken to establish the clinical outcomes of improved nutrition and to provide a tool to ensure that the nutritional aims of the better hospital food programme are taking effect.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how the board member nominated to take personal responsibility for monitoring hospital cleanliness will be held responsible for any failure;  [47008]

<a name="20417w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 It was a requirement of the NHS Plan that every national health service trust should nominate a board member to take responsibility for monitoring hospital cleanliness and report to the board following regular check-ups. Each NHS trust board takes collective responsibility, and overall accountability rests with the chief executive. The new national standards of cleanliness for the NHS, issued by NHS Estates in April 2001, set out clearly what is required.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> These data are not collected or held centrally. However, we are concerned by the impact of missed appointments on primary care services and have funded "Doctor/Patient Partnership" campaigns on this since 1997. In addition, the national primary care development team is now working with general practitioners to help them to offer more responsive and timely access for patients. For participating practices this approach has led to substantial reductions in missed appointments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Primary care trusts (PCTs) may develop indicative budgets at practice or locality level to make explicit resource use within a PCT, encourage fairer more transparent allocation of resources and enable primary care to lever strategic change within local health communities.
<P>

<a name="20417w25.html_para2">Incentive schemes created in conjunction with the development of indicative budgets encourage general practitioners to understand and reflect on their current practice and innovate. PCTs in consultation with practices and through the development of a local health improvement and modernisation programme should develop and agree a commissioning plan for the PCT as a whole, reflecting the health needs of local communities. This two-way dialogue allows PCTs to secure services for their populations that general practitioners and other primary and community health professionals identify as being necessary. Work is in hand to scope how PCTs and practices could be supported to develop indicative budgets at practice level. This could be through developing a national framework or local models of good practice.

 Our policy on services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers is set out in the White Paper "Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" published in March 2001. This was supplemented by guidance to local authorities and the national health service in August 2001.
<P>

<a name="20417w25.html_para3">Our objective for housing is to enable people with learning disabilities and their families to have greater choice and control over where and how they live. People with learning disabilities can live successfully in different types of housing including small-scale ordinary housing, supported living and village and residential communities as well as residential care. We expect local authorities to ensure that all housing options are considered when they are exploring the future housing, care and support needs of people with learning disabilities and their families.
<P>

<a name="20417w25.html_para4">Councils should respect the preferences of individuals and their families, wherever the preferred options will meet individuals' assessed needs and are affordable. Where there is limited demand for a particular option, councils and housing authorities may need to consider joining with neighbouring authorities to encourage the development of a greater range of provision.
<P>

<a name="20417w25.html_para5">Learning disability partnership boards have been set up in each local authority area to oversee and advise on implementation of the Valuing People programme. Boards have been asked to produce local housing strategies for people with learning disabilities by winter 2002&#150;03. The Department and the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions will issue shortly guidance about this for learning disability partnership boards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the expenditure on the NHS was as a proportion of the GDP of England in the last 12 months; and to what extent he collates information about NHS expenditure in Scotland as a percentage of Scottish GDP in order to assess his progress towards meeting his targets.  [46917]<P>

<P>
<a name="20417w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The gross domestic product (GDP) for England is not yet available for 2001&#150;02. The latest available GDP for England is for 1999 and is published by the Office of National Statistics in 'Regional Trends' which is available in the Library. Figures for later years are available on a United Kingdom basis only.
<P>

<a name="20417w25.html_para6">The Government's target for health care investment is for the whole of the United Kingdom. NHS expenditure in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is therefore collected by the Department in order to calculate total national health service expenditure in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20417w25.html_para7">Planned NHS expenditure in the United Kingdom for 2001&#150;02 was 6.3 per cent. of GDP. This means that total healthcare expenditure, including private healthcare, as a percentage of GDP last year was 7.3 per cent. rising to 7.6 per cent. by 2003&#150;04 based on latest expenditure plans.

 Health authorities and primary care trusts are under a statutory obligation set out in Directions to provide appropriate funding for treatments recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). The Directions were made using powers in the National Health Service Act 1977 and came into force on 1 January 2002. The Directions were introduced as part of the Government's strategy to ensure consistency of access to treatments recommended by NICE and deemed appropriate by clinicians for their individual patients. Funding is provided in baseline allocations to meet these commitments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much of its research budget is allocated for research into traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.  [48812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w26.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC supports a large amount of basic underpinning work on how the brain responds to injury of all types and on neural regeneration, which will inform research on rehabilitation after traumatic head injury. The MRC's expenditure specifically on rehabilitation after traumatic head injury (i.e. excluding the underpinning work) was &#163;835,000 in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="20417w26.html_para0">The Department commissions research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care. The Department has directly funded projects relating to brain and head injury, some of which are on rehabilitation, with total estimated expenditure of about &#163;125,000 for 2001&#150;02. The Department funded a major 



<P>
<P><I>17 Apr 2002 : Column 1026W</I><P>
project on rehabilitation of brain injured adults, which was completed in 1997, at a total cost of approximately &#163;1.2 million.
<P>

<a name="20417w26.html_para1">In addition to specific projects, the Department also provides support for research commissioned by charities and the MRC that takes place in the NHS. Management of much of the research supported in this way is devolved, and expenditure at project level is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="20417w26.html_para2">Details of ongoing and recently completed research projects taking place in, funded by, or of interest to, the national health service are available on the National Research Register (NRR) at www.doh.gov.uk/research/ nrr.htm. The NRR shows that there are considerable number of research related to brain and head injury.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w26.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the timetable is for the publication of NICE guidelines on the handling of brain-injured patients; whether the guidelines will include long-term rehabilitation issues; and if he will make a statement.  [48824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w26.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence provisional publication date for their Head Injury Guideline is February 2003. I understand that the guideline will not address the rehabilitation or long term care of patients with a head injury, but the guideline will provide criteria for the early identification of patients who will benefit from rehabilitation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w26.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the proposed National Service Framework for long-term conditions will include those arising from head injury; and what interim action will be taken to improve rehabilitation services before publication of that framework.  [48814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w26.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Ministers will decide the scope of the National Service Framework (NSF) for long-term conditions shortly. The Government's response to the Health Select Committee third report, "Head Injury: Rehabilitation", states that the NSF is expected to set standards for the care and treatment of people with long-term conditions, including head injury. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is producing a clinical guideline for the initial assessment, management and first referral of patients with head injury, which is likely to inform the development of standards for the NSF.
<P>

<a name="20417w26.html_para3">In the meanwhile we will continue to work with the voluntary and professional organisations to identify and consider how to address shortfalls in rehabilitation services for people with head injury.

<P>

<a name="20417w26.html_para6">The cost required to eliminate this backlog depends on a number of factors, including the extent to which major capital investment and disposals of property impact upon the amount of additional capital required.

 <i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]:</i> In 1999, we set targets for the reduction in health and safety backlog within national health service trusts in England one of which required health and safety backlog costs to be reduced by 90 per cent. by 31 March 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]:</i> The borough of Barnet is principally served by three London Ambulance Service (LAS) stations&#151;Friern Barnet, Barnet and Mill Hill. The LAS will always send the nearest available ambulance to every call, so resources based at these stations will sometimes also be supported by vehicles from other areas.
<P>

<a name="20417w27.html_para0">Between the hours of 11 pm and 7 am the LAS always plans to have at least four ambulances covering the area&#151;one each running out of Barnet and Friern Barnet and two from Mill Hill. Three other ambulances are also operated until the early hours, finishing between midnight and 2 am. As well as these and ambulances based in other local boroughs, the service also runs an extra ambulance, deployed by Central Ambulance Control, to provide additional operational cover where it is most needed in any area of the LAS north-west sector.

<a name="20417w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]:</i> The annual planning cycle provides opportunity for dialogue between the national health service and the Department in relation to delivery of priorities, financial pressures and the management of risk. The process of agreeing service and financial frameworks involves a round of negotiations through which we aim to agree, in aggregate terms, a plan for the NHS to maximise performance while identifying the contribution of individual health systems.
<P>

<a name="20417w27.html_para3">From April 2002 onwards the responsibility for performance management of the NHS is being devolved to 28 new strategic health authorities (StHAs). Chief executives of the new StHAs will be accountable for delivery of national priorities as part of 3-year franchise agreements. StHAs will hold the ring for NHS organisations in their respective patches and need to ensure that the commitments to which they will be held to account for delivering are achievable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20417w27.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> In the Financial Year 2000&#150;01, 148 written complaints were received about NHS Direct in England. This equates to one complaint in over 20,000 calls made to NHS Direct. Details of all written complaints can be found on the Department website: www.doh.gov.uk/nhscomplaints.
<P>

<a name="20417w27.html_para5">National surveys conducted between December 1998 and January 2001 have consistently shown caller satisfaction levels between 90 and 97 per cent.

<a name="20417w28.html_para4">Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust validates both its active and suspended list on a regular basis and is confident that their waiting lists are robust and accurate.

The regional office does not consider that there is any reason to review waiting list information at Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust.
