<a name="11114w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Catering Committee how many barrels of Carlsberg Lager and Carlsberg Export Lager were sold by the House of Commons Refreshment Department in 2000.  [14139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dennis Turner: </B> 
 It is difficult to give a precise answer to my hon. Friend's question, as figures are not kept in the form requested. However, I am able to inform him that in the 12-month period from April 2000 until March 2001, the House of Commons Refreshment Department purchased 210 11-gallon barrels of Carlsberg Lager. Barrels are purchased in response to demand, and it is reasonable to assume that the number of barrels sold is similar to the number purchased.
<P>

<a name="11114w01.html_para0">The Commons Refreshment Department does not sell draught Carlsberg Export Lager.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how much money is owed to his Department by Walton Group Plc in respect of Exchange Flags Liverpool; and if he will make a statement.  [12620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Department is pursuing a civil claim against the Walton Group plc and Todd and Benn (Contractors) Ltd. to recover the full city grant value of &#163;4,444,782. In addition, it is seeking interest totalling &#163;2,603,062 as of 9 November 2001, and a claim for legal fees, costs and expert fees that are estimated at 8 November 2001 to be &#163;280,000 (inclusive of VAT).

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what plans he has to extend the yellow school bus pilot; and if he will make a statement;  [12305]
<P>
<UL>(2) what research has been conducted <i>(a)</i> by and <i>(b)</i> on behalf of his Department on the yellow school bus pilot scheme; and when the results are to be published;  [12303]

<a name="11114w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement about the pilot project for the introduction of yellow buses for home-to-school transport.  [12317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department has facilitated the introduction of American-style yellow school buses by agreeing to grant exemption from some of the provisions of the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations to enable pilot schemes to operate. The first such scheme is expected to start in Calderdale in the new year. My Department will collect base line data near the start of pilot schemes, and will evaluate them, probably after about a year's operation. The results of the evaluations will be published. The Department has incurred no costs so far other than staff time in considering the case for exemptions from regulations. Future costs will be staff time plus consultancy fees for data collection and evaluation. The level of these costs will depend on the number of pilot schemes, which will be a matter for agreement between local authorities and operators.

Grants for these vehicles are now available and the website provides full information on how they can be claimed. Information is also available on the Trust's telephone hotline on 0845 602 1425.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has for a further round of New Deal for Communities funding to assist the regeneration of post-industrial areas of intense social deprivation.  [13673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There are no plans for a third round of New Deal for Communities (NDC) funding. The Government are fully committed to the NDC programme and to tackling multiple deprivation in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country, including many in post-industrial areas, to bridge the gap between these neighbourhoods and the rest of the country.
<P>

<a name="11114w01.html_para1">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit is in the process of rolling out a range of programmes that will build on the lessons learned through NDC and strengthen and improve core public services in deprived areas.

<a name="11114w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what recent meetings he has had with representatives of coach operators to discuss proposals for a half-fare concessionary scheme for pensioners on long distance coach journeys; and if he will make a statement.  [13684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 We announced on 5 November our approval in principle of a proposal from the Commission for Integrated Transport under which coach operators would offer half-price fares to older and disabled passengers on long distance scheduled coach services in England. In return operators would&#151;for the first time&#151;receive Fuel Duty Rebate.
<P>

<a name="11114w01.html_para2">My Department has already had initial discussions with the Confederation of Passenger Transport about this proposal and we look forward to further discussions with them shortly on the details of its implementation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_wqn7"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 24 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 228W, on best value, how many building direct labour organisations transferred to the private sector have been given admitted-body status to the local government pension scheme; and what pension provision will be made for those which will not remain in the LGPS.  [13811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Information about the transfer of building direct labour organisations (DLOs) to the private sector is not held centrally. When a local authority function is outsourced and the new contractor chooses not to seek admitted-body status within the local government pension scheme, transferred employees should be offered broadly comparable pension arrangements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to reform local government final salary pension schemes.  [14696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 There are no plans to change the current benefit package provided by the local government pension scheme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what was the total cost of local government final salary pensions in the last financial year.  [14697]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 In 2000&#150;01, pensions paid to members of the local government pension scheme totalled &#163;3.5 billion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the projects which have been considered as potential public-private partnerships since 1997 which have not been undertaken because the public sector comparator had a lower net present value than the public private partnership proposed; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="11114w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 13 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 607W. There are no cases of potential PPP projects within my department, or the former DETR, not being undertaken because the public sector comparator had a lower net present value.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the scale of English Partnerships land holdings is; and which proportion is earmarked for new housing in <i>(a)</i> Telford and <i>(b)</i> England.  [13462]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 In September 2001, English Partnerships owned a total of 5,700 hectares of land in England, 820 hectares (14 per cent.) of which was in Telford.
<P>

<a name="11114w01.html_para3">Of the overall total, 970 hectares (17 per cent.) is designated for housing in planning terms (ie it either has specific planning consent or is designated as such in the local plan). In Telford, 216 hectares (3.8 per cent.) were designated for housing.

 The changes to the planning procedures and guidance for telecommunications mast development which we introduced on 22 August this year greatly strengthen public consultation requirements on mast proposals of 15 metres and below (subject to a process of prior approval by Local Planning Authorities) so that they are the same as for planning applications. This gives local people a much better opportunity to have a say on mast proposals. Local Planning Authorities already have the ability to turn down mast applications where the do not consider amenity aspects have been adequately addressed. Our guidance also advises telecommunications operators to consult local people and Local Planning Authorities before submitting applications for masts of any size.

 There are a number of opportunities for registered keepers of vehicles and other road users and interested parties to take part in consultations on motorway building, improvement and widening. Public consultation takes place during studies such as the multi-modal and road-based studies, and prior to a preferred route announcement, and on the publication of draft orders. We do not propose to consult on a national scale with registered keepers of vehicles as this would not be cost effective.

<a name="11114w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A number of Multi-Modal Studies and Roads-Based Studies are currently being carried out which include sections of the M1 motorway within their remit.

<a name="11114w03.html_para1">Final figures for the costs of consultation will not be available until the studies are completed. However, the average total cost of a study, including the cost of consultation, is approximately &#163;1.5 million.

In the period between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2001, a total of 354 offences were recorded on the railway routes between Preston and Blackpool and at least 19 of these were alcohol related.

 We recognise the effect that anti-social behaviour, including drunkenness, can have on both train staff and other passengers' perceptions of their personal security. We are working with transport operators, local authorities, the police and others to improve personal security on transport, through such means as publishing good practice guidance and improving the ability of the British Transport Police (BTP) and train operators to deal with crime and anti-social behaviour. The BTP work closely with the train operators to identify hot spots of disorder. If necessary measures such as increased patrolling and special operations will be undertaken to control the problem.

However, the maintenance by the Environment Agency of an objection on a flood-risk ground to significant development proposals in flood plains would clearly influence the decision whether or not to call in an application. Call-in would be more likely if there was any evidence that the Agency's objection was likely to be over-ruled by the local planning authority without sufficient counter-balancing reasons having been taken into account.

<P>
<a name="11114w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="11114w06.html_para0">The Government had an opportunity to comment on the draft of the annual report on the implementation of the EU joint action, of 17 December 1998, on the European Union's contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons (1999/34/CFSP) and the EU programme on illicit trafficking in conventional arms of June 1997, as did all other EU member states. The report is entirely consistent with the Government's policy on Small Arms and Light Weapons. It provides a detailed account of action taken by EU member states at the national level and in international forums to combat the dangerous proliferation of small arms. The report also sets out priorities for a more systematic approach to EU assistance in this crucial area of work. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office submitted the report for parliamentary scrutiny on 14 June.
<P>

<a name="11114w06.html_para1">The Government are committed to tackling the scourge of small arms proliferation. The need to eradicate the illicit trade in small arms has a particular urgency in the context of the war against terrorism. The annual report predates the first ever UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in New York in July 2001. The Conference adopted a Programme of Action which commits States politically to put in place export control mechanisms, measures to ensure small arms traceability and to control brokers, and to destroy surplus weapons. There will be a Review Conference in 2006. It is vital that countries sustain the political momentum built up at the Conference to

 These are among a number of new ideas intended to complement the implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). We have been discussing these and other options with other States Parties since the end of the negotiations on a BWC Protocol in August. All are at an early stage of development. We expect them to be further discussed at the 5th Review Conference of the BWC in Geneva (19 November to 7 December). We welcome proposals that have been made for practical and effective measures to meet the biological weapons threat. We hope that these can be agreed at the Conference.

 Recent changes to airline operations and consequent reductions in air traffic has led to temporary deferral of work to create the new air traffic control centre at Prestwick. Air traffic control services for Scottish and North Atlantic airspace will continue to be provided by NATS staff from the existing centre at Prestwick. The main effect on the local economy of deferring work on the new centre will be to delay creation of short-term employment opportunities on the construction and commissioning of the new centre. The Government remain closely in touch with the industry with a view to securing the shortest possible delay.

 Adult (aged 16+) rates of sports participation are measured through the General Household Survey (GHS), a continuous survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics across Great Britain. Questions relating to sport are included on the survey once every three years, the last being 1996 and the next being due 2002 (in 1999, the GHS was not carried out).

This survey also enables analysis by age. Sport England has also undertaken a large scale survey of young people with disabilities using the same sports participation questions as in the wider 1999 survey (carried out in 2000).

 The Government fully recognise the important role that sport can play in the regeneration of both urban and rural areas and in addressing a whole range of social issues such as better health, reduced crime and social inclusion. Both the report of Policy Action Team 10 and the Government's Plan for Sport highlight how sport can be used to tackle neighbourhood renewal, social exclusion and community development. Among the initiatives included in the plan are the creation of the Community Sport Alliance which brings together key stakeholders of all levels to identify the key challenges facing sport in the community; the promotion of sport in regional policy making through contributions to the work of regional agencies such as the Regional Cultural Consortiums; and ensuring that equity principles are at the heart of all the Government's and Sport England's policies for the promotion and development of sport. In particular the Policy Directions issued to Sport England in respect of the distribution of the Lottery Sports Fund require it, in deciding applications for funding, to have regard to the scope for reducing economic and social deprivation, the need to promote access to sport for people from all sections of society and the need to further the objectives of sustainable development taking into account social and community progress and employment opportunities created by sports projects. Sport England has also introduced a number of other specific initiatives aimed at the regeneration of deprived areas including Sport Action Zones, one of which is Cornwall, its Priority Areas Initiative and the establishment of a Regeneration Policy Advisory Group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to the Minister for Sport's answer to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath on 5 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 4, what was the basis of the analysis her Department used for the calculation of numbers of playing fields disposed of during the period 1992 to 1997.  [14844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Public concern about the loss of school playing fields led directly to the introduction in October 1998 of section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Before section 77 was introduced, only grant-maintained schools were required to seek consent from the Secretary of State before selling land, including areas of their playing fields. Local authorities and other schools that owned their own playing fields were free to sell without restriction. The then Department for Education and Employment estimated that an average of 40 playing fields a month were sold in this way before October 1998. Their estimate is based on the number of playing field disposals at grant-maintained schools between April 1996, when the previous Government further encouraged the disposal of playing fields by relaxing the Local Authority Capital Finance Regulations which governed the use of sale proceeds, and 1 October 1998, when section 77 took effect. During this 30-month period, some 64 grant-maintained schools were given approval to dispose of areas of playing field, which is an average of over two a month. Using the proportion of grant-maintained schools at that time compared with the number of other schools, the Department for Education and Skills estimate the total number of playing field disposals each month to have been around 40.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2001]:</i> The Department has recently launched this year's fireworks safety campaign informing the public of the dangers posed by fireworks. The theme of this year's campaign, is to urge children and young people to take care when using or being near fireworks. As part of the campaign, around 2,000 information packs to help mount local safety campaigns have been distributed to trading standards, fire brigades, health promotion units, environmental health officers and police forces. In addition over 25,000 special information packs have been distributed for use in schools.
<P>

<a name="11114w09.html_para0">The public is warned of the effects of fireworks on animals through the fireworks code, which advises pet owners to keep pets indoors. Each pack of fireworks on sale contains a copy of the code.

<a name="11114w09.html_para1">Fireworks on sale in the United Kingdom are required under the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997 to adhere to British Standards BS 7114 which restrict the size and weight of fireworks. I have no plans to change this at present, although we are involved in the proposed European Standard which is likely to specify sound levels for certain fireworks.

 The DTI's energy projections published in November 2000 included projections of CHP capacity based on assumptions about future oil and gas prices. Those assumptions are still reasonable in the longer term but the Government recognise that high gas prices this year have reduced substantially the attractiveness of investment in new CHP plant in the short term. The Government remain committed to their CHP target of at least 10,000 MWe capacity by 2010, as well as their emission targets. My right hon.

Because of the wide-ranging nature of DTI support quantifying the exact proportion of public money given to support particular industries (e.g. manufacturing or farming) in each of the last 10 years would raise problems of definition and would also incur disproportionate cost.

<a name="11114w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In our liberalised energy market, the price paid to generators for electricity, including electricity from photovoltaics (PV), is a matter for negotiation between the generator and the supplier, and is subject to market fluctuation. We therefore have only limited and anecdotal information about prices paid to generators for PV energy. The best price recently mentioned to the Department has been 6.5p per kilowatt hour paid by a company offering a "net metering" deal, that is a deal in which the supplier buys PV energy from generators at the same price that they would charge them for electricity purchases. The best price obtainable at any time will vary with the market.
<P>

<a name="11114w11.html_para2">Some European countries have taken steps to encourage net metering, and some, notably Germany and Spain, have gone further by legislating for the utilities to pay renewable generators a premium price for all the electricity they wish to export to the network. In the case of PV, this is about 33p per kilowatt hour in Germany and 25p per kilowatt hour in Spain.
<P>

<a name="11114w11.html_para3">The Government are encouraging the uptake of PV in the UK through both domestic and large-scale field trials, soon to be followed by a major PV demonstration programme to rival the German and Japanese PV roofs programme. It is also working to overcome infrastructural barriers through simplified grid-connection, fairer tariffs and more positive planning guidance.

 It is too early to say. The 10p rate was introduced from the 2000&#150;01 tax year, and small companies do not have to pay their corporation tax until nine months after the end of their accounting periods.

 The share incentive plan was introduced to encourage greater share ownership among employees.

We have received one representation to reduce this period from five to three years. This would work against the aim of encouraging employees to retain shares in the company they work for over the long term, and it would be costly in terms of tax forgone.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w15.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Reducing national insurance contributions for those on low incomes forms part of the Government's strategy to make work pay. As a result of reforms since 1997, around 1 million lower paid employees have been taken out of having to pay NICs altogether. Cautious estimates show that labour supply has increased by around 160,000 people as a result of the entire package of measures to make work pay since 1997, including the reductions in income tax and national insurance contributions as well as working families tax credit and disabled persons tax credit.

The withdrawal of individual learning accounts has had the same effect on all individuals previously eligible for them, and service company workers are not affected any differently from anybody else.

 All prisons have a varying degree of Information Technology (IT) provision. The existing provision has been driven by local policy and local, internal networking is quite common. Currently, across the Prison Service as a whole, there is basic e-mail provision. It has been recognised that the Prison Service needs a modern infrastructure with interlinkings. To this end, Her Majesty's Prison Service has entered into a contract, part of which has the requirement to provide the Service with a new infrastructure that will provide common services on a Service-wide network and enable Her Majesty's Prison Service to build an electronic interface with the wider Criminal Justice System. We are on the verge of beginning the implementation of this new infrastructure.

 We are sympathetic to the needs of the recently bereaved and understand that making a claim for bereavement benefits will not be the first priority for people in these circumstances. We believe the three month time limit for claiming bereavement benefits strikes the right balance between allowing people time to grieve and setting a reasonable and appropriate limit on the length of time within which a claim to benefit should be made. The three month time limit for making a claim was introduced in 1997 for the majority of Social Security benefits and we have no plans to change it.
<P>

<a name="11114w17.html_para5">Since March 2000 the Department has issued leaflets on the new bereavement benefits to doctors' surgeries, Post Offices and benefit advisers. Articles explaining the new benefits were placed in a variety of magazines prior to their introduction in April 2001. Claim forms for bereavement benefits also include a clear explanation that claims must be made within three months. In addition, the Registrar of Deaths automatically issues a form to the person registering the death which gives them the opportunity to make a claim for bereavement benefits.

 The National Employment Panel is an employer-led body which provides independent advice to Ministers on the design, delivery and performance of the UK Government's labour market policies and programmes. Its remit encompasses all the new deals and other welfare-to-work activities delivered by the Department for Work and Pensions, Jobcentre Plus and partner organisations at the national and local levels.
<P>

<a name="11114w18.html_para0">Projects will include a review to examine how effectively welfare-to-work programmes are addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged across the new deal programmes; a new skills sub-group to advise on links between welfare-to-work initiatives and work force development; and work to promote equal access to employment for ethnic minorities through a standing Minority Ethnic Advisory Group.
<P>

<a name="11114w18.html_para1">The National Employment Panel is funded by the Department for Work and Pensions. It has a budget of &#163;603,000 per annum. It is supported by 15 staff of whom two are funded by private employers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the principles which underlie the Performance Framework; in what ways it differs from the system of Best Value; and whether it will be piloted in local authority areas.  [12939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w18.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We are committed to a performance framework for the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (HB/CTB), aimed at driving up standards of administration and counter-fraud activity in all types of local authority. The proposed performance framework will include: national standards which make clear what local authorities are expected to deliver; measurement and inspection, so we know whether local authorities are delivering; and consideration of subsidy incentives that reward improved performance.
<P>

<a name="11114w18.html_para3">As a first step, we are defining national performance standards which build on and go beyond the measures established by Best Value but do not replace them. The standards are based on Benefit Fraud Inspectorate findings, Audit Commission observations and reports, National Audit Office reports and academic research. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Nov 2001 : Column: 786W</I><P>
They define an effective and secure HB/CTB service&#151;addressing strategic management; customer service; speed, accuracy and security in the processing of claims; work with landlords; internal security; counter fraud; and overpayments.
<P>

<a name="11114w18.html_para4">The standards have already been tested in a pilot exercise over the summer in 14 local authorities. We are formally consulting the local authority associations on performance standards as part of the performance framework, and a copy of the consultation paper has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11114w18.html_para5">We recognise that working to meet these standards will be a gradual process and that effective implementation of the performance framework means phased implementation.

 The ONE evaluation did not focus on the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. This would have been impractical as there are wide variations in practices among local authorities in ONE pilot and control areas. However, research from the ONE pilots did show improvements to customer service arising from working in close partnership with local authorities. These partnerships will be a key requirement of Jobcentre Plus, and we will be discussing with local authorities how we can jointly guide and support our staff to deliver a cohesive, responsive service to our customers.

<P>
<a name="11114w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS plan states there will be 7,500 more consultants in post in 2004 than in 1999. By September 2000 the number of consultants in post had already increased by 1,100 to around 24,300. The national health service is currently drawing up plans by specialty to deliver the rest of the increase, a further 6,400 posts by 2004. We will ensure that these plans target areas of the country which are under-doctored relative to their weighted population.
<P>

<a name="11114w20.html_para3">In 2000 the number of consultant neurologists was 688, an increase of 31 (4.7 per cent.) over 1999. As well as the NHS plan consultant increases we aim to achieve a 54 per cent. expansion in training neurology specialists by 2010.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of how many <i>(a)</i> refugees and <i>(b)</i> those with special immigration status with medical qualifications have been prevented from working in the national health service by their inability to speak English to an adequate level in the last five years.  [14315]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 All doctors from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) need to pass the International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) test before they can be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). The majority of doctors who took their primary medical qualification outside the EEA also need to pass the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) test of medical and linguistic competence before registration is granted.
<P>

<a name="11114w21.html_para0">Passing the PLAB test is a pre-condition of registration for those doctors required to take it. Doctors are entitled to five attempts at the test. Those who fail it five times are prevented from registering with the GMC, and thus prevented from practising medicine in the national health service.
<P>

<a name="11114w21.html_para1">The GMC's records do not show how many of the doctors who fail the PLAB test five times are, in fact, from the refugee community. There is therefore no way of telling whether any refugee doctor has been prevented from getting work in the NHS by his or her ability to speak English.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS plan holds a commitment to provide extra doctors to the national health service, and we believe it makes moral and economic sense to use the skills of doctors in the refugee community to the best advantage of the NHS.
<P>

<a name="11114w21.html_para2">A Government funded database, developed and run by the Refugee Council and the British Medical Association, shows that there are nearly 400 refugee doctors who want information about retraining to work in the United Kingdom.

 <i>[holding answer 16 October 2001]:</i> Any child of compulsory school age living in England is entitled to free education. All four-year-olds are entitled to three terms of free, good quality, part-time nursery education before they reach compulsory school age regardless of duration of residence in the UK, immigration status, nationality or any other characteristics.
<P>

<a name="11114w21.html_para3">Three-year-olds are entitled to a free, good quality, part-time nursery education place depending on their age and their local early years development and childcare partnership's allocation criteria. Early years development and childcare partnerships must allocate places based on social need.
<P>

<a name="11114w21.html_para4">The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for determining when tuition fees are to be charged for further education courses. Advice to institutions for the current academic year is that, subject to residency requirements, tuition fees should not be charged to any learner aged 16 to 18 on either a full-time or part-time course. Other groups not charged tuition fees include: those receiving jobseekers' allowance (JSA); those receiving a means- tested state benefit; unwaged dependants (as defined by the Benefits Agency) of those listed above; people on adult basic education or English for speakers of other languages programmes; asylum seekers in receipt of the equivalent of a means-tested benefit (assistance under the terms of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act), and their dependants; and, certain learners participating in Council funded projects (only where identified in the project specification).
<P>

<a name="11114w21.html_para5">Higher education institutions, as independent, self- governing bodies, decide whether to charge students tuition fees at the 'home' rate or the higher 'overseas' rate using the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997, (as amended). To be eligible for home fee status, students usually need to have 'settled status' in the UK and have been ordinarily resident here for three years before their course starts, except where this was solely or mainly to receive full-time education. Students meeting these requirements will be classed as "home" students for tuition fee purposes. Broadly speaking, these will include, in most cases, UK and other European Union students, students with recognised refugee status, other students granted the right to enter or remain and who meet the UK residence requirement, and migrant workers from the European Economic Area. Students not meeting these requirements may be charged fees at the 'overseas' rate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidance she has issued to schools regarding assessment of teachers for the upper spine of performance-related pay.  [14565]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2001]:</i> The Department's guidance on School Teachers' Pay and Conditions of Employment 2001 includes a section entitled "Threshold and Upper Pay Scale" and Annexe A includes a section entitled "Handling Performance Pay". The Secretary of State will soon launch a consultation on the mechanism for specific funding to contribute towards the cost to schools of awarding performance pay points to teachers.

<a name="11114w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate she has made of the number of permanent teaching posts in maintained schools which were not filled on the first day of the current term; and what percentage this is of the total number of permanent teaching posts.  [7490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> It is estimated, based on a telephone survey conducted on 6&#150;7 September 2001, that there were about 2,000 full-time vacancies (0.6 per cent. of posts) in nursery, primary and secondary schools.
<P>

<a name="11114w22.html_para0">These figures were obtained from a telephone survey of nearly 1,500 schools conducted by DfES. Teacher vacancies are measured using the standard DfES definition, which excludes posts filled by a full-time teacher on a contract of one term or more.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The OECD asks for statutory salary scale points but, where these are not available, countries can use survey data on actual salary and use approximations to identify equivalents to bottom and top of the scale.<P>

2. Some countries pay different salaries to teachers in primary and secondary schools although there is no such distinction in England. 'Lower secondary' is, broadly the 11&#150;15 age range and upper secondary is 16&#150;19.<P>

3. These salary comparisons can be only broadly indicative. Thus, they exclude extra allowances and yet, in England, many teachers at the top of the scale would also get management allowances. The figures pre-date the introduction of performance related pay but the OECD definition would exclude that too. There are other differences, for example in the treatment of employer social security payments.<P>

4. The time taken to get to the top of the scale varies markedly between countries and so, for example, a country with a high top scale point might require many years service to reach this and so the top point is not representative of the pay of most teachers.<P>

5. 'Purchasing power parties' are different from currency exchange rates and aim to reflect differences in price levels between countries and are more appropriate for those comparisons. Teacher salaries will also reflect the overall levels of national incomes and wages in national economies which is one reason why the range of salaries is so wide. There will be other such factors such as the average age of entry to teaching of new qualifiers. Salary will also reflect non-pay elements of remuneration and features of the teaching job such as hours, workload, job security, status all of which might vary between countries.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what proportion of early years settings employ a qualified teacher; and what the cost would be of placing a qualified teacher in every early years setting.  [14579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11114w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2001]:</i> Approximately 35,000 early years settings are registered to deliver Government funded nursery education. Of these, around 50 per cent. are local education authority maintained primary schools and nursery schools, all of which directly employ qualified teachers.
<P>

<a name="11114w24.html_para0">We have asked local early years development and child care partnerships (EYDCPs), in association with their local education authorities, to ensure that a ratio of one teacher with qualified teacher status to every 10 early education settings in the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sector is achieved by 2004.
<P>

<a name="11114w24.html_para1">The approximate cost of placing a qualified teacher in every PVI sector setting would be &#163;435 million per annum. We have no present plans to do this.

We have no plans to claim any agrimonetary compensation from the EU. Any future payments of agrimonetary compensation, to which the Exchequer would have to contribute at least 71p in every pound, must be balanced against the needs of other sectors and taxpayers.

<P>
<a name="11114w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no requirement to inform the Department of the movement of mink. Under the Mink (Keeping) Regulations 1975 (as amended), such movements must be carried out in closed cages or other containers which prevent mink from escaping. The movement of farmed mink in Wales is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales. However, I understand that there have been no licensed mink farms in Wales for some years.

 Approximately 150 written responses were received in response to the Government's consultation on the proposed EU directive on the energy performance of buildings.

 The Department does not have statistics which could accurately reflect any job losses in the agricultural sector resulting from foot and mouth disease.

 Cleansing and disinfection and restocking are key stages in the FMD eradication process.




<P>
<P><I>14 Nov 2001 : Column: 816W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11114w25.html_para1">Our policy is to ensure that cleansing and disinfection is carried out thoroughly and efficiently while at the same time ensuring the best use of public funds. Preliminary cleansing and disinfection (C and D) is carried out during the slaughter and disposal stage on all premises known, or believed to be contaminated with foot and mouth disease in order to minimise the risk of the virus spreading to neighbouring farms. Twenty-four hours after this stage has been completed, secondary C and D can commence, the purpose of which is to reduce the risk of recrudescence and allow for restocking. Restocking can commence once the farmer has a certificate stating the C and D has been satisfactorily completed.
<P>

<a name="11114w25.html_para2">The Department will normally pay the costs of secondary C and D providing farms are (a) in a reasonable state of cleanliness and repair, (b) there are no health and safety implications for those involved in the cleansing operation and (c) that the costs incurred are proportionate to the individual farm situation. Since 5 August, contractual arrangements have been tightened and farmers encouraged to undertake secondary C and D themselves, wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="11114w25.html_para3">Restocking must be accomplished in such a way as to balance the needs of the livestock industry and the veterinary and scientific advice as to the disease control risks involved in this process. The key elements of our restocking policy are as follows:
<P>

<a name="11114w25.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Secondary C and D must take place and a period of 21 days allowed to elapse prior to restocking.
<P>
<BR>
If secondary C and D does not take place, a period of 12 months must elapse prior to restocking.
<P>
<BR>
Movements of stock on to the farm must be licensed by DEFRA.
<P>
<BR>
The numbers of livestock permitted for initial restocking must be set out in the premises restocking plan, which must be approved by the divisional veterinary manager.
<P>
<BR>
Depending on the origin of sheep, testing of the flock of origin and all the sheep to be moved may be required. This will give valuable surveillance data on the prevalence of disease in the national flock.
<P>
<BR>
Animals are to be inspected regularly for four weeks. Sheep and goats will be blood tested after 28 days. If all clear, restrictions can be lifted.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The crops grown in the programme of farmscale evaluations (FSEs) are at two different stages in the authorisation process. The powers to intervene in the licensing of the FSEs depend on the authorisation status of the GM crop concerned.
<P>

<a name="11114w27.html_para1">The oil seed rape and beet are authorised by my Department for growing in the evaluations under UK legislation implementing Part B of European directive 90/220 on deliberate release of GMOs. The consent is underpinned by a risk assessment and permits the GM crops to be grown in the evaluations on any arable land where rape or beet would normally be grown. The consent holder has to notify the Department of the locations of proposed sites prior to sowing together with a statement indicating whether the risk assessment remains valid for the new site and, if not, provide further evaluation. The consent holder may proceed to sow the crop unless he receives written indication from the Department that the new site does not comply on safety or other grounds with the conditions of the consent and the risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="11114w27.html_para2">The GM maize has Europe-wide approval for cultivation under Part C of Directive 90/220 granted in August 1998 by the French competent authority on behalf of the EC. However, this approval imposes no restrictions or conditions on the locations where the maize can be grown. For this crop, therefore, the Department has no statutory powers to intervene over the location of trial sites. However, before the GM maize could be grown commercially individual varieties will require listing on the National List of Seeds or the European Common Catalogue. In addition, under our voluntary agreement with the industry body SCIMAC, this GM crop will not be grown commercially in the UK until the completion of the evaluations and only then if it is assessed as causing no unacceptable effects on the environment.
<P>

<a name="11114w27.html_para3">The evaluations are being undertaken by an independent research consortium and overseen by the independent Scientific Steering Committee. SCIMAC provide the fields of crops for study. The steering committee has set overall criteria for the conduct of the evaluations and requires a representative distribution of sites. SCIMAC find farmers who may be willing to host an evaluation and draw up a list of potential farms from which the researchers select sites to meet the SSC criteria. Ministers are not involved in this process.
<P>

<a name="11114w27.html_para4">Given the public reaction to the proposal to locate an evaluation close to Ryton Organic Gardens last spring, the Government will use their influence to seek to ensure that no FSE site is chosen in future within cross-pollution distance of Ryton Organic Gardens.
