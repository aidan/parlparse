<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60209w01.html_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Criminal Procedure Rules Committee (CPRC) sets the rules which govern the practice and procedure of the criminal courts and give courts explicit powers actively to manage criminal cases and to avoid unnecessary delays and promote consistency between courts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The DPP is a member of the CPRC and both the CPS and my office play a leading role in contributing to the work of the CPRC and its sub-groups. The CPS was closely involved in the drafting of the overriding objective, the case management rules and forms. Significant contributions were made on the disclosure and terrorism protocols. The CPS regularly provides comment and suggestions on issues which the Committee are considering. In addition the criminal case management framework complements the rules in setting out the role and responsibilities of the CPS and others involved in managing criminal cases through the courts.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60209w01.html_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 Steps are being taken to improve service&#151;including the timely service of papers by the police. The electronic service of papers is increasingly being used by the CPS in the more complex criminal cases such as complex frauds and complex computer related crimes. The CPS in electronically serving evidence on the court has to ensure that the police have signed paper statements of all witnesses. The statements themselves can then be served electronically on the court and defence; this can be done by CD or e-mail. The signed paper bundle has to be retained by the police.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60209w01.html_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service maintains no central record of the time taken to reach pre-charge decisions, nor is the information recorded on individual case files. The time varies considerably, partly due to the need to gather evidence and talk to witnesses.

 Although the great majority of schools are orderly places we remain determined to reduce misbehaviour to an absolute minimum. So we are implementing a major national programme that makes behaviour management training available to all schools and provides extra resources for schools facing the greatest challenges. We are also legislating to give school staff an unequivocal power to discipline pupils and extend the use of court orders to reinforce parents&#039; responsibility for behaviour in school.

 Parklife centres offer a valuable link between the key business parks and business support services in Gloucestershire. The initiative has been jointly funded by the South West Regional Development Agency and Gloucestershire LSC from its discretionary budgets. As my hon. Friend is aware, the Learning and Skills Council is undertaking a major organisational restructuring. However, this should not impact on local arrangements to support the Parklife project.

 It is difficult to generalise about how long it takes people to find jobs after graduation and enter repayment as this is largely dependent on individual circumstances. The annual Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey (conducted by the Higher Education Statistics agency) illustrates this. For the 2003/04 cohort of graduates surveyed six months after graduation, 64 per cent. were in employment, 10 per cent. in employment combined with further study, 14 per cent. in further study, 6 per cent. unemployed, and 6 per cent. were not available for

 Pre-movement testing will be introduced in England on 20 February. It will apply to cattle over 15 months of age moving out of one-two year tested herds, unless the herd or the movement meets any of the exemptions set out in the TB (England) Order 2005 (as amended).

<a name="stpa_16">The impact of pre-movement testing on cattle prices and auction markets was considered by the Tuberculosis Pre-Movement Testing Stakeholder Group.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under what legislation the Department has the authority to block a second bovine tuberculosis test for a calf that tested positive to the initial tuberculin skin test when the owner is willing to pay for the test.  [48713]</p>




<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60209w04.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 February 2006]:</i> The current skin test for bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an effective test. It is the accepted standard laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of disease in a cattle herd.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w04.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_18">The Tuberculosis (England and Wales) Order 1984 requires cattle failing the tuberculin test, and those considered to have been direct contacts exposed to TB, to be compulsorily slaughtered. There is no provision for a second TB test nor is there a mechanism for appeals.

<p>
<a name="60209w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">In the case of statutory tuberculin testing of cattle, any request to release tuberculin for a further private test will always be declined by the Department. Approval for private tests is generally granted in the context of a test for purchaser assurance, or as a condition for cattle export in herds not subjected to tuberculosis restrictions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons Canada geese treated for fishing line injuries in sanctuaries are not allowed to be released back into the wild.  [48361]</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60209w04.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 February 2006]:</i> As with other non-native species of goose that have become naturalised, the Canada goose can have a localised impact on habitats, This can include the destruction of vegetation, as well as competing with native wildfowl for food and resources, such as nest sites. They can also pose a health risk to other animals and humans, for example through deposited faeces. This is why the Canada goose was added to Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It means that Canada geese are subject to the provisions of section 14 of the Act, and it is an offence to release them or allow them to escape into the wild.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2006 : Column 1349W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w04.html_para4">
We have recently publicly reviewed the provisions of Part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 including the possible adoption of a general licence to allow the release of certain non-native species that have been rehabilitated. I am currently working up more detailed proposals on these issues for inclusion in a consultation paper that we hope to issue later this year. The Canada goose is one of the possible species under consideration.

 There have been no ministerial discussions about extending the fund to Wales.

<a name="stpa_20">The Government&#039;s main tool for eradicating fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Warm Front Scheme, which offers a range of heating and insulation measures to householders in receipt of one of a range of qualifying benefits. The Scheme has assisted over one million households since its launch in June 2000. The new phase of the Scheme got under way in June last year, and is better equipped to target and assist those most in need in a sustainable way. The Scheme benefited from a boost in fuel poverty funding in England announced in the 2005 pre-Budget report of &#163;250 million. This is additional to the extra &#163;140 million announced in the last Spending Review and takes DEFRA&#039;s total fuel poverty funding over the 2005&#150;08 period to over &#163;800 million.

Well in advance of the launch of the new scheme it was made clear to farmers and land managers that registration of land on the RLR would be a pre-requisite for joining the scheme. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a voluntary environmental scheme and while we are aware that delays with land registration have caused difficulties for some farmers, we believe that reasonable steps have been taken to limit the impact of these delays as far as possible. All applicants who submit a valid application will secure a full five-year agreement, so although their entry to the scheme may have been delayed, they will not be disadvantaged.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice she received on the criteria for tuberculosis slaughter valuations for pedigree cattle <i>(a)</i> under six months and <i>(b)</i> over three years of age.  [49096]</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60209w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 New table valuation based compensation arrangements for bovine tuberculosis were introduced on 1 February 2006. Under the new system, compensation rates for pedigree cattle are calculated monthly using the average sales price obtained for animals within the same category over the previous six months. For pedigree cattle there are 18 table categories. These categories, which are based on the animal&#039;s age, sex and sector, were drawn up with the assistance of industry advisors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w06.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_35">There is no table value for pedigree cattle under 6 months. Animals that age would always be suckling, and it would be unusual to sell them without the dam.

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60209w06.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Under EC plant health legislation the import of certain genera of conifers from the Republic of Korea is normally prohibited. However, following interest from a number of traders and a request from the UK, a derogation allowing the import from the Republic of Korea of bonsai plants of the genera <i>Chamaecyparis</i>, <i>Juniperus</i> and <i>Pinus</i> was agreed by the European Commission in June 2002. A thorough assessment of the potential plant health risks associated with the import of such material was undertaken as part of the derogation process and stringent measures put in place, both pre-export in Korea and for handling the material on arrival in the EC, to mitigate any potential risk. The original derogation expired in 2005. Following a request from importers in the UK the derogation has been extended to 2007.

I recently consulted on options for local authority recycling/composting targets in 2007&#150;08.

<p>
<a name="60209w06.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_37">For the longer-term, as part of the review of waste strategy, Defra is looking at what levels and what forms of targets will be the most efficient at continuing the recent improvements we have seen in waste performance. The review will take into account existing policy levers designed to drive the management of waste up the hierarchy (such as the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme, the landfill tax escalator, and the obligations on producers in relation to packaging and waste electrical and electronic equipment). The Government intend to publish a consultation document on the waste strategy review in the next few weeks, followed by a revised waste strategy in the autumn.

 The Government aims to respond to reports of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) within one year of their publication.

 Currently around 400 tonnes of spent fuel is stored in Wales. Spent fuel from Welsh reactors is of the Magnox type and is not regarded as waste and is routinely reprocessed at Sellafield. Reprocessing spent fuel there does create high level waste but there is no high level waste in Wales. More detailed information on the location of spent fuel at specific locations at specific times is not normally made public for security reasons.

 The European Commission&#039;s proposal to tackle illegal logging, the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, was adopted by Council Conclusions in October 2003. This included proposals for bilateral agreements with timber producing countries and a commitment that the Commission would investigate &#039;additional options&#039; to tackle illegal logging.

This option was raised at a European stakeholder consultation meeting held by the European Commission and the UK&#039;s Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs) in Brussels on 31 January 2006. Some support for the proposal was voiced as well as concern that the effective enforcement of such a ban would demand additional evidence on all imports of timber to the EU. As such demands would be unlikely to be required of domestic producers, this could raise the likelihood of a challenge in the World Trade Organisation.

<i>[holding answer 6 February 2006]:</i> The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales. As part of the Agency&#039;s management role it has national and regional water resource strategies, published in 2001, which set out the pressures over the next 25 years.

<a name="60209w09.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_56">A good deal of water is already transferred within water companies&#039; areas of operation, and between companies, to give individual companies greater flexibility to meet local shortages. The Agency&#039;s national strategy notes though that water transfers can be a relatively expensive option. Pipelines for long distance transfers are large and their construction may be disruptive. Pumping can consume much energy and add to carbon emissions.

<p>
<a name="60209w09.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_59">Applications for consent for wind farms submitted to the DTI are accompanied by an environmental impact assessment that includes details of the likely impact of the project in question on the environment and wildlife, among other things. In considering an application, the Department will consult with a range of stakeholders, including the statutory advisers on nature conservation&#151;English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales, as appropriate&#151;as well as others with an interest in the project. This ensures that decisions on whether to grant consent for a wind farm are considered in the light of the best available information about its likely impacts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w09.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">The Department has established a Research Advisory Group to fund research into the impact of wind farms on the environment. This has included a joint study with wind farm developers and DEFRA to collect data on the distribution of sea birds in the three strategic offshore wind farm areas, the results of which will inform decisions on the grant of consent for wind farm projects in those areas. However, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) make clear that the available evidence suggests that appropriately positioned wind farms do not pose a significant hazard for birds. The RSPB&#039;s conclusion is supported by a report last year for the Swedish State Energy Authority, which found that only 14 of the total 1.5 million migrating seabirds that each year passes two wind farms at Kalmarsund in south east Sweden are at risk of being killed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w09.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_61">In any case, the likely impact on wildlife must be kept in context. A paper in Nature, by a large group of scientists including one from the RSPB, indicated that in sample regions covering about 20 per cent. of the Earth&#039;s land surface&#151;15 per cent. to 37 per cent. of species (not just birds) will be committed to extinction as a result of mid-range climate warming scenarios by 2050.

This performance-based system of grant-making is key to the glob fund&#039;s commitment to results.

 DFID has a range of initiatives to enhance the development impact of remittances for developing countries, and this includes an analysis of the effects of migrant remittances in reducing poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_115">In general, evidence shows remittances reduce poverty in developing countries. For example:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_216">New findings from Guatemala show that remittances reduce the level, depth and severity of poverty. Households receiving internal and international remittances spend around 50 per cent. more, respectively, than households with no remittances.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_217">Recent World Bank research from the Philippines confirms that remittances reduce poverty for those that receive them;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_218">In Bangladesh, remittances from internal migration can represent the majority of household income. Households receiving remittances have higher nutritional and health status, 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>9 Feb 2006 : Column 1391W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>higher levels of educational investment, and pools of money available for emergencies. There is clear evidence that without access to remittances, children&#039;s access to education would be severely limited. Remittance transfers can make up as much as 40 per cent. of the household budget for receiving poor families.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_116">At the level of the economy, research suggests that remittances provide valuable foreign exchange for developing countries, and strengthen the balance of payments. Unlike other financial flows, remittances are counter cyclical, thus alleviating macroeconomic shocks. Remittances can also provide investment capital for economic activity, contributing to economic growth. Where remittance flows are saved rather than spent, they help improve the savings ratios and provide a higher deposit base for the banking system, which is necessary for economic growth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w16.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_117">DFID has a number of initiatives underway to reduce barriers to remittance flows and improve their developmental impact. In particular, DFID has initiated remittance country partnerships with Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. These partnerships include work to extend access to remittances to poorer and more rural people, encourage greater competition and lower remittance prices, and improve data. DFID also works closely with economists in the World Bank that are researching in depth the impact of remittances on poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_118">In terms of work in the UK, DFID has recently set up a task force comprising of banks and money transfer companies, in order to lower remittance prices and improve the services they provide to low income migrants. The task force will implement recommendations from a public/private sector working group report that DFID launched late last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w16.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_119">DFID initiated a website (www.sendmoneyhome.org) for those wishing to send remittances to developing countries from the UK, which provides easily available comparative information on remittance prices and providers. The aim is to improve choice and stimulate competition, leading to lower prices and a better service for low income migrants. DFID funded a household survey in the UK among the Bangladeshi community which explores the impact on recipients of remittances to Bangladesh, and has recently commissioned a wider household survey to better quantify remittance flows from key ethnic minority communities within the UK.

 It has been a key principle of this Government&#039;s approach to the health concerns of veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict that there should be appropriate research into veterans&#039; illnesses and into the factors that may have a bearing on them. Research already sponsored by the Ministry of Defence includes: epidemiological studies; clinical and laboratory tests; a programme of investigation into the possible adverse health effects of the medical countermeasures offered to troops; a systematic review of research literature; and a study of the social aspects of the issue. Most of this work has been completed and published. We have also maintained close contact with the US authorities to ensure visibility and understanding of the extensive programme of research that they have commissioned. The research has shown no evidence of a unique illness associated with service in the Gulf, nor has it identified a specific cause of the illnesses in question.

Notes:<br>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and percentages to the nearest whole number, therefore individual numbers by parliamentary constituencies may not sum to Northern Ireland total.<br>

2. As with any sample survey the numbers and percentages quoted in the table above are subject to a degree of sampling error.<br>

3. A single year&#039;s data do not provide robust results at the level of parliamentary constituency. It was therefore necessary to combine two years data to allow robust analysis this level.<br>





4. The data were sourced from Households Below Average Income Northern Ireland (HBAI NI). The HBAI NI is based on information collected from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS was first run in NI in 2002&#150;03. Therefore data is not available prior to 2002&#150;03. The NBAI was first introduced in Great Britain in 1994&#150;95.<br>

5. The HBAI is the main source of income poverty measures throughout the UK and is used to monitor the United Kingdom&#039;s child poverty targets.<br>

6. Relative income poverty is defined as having an income less than 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income.<br>

7. Income before housing costs (BHC) includes the following main components: usual net earnings from employment; profit or loss from self-employment (losses are treated as a negative income); all social security benefits (including housing benefit, social fund, maternity, funeral and community care grants but excluding social fund loans) and tax credits; income from occupational and private pensions; investment income; maintenance payments, if a person receives them directly; income from educational grants and scholarships (including, for students, top up loans and parental contributions); the cash value of certain forms of income in kind (free school meals, free welfare milk, free school milk and free TV licence for those aged 75 and over).<br>

8. Income is net of the following items: income tax payments; national insurance contributions; domestic rates (this includes water and sewerage charges for Northern Ireland); contributions to occupational pension schemes (including all additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to occupational pension schemes, and any contributions to personal pensions); all maintenance and child support payments, which are deducted from the income of the person making the payment and parental contributions to students living away from home.<br>

9. Income after housing costs (AHC) is derived by deducting a measure of housing costs from BHC income measure. Housing costs include the following: rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, mortgage interest payments (net of tax relief); structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and service charges.<br>

 This cannot be determined until the Valuation and Lands Agency completes the revaluation process in the spring of 2006.

The Department&#039;s own analysis supports these estimates and indicates that the proportion of properties which will experience a decrease in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 52 per cent., the proportion that will face an increase in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 35 per cent. and the proportion with no change in bill (that is, between + /- 5 per cent.) is 13 per cent.

 The UK, as designated partner nation for counter narcotics, has worked closely with the Government of Afghanistan since 2002. Recently, we supported the Government of Afghanistan in reviewing and updating its National Drugs Control Strategy.

The CNPA is currently around 500 strong, but will be expanded further to give it the capacity to operate nationwide. The UK is also providing training for the Afghan Special Narcotics Force (ASNF), an elite and highly trained force equipped to tackle high value targets across the country. Since January 2004, the CNPA and ASNF have seized approximately 165 tonnes of opiates, destroyed over 264 drugs labs and made a significant number of arrests.

<p><a name="st_264"><a name="60209w31.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The identification of opium supply routes out of Afghanistan is based on seizure rates of opiates along the heroin trafficking routes. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime&#039;s 2004 Afghanistan Opium Survey showed that of Afghanistan&#039;s total opiate exports (500 metric tons of morphine and heroin and close to 100 metric tons of opium), about a quarter 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2006 : Column 1444W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
is exported via Central Asia (the Northern&quot; or Silk&quot; Route), but the bulk is still exported via Pakistan and Iran to Turkey and into the Balkans, (the Balkan Route&quot;). 90 per cent. of the drugs exported on the Northern Route&quot; are for the Russian market. Most of the opiates exported on the Balkan Route&quot; are destined for Europe. There is some evidence that the Caspian Route&quot;, from Turkmenistan across the Caspian Sea into the Caucasus, is increasingly being used to traffic drugs into Europe.

 Afghanistan has been the world&#039;s major supplier of illicit opium for a decade. It will take a long time to uproot something so deeply entrenched in Afghanistan&#039;s culture and economy. Without a strong state, a fully functioning judiciary or a properly trained and manned police force, Afghan capability to date has been limited.

These overall percentages, however, mask significant variations between provinces. For example, Nangarhar (-96 per cent.), Badakshan (-53 per cent.) and Helmand (-10 per cent.) saw the most significant decreases, while other provinces, such as Balkh and Farah, saw increases. Progress was also made in 2005 with the establishment of a Ministry for Counter Narcotics in Afghanistan, the passage of vital counter narcotics legislation, the conviction of over 90 drug traffickers and the seizure of some 160 tonnes of opiates.

 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. In 2005, UNODC estimated a total of 104,000 hectares of land were under opium poppy cultivation, with the highest levels of cultivation seen in Helmand, Kandahar, Balkh, Farah and Badakshan provinces. Total production was estimated at 4,100 tonnes. These figures represent a 21 percent. reduction on cultivation and a 2.5 percent. reduction on production over 2004 figures. The smaller scale of the decrease in total production resulted from higher yields per hectare arising from good weather conditions and less disease. Full details, including the level of opium cultivation by province from 2002&#150;05, can be found in the UNODC Afghanistan opium survey, November 2005, or on UNODC&#039;s website http://www.unodc.org.

Following endorsement of the Afghanistan compact at the London conference on 31 January-1 February, the UK remains fully committed to this work.

The UK has also supported the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s work to update its national drug control strategy (NDCS) which was approved by President Karzai in January 2006.

<p><a name="st_268"><a name="60209w31.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The UK believes that the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s recently updated national drug control strategy represents the best means of securing a sustainable reduction on the production and trafficking of opiates in Afghanistan. The strategy highlights four key priorities. These are: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; developing effective state institutions to combat drugs at the central and provincial level; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment for problem drug users. The strategy also states that there is a role for targeted ground-based eradication where alternative livelihoods exist, in order to incentivise the shift away from poppy cultivation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w31.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_234">The UK does not carry out eradication, but we do support Afghan eradication activity where alternative livelihoods exist. We have therefore provided support to the planning, monitoring and targeting work of the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s central eradication planning and monitoring cell. We have also funded a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime project to verify governor-led eradication and provided funding to support targeted eradication by the Afghan national police.

<a name="stpa_235">On licensing of opium production, the Afghan Minister for counter narcotics has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_257">The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad. Without an effective control mechanism, a lot of opium will still be refined into heroin for illicit markets in the West and elsewhere. We could not accept this.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60209w31.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_237">We do not believe that licensing opium cultivation in Afghanistan is a realistic solution to the problems of the opium economy in Afghanistan. In the absence of a strong state presence throughout the country there is currently too high a risk of diversion of legally produced opium into illegal channels, and overall levels of illicit cultivation could increase as a result.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w31.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_238">Helping Afghan farmers develop viable commercial crops as feasible economic alternatives to poppy is an important part of the UK&#039;s support. But farmers also need access to credit, land and markets, alternative employment opportunities (on and off the farm) infrastructure such as irrigation and roads to help grow and transport produce; and government emergency mechanisms to ensure food security. The UK is supporting the Government of Afghanistan to deliver in all of these areas, to enforce the Afghan law against growing poppy and inject risk into the system through a credible drugs law enforcement and manual poppy field eradication threat. Only in this way will we make a sustainable impact on cultivation and production.

ISAF&#039;s role in support of the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s counter narcotics campaign is set out in the counter narcotics annex of the NATO Operations Plan (OPLAN). NATO Ministers approved the revised OPLAN in December 2005. ISAF forces will be able to help with the provision of training to Afghan counter-narcotics forces and will when necessary provide support to their operations. They will also help the Afghan Government explain their policies to the Afghan people. ISAF forces will not take part in the eradication of opium poppy or in pre-planned and direct military action against the drugs trade.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pursuant to his meeting of 30 January 2006 with the Foreign Ministers of China, France, Germany, Russia, the US and the High Representative of the EU, how long he expects the extensive period of confidence-building required of Iran to be; what assurances are being sought from Iran; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_283"><a name="60209w33.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The nature of Iran&#039;s nuclear activities; its long record of concealment and failure to be fully transparent with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); its many breaches of its obligations; and its refusal to take and sustain confidence building steps requested by the IAEA Board of Governors have all contributed to a lack of confidence among the international community that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is, as it claims, for exclusively peaceful purposes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w33.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_245">In August 2005, the E3/EU presented proposals covering long-term arrangements for Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. These stated that continued confidence building would be required over a significant period of time, and outlined ways in which Iran could build confidence, including by making a binding commitment not to pursue fuel cycle activities other than the construction and operation of light water power and research reactors. They suggested that a final agreement could be reviewed every 10 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60209w33.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_246">Iran left the negotiations in August 2005 when it unilaterally decided to restart uranium conversion activities, contrary to repeated requests by the IAEA board and in violation of the Paris Agreement, which had set out the framework for talks. E3/EU officials held an exploratory meeting with Iran in December 2005 to see if it would be possible to agree a basis for resuming negotiations. The E3/EU stated that it would be essential, inter alia, for Iran not to renege further on its commitment to suspend all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. Iran&#039;s subsequent decision to restart enrichment related activity was a further rejection of efforts to seek a diplomatic solution, and has aroused further suspicion of Iran&#039;s intentions. We hope that Iran will reinstate a full suspension of enrichment related and reprocessing activities, address in full the outstanding requests of the IAEA Board of Governors and return to negotiations on a long-term agreement.

<sup>(27)</sup> Gateway and caseload interventions are performed as part of customer compliance activity from 2006&#150;07.<br>

<sup>(28)</sup> Customer compliance figures for 2007&#150;08 are forecasted based on 2006&#150;07 calculations and the trend of claims/caseload for income support/jobseeker&#039;s allowance. Approx 200,000 cases per annum previously handled by Fraud Investigation Service will be actioned by customer compliance officers from 2006&#150;07. Customer compliance activity is always intended to take place face-to-face with the customer, although not necessarily via a home visit. An assumption has been made for these figures that 50 percent will take place in a Jobcentre Plus office while the remaining 50 percent will be carried out by visit.<br>

<sup>(29)</sup> Core visits figures for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 are forecasted based on the previous three years actual data and the volume trend of claims for income support/jobseeker&#039;s allowance.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are not kept on the number of home visits made by Fraud Investigation Service investigators.<br>

2. Gateway interventions are visits made before benefit paid based on a risk priority list.<br>

3. Caseload interventions are visits made during the lifetime of a claim based on a risk priority list.<br>

4. Customer compliance visits are made to a customer where there is alleged fraud/error but a sanction/prosecution is unlikely.<br>

5. Core visits usually have a customer service angle. Examples are appointee visits and delivery of overpayment letters.<br>

 The merger of Gloucestershire Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust with Avon and Wiltshire ambulance trusts is part of wider process to create fewer, larger ambulance trusts across England. This is intended to reduce management costs and divert savings to front-line services.

<a name="stpa_295">Over the period of a pandemic, which could be around three to four months, the proportion of the workforce who will take time off due to illness will be similar to the overall clinical attack rate.

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="60209w41.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The letter of 13 December, to the director of development for Bristol South and West Primary Care Trust, confirmed the Department&#039;s decision to require the standard private finance initiative contract to be used in future for complex individual Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) facilities with a capital value of over &#163;25 million. This decision was taken to ensure appropriate risk transfer for these very large LIFT facilities, which are much larger and cover additional services than those originally intended to be undertaken under LIFT. The decision simply involves the use of a different contract for the limited number of LIFT facilities where it is more appropriate. It does not represent a major policy, financial or service change, and for this reason, no formal consultations were undertaken with stakeholders including the LIFT Liaison Organisation for Business Investors (LIFT LOBI). This is in line with the Cabinet Office&#039;s Code of Practice on Consultation&quot;. The Department&#039;s national health service LIFT policy lead met representatives of LIFT LOBI on 9 January to discuss and explain the decision, and is also holding a series of meetings with the primary care trusts affected. I have no plans to meet members of LIFT LOBI.

The Inspector is concerned that some medical practitioners base their diagnosis on positive results from unsuitable and unvalidated tests performed in non-accredited laboratories. A warning was published in the American journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 11 February 2005, advising caution regarding many commercially promoted tests for Lyme borreliosis and restating the internationally accepted diagnostic criteria.

 Under the terms of their contract, contractors receive a global sum which is a contribution towards the contractor&#039;s costs in delivering essential and additional services, including maintaining adequate patient records. In addition, contractors can obtain points within the quality and outcomes framework on a number of areas relating to the maintenance of patient records. The relevant indicators are outlined in annex D of the statement of financial entitlements, which is available in the Library. There are no current plans to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2006 : Column 1487W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60209w42.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_312">The transfer of local records to the NHS CRS requires compliance with NHS Connecting for Health&#039;s stringent data migration quality standards. However, good practice guidelines for general practice electronic patient records developed by the General Practitioners Committee and the Royal College of General Practitioners, and issued by the Department, make it clear that responsibility for the quality of the necessary transfer processes, and for ensuring information is accurate and up-to-date, lies with the individual practice. This includes the putting in place of procedures to identify and resolve where an error occurs in code conversion. That could be as simple as reviewing and verifying the relevant record with the patient at the next consultation.
