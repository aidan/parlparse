<p><a name="50203w02.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 There are currently no changes proposed in respect of the role played by the custody sergeant as set out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). We are, however, proposing under Clause 111 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill that chief officers of police should be able to develop a more flexible approach to the staffing of their custody suites by making use of police staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w02.html_para0">
The Thematic Inspection by Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary published in July 2004 on Workforce Modernisation concluded that the role of police staff could be extended to perform that of the custody officer. The Report recognised the importance of suitable training and transitional arrangements; and identified that the ability to use staff custody officers would enable the release of experienced supervisors to front-line duties and could strengthen the independence of the custody officer role as set out in PACE.
</p>

We are proposing to ensure that these benefits can be fully assessed through establishing a programme of pilot sites looking at selection, training and practical application at the police station.

<p><a name="50203w06.html_wqn0"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications for greenhouse gas emissions of the absence of an agreed national allocation plan under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.  [211782]</p>




<p><a name="50203w06.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2005]:</i> The UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) was submitted to the Commission in April 2004 and was approved on 7 July. The NAP clearly stated that the figure for the total number of allowances to be allocated was provisional pending finalisation of the emissions projections, the review of Climate Change Agreement targets, and the receipt of verified data from installations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para0">
Although we are still awaiting a formal response from the Commission on the proposed amendments to the NAP (submitted 10 November 2004), the EU Emissions Trading Scheme has commenced operation. Under the terms of their greenhouse gas emissions permits which were issued during the course of last year, operators began monitoring their carbon dioxide emissions on 1 January this year. There has been an active market in contracts for future delivery of emissions allowances for some time. UK operators will be able to trade on the &quot;spot&quot; market once allowances have been issued, which is anticipated to be at the end of March. We plan to announce the installation allocations in early February which will provide UK operators with greater certainty about their allocation. The delay in trading will not affect the fact that operators covered by the Scheme will be required to surrender allowances in line with their carbon dioxide emissions for 2005, as the first year of Phase 1 of the Scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para1">
Other member states have also found the implementation of the scheme challenging. Denmark is the only country which is currently in a position to spot trade, and a number of other member states expect to be in a position to spot trade by the end of February. Italy, the Czech Republic, Poland and Greece are yet to receive approval of their NAP from the European Commission.

<p><a name="50203w06.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) was submitted to the European Commission in April 2004, and was approved in July. The total number of allowances to be allocated was set at 0.7 per cent. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1023W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
below the projected UK emissions 2005&#150;07. The NAP clearly stated that this figure (total number of allowances) was provisional and based on interim projections.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para2">
Following the finalisation of energy projections, UK emissions 2005&#150;07 are now estimated to be 56 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub>  higher than was estimated in April. The Government have proposed to increase the total number of allowances, but just by 20 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> . The effect of this is to increase the level of effort required from our NAP to 5 per cent. below projected emissions, making the UK NAP a more ambitious plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para3">
The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is one of the measures in place to help us achieve our national goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in CO <sub>2</sub>  on 1990 levels by 2010.

<p><a name="50203w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 February 2005]:</i> We have increased flood defence and coast erosion funding to the Environment Agency and other operating authorities up from &#163;312 million in 1997&#150;98 and set to rise to &#163;570 million next year and for each of the following two years. However, although building and maintaining physical defences will reduce the risk of flooding, that risk can never be completely eliminated. Plans exist at local, regional and central levels to respond to potential and actual flood events.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para4">
In addition to building and maintaining defences, the Environment Agency maintains its own local, regional and national level contingency plans to deal with potential or actual flooding. As part of its remit, the Agency also maintains a flood warning system to ensure as high a level of preparedness as possible by the public and the local, regional and central responders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para5">
At the national level, Defra has the lead Department role for flood emergencies and our Lead Department Plan sets out the co-ordination arrangements at local, regional and central levels for flooding from rivers or the sea. Alongside this Plan other Departments and Agencies maintain their own plans in their areas of responsibility to respond to, for example, the consequences of floods. There are also provisions for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1024W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Government co-ordination when necessary through the arrangements operated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para6">
The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 formalises a number of duties on local authorities, the emergency services and other organisations involved, including the Environment agency, in responding to any emergency. Among these are contingency planning and risk assessment for emergencies at the local level, including flooding: for example, local flood response plans were activated in the case of both the Boscastle flood in August last year and the January 2005 Carlisle flood.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para7">
The Government have also set up a Regional Resilience Team in each of the English regions to enhance the co-ordination of planning for wide impact events, such as major flooding, and to improve lines of communication between central Government and local responders during the response to an incident. These arrangements worked successfully in relation to the Boscastle and Carlisle floods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w06.html_para8">
The Environment Agency, with other responders, also carries out a regular programme of exercises to test its capability at all levels. Last year, EA led a national level exercise&#151;Exercise Triton&#151;to test the preparedness of organisations at all levels, local, regional and national to a simulated national scale event involving flooding of the East Coast from Lincolnshire to Hampshire, with offsets in Gwent and North Wales.

<p><a name="50203w07.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency has powers under the Groundwater Regulations 1998 to serve a notice to prohibit, or make subject to conditions, activities, such as operating a petrol station, which might put groundwater at risk. Failure to follow the Groundwater Protection Code, including the provisions on risk assessments, is not an offence in itself but shall be considered, along with individual site circumstances, by the Agency when deciding whether to serve a notice. The Agency will often, particularly where it perceives risks to be low, seek to address issues through dialogue before using these notice powers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w07.html_para1">
The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (DSEAR) are the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive. Enforcement of DSEAR at petrol filling stations is undertaken by the local Petroleum Licensing Authority (PLA). Regulation 5(1) requires that where a dangerous substance is present at the workplace, the employer should make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks. Should the PLA discover that such a risk assessment has not been undertaken, then the full range of regulatory action is available to the enforcing officer, ranging from a verbal request to undertake a risk assessment to, ultimately, prosecution.

<p><a name="50203w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The precise scale of likely damage which could be caused by a tsunami type wave is difficult to predict as this would depend on both size and origin. However, the flood maps published on the internet by the Environment Agency now show the potential extent of an extreme flood (estimated at a 0.1 per cent. or 1 in 1,000 annual probability) for all coastal areas of England. While this was never intended to cover tsunami-type events, these maps are clearly indicative of the areas most at risk in such an occurrence. Assessments of such risks for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are matters for the devolved Administrations. However, the Environment Agency Flood maps also cover Wales.

A number of other initiatives have been of particular relevance to transport provision in rural areas. In 2002 we extended eligibility to Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) to a wide range of community transport operations. Some 700 community transport groups are now claiming the grant, many of them in rural areas. Last year we introduced changes to regulations making it easier to provide flexible and demand responsive bus services and making these services eligible for BSOG. We have also issued guidance to authorities on the introduction of accessibility planning which provides a framework for improving accessibility in rural areas and elsewhere.

<a name="50203w12.html_para7">
At the Global Partners&#039; Forum on orphans and vulnerable children held in Washington DC in December 2004, I announced how the UK would meet our target of spending at least &#163;150 million over the next three years to meet the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. Most of this will be spent in Africa where the impacts of AIDS on children are most severe. DFID will mainly be providing funds though our country programmes to support national responses. We are however, already providing funds through NGOs to support vulnerable children in Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In a number of countries, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe, we are supporting the rapid assessment analysis and action plan process (RAAAP), which has been led by UNICEF. This has resulted in the development of 16 national action plans for orphans and vulnerable children. Effective civil society involvement in their implementation is an important issue for us and we will be working with UNICEF to ensure that civil society organisations are appropriately included in these programmes.

We will also increase our Civil Society Challenge Fund from &#163;10 million to &#163;14 million in 2005 and encourage proposals from NGOs wanting to provide support in this field.

[213215]</p>




<p><a name="50203w13.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Both DFID and the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) recognise the benefits of consultation. It can improve the design of projects and policies, and increase developing countries&#039; ownership of their own development.
</p>


<p>

The IFIs have a diverse range of consultation guidelines for different types of policies and projects; DFID believes that this is appropriate. The EU guidelines on consultation also specifically state that

make their consultations more transparent and comprehensive. In particular, we encourage IFIs to consult widely with affected parties, allowing an appropriate amount of time both for consultation and feedback. DFID also stresses the importance of ensuring that the consultation is tailored to local needs. In the ongoing negotiations of the 14th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the arm of the World Bank which lends to the worlds poorest countries, the UK has been pushing for strengthened documentation of stakeholder feedback from consultations required under the World Bank&#039;s safeguard policies.

shared out in the same fixed proportions as each distributor&#039;s share of operator-related lottery income. This will end the current arrangement whereby those distributors that manage to reduce their balances receive proportionately less investment income, and it will also make the estimation of future income simpler and more transparent for all. When this measure takes effect the Heritage Lottery Fund will therefore receive 16.67 per cent. of all the income that the lottery generates for good causes.

<p><a name="50203w17.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many attacks on taxi drivers in North Belfast have been reported in the last year; and who was found to be responsible in each case.  [211969]</p>




<p><a name="50203w17.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 Due to the nature of the statistics held by PSNI, it is not possible to ascertain how many specific attacks upon taxi drivers occurred between 1 January 2004 and 27 January 2005, as victims are not identified by occupation. However, the DCU Commander in North Belfast reports that between those dates 124 incidents involving taxis occurred. These incidents vary in nature and include incidents where persons run off without paying, as well as more serious offences such as assault and aggravated criminal damage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w17.html_para0">
The vast majority of those incidents are unrelated to the recent series of attacks upon taxis and taxi drivers in North Belfast. The recent spate of attacks upon taxis in that area can be attributed to organized criminality with links both to the UVF and LVF. Since 1 December 2004, North Belfast DCU has recorded 12 incidents involving taxis. On three of those occasions a taxi driver was threatened. On 10 of those occasions a taxi has been set alight.

 In order to facilitate the supply of suitably qualified dentists the Department funds a one-year vocational training (VT) scheme and a two-year general professional training (GPT) scheme. Prior to August 2000 there were 20 VT places, this has been increased to the current level of 24 VT places and four dental trainees in each year of the GPT scheme.

<p><a name="50203w18.html_spnew3"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 Recruitment and selection procedures are a matter for individual Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS) employers and it is the responsibility of the employer to carry out all necessary pre employment checks. In addition, for medical and dental staff a system of alert letters is in place whereby all HPSS employers are notified in cases where a doctor or dentist, who has been dismissed or suspended, poses a potential risk to the safety of patients and it is believed he/she will seek work elsewhere. The Department is currently reviewing the procedures that exist for alert letters with a view to potentially extending the process to cover other health care staff.

<p><a name="50203w18.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 There is no statutory definition of the term fit person as used in Articles 5 and 9 of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. The protection and safety of the public lies at the heart of the legislation, which requires that an applicant for a firearms certificate or a current holder, should be a person who is fit to be entrusted with a firearm or ammunition. There are various matters which the Chief Constable may take into account before making a decision. Guidance on this and all other forearms licensing issues is contained in the Guidance on Northern Ireland Firearms Controls, which is available on the Northern Ireland Office website www.nio.gov.uk

 The Department is currently discussing with Boards the specific priority areas for service development for inclusion in Boards&#039; Health and Wellbeing Investment Plans and Trust Delivery Plans. It has, however, already been made clear to Boards and Trusts that priority will be given to the reform and modernisation of hospital and associated primary and community care services. The Department expects significant increases in productivity and improved quality and safety of services to be achieved as a result of the ongoing re-configuration of existing services and new ways of working made possible by a range of pay reforms currently being implemented.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answer of 19 January 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 977W, on maternity units, what the reasons were for the temporary arrangement in December 2004; what form this arrangement took; and when it is expected to end.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1072W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50203w19.html_spnew0"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The midwife-led unit in Craigavon Area Hospital is currently operating with two rather than three midwives. These temporary arrangements were put in place due to staff sickness and a high level of obstetric activity within the main delivery suite and the maternity wards. This action has been necessary in order to ensure that a safe service is provided across all the trust&#039;s maternity services. I would emphasis that the extent of change was the reallocation of one midwife only and that this measure is temporary, circumstance-specific, and under continual review.

<p><a name="50203w19.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 There is a range of organisations, both statutory and voluntary, within Northern Ireland involved in the provision of support to migrant workers including the provision of information on services. Some provide &quot;welcome packs&quot; in English and a variety of minority languages where there is a demand. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister has provided funding from its minority ethnic voluntary organisation fund for this purpose, for example to the South Tyrone Empowerment Programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para0">
Also the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is planning a booklet for migrant workers outlining where and how to seek advice, support and redress against racism and to access public services. This booklet is due to be published in March 2005. It is anticipated that the booklet will be published in a variety of languages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para1">
However, we recognise that we still have a great deal to do in facing the challenges posed by the arrival of increasing numbers of migrant workers in Northern Ireland. This has been brought into stark relief by the horrific ordeal of the Ukrainian national who had her legs amputated after suffering from frostbite as a result of sleeping rough. Clearly, Government and others need to establish, as a matter of urgency, what lessons we can learn from this horrific experience. To this end a multi-agency review and assessment meeting is being facilitated by the northern health and social services board in the near future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para2">
I have asked my officials to investigate whether there are gaps in provision of information services and welcome packs, how to plug any gaps and the scope for setting out minimum standards. We recognise, however, the crucial role of the voluntary and community sector in providing information that is tailored to specific communities across Northern Ireland and we would wish this to continue. I also wish to see employers and trade unions working with us on this important area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para3">
The rapid changes in the composition of the migrant worker population in Northern Ireland and the sheer diversity of source countries for migrant workers means that it is unlikely to be practical to offer every single migrant worker, regardless of the language they speak, a welcome pack in their own mother tongue. However, I would hope that such packs could be made available in those languages that are most frequently used.

 Research commissioned by the Office of the First Minister and &quot;Deputy First Minister&#151;Migrant Workers in Northern Ireland&quot; (June 2004) indicates that &quot;migrant workers are a growing category of employees in Northern Ireland and they are a necessary factor for many employment sectors due to a shortage of available local labour&quot;. I have arranged for copies of the research report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para4">
This research indicates the difficulty in identifying the total number of migrant workers in Northern Ireland with any degree of accuracy. In particular, nationals from countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) and family members of EEA nationals are exempt from immigration control and have a right to enter, reside and work in the UK without the permission of any UK authority. Thus there is no central body that records their migration to Northern Ireland. Migrant workers from outside the EEA are allowed to work here under work permit arrangements which are regulated by the Home Office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para5">
The 2001 Census indicates that there were 5,940 people in Northern Ireland who were born in EU countries (excluding the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) and 20,719 people born in non-EU countries. This gives a maximum figure of 26,659 people who could be classified as migrant workers or dependents of migrant workers.
</p>


<p>

Home Office records show that 3,253 applications for work permits were approved from employers with a Northern Ireland postcode in 2003 and 3,827 in 2004.

I have asked my officials to work with their colleagues in other Government Departments including the Home Office, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, trades unions and business interests to see how they can work together in this area, to improve the availability of information on flows of migrant workers into Northern Ireland&#151;to ensure that Government Departments, agencies and others can respond effectively to the needs of migrant workers.

The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is to be commended for the lead that it is taking in gathering examples of good practice in the employment of migrant workers. Many employers in both the public and the private sector are to be commended, too, for their good practice in working with and supporting employees from overseas. The Equality Commission has held a range of seminars and roundtable discussions to encourage employers and service providers to meet their obligations to migrant workers. Together with Business in the Community it is organising a &quot;Migrant Workers: Building on Best Practice&quot; conference for later in the year. I strongly support this initiative. I would wish to see greater exchange of good practice between employers (including trade unions) and recognition by

I do not have details of the English language skills of migrant workers. We do know that the language barrier is a problem for many migrant workers, their family members and members of minority ethnic groups who do not speak English as their first language or who speak little English and for the statutory agencies involved in the provision of services. Government are committed to effective communication with all its customers and to ensuring that services are as accessible as possible to all members of the community, including people from minority ethnic groups and migrant workers. DHSSPS does not have information on the number of migrant workers accessing emergency medical services. In emergencies hospitals use interpreting services provided by Language Line and other providers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para10">
For its part, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) introduced new interpretation procedures in September 2004. Telephone interpreters are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and are available from any phone, including mobiles, from any location. This has considerably increased the Police Service&#039;s ability to liaise quickly with individuals who cannot understand English. Face-to-face interpreters are also available if required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w19.html_para11">
Finally, the PSNI is currently working with its telephone interpretation service provider to investigate ways of handling emergency calls made by people who cannot speak English.

Notes:<br>

1. This information relates to resources in both operational regions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, rural and urban. They provide a snapshot only of resources at 3pm and 3am on early and night shift on 23 November 2004, and should be read in that context. These figures can vary due to shift changeovers and variable shift patterns.<br>

2. The support provided to response and community policing teams has an important role in frontline service delivery. Community safety teams, domestic violence officers etc. all provide a frontline service, and deal with victims, perpetrators and witnesses on a daily basis.<br>

3. It is not possible to state how many officers attached to all headquarters departments were on duty on that date as only manual records are held and a manual search would be required that would incur disproportionate cost. This includes murder investigation teams, serious crime teams etc. <br>

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he intends to designate specific sites for development within Hartlepool under the policies set out in Sustainable Communities: Homes for All.  [213501]</p>




<p><a name="50203w23.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 No. This is a matter for Hartlepool borough council to consider through its local development plan process working within national planning guidance and the regional spatial strategy. The Council&#039;s review of the Hartlepool Local Plan has recently considered the issue of housing need in the borough and has identified a range of housing sites. Housing market renewal in Hartlepool has also been recognised as a priority by the North East Housing Board. Tees Valley (including Hartlepool) is likely to be one of the beneficiaries of funding recently announced for Housing Market Renewal to be available from April 2006 and distributed through Regional Housing Boards.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans there are for providing new housing with a selling price of &#163;60,000 in the Chorley constituency.  [214397]</p>




<p><a name="50203w23.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently announced that we are working on a new First Time Buyers Initiative&#151;of which the &quot;Design for Manufacture&quot; competition is an adjunct&#151;designed to provide those who are unable to purchase a home outright with a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to independent home ownership. English Partnerships will be leading on the delivery of 15,000 homes to 2010. It is not possible, at the present time, to identify precisely where homes constructed under these schemes will be available. However, in addition to sites in English Partnership&#039;s portfolio we will be encouraging other landowners, such as local authorities, to use the scheme&#039;s model as a way of addressing affordability issues in their areas.

 Consent does not have to be given to housing associations before they can impose a right of first refusal covenant in respect of Right to Buy or voluntary sales under the Housing Act 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w23.html_para0">
Under section 188 of the Housing Act 2004, all social landlords (local authorities or housing associations) that sell properties under the Right to Buy scheme are required to include a &quot;right of first refusal&quot; covenant in the conveyance or grant of lease. This covenant requires the owner of an ex-Right to Buy home who wishes to

resell it within 10 years of the Right to Buy sale to offer it to the former landlord or to another social landlord, at market value. If the offer is not accepted, the owner is free to sell on the open market. Regulations setting out the procedures to be followed will be laid before Parliament shortly. These regulations will reflect the responses to the Government&#039;s consultation paper published in March 2004, and sent to landlords, representative bodies, and tenants&#039; organisations.

Consent is still required for the imposition of a right of first refusal covenant in areas which have been designated as rural by the Secretary of State, my right hon.

<p><a name="50203w23.html_spnew4"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 EN 13724 is a voluntary standard setting out specifications covering the height, positioning and design of letter boxes for ergonomic and safety reasons. The Government have no plans to amend the Building Regulations to implement this standard.

 The Government are working to ensure that inspection focuses more clearly on improvement for service users and, through a risk based and proportionate approach, the overall burden of inspection will be significantly reduced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w23.html_para4">
Inspection programmes have not been worked up in detail for the years in question, but in 2004&#150;05 there was a 30 per cent. reduction in the number of inspections compared to 2002&#150;03.

The Audit Commission, which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sponsors, anticipates that by 2006&#150;07, the volume of inspections needed for Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA), including the corporate assessments planned for that year, should fall by 68 per cent. from the 2002&#150;03 level.

<p><a name="50203w23.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The results of the Soundings Exercise were published in June 2003. This considered the level of interest in holding referendums on establishing elected regional assemblies in the English regions.

No polls, focus groups or other measures of public opinion on this subject have been undertaken since then by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

 As soon as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) received news of the tsunami disaster it activated its emergency crisis plan that deals with major emergencies involving British nationals overseas. Under this plan, posts in the affected region were reinforced with trained consular staff both from London and other regional posts.

<a name="50203w28.html_para5">
Between 26 December and 24 January, the FCO sent a total of 105 extra staff to Thailand. As of 24 January, 51 of these extra staff remained in Thailand. 27 were supporting the embassy in Bangkok and 24 were manning the temporary mission in Phuket. On 26 December, a rapid deployment team of 10 FCO staff was sent out from London to the high commission in Colombo. A further eight team members were deployed between 28 and 30 December. As of 24 January, one member of this team remained in Sri Lanka.

<a name="50203w28.html_para7">
It is far from clear as yet what the total financial cost of the consular operation will be but it will almost certainly exceed that of any recent consular crisis. The cost includes the deployment of police officers to the affected region for family liaison and forensic investigation. We expect some tsunami-related activity to continue into the next financial year.

Since October 2003 a proportion of each UK passport fee has gone towards establishing an Emergency and Disaster Reserve (EDR) which is controlled jointly by the FCO and Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury. By the end of financial year 2004&#150;05, allowing for previous non-tsunami claims yet to be paid, there will be roughly &#163;5 million in the EDR which we hope will be sufficient to cover the majority of the 2004&#150;05 claim. In the event that total claims exceed the capacity of the EDR, we will need to consider how best to meet that cost, including by seeking access to the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits Reserve.

 No specific guidance has been issued to the national health service on proposed mergers of ambulance services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w30.html_para0">
However, under section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, NHS bodies are under a duty to consult and involve patients, the public and their representatives in the planning of changes to services and to involve them in decisions affecting the operation of services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w30.html_para1">
Once the results of these consultations are known, if the trust boards and strategic health authority agree that a merger should take place, they are required to write to the Secretary of State for Health asking that the Department take action to merge the organisations. If that request is approved by Ministers, an order will be drawn up dissolving the organisations in question and creating a replacement organisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w30.html_para2">
There are no set standards for what the Secretary of State would take into account when considering a request to merge NHS organisations. But as a general rule, before approving the merger of any NHS trusts, the Secretary of State would seek to satisfy himself that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">appropriate consultation has been undertaken locally;</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">any organisational changes are in the interests of patients and staff; and</p>

 Any decisions around the configuration of ambulance trusts are a matter for the local health economy to consider, led by the strategic health authority (SHA) and in consultation with patients and the public.

Should a proposal to change services represent a substantial development or variation, NHS bodies are under a duty to consult relevant local authority overview and scrutiny committees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50203w30.html_para3">
It is appropriate for SHAs and commissioners to examine how ambulance services are provided in their area and consider whether the current arrangements could be improved to benefit patients and staff, reduce duplication and improve efficiency.
