To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures the Government have taken to encourage the use of <i>(a)</i> biodegradable starch-base plastics and <i>(b)</i> other starch-based products in place of petrochemicals  [91654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 1999]:</i> A fully biodegradable product can offer significant environmental benefits, for example where it can be composted or reused in another form. A particular type of degradable product, "inherently degradable resins" (starch mixed with polyethylene), was developed in the latter part of the 1980s. Although marketed as biodegradable, research has suggested otherwise. The micro-organisms consumed the starch, leaving the polyethylene intact.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para0">Our recent consultation paper, "Less Waste: More Value", emphasised the need to gain more value from waste through re-use, recycling, composting and recovery of energy. Products which are specifically designed for disposal with no beneficial recovery potential run counter to this approach.

<a name="90726w01.htm_para1">These additional social lettings come from new build, the purchase and rehabilitation of existing property and from empty properties brought into use for temporary social housing. The ADP and LASHG also supports the provision of homes for shared ownership and incentive schemes which assist social tenants to move into home ownership and vacate their lettings for others in housing need.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para2">On the basis of information provided to the Department by local authorities, there were at least 35 council houses built in London boroughs in 1998-99.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on progress in improving accessibility to public transport for people with disabilities in London.  [92404]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Progress at the national level will impact on London. We are already bringing forward regulations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to require new trains, buses and newly licensed taxis to be accessible to disabled people, including those in wheelchairs.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para3">The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations came into effect on 1 January 1999 requiring all new trains, including Underground trains, to meet requirements for wheelchair access and a range of other features to help people with disabilities. We are proposing that all new single deck buses will have to comply with similar regulations from next year and double deckers from the year after. There are now nearly 1,000 low floor buses in use throughout London, and most areas will have routes on which this type of vehicle are in operation.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para4">All taxis in London will be accessible by 1 January 2000 and there are already more than 16,000 accessible taxis in the fleet. National requirements on accessibility 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 1999 : Column: 3</I><P>
are proposed to come into effect from 2002 and will lead to further improvements in access standards for taxis. Other provisions of the Act which come into effect in 2004 will also require reasonable steps to be taken to remove or alter barriers to access Underground stations. Investment in the Underground, which the Public Private Partnership will bring, will, amongst other things, enable work to be carried out to establish a network of key stations which would be fully accessible to those with mobility problems.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para5">Dedicated door-to-door services in London are currently provided primarily by the Dial-a-Ride and Taxicard schemes. Working with the Commission for Accessible Transport we will be taking forward their proposals on pilot schemes on better co-ordination of services.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para6">The Greater London Authority Bill places a duty on the mayor to address transport issues affecting disabled people and others who may face difficulties in using all forms of public transport. The mayor's transport strategy must (under clause 124(2)(a) of the Bill) contain proposals for transport which is accessible. London Boroughs Local Implementation Plans will have to deliver the mayoral strategy.
<P>

<a name="90726w01.htm_para7">Schedule 8(3) of the Bill places the mayor under a duty to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the membership of Transport for London represents the interests of those who require accessible transport.

<a name="90726w01.htm_para8">The Department is now seeking the advice of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on the safety issues at Rovie Crossing. We expect to receive HSE's advice around the middle of August. The Secretary of State will then take a decision on Railtrack's application. Any new safety measures will be for Railtrack Scotland (not ScotRail) to install.

<P>
<a name="90726w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Planning inspectors have a quasi- judicial role and must not only conduct themselves in an open and impartial manner, but been seen to do so. Membership of a society that is perceived by many people to operate with a degree of secrecy is therefore inconsistent with the work of an Inspector.

 The average annual expenditure per dwelling on repairs and maintenance by local authorities in England in 1997-98 was &#163;663.00. This is derived from the revenue expenditures recorded by local authorities that continue to operate a Housing Revenue Account and excludes expenditure of a capital nature.

<P>
<P>

 Details of regulations that imposed compliance costs on business are published in the Department's regulatory impact assessments and laid in both Houses. A summary of all the regulatory assessments published by the Department and other regulatory Departments in Whitehall are published every six months in a White Paper, and are available on a monthly basis on the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit's website.
<P>

<a name="90726w02.htm_para7">The Department includes a section on its regulatory activity in its Annual Report.
<P>

<a name="90726w02.htm_para8">There is no arbitrary target for reducing the compliance costs of regulation. However, all departments are required to make an assessment of the risks, costs and benefits of any regulatory proposal that has an impact on business, charities and voluntary bodies before they decide to act. Without an assessment of this kind there can be no collective agreement of a regulatory proposal.

 A UK proposal to add the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) to Appendix II of the CITES Convention was submitted to the CITES Secretariat on 14 May. It was circulated for comment to all 145 CITES parties, including range states, on 31 May. We will consider responses before making a final decision on whether to submit the proposal to next year's 11th CITES Conference, by the Secretariat's deadline of 12 November 1999. We have already received indications of support from several countries.

<a name="90726w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The current number of signatories to the Declaration of Intent with the air conditioning and refrigeration industry is 205. It is difficult to estimate the potential number of signatories to the Declaration of Intent because there are a large number of smaller air conditioning and refrigeration companies in operation, many of which do not belong to a trade association. It is important to note that those who have already signed up are mostly members of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Industry Board (ACRIB) and much larger companies in general.

<a name="90726w04.htm_para0">I am not aware of the reports by Dr. Alexandrakis. However, the report of the Committee of Independent Experts, which led to the resignation of the Commission in March, revealed a lack of responsibility and accountability in the Commission's handling of external aid spending in the Mediterranean, in emergency aid and in nuclear safety in Eastern Europe. I welcome the report and the shake up which it has triggered. The new Commission and member states must now ensure that fraud and weak controls are rooted out and that EC funds are spent properly and effectively on development and other programmes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what proportion of the financial allocation from the Eastern Health and Social Services Board towards the Down Lisburn Trust in respect of community care provision for 1999-2000 has been expended to date.  [92009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 Although service agreements have not yet been finalised, of the amount the Eastern Health and Social Services Board proposed to allocate to Down and Lisburn Trust for community care provision for 1999-2000, 24.4 per cent. has been spent to date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 While the Commission was sitting, work was already taking place in some of the areas which the report highlights, such as developing a national strategy for carers and the extension of the direct payments scheme to people 65 and over. Where the Commission is recommending new policies for the future, these proposals will require more detailed consideration in coming months.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 1999]:</i> A large number of official documents were generated during the period of the previous Administration, many of which were published or put in the public domain. Since May 1997, the Northern Ireland Office has been guided by the convention governing access to the papers of a previous Administration, as set out in the then Prime Minister's reply to a written question on 24 January 1980, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>305-07.

[92297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans for an investigation into this matter. The Planning Service will reconsider its advice on the application for planning permission in the light of the Judicial Review decision. The Secretary of State is not aware of any planning cases where misleading information may have been given to the Minister.

 This is a matter for the Parades Commission. However, I understand that two of the preliminary survey responses were made public at the time of the launch of the Commission's Annual Report. The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, the largest circulating local daily newspaper, then requested full details for publication when these became available. No other media outlet requested such details.

 As a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, an additional 600 full-time higher education places were secured in the further education sector over the next two years. These places have been allocated to six areas of skills needs identified as being important for the development of the regional economy. The six vocational areas are computing, construction, electronics, hospitality and catering, manufacturing engineering and software engineering.
<P>

<a name="90726w07.htm_para0">Colleges of further and higher education were invited to submit bids for the additional places to the Department of Education. Bids were assessed against five common criteria so that places could be awarded on the basis of a college's ability to deliver high quality, relevant provision in the specified vocational areas. The five criteria were: expertise and experience of teaching staff, links with industry; resources; senior management commitment; and track record in provision of higher education. The population of the council area in which a college is situated was not taken into consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w07.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The purpose of internal histories is to provide factual, accurate and authoritative background information for members of departments on particular topics; planning and decision making; to evaluate the effectiveness of policy and to point out possible lessons for the future. The target audience for internal histories is primarily relevant departmental staff.
<P>

<a name="90726w07.htm_para8">These histories are not written for publication but as public records they are considered under the Public Records Acts for release to the Public Record Office. As has been the practice under successive administrations, it is a matter for Departments whether they wish to conduct an internal history and topics are usually commissioned by senior staff in departments in response, for example, to a need for analyses of major developments or operations or to provide factual reports on particular events. Authors are usually drawn from officers from the department with relevant experience or from within their historical branches.

China has signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and invited the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit. These positive steps will help to bring about China's closer co-operation with UN human rights mechanisms. We will continue to encourage China to ratify the international covenants which it has signed and we will continue to support developments in China's legal system which we believe will bring about positive change to human rights in the longer term.

An entry on the MCA's computerised Produce Licence database gives the date of authorisation as 19 November 1973. This may be the date on which the formal notification was sent to the company. There were over 39,000 applications for product licences of right and it is reasonable to assume that there would have been some delay in processing those applications.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 1999]:</i> Products and by-products made from genetically modified crops which satisfied the definition of a medicinal product, as defined in Article 1 of Directive 65/65/EEC, would be subject to medicines legislation. The Medicines Act does not cover the regulation of crop cultivation. The Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions is responsible for implementing Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.

 The Royal Commission on the reform of the House of Lords issued a consultation document in March of this year and I understand that, in response, it has received over 1,300 written submissions concerning the long-term reform of the House of Lords from members of the public, MPs, peers, academics and a range of organisations.
<P>

<a name="90726w13.htm_para0">The Commission is keen to secure the widest possible range of views on the issues raised by its terms of reference and it has organised a series of public meetings throughout the UK to enable it to probe and test the written evidence it has received and to hear the views of members of the general public. The final meeting will be in London on 27 July.

 I have no plans to speed up the legislative process as such. The House's procedures already provide sufficient flexibility in cases of urgency.

 The Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN) is monitored on an operational basis with real time information.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DU ammunition was last fired at the DERA Eskmeals range at hard targets or dummy armour in September 1995. Public concern about the risk of contamination from DU prompted DERA, in December 1993, to commission an independent study by W S Atkins Environment. The report of the study, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House, concluded that there was no significant risk to the public, site personnel or the environment. The comprehensive environmental monitoring programme, that DERA continues to conduct, confirms that this is still the case. The monitoring reports are all within the public domain; the most recent reports, for 1995/96, were presented to the Environment Agency and local councils at the beginning of last year and further reports will be available to the public in due course as a matter of routine.</FONT></UL>

 In the Defence Housing Executive (DHE) 1999 Corporate Plan, the action plan sets out a key target relating to the unit cost of housing and aims to achieve a figure of less than &#163;5,400 per property. The figure is calculated by dividing the total cost of the DHE (&#163;349,152 million including some &#163;100 million rental payment to Annington Homes Ltd) by the number of properties occupied (including those which are Substitute Services Families Accommodation) (63,195). The equivalent figure for Financial Year 1998-99 is &#163;5,460. The cost of the upgrade programme is not included as this is outside the routine cost of housing provision.

 My Department does not provide financial or material assistance to the Ty Gwyn clinic, and I am not aware of any similar facilities in the United Kingdom which specialise in the treatment of traumatised Service personnel. Admission of Service personnel suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to the Duchess of Kent's Psychiatric Hospital, Catterick, would be on the basis of clinical judgment. Former Service personnel are eligible for treatment of post traumatic stress disorder at the Duchess of Kent's Psychiatric Hospital, free of charge as NHS patients, if they live within the catchment area of the hospital. If not, the cost of treatment would need to be met by their local health authority in accordance with NHS budgetary procedures. Admission of former Service personnel would depend on spare capacity being available.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the purpose of the concession to Immigration Rules in respect of the one year rule and women suffering domestic violence.  [92471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w17.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Under the Immigration Rules, spouses of British Citizens or of people settled in the United Kingdom are not given settlement on arrival or following the marriage; they are granted an initial period of 12 months. At the end of this 12 month probationary period, settlement will be granted if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the marriage is still subsisting and that each of the parties has the intention of living permanently with the other as his or her spouse.
<P>

<a name="90726w17.htm_para1">If, for whatever reason, the marriage has broken down during the probationary year, settlement is normally refused. That is because the fundamental reason for the person's admission in the first place--to continue or commence stable family life--no longer exists. In the past, cases where violence was the reason for the breakdown of a marriage have been considered sympathetically but it was held that domestic violence could not normally override the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
<P>

<a name="90726w17.htm_para2">The probationary period is intended as a safeguard against abuse. If settlement were granted immediately there would be no recourse against applicants who desert their partners as soon as they arrive in the country. The absence of a probationary period would also allow more bogus marriages to escape detection. We, therefore, have no intention of abolishing this requirement of the Rules, which in the generality of cases is the only sensible way to operate a firm but fair immigration control.
<P>

<a name="90726w17.htm_para3">However, we were aware that this policy placed a small minority of individuals in a distressing dilemma in that their insecure immigration status left them feeling "trapped" in a violent marriage. They faced a stark choice between staying within the violent relationship or leaving their sponsor and being refused settlement.
<P>

<a name="90726w17.htm_para4">As I said in my reply to my hon. Friend on 16 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>164-65</i>, the domestic violence concession has been introduced for overseas spouses who wish to remain in the United Kingdom, but who wish to leave their partner because of domestic violence before completion of the 12 month probationary period.

However, the endorsement of passports with summaries of court orders has been considered by the Parent/Carer Child Abduction Co-ordinating Group, which is an inter- departmental group of officials, together with Re-unite. The Group will be looking at the effectiveness of introducing endorsements of the passports of children at risk of abduction.

<a name="90726w18.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There is no legal requirement for the photograph on a child's passport to be updated before the formal renewal of the passport after five years. While the appearance of young children can change rapidly, a photograph provides evidence to an immigration officer of basic characteristics, and only in a minority of cases would a child not be able to be identified. The United Kingdom Passport Agency has issued passports to young children for many years without difficulty prior to the policy change in October 1998 requiring separate passports. An application can be made for an amended passport with a new photograph in at a cost of &#163;11.

<P>
<a name="90726w18.htm_spnew15"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It would not be appropriate to disclose details of the proposals submitted for Private Sector Involvement in the Issue of the British Passport. This information is commercially confidential. The high level criteria applied in awarding the United Kingdom Passport Agency's contract for the passport issuing arrangements were security, continuity of service, compatibility, management information systems, archive system, commercial and technical criteria, examining support/speed/method/customer service, evergreening and cultural compatibility. On the basis of these criteria, contracts were awarded to the supplier who put forward the best solution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w18.htm_spnew16"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The factors that led to the timing of the introduction of the new computer systems in the United Kingdom Passport Agency were the need to modernise existing systems, to enhance the Agency's capacity to prevent passport fraud and improve the security of the British passport, to replace obsolete printing equipment, to provide better customer information and to continue to improve the Agency's efficiency and effectiveness and the need for the introduction of the new system to coincide with its quiet season between October and the end of the year. The new computer systems were introduced at the Agency's request.

<P>
<a name="90726w20.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 For reasons of security, it is not our policy to publish the locations at which firearms are stored. Records of the number and calibre of firearms held by individual schools and of the number of pupils enrolled in the shooting club are not kept centrally. Each school club appoints a responsible adult to take charge of all aspects of shooting at the school. The responsible adult must have personal experience of the weapons used by the school and at least one year's experience of exercising control of the age group of pupils concerned. This adult is issued with a firearm certificate by the police on which the club's guns are entered. Before any school club is granted approval, the police inspect the armoury in which 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jul 1999 : Column: 72</I><P>
the guns will be stored. No club is allowed to hold more guns on the club certificate than can be safely stored in the armoury under secure conditions. Nor are they allowed to possess guns with muzzle energies and velocities greater than those stipulated on the range safety certificate.

 I have no plans to review the powers of the Royal Parks Constabulary in relation to the area and roads surrounding St. James's and Hyde Parks. The Constabulary's primary duty is to maintain order in the Royal Parks and making them safe for park users. If there is a need to apprehend a person beyond the boundary of a Royal Park, they can call upon the Metropolitan Police for assistance. Constitution Hill in the Green Park, Birdcage Walk in St James's Park, and the North, South, West and East Carriage Drives in Hyde Park are already the policing responsibility of the Royal Parks Constabulary.

 The New Millennium Experience Company has sent to schools an Information and Booking form for educational visits to the Dome at Greenwich. The form is available from NMEC's 12 regional offices. The form includes details about the Education Tours scheme through which up to one million free tickets will be available to schools. Each school will be able to apply for up to 100 free tickets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w22.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The British Tourist Authority (BTA) has estimated the number of overseas visits to the UK in 2000 as 27.5 million. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) forecasts 2.4 million overseas visitors to the Dome. The BTA has also indicated that as a direct result of the Millennium Experience an additional &#163;300m-&#163;500m of overseas tourist revenue will be brought into the UK economy. It is conceivable that as a result of the Millennium celebrations this figure could be doubled if the knock-on effect to related industries is taken into account. The BTA has further estimated that 10,000-15,000 new tourism-related jobs will be created. This is excellent news for the whole of the UK.

<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para0">"Our Town Story", sponsored by McDonald's, is linked to the Theatre space and Education Centre at the Dome. It enables more than 20,000 schoolchildren and other members of the community in every education authority and library board area in the UK to stage a performance in the Dome telling the story of their community.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w22.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Government recognise the important significance of the year 2000 as a Christian anniversary, and is keen to see this reflected in the official celebrations. However, we also wish to ensure that celebrations are accessible and relevant to people of all religious persuasions and none. Through the Lambeth Group, my Department, the Millennium Commission and the New Millennium Experience Company are working closely with the Christian churches, ecumenical groups and other faith communities to ensure that the spiritual aspect of the occasion receives proper recognition. We are also working with Church groups in the four nations of the UK to deliver ecumenical Millennium Church Services in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast on Sunday 2 January 2000.

[91376]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w22.htm_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is not responsible for travel arrangements to the Dome for schoolchildren or any other groups. Very few, if any, visitor attractions subsidise or pay for school travel and very few provide significant numbers of free entry tickets for schoolchildren. NMEC is providing up to one million free school tickets under the Education Tour scheme. All schools in the UK can apply for these tickets. NMEC has also worked hard to negotiate deals with travel providers and operators which represent good value for money for visitors to the Dome. NMEC has informed schools about these providers and operators in their area.

 There are up to one million free tickets available to schoolchildren. Final details of allocations, including the ballot arrangements, will be announced in due course. However, the free tickets will be on a pro rata to school population basis. Under the Education Tours Scheme, schools in Scotland will be allocated about 8.5 per cent. of the free tickets. However,

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w22.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The Government fund Sport England to develop programmes in all these areas. On <i>(a)</i>, Sport England believes in lifelong participation in sport, and its Active Communities programme has seen substantial investment in initiatives with particular appeal to older participants, such as capital Lottery funding for walking, keep-fit/yoga, swimming, cycling, golf and bowls. For example, 290 awards have been made to bowls projects, grants of &#163;26 million supporting project costs of &#163;42.5 million. Through the monitoring of completed Lottery projects, Sport England reports that participation among senior citizens at these facilities has doubled.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para1">Sport England also monitors the age structure of the population and its Facilities Planning Model (a mathematical model aimed at assessing the needs for sport and recreational facilities) is used, on a local community and national level, to determine facilities required for each age group, including older people. Through its advice to local authorities Sport England encourages the needs and concerns of older people to be incorporated in Local Sports Strategies and Best Value practices.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para2">Other work in this area includes support for GP referral schemes, working with the health sector to encourage physical activity to maintain good health.

organisations. This decision was based on consultation and feedback from all parts of sport for people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para4">Sport England has overseen the formation of the National Federation of Disability Sport, which brings together all the key disability sports organisations. With the election of a management board and appointment of key staff at both a national and regional level, it is able to ensure that people with disabilities can receive proper sporting opportunities.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para5">As well as its own Disability Advisory Group, Sport England also has a service team of staff with the appropriate skills to co-ordinate and audit the disability work that Sport England is doing across the range of all its service areas, including Lottery programmes. Baselines of sporting provision for people with disabilities in England have been established and research carried out to find out their exact needs.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para6">On <i>(c)</i>, Sport England has made special efforts to tackle the problems that exist in this area, including setting up its own advisory Group and working with the Commission for Racial Equality jointly to appoint two staff to work on anti-racism initiatives with the governing bodies of sport.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para7">Six sports were initially identified as priority areas for work: cricket, basketball, rugby league, rugby union, athletics and swimming. The starting point for each sport is the formulation of a racial equity statement.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para8">Sport England has also given financial support to help develop action plans for sports which seek the elimination of racism.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para9">Sport England has contracted the Office for National Statistics to conduct a survey to measure accurately levels of participation by members of the ethnic minorities. By establishing the sporting needs of the Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities support can be much more effectively tailored.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para10">Sport England has also organised and run generic equity workshops for the governing bodies of sport. This is a structured programme and part of the Running Sport range of education and training support.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para11">In addition, following the publication of the Football Task Force's report "Eliminating Racism from Football", I asked the football authorities to consider how they could implement the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="90726w22.htm_para12">This has been a good start, but I want to ensure that racism is tackled by all sports. To that end I have written to the Governing bodies of cricket, tennis, athletics, rugby union and league asking them how the problems can be addressed within their sports. I hope to meet with those Governing Bodies, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Local Government Association to discuss how we can go about removing racism from sport in the very near future.

<P>

<a name="90726w23.htm_para0">The National Lottery Act 1998 contained a number of measures designed to bring this about. Distributors must now examine the needs of their sectors systematically and draw up strategic plans which reflect those needs and their proposals for addressing them. They have new powers to encourage specific applications where these are not forthcoming spontaneously, to delegate decision-making closer to the grass roots, and to enter into joint schemes. Revised Policy Directions issued to the distributors last year also stressed the need to ensure that all parts of the country have access to Lottery funds.

<a name="90726w23.htm_para4">There is no arbitrary target for reducing the compliance costs of regulation. However, all Departments are required to make an assessment of the risks, costs and benefits of any regulatory proposal that has an impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies before they decide to act. Without an assessment of this kind there can be no collective agreement of a regulatory proposal.

 The wide ranging reforms to the teaching profession set out in our Green Paper "Teachers--meeting the challenge of change" will make teaching more attractive. Over time, it will substantially boost our ability to ensure the supply of high quality teachers we need.
<P>

<a name="90726w23.htm_para7">We are also investing &#163;130 million in shorter term measures, many of which target these shortage subjects. Last October, I announced &#163;5,000 incentives for graduates in maths and science subjects to go into teaching. These have already brought a substantial increase in PGCE applications in those subjects, by 37 per cent. for maths and 33 per cent. for physics. This comes on top of &#163;10 million of financial assistance for trainee teachers in shortage subjects, including maths, physics and technology, and the waiver of PGCE tuition fees. We have also launched a scheme to recruit 600 mature maths and science graduates and match them to vacancies in schools. Other action targeting these subjects includes the high-profile national advertising campaigns of the Teacher Training Agency. They also work closely with higher education institutions and professional subject associations on a range of initiatives to boost recruitment to teaching.

<a name="90726w24.htm_para0">However, officials from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Science and Technology have had several discussions with the New Millennium Experience Company about ideas and source material for exhibits which promote greater public understanding of science, engineering and technology and its key role in shaping the world of the 21st century.

<P>
<a name="90726w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 I understand from the Post Office that it does not use a trawl system for job vacancies. All vacancies filled internally are subject to an open resourcing policy, which enables anyone in any grade in the organisation to apply.

<a name="90726w24.htm_para1">It is Post Office normal practice to charge its constituent businesses, including Parcelforce, interest at a commercial rate on their in-year funding requirements. As Parcelforce is not a legal entity and therefore has no share capital, other loans to Parcelforce from the Post Office Group Centre are treated within the Post Office Group as a surrogate for equity and, as such, do not carry an obligation for interest payments.

 As announced in the White Paper "Post Office Reform: A World Class Service for the 21st Century" published on 8 July, the Government have agreed a strategy for the future of Crown post offices, which reflects proposals put by the Post Office to the trade unions, of retaining a core of directly owned and managed Crown offices at which at least 15 per cent. of the total business transacted by the counters' network will be done. The lifting of the moratorium on the conversion of Crown offices to agency status was announced on 7 December 1998 by the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my right hon.

 Consolidation of the reform package in primary legislation will involve changes to a range of existing powers in order to reflect the new framework which separates Government ownership from Post Office business operations and introduces new, independent regulation. The future of the powers of entry, search and arrest, currently available to the Investigation Branch of the Royal Mail will be considered in this wider context.

 The Government are committed to a transparent regulatory regime. The new postal services Commission will therefore not only have powers to require information, but to publish information for the benefit of consumers and in the interests of good regulation. They will, therefore, have the ability to publish details of internal transfer pricing arrangements. The Government do not propose to require them to do so.

 Post Office privileges which have been granted in the past, including the Post Office's power to acquire land by compulsory purchase in certain circumstances, were provided to facilitate the universal service obligations (USO) placed on the Post Office.

<P>
<a name="90726w24.htm_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The intention of transforming the Post Office into a public limited company is to underline the clear separation of the functions of ownership and management. In particular it will make it absolutely clear that the Directors owe their duties to the company and not directly to the Government as owner. This will reinforce the new arm's length relationship between the Government and the Post Office Board.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures he has implemented to ensure that the transfer of Royal Mail Priority Services to Parcelforce does not result in any monopoly services being delivered by Parcelforce.  [91735]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w24.htm_spnew16"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 No monopoly business is carried by Parcelforce. However, as set out in the White Paper, under the transfer of Priority Services much of the operational activity, at least initially, continues to be carried out by Royal Mail. This raises the possibility of the Post Office monopoly business improperly subsidising wider Parcelforce business in the competitive arena. The Government therefore asked its auditors for the Post Office to look at the business case for the transfer; at the basis on which revenues and costs would be treated under the new arrangements; and, in particular, whether this was on a defensible basis from a competition point of view and with accounting transparency. In the light of the advice from the auditors, the Government have confidence that the arrangements are satisfactory. They will continue to be monitored by the auditors until the Regulator has its own arrangements in place.

<P>
<P>

How the non-monopoly services of the Post Office will account for the cost of capital tied up in its fixed assets, and how such fixed assets will be valued, will be a matter in the first instance for the Board of the Post Office. These accounts will be independently audited and, in due course, will also be subject to scrutiny by the new independent regulator, the Postal Services Commission. All services will be included.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 1999]:</i> As set out in the White Paper on Post Office Reform, the Government believe that there is a genuine need for special services for the blind and has made clear that the Post Office will continue to be obliged to provide them under the reform programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w24.htm_spnew39"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 It will be the responsibility of the Regulator to ensure that any cross-subsidy from the monopoly area to competitive activities is the minimum required, in their opinion, to ensure the continued provision of services required by the universal service obligation at a uniform tariff. It will be for the Regulator to determine the extent to which this is affected, if at all, by plc status.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 1999]:</i> I understand from the Post Office that, as part of the new subpostmasters remuneration system, all sub-post offices receive some level of guaranteed minimum income. The system, which was specifically designed to help support smaller, mainly rural offices, includes a fixed element and an element which varies according to the amount of business a sub-post office handles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w25.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 This is the longest running personal injury action in the UK and the development of an agreed assessment process, which can handle the 77,000 claims received, has inevitably taken some considerable time. However, as soon as agreement in principle on spirometry testing was reached in March we awarded the contract for the programme of spirometry testing throughout Scotland, England and Wales to Healthcall Services Limited. This is principally to help prioritise claims for the full medical assessment process, but will also enable us to extend offers of interim payments to new categories of miners and, in some cases, make full and final offers. Some 3,300 claimants have already been assessed, and we anticipate that the majority of the remaining existing claimants will be completed by the Autumn, with the most elderly being considered first. This should help ensure that those with severe disabilities are invited to be tested at an early stage.

<a name="90726w26.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) has responsibility for regulating premium rate services. ICSTIS enforces an effective Code of Practice which has provisions to ensure that consumers are given adequate information to enable them to take informed decisions about the use of premium rate services. The Code ensures that the costs of calls to premium rate lines used by businesses must be given in advertisements and has provisions limiting the time spent by callers on these services. ICSTIS and Oftel are planning to review the regulatory framework for premium rate services later this year to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from the right level of protection.

[92314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w26.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Details of regulations which impose compliance costs on business are published in the Department's regulatory impact assessments copies of which are placed in the Libraries of both Houses. A summary of all regulatory impact assessments published by the Department and the other regulatory Departments in Whitehall are published every six months by way of Command Paper, and are available on a monthly basis on the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit's website. Where appropriate, regulatory impact assessments also contain information on how a regulation will be monitored.
<P>

<a name="90726w26.htm_para10">The Department published details on its regulatory activity in its Departmental Expenditure Plans Report (Cm. 4211). Recent examples of measures already taken or planned to reduce burdens on business include:

<a name="90726w26.htm_para15">Although there is no arbitrary target for reducing the compliance costs of regulation we are committed to minimising the burden of regulation on business. In addition all Departments are required to make an assessment of the risks, costs and benefits of any regulatory proposal which has an impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies before they decide to act. Without an assessment of this kind there can be no collective agreement to a regulatory proposal.

 We have not issued any new instructions regarding counting money in claimants' current accounts as capital for the purpose of determining entitlement to Housing Benefit. The policy remains that all holdings with a clear monetary value are treated as a claimant's capital. This includes the amount held in their current account after offsetting any amounts of income paid into the account used in the assessment of Housing Benefit entitlement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what recent studies have been commissioned by the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board relating to the needs of severely and profoundly deaf people; and what recommendations from those studies his Department has acted on.  [92562]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w27.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board (DLAAB) is an advisory body and does not itself commission work. However, in 1998 the Board was commissioned by the Department of Social Security to undertake a study on deafness in children and young adults. This work will be completed shortly.
<P>

<a name="90726w27.htm_para1">In addition, the Department more recently commissioned the Board to undertake a study of deaf- blind people who had claimed DLA. The Department is currently acting on certain findings arising from this work, in particular recommendations on improving evidence gathering on claims from deaf-blind people and on the need to increase the understanding of the problems arising from the combination of deafness and blindness amongst those responsible for administrating Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what was the level of spending on social security in Scotland in each of the last five years <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> as a percentage of the United Kingdom total broken down to show spending on (i) benefit payments, (ii) Scotland's pro-rata share of United Kingdom administration costs and (iii) actual spending on central and local administration and the branch network for facilities in Scotland.

<P>
<a name="90726w27.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 DSS accounts for its administrative costs operationally (by Agency and Business Unit). It does not maintain accounting records by geographical territory and it is therefore not possible to provide reliable expenditure information covering all Departmental operations in the format requested. An estimate of Social Security Benefit Expenditure in Scotland in the past five years can be found in the table.

<P>
<a name="90726w28.htm_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The New Deal for Lone Parents provides practical help and advice for lone parents on Income Support who want to make the move into work. Since it was launched, the service has helped over 16,500 lone parents into work.
<P>

<a name="90726w28.htm_para1">In addition, a range of new measures will mean that lone parents will be even better off in work. Key initiatives include; the National Minimum Wage; the new 10p starting rate of income tax, from which people on low incomes gain up to &#163;2.88 a week; and the Working Families Tax Credit which, from October, will guarantee a minimum income of &#163;200 a week for every family in full-time work.
<P>

<a name="90726w28.htm_para2">Analysis of benefit administration data for a sample of around 300 lone parents who moved into work and on to Family Credit following participation in the New Deal for Lone Parents as at March 1998 showed that they were, on average, &#163;40 a week better off.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Delivery of the payments was broadly similar to the previous winter and about 10 million payments were automatically issued last winter to eligible customers. This figure does not include those customers who were identified as entitled to a WFP at a later date because of a retrospective award of a qualifying benefit or those whose benefits were maintained clerically.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Approximately 1.4 million &#163;50 payments were issued automatically to pensioners receiving Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) by the end of November 1998. A further 8.6 million &#163;20 or &#163;10 payments were issued to other eligible pensioners by the end of January 1999. Around 3.4 million of the &#163;20 or &#163;10 payments were issued via Automated Credit Transfer to the customer's bank account, 5.2 million were

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>BA records indicate that payments have been issued to all customers where the information held suggested entitlement. BA offices will investigate claims from customers who may have expected a payment, but did not receive one, if they contact the office which normally deals with their pension or benefit.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Approximately 113,000 of the payments issued to Post Offices were returned to BA offices without being cashed.

 Information is not available in the format requested. State Retirement Pensions are paid to individuals. Category A pension is payable on a person's own contribution record and Category B pension is paid to a married woman (or a widow) on her husband's insurance record. It is not possible to identify someone's marital status from the category of pension. Such information as is available is in the table.

<a name="90726w29.htm_para0">The overall reduction in the proportion of ethnic minority appointments made to this Department's public bodies has been caused by the fact that there have been no new non-judicial appointments to the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS). This is because ITS is to be replaced by The Appeals Service, which will only comprise of judicial appointees, on 1 April 1999. Non- judicial ITS appointments currently make up 69 per cent. of all this Department's public appointments. While effort is made to ensure social diversity on our remaining public bodies, the constitution of these bodies restricts the pool from which suitable candidates can be sought. For example, legislation governing war pensions committees stipulates that members should be drawn from ex-service organisations.We have two overall commitments for equal opportunities and public appointments:

After lengthy consultation with Trade Union Side, the CA gave notice in August 1997 that with effect from 31 July 1998 the normal retirement age for all staff would be 60. As a transitional measure, people could be retained for up to 12 months, but not beyond age 62 for people at pay bands B2 and B3 (equivalent to Executive Officer level); and not beyond age 65 for people in pay bands up to and including B1 (equivalent to Administrative Officer level).

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what are the target levels for the present financial year for the detection of alcohol and tobacco fraud and smuggling; and what progress has been made in achieving these target levels in the first three months of the current financial year.  [92766]<P>

<P>
<a name="90726w30.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Customs targets for the detection of alcohol and tobacco smuggling and fraud for the present financial year are:
<P>

<a name="90726w30.htm_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to detect alcohol and tobacco fraud and smuggling to the revenue value of &#163;307 million, and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90726w30.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to disrupt or dismantle 25 major excise smuggling organisations.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90726w30.htm_para3">Data in respect of our performance against these targets during the first three months of the year (April-June) are still being collated and validated. However, the emerging results are encouraging and, if this pattern continues, Customs consider they are on course to achieve the targets by the end of 1999-2000.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what <i>(a)</i> fines, <i>(b)</i> charges and <i>(c)</i> convictions have resulted each year since 1 January 1990 from the (i) detection of fraud and (ii) detection of misdeclaration of goods on (1) cigarettes, (2) hand rolling tobacco, (3) cigars, (4) spirits, (5) cider, (6) fortified wines, (7) wine and (8) beer entering the United Kingdom.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what measures are <i>(a)</i> in place and <i>(b)</i> planned to prevent the purchase of non-duty paid excise goods through the internet.  [92767]<P>

<P>
<a name="90726w30.htm_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise are aware of the risks from this form of smuggling. Staff at postal and courier depots have been alerted and Customs are looking separately at the wider issues involved.

<a name="90726w30.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list those proposals for private finance initiatives for each department of state made since 1 May 1997, stating for each the proposed <i>(a)</i> contribution from private finance and <i>(b)</i> date of commencement; and if he will list in each case whether the sums involved count against the ceilings for public investment set by the Treaty of Maastricht.  [92771]<P>

<a name="90726w30.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Table 1 gives the details underpinning Table B16 of 1999 FSBR covering PFI/PPP projects signed from 1 May 1997 to 1 April 1999. Under PFI, the public sector contracts for services not assets, and capital investment is only one of the activities undertaken by the private sector in order to supply these services. The figures in Table 1 therefore do not reflect the total value of these contracts, but do reflect Treasury estimates of capital expenditure by the private sector.
<P>

<a name="90726w30.htm_para4"><i>(b)</i> Table 2 shows a list and start dates of those projects which the Treasury has been informed are operational.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 19 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>859-60</i>, if he is able to estimate the increased revenue to the Treasury as a result of the abolition of duty free shopping for this financial year and the next.  [93160]<P>

<a name="90726w31.htm_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 We have estimated that the abolition of duty free sales within Europe could yield &#163;120 million in revenue receipts in a full year, but this does depend entirely on how the companies providing the services seize on the new commercial opportunities that are now open to them. This estimate will be kept under review as further information on the marketing strategies of the operators becomes available.

<a name="90726w31.htm_para2">There is no arbitrary target for reducing the compliance cost of regulation. However, all Departments are required to make an assessment of the risks, costs and benefits of any regulatory proposal that has an impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies before they decide to act. Without an assessment of this kind, there can be no collective agreement of a regulatory proposal.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question on the definition of unemployment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS measure of unemployment, derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. The LFS has used the ILO definition since 1984. Prior to this a slightly different definition was used. This included people who were without a paid job who were looking for work in the reference week, or prevented from seeking work by temporary sickness or holiday, or were waiting to start a job they had already obtained or were waiting for the results of a job application. Full-time students who were seeking work but who were not available to start work in the next two weeks because they had to complete their education were excluded. The definition was used from spring 1979 to spring 1983.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Labour Force Survey measure of unemployment has been compiled and published on the same definition since 1984 (annually 1984-1991; quarterly 1992 to March 1998) and a monthly moving average of each three month period from April 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS also published the monthly numbers of people who are claiming unemployment related benefits, also known as the Claimant Count. There have been nine changes affecting the coverage of the monthly claimant count since 1979 which have been significant enough to warrant a recasting of the consistent seasonally adjusted series. Further details of these discontinuities are given in the November 1995 edition of <i>Labour Market Trends</i>, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many appointments to public bodies were made by his Department in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99, broken down by (i) gender and (ii) ethnicity; and if he will make a statement.  [92513]<P>

<a name="90726w33.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government announced in their publication "Quangos--Opening up Public Appointments 1999-2002" (copies deposited in the Libraries of both Houses) their commitment to the equal representation of women and men in public appointments and a pro rata representation of members of ethnic minority groups. In moving towards achieving these commitments, the Chancellor's departments have set an ambitious overall goal that women should form a minimum of 40 per cent. of appointments to Chancellor's Departments' Public Bodies by 2003 (or for small bodies that at least one appointment should be held by a woman). There is also a goal that each of the Chancellor's Departments' Public Bodies should include at least one appointment from a member of the ethnic minorities by 2003 and that ethnic minorities should account for a minimum of 4 per cent. of appointments to larger bodies. The following table gives details of appointments made to NDPB's of the Chancellor's departments and agencies over the periods requested. Information on the number of appointments by both gender and ethnic origin cannot be provided since the number of new appointments in each category is less than five.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what assessment he has made of the benefits of requiring the carrying of smartcards by persons seeking access to Government services.  [91718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90726w33.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 There is no intention that people should be obliged to carry smartcards to obtain general access to public services. However, the experience of the private sector shows that smartcards can be popular and effective. The Government is interested in the benefits which smartcards can offer both for secure authentication and the enhancement of privacy.

With the Parliamentary Secretary, I have recently met with representatives of the Small Abattoir Federation (SAFe) and the Country Landowners Association (CLA), and with my right hon.

 The EC legislation currently specifies that the advance of the beef special premium is at 60 per cent. of the total payment. Although increases in the advance have been authorised in the past there has been no proposal to date from the Commission to increase the rate this year.

 In certain circumstances, Article 30 (<i>ex</i> Article 36) of the Treaty allows the maintenance of restrictions on the free movement of goods where these can be justified for the protection of the health and life of humans or animals or on the grounds of public morality or policy. However, it is clear from Rulings by the European Court of Justice that we cannot use Article 30 to impose higher UK standards on imports where EU law has been harmonised as it has been in the case of both pigmeat and farm animal welfare.

In line with the priorities that I set out last October, the Agency has received an independent report on its management structures and skills base and the recommendations will be implemented by next April. An elaboration of the Environment Agency's flood defence supervisory duty was published in May, along with interim high level targets for the Agency and other flood and coastal defence operating authorities. The Agency is now working with others to ensure that flood and coastal defences are identified and inspected; the results recorded and assessed; and appropriate action to remedy defects put in hand. Consultation on further development of high level targets and the supervisory duty is in hand.
<P>

<a name="90726w35.htm_para2">The Agency has reported that indicative maps of floodplains have been produced ahead of the September target, and are currently being distributed to local authorities for use in both development control and emergency planning. These maps are being used to review the Agency's database of properties at risk of flooding. Further work has been done on flood warning, with an extension to the number of properties now able to receive direct Automatic Voice Messages through the telephone system. Flood warning messages have been reviewed and a new system to replace the present colour-coded warnings is planned from September 2000. The Agency is embarking on a significant programme of work, both internally and with partners such as local authorities and the emergency services, to ensure that the necessary preparations are made. I have agreed with the Agency that it is important to ensure that these arrangements are introduced successfully and are coupled with a campaign to increase public awareness.
