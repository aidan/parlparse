 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take steps to ensure that under the proposed EU directive 2004/28/EC on Veterinary Medicines <i>(a)</i> medicines available to beekeepers for the treatment of pests and diseases will be exempt from the regulations set out and will not require a prescription and <i>(b)</i> the proposed inspectors will be qualified experts who provide and use antibiotics in the treatment of disease and not veterinary surgeons who have no training in bee health.  [221410]</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50324w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The amending directive, 2004/28/EC, was published by the European Commission on 30 April 2004 following a major review of EU medicines legislation. Member states are required to implement its provisions by 30 October 2005. It includes a provision requiring all medicines for food-producing animals, including bees, to be available only on veterinary prescription.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">This provision was introduced with the intention of strengthening the control of these medicines and related consumer safeguards. While there are valid reasons for restricting some veterinary medicines to prescription supply, we do not consider this appropriate for all medicines for use in food-producing animals. Neither the Commission, nor the majority of member states supported the UK view and the requirement was consequently included in the amending directive.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Mar 2005 : Column 925W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para4">
However, the UK successfully negotiated the inclusion of a provision that allows medicines that meet certain criteria, to be agreed subsequently, to be exempt from the prescription requirement. This provision also allows the current distribution arrangements to remain until a list of exemption criteria is agreed, or until January 2007 if no list has been agreed by then. The exemption list is to be proposed by the Commission and voted on by the member states. We are well aware of concerns expressed by UK beekeepers and will continue to argue strongly for medicines for routine use in bees that do not meet any of the other criteria for prescription only status to be included on the list.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_20">In addition to pressing for routine bee medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement, we have proposed new distribution categories for the UK that include tiered categories of prescription only medicines. If adopted, these will comply with the directive&#039;s provisions while allowing most medicines for food-producing animals that are currently available without prescription to be supplied by pharmacists or suitably qualified persons without the need to involve a veterinary surgeon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_21">Antimicrobial resistance is a serious problem in human medicine resulting in increasing concerns about the use of antimicrobial products, including antibiotics, in human medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture and horticulture. It is therefore likely that any veterinary medicines containing antibiotics will be under veterinary control. There is one antibiotic authorised for use in bees, for the treatment of Nosema. Officials at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate will be discussing how this antibiotic is to be supplied with beekeeper representatives.

<a name="stpa_22">A survey carried out by SWM for the extension of the landfill demonstrated that the geology beneath the site is primarily sandstone, which contains a major aquifer. Environment Agency guidance, based on the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive, precludes the authorisation of any new landfill sites located on major aquifers unless substantial low permeable barriers such as certain types of clay protect them. This does not exist at Betton Abbots and as a consequence SWM have withdrawn their permit application.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50324w03.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The provisional total of 736 million tonnes included in the UK&#039;s National Allocation Plan was calculated by estimating the projected emissions from the sectors covered by the EU ETS and subtracting the additional savings of 5.5 MtCO <sub>2</sub>  which the Government decided the EU ETS would deliver. This calculation was based on provisional emission projections and this was made clear when submitting the UK&#039;s National Allocation Plan (NAP) to the European Commission in April 2004.

<a name="50324w03.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_24">Following the finalisation of emissions projections and Climate Change Agreement targets UK emissions for the period 2005&#150;07 are now estimated to be around 56 MtCO <sub>2</sub>  higher than in April last year. These latest projections are more consistent with recent historic emissions levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_25">Rather than increase the total by that amount, the UK proposed to increase the total number of allowances by around 20 million to 756 million, which ensures that the UK strikes a balance between the concerns of business about potential competitiveness impacts and the UK&#039;s leadership on climate change. However, the Commission has made it clear that it does not consider that the provisional total of 736 million allowances can be exceeded and is not prepared to consider any increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_26">On 11 March the Government announced their intention to issue allowances in line with the NAP approved by the Commission (736 million) as soon as possible to allow operators to fully participate in the EU ETS, while initiating legal proceedings against the Commission, seeking to require the Commission to consider the substance of the amendment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w03.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_27">In accordance with earlier announcements, the additional reduction will be taken from the electricity supply industry. As this industry is more insulated from international competition than others, this approach will have less of an impact on UK competitiveness than reducing the allocation to other industries. The Government do not expect this approach will have a material impact on electricity prices which will reflect the price of allowances in the EU-wide market, rather than the number of allowances allocated free to generators. In the event of a successful challenge, the additional allowances would be distributed between the installations in the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) sector.

In addition there will be on-site surveys to establish a more in-depth profile of visitors and visitor behaviour on access land and an on-line (website) survey of access land users seeking to establish qualitative data on views, perceptions and levels of public satisfaction in relation to access land. The Agency&#039;s monitoring programme will include a land manager survey to assess the impact of the new rights of access on land managers and also a nature conservation monitoring element through an extension to the Breeding Bird Survey, operated by the British Trust for Ornithology.

This assessment will be possible once a full year of data is available to compare against the visits recorded by the Great Britain Day Visit Survey 2002&#150;03.

 The Rural Payments Agency has announced that it expects to begin payments under the single payment scheme in February 2006, well before the deadline of 30 June 2006 set in EU legislation. To the extent that farmers have made plans based on receiving a payment earlier, they may face cash-flow problems. Whether that happens in practice depends very much on the individual circumstances of the farm business rather than its size.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what criteria were used to define severely disadvantaged areas; and for what reason the Moorland Line was not used in determining areas eligible for the lower rate of the single farm payment.  [222463]</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="50324w05.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The severely disadvantaged areas (SDAs) form part of the less favoured areas (LFAs) of the UK as listed in EU Council Directive 84/169/EEC. The LFAs are further divided for domestic purposes between SDAs and disadvantaged areas (DAs), the distinction being one of degree, most significantly of land quality. Upland SDAs are disadvantaged relative to non-SDA land in respect of a number of handicaps. These include higher altitude, harsher climate with a shorter growing season, low soil fertility, difficult topography, and remoteness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w05.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_47">Both the SDAs and the Moorland Line have been taken into account in establishing English areas for the purpose of the single payment scheme (SPS.) In view of the considerable redistributional effects that would flow from a single flat rate payment under the SPS, it was initially concluded that England would be divided into two areas, SDAs and other land. However, following representations from a number of key stakeholders (including the NFU and the CLA) this has been amended so that the area boundaries that will apply in England divide the country into three, broadly corresponding to land types and still using existing boundaries. One area comprises the upland severely disadvantaged area (SDA), another the Moorland Line within the SDA and the third area will be all land outside the SDA.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether Denmark&#039;s inclusion of social criteria in its policy for timber procurement complies with the requirements of the European Forestry Certification Scheme; and if she will make a statement on the implications for inclusion of social criteria in UK policy.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50324w06.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK Government accept that social criteria are complementary to environmental and economic criteria in the context of sustainable forest management and that international guidelines, including the Pan European Operational Level Guidelines, recognise this principle. The UK Government timber procurement policy has been devised so that one outcome will be the enhancement of forest dependent peoples&#039; well being through an increase in the amount of legal timber and timber from well managed forests being supplied.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_49">European procurement directives require public sector contracting authorities to limit their contract specifications to criteria that are relevant to the product or service being purchased. The UK Government believe that forest dependent people play a part in sustaining forest health and vitality. However, as far as the procurement directives are concerned, their well being does not appear to be sufficiently relevant to the subject matter of contracts to warrant inclusion as contract specification criteria. The UK&#039;s interpretation of the directives is based on legal advice and on advice from officials responsible for procurement policy. It would appear that a different view is taken by Denmark. However, if it were ever to be established beyond reasonable doubt that the well being of forest dependent people could feasibly be included as a requirement in public sector contracts, then the UK Government would reconsider its position.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take steps to ensure that increases in water charges are used to <i>(a)</i> improve (i) reliability of supply and (ii) water quality and <i>(b)</i> reduce (A) sewer flooding and (B) pesticide run-off.

 Water companies may increase their charges only within the price limits set by Ofwat. Ofwat&#039;s approach to setting price limits is to allow no more than is necessary for efficient companies to finance their functions. In co-operation with the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, Ofwat monitor companies&#039; delivery of their functions and levels of service and takes regulatory action where their performance falls short.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_54">In the period covered by new price limits, 2005 to 2010, companies will be undertaking a range of measures in order to meet their water supply duties. Companies will, for example, take measures to increase the security of supply where supply is most at risk, including measures to reduce leakage. They will be making improvements to water treatment works to continue to meet the standards of drinking water quality, as well as improving the taste, colour and odour of drinking water in areas where this has been an issue of local concern. They are also expected to reduce the number of homes at risk from sewer flooding so that by 2010 no more than 0.01 per cent. of properties will be at risk of internal flooding from overloaded sewers at least once every 10 years.

 The FSA is responsible for setting standards about the quality of advice on investment products. It indicated in its consultation paper 04/11, published in June 2004, that it did not intend to extend the particular suitability test that currently applies to the sale of stakeholder pensions&#151;known as &#039;RU64&#039;&#151;to the wider suite of stakeholder products that will be launched in April 2005. The FSA has confirmed to me that this position has not changed since the publication of that paper.

Officials meet with representatives of industry, consumer groups and the FSA from time to time to discuss a variety of issues regarding financial services.

 Government planning policies on parking are laid down in Planning Policy Guidance note (PPG) 13 Transport. We want to promote accessibility, the use of public transport, walking and cycling and to reduce the need to travel, especially by private car. The availability of parking is an important factor in people&#039;s transport choices, so we encourage local authorities to develop and implement policies on parking that, as part of a package of planning and transport measures, ensure levels of parking provided in association with development will promote sustainable transport choices. There should be no minimum standards for development, other than parking for disabled people, and policies in development plans should set maximum levels of parking for broad classes of development.

All allegations of assault or inappropriate use of force, which includes incorrect handcuffing, are also referred to the police as the appropriate authority to investigate such matters.

Once he has reported back and made recommendations we will be able to consider any implications for the remainder of the detention estate.

 Prison Service Order 4630 issued in September 2004 makes it a mandatory requirement for all prisons to notify the Immigration and Nationality Department Criminal Casework Team of all foreign nationals sentenced to a term of imprisonment in order to determine their liability to deportation.

<a name="stpa_107">Those who are convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment are liable to deportation, either if the court makes such a recommendation or if the Secretary of State considers their presence is no longer conducive to the public good. Each case is examined on its merits taking into consider a person&#039;s age, length of residency, conduct, ties to the United Kingdom, compassionate circumstances and representations before taking a decision whether to make a deportation order.

<p>
<a name="50324w14.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_108">Deportation proceedings are normally initiated 12 months before the earliest point of release, but there is a right of appeal, which will inevitably delay the case. However, where a prisoner waives the right of appeal or the appeal is dismissed, the early removal scheme introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for removal up to 135 days in advance of the conditional release or parole eligibility date, with the exception of a small number of prisoners whose offence is listed in appendix 4 to Prison Service Order 6000.

 Drug testing on arrest is a provision within the Drugs Bill currently before Parliament. The provision builds upon the existing drug testing on charge scheme and will mean that persons who are in police detention having been arrested for a trigger offence (or an offence to which an inspector has reasonable grounds for suspecting that misuse of a specified Class A drug contributed), may be tested earlier than at present. The Drugs Bill also contains provision for those who test positive to be required to attend an assessment of their drug use and related issues. Assessment in this context has previously been voluntary on the part of the arrestee.

We, along with France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, believe that the priorities of an enlarged Union can be met within a budget of 1 per cent. EU GNI. This is sufficient to meet the challenge of cohesion provided that resources are focused on priorities&#151;namely the poorest member states.

The elections should not be seen in isolation, but in the context of the political climate that had prevailed since the 2002 presidential elections.

I decided, following advice from officials, to visit the latter as it was easy to slot into my programme and because it is the home city of the Chief Minister of Punjab province, Pervaiz Ellahi.

 India&#039;s assistance is more immediately critical than the UK&#039;s as they provide lethal hardware. The UK&#039;s support has been non-lethal and focused on improving general professionalism and intelligence capabilities. However, given the topography of Nepal and the capabilities of the security forces and the Maoists, it does not appear that either side can win the conflict militarily. A negotiated political settlement involving all the constitutional forces offers the best way to resolve the conflict in Nepal and to create a stable democracy with good governance and respect for human rights. We assess that by taking power the King has undermined democracy, increased the risk of instability and that this is likely to lead to intensified conflict. The UK&#039;s military support has been predicated on multi-party democracy and the preservation of democratic freedoms. We are considering with international partners what our longer term policy should be in the new political context.

Following contact with the relevant electoral registration officers, the commission has advised me that while the current percentage of voters registered for postal votes in Stevenage is indeed around 50 per cent., the correct figures for Newcastle and Cardiff are around 41 per cent. and 14 per cent. respectively. Although the general point that I was illustrating with these figures&#151;that postal voting is now very widespread&#151;remains valid, I regret that the incorrect information I had been given led me to give the House an inaccurate picture of the current position in Newcastle and Cardiff.

<sup>(22)</sup> The total expenditure on education in schools and LEAs is drawn from the net current expenditure column of the total education spending line. This includes expenditure on schools, education out of schools, continuing education, youth and community and also central LEA management and support. However excluded from the total expenditure is any capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). HE expenditure is not allocated on an LEA basis and instead is largely funded by Government with the money allocated annually, to individual universities through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Similarly, the Department does not collect information on the level of funding per student in FE at a local or regional level and therefore we are unable to identify the per capita cost in respect of HE and FE provision for Wirral and Cheshire LEAs and as such it has been excluded.<br>





<sup>(23)</sup> The expenditure data for 1997&#150;98 are drawn from the annual &#039;RO1&#039; spending returns which local authorities submitted to the ODPM. Figures for 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;04 are drawn from Section 52 outturn statements which LEAs submitted to the DfES.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup> In order to provide a per capita figure for expenditure on education we have divided each LEA&#039;s net current education expenditure figure by the total population aged between three and 19 (inclusive) within that authority. The population figures are estimated resident mid year population figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and these have recently been revised following the 2001 Census. Thus for financial year 1997&#150;98 we have used the population estimate from mid year 1997 and for 2001&#150;02 we used the mid 2001 estimate (and so on).<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Cheshire LEA was split into Cheshire LEA, Halton LEA and Warrington LEA. As a result, 1997&#150;98 data is for pre-LGR Cheshire LEA and data for subsequent years is for the part of pre-LGR Cheshire now known as Cheshire LEA and is not therefore comparable with the 1997&#150;98 figure. This break in the time series is shown by the blank row.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 as reported by the LEA.<br>

This single grant would remain separate from schools core funding, which will continue to be routed through local authorities&#039; school budget formulae.

Notes:<br>

1. The figures quoted are as at 1 January 2005 and are for UK Regular Trained Army soldiers only and therefore exclude TA, Mobilised Reserves, Full-Time Reserve Service, Gurkhas and Home Service Battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment.<br>

2. The strength figures do not include soldiers in the Parachute Regiment that are serving outside the battalion, or personnel from other cap badges that are attached to the battalion.<br>

3. In addition to the figures there are 15 Parachute Regiment soldiers serving outside the battalions whose nationality is not British.<br>

4. We cannot be precise about the strength in each battalion as the means by which these data are collected does not allow for separate attribution. The split is derived from an estimate based on the strength by Unit Identity Number.<br>

5. All figures have been rounded to the nearest five. Totals are rounded separately and therefore may not equal the sum of their parts.<br>

1. All figures have been rounded to the nearest million pounds.<br>

2. Incapacity benefit includes expenditure on working age claimants of incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance and income support (long-term sick/disabled and short-term sick). The figure includes a small number of people who are not claiming incapacity benefit (payment or credits) or severe disablement allowance.<br>

3. State pensions expenditure includes basic state pension, additional state pension, non-contributory state pension and graduated retirement benefit.<br>

4. Pension credit expenditure includes both the guarantee credit and the savings credit.<br>

5. Winter fuel expenditure includes the basic winter fuel payment and the over 80s payment, which was introduced in 2003&#150;04.<br>

6. Figures are consistent with the pre-budget report 2004 and with expenditure information published on the internet at http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp (tables 1, 3 and 7). These tables will shortly be updated with budget 2005 figures.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. All expenditure figures have been rounded to the nearest million pounds. Expenditure recorded on the department&#039;s accounting systems has been apportioned between males and females using a 5 per cent. sample of administrative records.<br>

2. All caseload figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand, and are based on a 5 per cent. sample of administrative records.<br>

3. A basic state tension is paid to those who fully or partially satisfy the contribution conditions for a category A or category B basic state pension.<br>

4. Category D retirement pensions are not included in the figures.<br>

5. The SERFS (state earnings-related pension scheme) figure also includes amounts for state second pension and graduated retirement benefit.<br>

6. Basic state pension and SERPS expenditure includes pensions paid to people living overseas.<br>

7. Pension credit expenditure includes both the guarantee credit and the savings credit. As pension credit was only introduced on 6 October 2003, the 2003&#150;04 expenditure quoted relates only to half a year.<br>

8. Figures are consistent with the Pre-Budget Report 2004 and with expenditure information published on the Internet at http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp (table 3). These tables will shortly be updated with Budget 2005 figures.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. All figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds.<br>

2. Expenditure for basic state pension and pension credit has been apportioned using 2004&#150;05 Quarterly Statistical Inquiry data.<br>

3. Figures for expenditure on basic state pension exclude people receiving Category C or Category D pension only, additional state pension only or graduated retirement benefit only.<br>

4. Pension credit expenditure includes both the guarantee credit and the savings credit.<br>

5. 2004&#150;05 Quarterly Statistical Inquiry data is not yet available for winter fuel, council tax &#163;100 payments or free television licence expenditure. Therefore, 2003&#150;04 data has been used. It has been assumed that the City of York&#039;s proportion of the Great Britain total (United Kingdom in the case of free television licence expenditure) would be very similar in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05.<br>

6. Winter fuel expenditure includes the basic winter fuel payment and the Over 80s payment, which was introduced in 2003&#150;04.<br>

7. Council tax &#163;100 payments has been interpreted to mean the over 70s payment introduced in 2004&#150;05.<br>

8. Free television licence expenditure data is not available at a local level within the Department. The expenditure has been estimated using the number of households where there is one or more people aged 75 or over, according to the Department&#039;s winter fuel payments database, and the estimated cost of free television licences in 2004&#150;05.<br>

9. Figures are consistent with the pre-budget report 2004 and with expenditure information published on the internet at http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp (table3). These tables will shortly be updated with budget 2005 figures.<br>

Expenditure is based on departmental forecasts underpinning the pre-budget report and has been apportioned using Quarterly Statistical Inquiry data, from 2003&#150;04 or 2004&#150;05, for the relevant benefits. The data is based on a 5 per cent. sample, and therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation, with the exception of winter fuel, council tax &#163;100 payments and free television licence expenditure which have been calculated from 100 per cent. samples.<br>

<sup>(43)</sup> Provisional data.<br>

<sup>(44)</sup> This figure is used to allow for a more accurate comparison with previous years. As explained in: Bridging exercise comparing drug misuse treatment data 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04&quot;, available at http://www.nta.nhs.uk, the method of measuring contact with drug treatment services has been changed and the definition tightened since data was collected in 2002&#150;03. Based on the new methodology introduced in 2003&#150;04, the total number of people actually recorded as being in contact with structured drug treatment in 2003&#150;04 was 125,913. This figure is the total number of individuals whose treatment falls within the definition of structured drug treatment as defined by NTA&#039;s Models of Care as treatment following assessment and delivered according to a care plan, with clear goals, which is regularly reviewed with the client.&quot; This figure is used to produce the percentage data.<br>

In part, this is the result of advances in maternal and neonatal care which save premature babies who would not have survived in the past. There are also a number of avoidable causal factors associated with low birth-weight, which we are addressing through a range of initiatives to promote access to wholesome nutrition, enhanced health care prior to and during pregnancy and the adoption of healthier lifestyle choices.

<p><a name="st_348"><a name="50324w42.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 March 2005]:</i> The Payment by results market forces factor (MFF) used in 2004&#150;05 was updated for 2005&#150;06 to take account of the most recently available data on earnings, expenditure, land values and building costs. Following advice to Ministers from the independent Advisory Committee on resource allocation, we also made a change to the methodology to make it more sensitive to cost pressures within individual primary care trust areas, rather than the larger areas previously used. Full details are available on the Department&#039;s website at: www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/02/99/04100299.pdf.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w42.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_362">In 2004&#150;05, the MFF was a determinant of the prices paid by primary care trusts (PCTs) to national health service trusts for only 48 groups of procedures (known as healthcare resource groups). In 2005&#150;06, the scope of payment by results will be increasing to cover the whole of elective in-patient care for NHS trusts. PCTs will pay the same national tariff to any trust with which they commission, and an allocation for the MFF for elective care will be made to providers directly from the centre. 2005&#150;06 will be the first year in which such allocations will be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w42.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_363">The Department provided details of the 2005&#150;06 MFF allocations to the NHS on 21 February 2005. There are three reasons why Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre hospital NHS trust (Blackpool) would have a different MFF allocation to Lancashire teaching hospitals NHS trust (Preston): differences in their volume of elective activity (more activity requires more funding); differences in the case mix of that activity (more complex activity requires more funding), and differences in the MFF itself (trusts located in more expensive areas require more funding). The 2005&#150;06 MFF for Lancashire teaching is 1.1 per cent., higher than for Blackpool largely because the MFF allows for higher general wage pressures in Preston.

<i>[holding answer 10 March 2005]:</i> From 1 April 2004, responsibility for funding the bursaries for nurses returning to work in the national health service has been devolved to primary care trusts.

Furthermore, we are allocating historic levels of funding to PCTs to ensure the NHS secures the workforce necessary to deliver improved services. For the three-year revenue allocations to cover 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, PCTs received an average cash increase of 9.22 per cent., 9.55 per cent. and 9.32 per cent. This is an average over the three years of 30.83 per cent.

Detailed and specific information on people receiving kidney dialysis broken down into age groups is not yet available. However, the 2002 survey showed that 27 per cent. of adult patients on renal replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation) were aged 18&#150;44, 39 per cent. were aged 45&#150;64 and 34 per cent. were aged 65 or older.

This does not reflect the full increase in capacity, as additional facilities were also put into existing units; the total number of haemodialysis stations in England rose from 1,890 in 1998 to 2,582 in 2002.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has not made any recommendations on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50324w45.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_374">Based on the work of its expert working group on the safety of SSRIs, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) issued advice on the use of SSRIs in the paediatric population in June, September and December 2003. That advice was that the balance of risks and benefits for the treatment of depressive illness in under 18s is judged to be unfavourable for paroxetine (Seroxat), venlafaxine (Efexor), sertraline (Lustral), citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex) and mirtazapine (Zispin). It is not possible to assess the balance of risks and benefits for fluvoxamine (Faverin,) due to the absence of paediatric clinical trial data. Only fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating depressive illness in children and adolescents, although it is possible that, in common with the other SSRIs, it is associated with a small increased risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Overall, the balance of risks and benefits for fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive illness in under 18s is judged to be favourable.
