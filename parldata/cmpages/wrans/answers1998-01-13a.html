 The procurement of food for the Armed Forces is contracted to Booker Foodservice which took over the contract from NAAFI on 1 October 1997. The Ministry of Defence does not specify the source from which Booker Foodservice should obtain meat, but expects it to seek the best market prices for these and all other products. It is required to give full consideration to British products. Booker Foodservice has advised the following estimate for the breakdown of country of origin for meat purchased for the Armed Forces, based on value, for the 12-month period ending September 1998:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to review and update the waste management policies set out in the 1995 White Paper "Making Waste Work: A Strategy for Sustainable Waste Management in England and Wales". [23176]

<P>
<a name="80113w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Reducing the waste we generate, making better use of waste, and ensuring that the remainder is disposed of safely, are all critical components of a more sustainable society. The Government set a high priority on improving our waste management. That is why I am announcing today the preparation of a new waste strategy for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="80113w01.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I have asked officials, working with the Environment Agency and other interested parties, to begin preparation of the new strategy which will fulfil the requirements of the Environment Act 1995. The first step towards this goal will be a wide public consultation beginning in the Spring of this year, leading to publication of a White Paper in 1999.
<P>

<a name="80113w01.html_para3">The 1995 White Paper "Making Waste Work" set out the previous Government's policy framework for the management of waste, identified ways in which waste could be managed in a more sustainable way and set a number of targets for achieving that aim. It recognised the principles of the waste hierarchy and best practicable environmental option as being at the heart of waste policy, and set out a number of options by which central Government, local authorities, industry and commerce, the waste management industry, householders, and the voluntary and community sectors could help achieve that strategy's aims.
<P>

<a name="80113w01.html_para4">This Government support the broad thrust of the policies set out in the 1995 White Paper but nevertheless believe that the time is now right for a comprehensive review of waste management in England and Wales. I am sure that this will be welcomed by all interested parties. They will want to know what our future priorities will be so that they can plan and invest for them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80113w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Claims for possession, which form the overwhelming majority of housing cases, are excluded from the small claims regime. The collection of more detailed statistical information in relation to small claims was introduced by the Court Service in 1996 as part of the exercise in monitoring the effects of the rise in the limit to &#163;3,000. One of the categories is "non-possession housing disputes". This Department has not undertaken any research specifically in connection with housing cases, however, a wider study of litigants' experiences of small claims by Professor John Baldwin was published in December 1997.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80113w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is estimated that the increase in the small claims limit made on 1 January 1996, from &#163;1,000 to &#163;3,000, has resulted in a reduction of 18.8 per cent. in the number of certificates issued during 1996-97 for money claims (excluding personal injury claims).

 Our spending plans remain unaffected by the proposed removal of money and damages claims from the scope of legal aid. The aim is to use the existing budget better. Until we have reached final decisions on the types of case that are to be excluded and other matters of important detail the expenditure implications cannot be quantified. That will not be until we have completed the extensive consultation we are currently undertaking.

 Responses to our White Paper "Building Excellent Schools Together" have strongly endorsed the Government's overriding emphasis on strengthening the basic skills of literacy and numeracy and the targets set for attainment in the core subjects in primary schools. The broad purpose and content of the curriculum in Wales--notably as regards the Welsh language and the Curriculum Cymreig--is also well understood and appreciated. The responses did, however, show that many teachers are concerned about overload within the curriculum taught in primary schools in Wales and feel that this might work against the drive to improve standards of literacy and numeracy.
<P>

<a name="80113w02.html_para3">I take these concerns very seriously and I have therefore asked for urgent advice from the Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales (ACCAC) on ways in which the curriculum might be slimmed down in a way which reflects the distinctive nature of the curriculum in Wales. I have also written to every primary school head teacher to emphasise the Government's commitment to the targets set in the White Paper and to explain what I have asked ACCAC to do.
<P>

<a name="80113w02.html_para4">In the light of the responses to the White Paper, I want to be sure that the position of Welsh and more generally of the Curriculum Cymreig have been weighed along with our broader objectives to ensure rigorous standards of teaching and learning together with a sound progression into secondary school education. I do not assume that a reduction in overload would of itself result in a better use of available time and I have, therefore, asked Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools to provide further guidance to deal with this point.
<P>

<a name="80113w02.html_para5">I expect to receive advice by March. I will then set out an agenda for action and will consult teachers and others before changes are introduced. This timetable will allow for the option of modifying the Welsh curriculum from September 1998 in line with the announcement today by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education.
<P>

<a name="80113w02.html_para6">Copies of my letters to head teachers and ACCAC have been placed in the Library of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 12 January 1998]:</i> Claims under the Firearms Compensation Scheme are dealt with in the order in which they are received from the police. This claim was received on 23 September 1997, towards the end of the three month hand-in period, and is defective, in that the claimant has declined to sign the required declaration relinquishing ownership of the surrendered weapons. Until this is done, no payment can be made. The claim is therefore being returned for completion.

 The appointment of the Chairman-designate of the Football Trust was wholly a matter for the Trustees. I was consulted by Trustees on their nomination of my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry), as the Trust Deed provides, and was very pleased to be able to support that nomination. My hon. Friend has considerable experience of all aspects of football and is widely acknowledged as a key figure in sports policy making. I understand the question of remuneration is to be considered at the first meeting of the new Trust. I would like to pay tribute to

 No funds have been diverted from the existing good causes. Funds continue to be allocated between the existing five good causes according to the percentages approved by Parliament. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 1 October 1997 that, from 14 October, and with the agreement of existing Lottery distributors, "shadow" accounts would be maintained, setting aside funds for the New Opportunities Fund and NESTA on the basis of the proposed percentage shares outlined in the National Lottery Bill. The existing distributors are planning their commitments and expenditure on the basis of these "shadow" accounts. Subject to Parliamentary approval of the relevant provisions of the Bill, resources will be transferred to the New Opportunities Fund and NESTA in line with these accounts after Royal Assent. If the legislation were not passed, for whatever reason, the funds would simply remain in the accounts of the existing distributors, as currently provided.

Work-related qualifications such as National Certificate, HNC and HND combine knowledge and practical experience in a wide range of subject areas to prepare for employment. Work-based Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs), which are assessed in workplace conditions and recognise that individuals are competent for specific occupations, can in certain situations also be taken in preparation for employment.

With the introduction of the extended Project Work Pilots separate figures for referrals to adjudication resulting from referrals to Project Work were not collected. Information on the total number of Adjudication Officers' decisions and opinions and disallowance rates relating to all government employment training programmes is 



contained in a published document entitled "Analysis of Adjudication Officers' Decisions". This provides information on all the labour market entitlement and sanction questions arising on claims. The latest information available is up to September 1997. Copies of this document are held in the Library of the House.<P>

Table 3 contains the number of sanctions and disallowances imposed and opinions given from the introduction of JSA in October 1996 for:<P>

giving up a place on a training scheme or employment programme;<P>

refusal of a place on a training scheme or employment programme;<P>

neglect to avail of a place on a training scheme or employment programme;<P>

failure to attend on a training scheme or employment programme; and <P>

losing a place on a training scheme or employment programme through misconduct.<P>

Schemes and programmes included in this definition are Jobplan Workshops, Restart Courses, Workwise, Worklink and Project Work. Employment Service statistics do not identify the number of sanctions relating to each programme, nor do they differentiate between tow and four week sanctions or disallowances.<P>

Newly registered schools, or those causing concern, are inspected mor frequently and at least annually. Save in exceptional cases, these inspections do not normally lead to published reports.

We will announce the new arrangements when they are finalised.

Independent schools approved under that section are already inspected by Ofsted in the same way as maintained schools.

 During the course of the UK Presidency, we are determined to make as much progress as possible towards the next enlargement of the European Union. One element of this will be discussing with other Member States how and when to proceed with Protocol No. 11 to the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning institutional reform in the context of enlargement. We fully support the principle of a smaller Commission and the reweighing of votes in the Council that this Protocol provides for.
<P>

<a name="80113w09.html_para0">Preparation for other measures envisaged by the Treaty of Amsterdam--for example, improving the quality of European legislation and ensuring greater openness in the Union--will continue during the UK Presidency. So will a series of continuing reforms to improve the operational efficiency of the institutions, such as SEM 2000 to improve financial management in the Commission and MAP 2000 to modernise the European civil service.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> The Joint European Torus at Culham is the European fusion programme's most important facility, and is in fact the largest of its kind operating anywhere in the world. The management achieved record results last month for fusion power and fusion energy. However, the report of the European Court of Auditors on JET's 1996 accounts raised some issues of concern. It identified a number of weaknesses in JET management's application of JET's Financial Regulations concerning the awarding of contracts, most notably in the areas of contract personnel and invitation to tender. The JET Director, Dr. Keilhacker, has responded disagreeing with the conclusions drawn by the Court in some of the specific examples quoted. He accepted some of the recommendations and rejected others.
<P>

<a name="80113w10.html_para0">We are concerned about the apparent weaknesses in various areas of JET management's performance, and we shall ensure that the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority pursue this issue in the JET council and other committees on which it is represented. I expect the JET Council either to satisfy itself that the JET Director's response is adequate or to ensure that he implements the audit recommendations.
<P>

<a name="80113w10.html_para1">JET's expenditure is around &#163;60 million a year, and it is important that this money is spent with proper regard to propriety and the need for value for money.

 The Department of Health established a task force in 1993 to look at ways of securing better and more cost-effective chiropody services within the National Health Service.

 The Department of Health established in 1993 a task force to look at ways of securing better and more cost-effective chiropody services within the National Health Service. The recommendations were widely disseminated to the service with the emphasis being on the provision of services to "at risk" groups and those with acute clinical need.
<P>

<a name="80113w11.html_para5">It is currently the responsibility of health authorities and general practitioner fundholders to assess the health care needs of their population, and to secure a range of hospital and community health services to meet those needs. Decisions about health care and the use of resources are best taken at local level because it is there that people's needs are best known and services can be tailored accordingly.

 The information requested is not routinely collected. Health authorities are not required to notify the Department of changes in activity in particular services.

 It is currently the responsibility of health authorities and general practitioner fundholders to assess the health care needs of their population, and to secure a range of hospital and community health services, including chiropody services, to meet those needs. Health authorities were informed, in the 1997-98 NHS Priorities and Planning Guidance, of the need to ensure, in collaboration with other local authorities and organisations, that integrated services are in place to meet needs for continuing health care for older people, people with disabilities, vulnerable people and children.

 It is currently the responsibility of health authorities and general practitioner fundholders to assess the health care needs of their population, and to secure a range of hospital and community health services, including chiropody services, to meet those needs. Most health authorities give priority to meeting the chiropody needs of older people, those with "at risk" conditions for example diabetes, and certain other groups such as children, pregnant women, and people with learning disabilities.

 When the Department became aware that some women had received less than the recommended dose of anti-D immunoglobulin, at the Fallodon Private Surgical Hospital, expert medical advice was sought on the medical consequences. That advice was that it would not be possible to identify any woman who may have been affected unless and until they became pregnant again.
<P>

<a name="80113w12.html_para0">Establishing the number of female patients who did not receive the full dose of anti-D would not therefore guide future care, nor offer benefit to the women concerned, and might cause needless anxiety. Any attempt to contact these women indirectly, for example via their general practitioner, would have run the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="80113w12.html_para1">A woman's blood group is routinely tested as part of her ante-natal care. If she is found to be Rhesus negative she would be monitored to see whether she develops Anti-D antibodies. Action necessary to protect the baby would be determined by the results of this monitoring.

 In our manifesto we made a commitment to review the central areas of insecurity for older people and examine ways to deliver more automatic help to the poorest pensioners. Work is underway in both areas, but we are not prepared to allow another winter to go by when pensioners are fearful of turning up their heating because they do not know whether they will get the help they need with their fuel bills. The additional help of &#163;400 million over this winter and next, announced by the Chancellor on 25 November 1997, demonstrates the Government's commitment to help the elderly keep warm in their homes.

<a name="80113w12.html_para2">We have already taken action to cut fuel costs and make homes easier to heat. So far we have: reduced VAT on domestic fuel from eight to five per cent; reduced the gas levy to zero; extended energy efficiency grants and announced a reduction on VAT on energy saving installation schemes; announced the setting up of an Environmental Task Force which is expected to include a programme of energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly; and, released almost &#163;800 million to local authorities over the next two years to help meet pressing housing needs, which is expected to feature improved energy efficiency in many areas.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Performance in all areas of the Benefits Agency (BA), including the clearance of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit referrals in respiratory disease cases, is routinely monitored. There were temporary problems with examinations in the Yorkshire region earlier this year due to recruitment of new staff and a reorganisation of boundaries within BAMS. Appropriate action has been taken by local management to deal with those problems.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information on performance targets is available for the Leeds Medical Services Centre (MSC), which includes Normanton. BAMS are set national performance targets when dealing with claims to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB) from clients suffering from respiratory diseases. The performance of Leeds MSC against these national targets since January is set out on the attached table. I would like to reassure you that BAMS is fully committed to continuing this improvement.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since July, there has been no shortage of suitably trained doctors to carry out medical examinations in the Yorkshire Regions for chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Much of the delay in dealing with respiratory disease cases is not directly related to arrangements for the actual medical examination. Once a case is at the examination stage it normally takes only 2-3 weeks to arrange and carry out the relevant medical procedure. However, it may be necessary to obtain further medical evidence before any examination is carried out and it is here that delays can occur, many of which are outside the BA's control. There is a legal requirement, for example, to obtain original X-rays when the client has had an X-ray taken during the last 18 months. This is connected with radiation protection and avoids the necessity for further exposure. Hospital case notes, consultant's reports, etc may also be needed.

 We would encourage anyone who is entitled to a benefit to make a claim.

<P>

 New lone parents, including those fleeing domestic violence, will continue to receive the same rate of Child Benefit as couples with children.

<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para4">A parent who has experienced domestic violence and decides to leave their partner can seek help from a variety of sources. These include the police, Women's Aid or a local refuge, Social Services and health professionals at a doctor's surgery or Hospital. The key is for agencies to work together locally to ensure that they provide effective support to those contacting them for help, and refer them on to other agencies, such a Housing or a local refuge, where necessary.

<P>
<a name="80113w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Government believe that work is the best form of welfare. Our priority is to provide all families, including lone parents, with the support they need to make the transition into work and to support themselves in work. We have already undertaken a number of important steps to help achieve this.
<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para5">Childcare plays a crucial role in supporting lone parents in work as they need access to affordable, good quality childcare to help balance work and family life successfully. That is why our Manifesto gave a commitment to introduce a National Childcare Strategy. That commitment is already becoming a reality.
<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para6">The massive boost in childcare provision which was announced by my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-Budget statement means every child will have access to out of school care in their community. We are investing an extra &#163;300 million to provide an extra 30,000 out of school clubs--a tenfold increase on existing provision. We have guaranteed a nursery place for every four year old in Britain and provided specific help in the New Deal for Lone Parents towards the cost of childcare.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 1998 : Column: 207</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para7">In addition, the improvements to the childcare disregard scheme in the in-work benefits from June 1998, means parents will be able to receive up to &#163;95.50 a week towards the cost of their childcare. There will also be more help with the cost of childcare through the Working Families Tax Credit.
<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para8">We are also reviewing all aspects of the Child Support Agency to ensure it provides a fair, efficient, and effective service. Maintenance is a portable income which lone mothers keep when they move into work and they need to know the Child Support Agency will take every action to ensure that it is paid.
<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para9">The implementation of a National Minimum Wage will also benefit all low income families. It will provide a statutory level beneath which pay should not fall and will remove the worst excesses of low pay and exploitation of vulnerable workers.
<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para10">Finally, we are also examining the interaction of the tax and benefit systems so that they can be streamlined and modernised, so as to fulfil objectives of promoting work incentives, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and strengthening community and family life.

<a name="80113w14.html_para11">The information is not available in the format requested. there are a number of reasons why a lone parent may cease claiming Income Support. These include: re-partnering; receiving an increase in income other than earnings (for example following an award of maintenance); and either starting work or increasing their hours of work.
<P>

<a name="80113w14.html_para12">There were 506,000 Income Support claimants in receipt of a lone parent premium at the end of November 1996 whose youngest child was aged 5 or over. Three months later 46,000 had ceased to fit into this category: around 36,000 had ceased to claim by the end of February 1997 and a further 10,000 remained on benefit but experienced a change in their circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she has considered excluding sufferers from multiple sclerosis among the categories of disabled people already excluded from the current review programme of disability living allowance claims; and if she will make a statement. [22375]

<a name="80113w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) is designed to gather up-to-date information about the care and mobility needs of people receiving the higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) with either the middle or highest rate of the care component, through a programme of postal inquiries and home visits. People with certain conditions are not being contacted directly. These are disabled people receiving payments under Special Rules, quadriplegics, paraplegics, people who are both deaf and blind, double amputees and those within our definition of severe mental impairment. There are no plans to extend this list of conditions.
<P>

<a name="80113w15.html_para0">The level of entitlement to DLA cannot generally be predicted by the fact that an individual has a certain disabling condition. Entitlement is based on the effect of that disabling condition on the individual concerned and their need for help with personal care and/or getting around. Disabling conditions rarely remain static and as conditions improve or worsen, or the disabled person becomes more or less able to cope, the need for help changes also. Any change in the level of help needed with either personal care or getting around could affect entitlement to DLA. Where a change is gradual and occurs over time, it can be difficult for the individual to recognise exactly the point at which they should be contacting the Benefits Agency.

 Income derived from capital which has been invested is treated as capital but only from the date it is due to be credited to the claimant's account. This is because, to aid efficient administration, a notional (tariff) income is assumed where capital held by a claimant exceeds &#163;3,000. To take into account both notional and actual income derived from same capital would be inequitable.
