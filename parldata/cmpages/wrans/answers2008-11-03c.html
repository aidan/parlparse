 The following table shows the administrative costs for managing the pension credit system since its inception in October 2003. Please note that due to the launch of pension credit in October 2003, the figures for the financial year 2003-04 are low in comparison to future years; years 2004-06 administrative costs are at their highest due to these years being the peak years for achieving the PSA target; and years 2006-08 represent steady state. The lower costs for 2007-08 represent the impact of the Pension Transformation Programme (PTP) and the introduction of PTP wave 1.</p>

 Tackling pensioner poverty remains one of this Government's key priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="81103w0002.htm_para2"><a name="08110337000373">The Government have introduced a number of measures to help older people out of poverty. In 1997, the poorest pensioners lived on around &#163;69 a week, today pension credit ensures that no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;124.05 a week (&#163;189.35 for a couple). We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit at least in line with earnings in every year since its introduction, and the value of the safety-net we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by over a third in real terms since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="81103w0002.htm_para3"><a name="08110337000374">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Between 1998-99 and 2006-07 the number of pensioners in low income in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million to 2.1 million (measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs.)</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="81103w0002.htm_para4"><a name="08110337000375">Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next Parliament, will help secure the gains we have made into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="81103w0002.htm_para5"><a name="08110337000376">We are striving to ensure that older people are aware of, and take up their entitlements through initiatives such as: using sophisticated data matching to identify those who may be entitled to, but not currently receiving, benefits; home visits for vulnerable customers; targeted local marketing and media campaigns; a simple and straightforward claim process and ever closer working with partner organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="81103w0002.htm_para6"><a name="08110337000377">In addition to pension credit we have increased winter fuel payments to &#163;200 for households with someone aged 60-79, and &#163;300 for those with someone aged 80 or over. We will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &#163;50 for households with someone aged 60 to 79 and &#163;100 for those with someone aged 80  or over. Since 1997, we have also introduced free eye-tests, free off-peak bus travel for pensioners and free television licences for those aged over 75.</p>

 The Pensions Bill, which is currently progressing through Parliament, will bring in arrangements to encourage individuals to make provisions for their own retirement through the introduction of automatic enrolment.

 The House Administration is undertaking a liability review and assessment that will determine the full extent of any monies to be recovered from consultants.

At that stage, in the light of delays and construction problems, a project recovery manager was appointed who initially reported to the Clerk of the House and Chief Executive and then, from autumn 2007, to a new Project Board led by the Principal Clerk of Select Committees.

 The Association of Police Officers are reviewing the use of third party reporting mechanisms. The Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism and Policing discussed the matter at a bi-lateral meeting with the Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police on 21 October 2008 both parties stated their desire to see a service provided and the Minister has asked Superintendent Paul Giannasi, the project lead for Race for Justice to urgently meet with Metropolitan Police officials to establish the feasibility and cost of a solution. The first meeting has taken place and a report will be considered by the Minister and the Commissioner when the work is complete.

 The following table sets out the number of constables and police community support officers in England and the Avon and Somerset constabulary for March 2007 and 2008. It is not possible to identify what proportion of constables are, or will be funded by the Home Office during the CSR period as the cost of policing is jointly met through police grant from the Home Office, revenue support grant from the DCLG and the police authority precept on the council tax. Decisions on the number of officers at each rank are an operational matter for the chief constable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="81103w0009.htm_para0"><a name="08110343000672">In December 2006, in response to requests from Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities, my predecessor agreed to relax the controls over officer numbers imposed by the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF). As a result of this relaxation, chief constables are able to use the CFF funding where it is most needed, rather than solely to fund police officer posts. This flexibility has given the service the freedom they asked for to employ staff instead of officers in back office and support roles, allowing officers to concentrate on core policing functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="81103w0009.htm_para1"><a name="08110343000673">CFF payments total &#163;274.3 million for England, including &#163;1.422 million for the Avon and Somerset constabulary. As many forces are now taking advantage of the new CFF flexibilities it is not possible to identify how many constable posts continue to be funded through the CFF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="81103w0009.htm_para2"><a name="08110343000674">In the case of police community support officers specific grant funding for neighbourhood policing includes a contribution towards the cost of maintaining PCSOs in England.

<i> [holding answer 28 October 2008]:</i> The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has assessed six sites for a multi purpose test centre (MPTC) location in the search area around Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="81103w0011.htm_para4"><a name="08110343001104">One site, brought to DSA's attention by Pembrokeshire county council, was confirmed as being suitable. The site is council-owned and Agency staff held positive discussions with council officials regarding its use for motorcycle testing. However, the planning application submitted by DSA was later turned down by the council as was a subsequent appeal against the decision. Because of the problems encountered in finding a suitable location it has not been possible to set a timetable for establishing a MPTC in Pembroke. There is insufficient time to locate a suitable site for a MPTC, obtain planning permission and construct it in Pembroke before the target implementation date for the new practical motorcycle test at the end of March 2009.</p>

Sites under consideration include sports stadiums, docks, car parks and showgrounds. So far two potential sites have been identified in Pembrokeshire and these are being further assessed. DSA also wrote to Pembrokeshire county council on 22 October seeking assistance to locate such suitable sites.</p>

 Funding for the treatment of mental health conditions, of which post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is only one (and not the predominant) diagnosis, is provided from a number of budget areas within the Ministry of Defence.</p>

First, the Reserves Mental Health Programme (RMHP) provides a mental health assessment plus, if necessary, out-patient treatment at a DCMH, to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since 1 January 2003 following an overseas operational deployment as a reservist, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Medical staffs who provide these assessments and treatment do so as part of their overall duties and are not uniquely engaged on the RMHP; it is not therefore possible to provide an overall cost of the programme without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

 The healthcare of veterans is principally a matter for the national health service and the four UK health Departments, reflecting the need to provide expert care close to an individual's home and family. Information has not been collected on how many former members of the armed forces were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in each of the last five years. However, a sample survey on psychiatric morbidity is currently being carried out by the Office for National Statistics; this includes questions allowing identification of veterans, the time at which they served and whether any traumatic experience that may have caused their condition took place in service. This will allow a clearer understanding of the extent and nature of veterans' mental health problems. In addition, in 2003 we commissioned Kings College London to undertake a study of the health outcomes for some 20,000 personnel deployed to Iraq or in a non-deployed comparator group. This includes analysis of mental health outcomes which so far shows that generally there is not a higher incidence of mental health problems among those deployed though there were some specific areas of concern, notably among reservists; we have taken steps to address this by offering those with operational service since 2003 access to defence medical services where appropriate, for assessment and treatment.</p>

We are also looking at ways in which we can improve our understanding of the reasons why veterans are in prison and the extent to which their military service may be a factor.</p>

 For those leaving the armed forces with an alcohol or drug problem, the three service welfare organisations can signpost to the sources of help that are available after discharge. The UK Departments of Health are generally responsible for the provision, through the national health service, of help to those experiencing problems with drugs and alcohol, including veterans.</p>

 In line with long-standing practice, the health care of veterans is primarily a matter for the NHS which, evidence indicates, meets the needs of a large proportion of those with mental health problems. We are aware that some veterans seek a service that can provide an expert cultural understanding of the military context of their problems. To address this, the Department is working with the four UK health departments in piloting a new expert mental health care service for veterans in six NHS trusts across the UK. The NHS sites undertaking pilots are: Stafford, Camden and Islington, Cardiff, Bishop Auckland, Plymouth and Scotland. In addition, for those veterans and health professionals not in a pilot catchment area, we have expanded our Medical Assessment Programme (MAP), based at St. Thomas&#146; hospital, London, to include assessment of veterans with mental health symptoms who have operational service since 1982 by a military psychiatrist with considerable service experience. Where appropriate, the Department also funds care at the centres run by the charity Combat Stress for those veterans in receipt of a war pension on the basis that their condition has been accepted as attributable to service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="81103w0018.htm_para0"><a name="08110347000248">The principal cause for a later service commencement date has been the significant re-scoping and redesigning of the radio solution following the major reconfiguration of the Ambulance Trusts in 2006. This has resulted in a more resilient and flexible solution being delivered which comes about through the networking of two of the communication control system and the ability of Trust control rooms to connect to either system. It is planned that all Trusts will have full service by the end of 2009.</p>

 The centrally funded provision of airwave Tetra radios is based on the fleet sizes and other requirements of NHS ambulance trusts in February 2005. This provision allowed for radios to be installed in all A&amp;E ambulances, rapid response vehicles, officers cars, patient transport vehicles, on motorbikes and in air ambulances. One ambulance trust has indicated a requirement for radios for community first responders. All subsequent new requirements are added to the contract, with costs met by the trusts concerned.</p>

While this approach was able to provide an estimate of the total number of individuals treated in the year, it does not provide an estimate of the total number of episodes or treatments provided.</p>

 Where a primary care trust (PCT) chooses to provide an income guarantee for a new general practitioner (GP)-led health centre, it shares with the provider the risks arising from starting a new service with an unknown volume of activity (unregistered patient attendances) and is therefore planning to minimise the potential financial risks and service costs from an unknown local demand.

 We remain very concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza. We monitor it closely through humanitarian agencies and NGOs.

Our earlier funding for the European Commission&#146;s TIM/PEGASE mechanism supported the provision of emergency medical and social services to the population of Gaza and the West Bank and paid salaries of key public sector workers.</p>

 There has not been a specific assessment of the impact of empty property rates on self administered pension schemes.

 The information requested was published in the 2007 Budget.

This estimate reflects the increase in yield from rates, offset against reduced corporation tax yield (because rates are a legitimate deduction from corporation tax) and changes in other tax yields resulting from increased transactions and associated behaviour.</p>

 The Department held its last staff survey in June 2007. The results were analysed and presented to the Executive Committee in September 2007. The results showed that in both areas of change management and communication there is scope for improvement, and this has been reflected in the resulting action plan. We have also introduced a programme of regular pulse surveys to ensure that we continue to monitor progress against the action plan, including communications with our NDPBs.</p>

measures designed to reform their decision-making structure in order to make it a more modern, effective and representative governing body for football. His recommendations fell into five main areas: a reformed FA board headed by an independent chairman; a broader, more representative FA Council to act as the "parliament of football"; a new semi-autonomous regulation and compliance body; the creation of a Community Football Alliance to bridge the governing body functions for the professional and national sides of the game; and a funding formula to clearly set out the distribution of FA surpluses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_485"><a name="81103w0033.htm_para8"><a name="08110419000504">The recommendations were approved by the FA Council in October 2006 and by the AGM in May 2007. Since that time the new FA board has been introduced, with five representatives for each of the professional and national game, alongside the FA CEO and Lord Triesman as the FA's first independent chairman. In addition, the FA Council has expanded to incorporate greater representation for players, supporters, managers, referees, ethnic minorities, disability football, women's football and other areas of the game. The new Football Regulatory Authority acts as an oversight body for the FA's governance and regulation activities. The funding formula is also now in operation and measures have been putt in place to bridge the gap between the professional and national games.</p>

 Most of Hemel Hempstead and its surrounding areas receive signals from the &#145;Hemel Hempstead&#146; transmitter at Bedmond. This transmitter already broadcasts digital signals and digital terrestrial television (DTT) coverage and should be generally good. There is a small area in the centre of the town where terrain and tall buildings screen viewers from the main Hemel Hempstead transmitter. In that area, viewers receive signals from the much smaller &#145;Hemel Hempstead Town&#146; relay transmitter. Hemel Hempstead Town only broadcasts four analogue services at present and therefore DTT reception will not be possible for viewers that rely on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"><a name="81103w0033.htm_para10"><a name="08110419000508">When switchover occurs, Hemel Hempstead Town relay will be converted to broadcast digital services and the power of the digital services from the transmitter at Bedmond will also be increased. These two measures should improve the reception reliability of the digital services and extend their reach to match that of the analogue services they replace. Switchover is due to occur in the ITV London region in 2012.</p>

The plan also includes action to reform qualifications, support for small businesses, establish a new national skills academy for hospitality to raise standards of delivery of training, improve the quality of apprenticeships, develop new 14-19 diplomas in hospitality and in travel and tourism, launch a campaign to promote careers and improve perceptions of jobs in the sector, and develop a pre-employability package aimed at jobseekers.

 DEFRA has a project to take forward the policy on waste wood set out in the Waste Strategy 2007. As an initial step, DEFRA published an information report 'Waste Wood as a Biomass Fuel' in April 2008, prepared in consultation with waste wood recyclers and other stakeholders. As a practical follow-up step to this report, we are encouraging local authorities applying for waste private finance initiative (PFI) credits in support of their waste infrastructure procurements to include plans for waste wood collection and supply.</p>

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="10"><sup>(1)</sup> The unified Aimhigher programme was introduced in 2004. Predecessor programmes were Excellence Challenge, funded by the then Department for Education and Skills, and Partnerships for Progression, funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). Aimhigher is funded jointly by DIUS, HEFCE, the LSC and the Department for Health. Includes allocations for Aimhigher Associates (&#163;3 million in 2008-09, &#163;9 million in 2009-10, and &#163;9 million in 2010-11).<br>
<sup>(2 )</sup>Excellence Challenge included Opportunity Bursaries. These were grants to eligible people from lower income families and were worth &#163;2,000 over three years. From September 2001, 26,000 such bursaries were made available at a total cost of &#163;37 million. With the wider reintroduction of grants in 2006, the Opportunity Bursary scheme was withdrawn.<br>
<sup>(3 )</sup>Funded by HEFCE.<br>
<sup>(4 )</sup>Includes student loans RAB charge, fee loans, student support grants, maintenance grant, HE grant, grants for vulnerable students, tuition fee grants, grants for part-time students and access funds and bursaries. The student loans RAB charge estimates the future cost to Government of subsidising and writing off the student loans issued in that year; it does not represent the amount of cash lent to students, which has risen each year since the introduction of student loans. Figures for 1997 to 2007 are outturn; that for 2007-08 is estimated outturn; and those for 2008 to 11 are plans.<br>
<sup>(5 )</sup>These figures also include the allocations for improving the retention of non-traditional students, and to widen access and improve provision for disabled students. The figure for 2008-09 is provisional.<br>
<sup>(6 )</sup>The Office for Fair Access forecasts that around &#163;300 million annually will be spent by higher education providers on bursaries and scholarships benefiting students from low-income and other under-represented groups by the academic year 2008/09.<br>
<sup>(7 )</sup>Not yet available.<br>
<sup>(8 )</sup>In 2001 to 2004, Aimhigher contributed &#163;10 million a year towards the widening participation allocation. The figure given as the total for each of these years is therefore less than the sum of the parts to avoid double counting.<br>

 Our policy is for all pupils, irrespective of background or ability, to have an entitlement to a core of learning set out in the National Curriculum statutory Programmes of Study.

Schools may adapt the Programmes of Study in order to provide all pupils with appropriately challenging work at each key stage; they may group pupils in whichever way best meets their needs and are free to use a range of teaching methods. Head teachers may also introduce other experiences and subjects once they are satisfied that they are meeting the statutory requirements of the National Curriculum.</p>

 Controlled assessments will be introduced within GCSEs from next year to replace coursework. This will help to reassure the public that the work that students submit is their own, and maintain the integrity of the GCSE. Students who study from home by choice will attend centres, usually local schools or colleges, so that they can participate in these assessments. Those who study from home because they are sick or disabled will have special arrangements put in place which ensure they are not prevented from participating. We will keep these arrangements under review to ensure that all candidates have the best opportunity to have their learning accredited.</p>

However, we are committed to retaining the valuable expertise of as many LSC people as possible and will continue to do all we can to support LSC staff, working with their representatives, to ensure they have as much certainty as possible about what their options will be, as the new organisational set up becomes clearer. The LSC has a good track record of delivering major restructuring programmes. For example, &#145;theme 7&#146; of the LSC&#146;s Agenda for Change programme undertaken last year was designed to further streamline the organisation and give local offices a more strategic role, built around a stronger relationship with local authorities and other key stakeholders. Since 2003 staffing levels at the organisation have reduced from 7,000 to 3,451 (the average number of staff in full time equivalent numbers employed by the LSC for the year ending March 2008, including 269 agency and temporary staff and five inward secondees).</p>

 The information requested in his question (232413) is not held centrally, however Advanced Skills Teachers, Leading Teachers, and other primary school teachers may be able to provide primary schools with specialist mathematics support. We do not hold numbers for how many are doing this centrally. The recent &#147;Independent Review of Mathematics Teaching in Early Years Settings and Primary Schools&#148; by Sir Peter Williams estimated that approximately 3,000 teachers with a mathematics specialism are currently working in primary schools. By 2019 we will have implemented Sir Peter&#146;s main recommendation in accordance with his timetable, so that all primary schools will have access to a mathematics specialist teacher with their numbers increasing to around 13,000.</p>

 The Government believe that the EU&#146;s commitment to a 30 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of a comprehensive international agreement should be built firmly into the current EU Climate and Energy Package. We believe that the trigger for moving to the higher EU GHG target should be the EU&#146;s ratification of an international climate agreement for post-2012. Once the decision to ratify is taken, we favour amending the EU&#146;s implementing legislation by the comitology procedure rather than co-decision. This is in line with the proposal from the European Commission and the position taken by the European Parliament. However, ultimately, it is the commitment to the 30 per cent. reduction target that is of greatest importance. Whatever process is put in place to move to a higher target, it must be swift and transparent.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2008]:</i> In the context of the Energy Bill, the Department has considered the concept of an emission performance standard for new power stations. We do not support the introduction of such a standard because it would not yield any additional carbon savings as missions from the power sector are already capped under the EU emissions trading scheme. Furthermore, it presents a number of risks:</p>

The result is that the original PPERA power for the Commission to enter premises for the purposes of carrying out its functions will now apply to election agents and candidates, alongside the other individuals and organisations listed in paragraph 1(1) in Schedule 19A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="81103w0052.htm_para2"><a name="08110419005075">In addition, the Political Parties and Elections Bill seeks to provide new powers for use by the Commission when it undertakes an investigation into a suspected breach of PPERA. To this end the Bill provides the Commission with new powers to request information, to put questions and to apply for a warrant to enable it to enter premises when carrying out an investigation into a suspected offence or other contravention of the 2000 Act. These powers are capable of applying to election agents and candidates who have such information in the same way that they may apply to anyone else. However, we have also introduced a number of important safeguards for the use of these new powers. In relation to entry of premises under this new power, the Commission will need to apply for a warrant under paragraph 3 of Schedule 19A. There is no automatic right of entry. For a warrant to be issued, the Commission must demonstrate on oath to a justice of the peace that it have reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed (or other contravention of PPERA has occurred). They must also establish that documents are on the premises that were withheld following an earlier request or that are otherwise relevant to the investigation. When entering the premises, they must be accompanied at all times by a constable.</p>

 The effect of clause 10 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill (Bill 141) will be that the key consideration in determining whether or not the candidate expenditure limit applies will be the purpose for which expenditure is used.

 The figures in the impact assessment for the numbers of donations potentially affected by the additional declaration requirements in clause 8 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill are estimates, as there is no publicly available data on the number of donations accepted by political parties of amounts between &#163;200 and the thresholds above which the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 requires that donations be reported to the Electoral Commission and publicly disclosed. The estimates were arrived at through extrapolating from the publicly available data on donations of over &#163;5,000 to parties' central offices and &#163;1,000 to local accounting units. These estimates were intended to represent an average yearly figure, taking into account the fact that levels of donations increase considerably towards the end of an electoral cycle.</p>

As I indicated at Second Reading of the Political Parties and Elections Bill, representations have been received from a number of parties that the &#163;200 limit is too low, and we have also received wider representations about the impact of clause 8 on those charged with complying with the law. Although I am clear that greater transparency is essential, it should not be achieved at the cost of overburdening political parties and I am ready to consider representations on the detail of our proposals in that area.</p>

 The Government are committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and from mid 2007 this has been applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety. The Prison Officers Association are partners in its approach.</p>

Sectoral restrictions apply principally in the transport, agriculture, coal and steel sectors. Restrictions generally arise from either the Industrial Development Act of 1982, which provides the statutory basis for SFLG, or from European State Aid rules designed to prevent public interventions from distorting the market. In April 2003, sectoral restrictions on retail, catering and other local service businesses were removed.</p>
