<a name="00721w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many of the written parliamentary questions tabled to his Department between 19 October 1999 and 20 April have not received substantive answers, excluding those not answered citing disproportionate cost, stating that the information is <i>(a)</i> not available, <i>(b)</i> not held centrally, <i>(c)</i> not held in the form requested and <i>(d)</i> citing commercial or other confidentiality.

<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2000]:</i> Of replies to parliamentary questions tabled to the Department during the period citing commercial or other confidentiality, I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave on 29 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 575W.
<P>

<a name="00721w01.html_para0">In addition, five replies stated that the information was not available, 27 replies stated that information was not held centrally and 20 replies stated that the information was not held in the form requested.

<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Pickthall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what discussions he has had with travel companies about the differential costs of holidays that encourage holiday absences in schools.  [131468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2000]:</i> We are engaged in on-going discussions with the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) to see what we can do together to reduce the number of family holidays taken during term time.
<P>

<a name="00721w01.html_para1">As a result of earlier discussions, ABTA wrote to all its members on 15 December 1999, asking them to remind parents of the implications of taking holidays in term time. ABTA members were also requested to remind parents of the importance of discussing their plans with the school before making any firm commitment.
<P>

<a name="00721w01.html_para2">Our recent guidance to all schools, "Social Inclusion: Pupil Support" underlines this approach. The guidance makes clear that while parents should not normally take children out of school for holidays, each request for absence should be considered individually, taking into account factors such as the time of the year proposed for the holiday and the overall attendance pattern of the pupil.
<P>

<a name="00721w01.html_para3">We will continue to talk to ABTA about the issue of family holidays during school term time, and to get the message across to parents that they must consider the impact of absence from school during term time on children's education.

 In 1998-99, local education authorities in the South West bid successfully for a total of &#163;4.12 million New Deal for Schools funding to support Public-Private Partnerships. In 1999-2000, South West local education authorities received &#163;3.28 million from the same source for Public-Private Partnerships, plus &#163;14.2 million in PFI credits for a schools Private Finance Initiative scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will set out the terms of contract for external assessors under the teachers' performance- related pay scheme, with particular reference to the length of term of such contracts; and what additional costs will be incurred as a result of the High Court judgment of 14 July.

<a name="00721w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Cambridge Education Associates (CEA) have been contracted by DfEE to recruit, deploy and quality assure external assessors. In turn CEA contract with individuals to work as threshold assessors. The terms of this contract are a matter between the individual and CEA. The length of the contract depends on the individual assessor's availability to work for CEA. It is not yet clear what, if any, additional costs will be incurred as a result of the High Court Judgment of the 14 July.

<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the costs which will be incurred if the School Teachers' Pay Review Body recommends changes to the standards set for teachers to meet the threshold requirements under performance-related pay and all applications have to be re-submitted.  [131753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department has asked the School Teacher Review Body to start the process of consulting formally on the threshold standards. At this time it is not possible to say whether the Review Body will recommend any changes. Therefore the Department cannot estimate the costs that will be incurred at this stage.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what advice he received prior to the recent court ruling on teachers' performance-related pay concerning how the <i>(a)</i> determination and <i>(b)</i> imposition of threshold standards under the teachers' performance- related pay scheme should be dealt with, with particular reference to his statutory powers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what customer service level for employers target will be set for the Employment Service in 2000-01.  [132477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 In a first for executive agencies, I have set the Employment Service a customer service target for employers. ES is committed to working closely with employers to help them to fill their vacancies and in doing so encourage them to open up more opportunities to disadvantaged jobseekers. The setting of such a target reinforces the ES's commitment to achieving the highest standards of customer service. In addition to the challenging goals that I have already announced, the setting of a stretching but realistic target level for employer service will help the ES to achieve the high level of performance that I expect of it in 2000-01.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Employment Service aims to make a major contributions to an efficient and flexible labour market and to the Government's objectives of high and stable employment and growth, equality of opportunity and social inclusion. ES works closely with employers and with its private, voluntary and public sector partners to provide a quality service for all people without a job and to promote employment opportunities for all who can work. It aims to attract a diverse range of vacancies and to fill those vacancies quickly by matching the right people and skills with the right jobs. Its chief priority is to help individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It does this through correct application of the JSA regime, delivery of the New Deals and the pilot ONE service, and provision of appropriate information, advice, training and support. The Agency has achieved much over the past three years. The challenge and opportunity now facing it is to sustain continuous improvement in its services to jobseekers and employers and to make those services more accessible and relevant to customer needs, through effective use of modern technology and close working with a wide range of partners".</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="00721w02.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Kingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the humanitarian impact is of the drought affecting south and west Asia; and how the Government are responding.  [132627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w02.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The drought is part of a regional system affecting a belt of countries across west and south Asia. Its effect on the population is particularly acute in southern Afghanistan, western India, southern and central Pakistan, and to a lesser extent parts of Iran and Iraq. Water shortages have been exacerbated in many areas by poor management of limited sources. The principal effects of the drought include reduced crop production, sharp drops in household income, death of livestock and weakening of remaining herds, and health problems associated with reduced food intake and scarcity of water.
<P>

<a name="00721w02.html_para0">We have committed over &#163;3.2 million for relief projects in response to the drought regionally. This support has been channelled through the World Food Programme for food distribution and food for work programmes; and through NGOs for schemes that target the more remote and vulnerable communities unlikely to be benefiting from Government schemes. We have also seconded a five-person team of specialists to support the UN in their assessment of the drought in Pakistan. We are monitoring the situation carefully and currently considering what further assistance to provide.

<a name="00721w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Duncan Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what complaints have been made by the Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency to Feuchter in relation to the fitness for purpose of the Mark II combat gloves they have delivered;  [129727]
<P>
<UL>
<P>
(2) what experience Feuchter had in the manufacture of gloves prior to being awarded the contract for manufacture of the Mark II combat glove in 1998;  [129726]
<P>
(3) how many Mark III combat gloves were manufactured in the UK by Feuchter; and how many Mark II combat gloves manufactured <i>(a)</i> by Feuchter and <i>(b)</i> by other companies have been (i) held to be unusable and (ii) rejected as unfit for their purpose;  [129728]
<P>
(4) how many gloves were manufactured by Zova before expert glove cutting training was given to its staff;  [129730]
<P>
(5) pursuant to his answer of 19 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 30W, on visits to Zova, what capabilities for glove making, as distinct from other leather working, this company demonstrated.  [129729]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 2000]:</i> The pre-production sample of Mark II Combat Gloves provided by Feuchter was found to be unacceptable. Feuchter took the necessary action to improve their production process and, as a result, all gloves subsequently delivered under the terms of the contract proved to be acceptable. No gloves manufactured by Feuchter were therefore formally rejected under the terms of the contract. Following inspection by DCTA staff, a total of 3,260 pairs of Mark II Combat Gloves manufactured by other companies were, however, rejected as being unfit for purpose.
<P>

<a name="00721w02.html_para2">Feuchter held five other DCTA contracts for the manufacture of mittens (extreme cold weather--inners, outers and liners), prior to the award of the contact for the manufacture of Mark II Combat Gloves in 1998. For the duration of the contract for the manufacture of the Mark II Combat Gloves, Feuchter sub-contracted the manufacturing operation to Zova in Poland; no gloves were manufactured in the UK by Feuchter. During their visits to view the manufacturing operation, DCTA staff were satisfied that Zova possessed the necessary capabilities for the manufacture of leather gloves, although a requirement for some additional training on the table cutting operation was identified. Some 47,000 pairs of gloves had been manufactured by Zova before this additional training was provided. No other leather working was being undertaken at the time of the visits, as Zova's manufacturing capacity was fully committed to fulfilling DCTA contracts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2000]:</i> The Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency (DCTA) procures clothing for all three Armed Services, with many items common to all three. To separate the cost of clothing destined specifically for the Army could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, during the financial year 1999-2000, of the 83 per cent. of clothing contracts placed by the DCTA with British-based companies, and referred to in my answer of 3 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 11, 48.9 per cent. by value will be manufactured in the United Kingdom.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2000]:</i> The US are examining an operational concept in which in a crisis aircraft would be deployed to forward operating locations. This concept would not involve any permanent stationing of aircraft at these locations, but some equipment would be pre-positioned. However, the concept is still being studied and no request to use RAF Fairford, or any other UK base, has yet been made. RAF Fairford has of course been used as a standby operating location in the past, most recently during the Kosovo campaign.

 The personal data supplied by the London Borough of Waltham Forest to the Inland Revenue are supplied under legal obligations.

 The illustrative employment tax credit outlined in the Treasury paper "Tackling Poverty and Making Work Pay--Tax Credits for the 21st Century" includes an estimate of around &#163;300 million a year as the cost of extending support to people without children. This is based on extending the adult credit in the Working Families Tax Credit under certain specified assumptions.

 Treasury Ministers have received representations about the raising of tax changes by the Inland Revenue in respect of out of court compensation paid by MAFF to a number of former tenants of the Land Settlement Association. However, Ministers do not intervene in individual cases. The Inland Revenue's independence from Treasury Ministers in the handling of individuals' tax affairs and the application of the tax law must be scrupulously observed.

<P>
<a name="00721w05.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have carried out more than one systematic review of Social Security leaflets since 1996.
<P>

<a name="00721w05.html_para2">Between 1996-99, the Benefits Agency undertook a wholesale review of its customer information leaflets with the aim of making them much more customer focused. This piece of work involved primary research and continuous product testing, as well as consultation with key stakeholders. The leaflets were redesigned and the information within them laid out differently, but the core information was not altered.
<P>

<a name="00721w05.html_para3">In June 1999 a further review was commissioned to identify any erroneous information that needed to be removed or any information which was missing from our leaflets.
<P>

<a name="00721w05.html_para4">This exercise was completed in August 1999 and no major amendments were identified. There were a few minor changes made due to a combination of minor omissions and lack of cross-referencing. Revisions and future changes were also identified around JSA leaflets. These future changes being incorporated later in the year.
<P>

<a name="00721w05.html_para5">The Benefits Agency review resulted in the roll-out of a new suite of leaflets; fewer in number by a third, better targeted to client groups and easier for customers to negotiate their way around. Full evaluation of these new leaflets is in progress; all the early indications are positive.

 A person claiming an income-related benefit may be asked to provide evidence of the value of any capital asset. Depending on the type of asset this may be the face value, the market value or the surrender value. However, evidence would not normally be sought if it was clear that the value would be disregarded. For example, the surrender value of life insurance policies is fully disregarded. No evidence of surrender value would be needed in this case.

 The Rail Regulator and the Franchising Director are ensuring that the needs of all train operators using the West Coast Main Line (WCML) are met by Railtrack's plans for the provision of train paths. The Rail Regulator has issued an order requiring Railtrack to produce final plans and options for the WCML upgrade. In particular, he is seeking information about the extent to which these plans would meet the capacity commitments which Railtrack gave to the Rail Regulator in April 1998. The Rail Regulator also issued a consultation document on 20 June about reviewing the increased costs associated with the WCML upgrade as part of his periodic review of Railtrack's access charges. He is consulting widely on these costs, which have risen from the original estimate of &#163;2.3 billion to a new figure in the region of &#163;5.85 billion. These figures will be subjected to considerable scrutiny and discussion with the Franchising Director before the Rail Regulator announces his draft conclusions later this month.

<P>
<a name="00721w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government have not undertaken a specific assessment of the environmental impacts or cost implications of the transportation of fuel products by different modes of transport. All fuel products are distributed from the refinery to the final consumer in the UK through a combination of pipeline, rail, road or ship, although the exact modes of transport used vary depending on where the fuel is refined and consumed.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 2000 : Column: 350W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00721w05.html_para6">Lifecycle environmental analysis indicates that, regardless of the mode of transportation, the distribution of fuel products is only a small element of the overall lifecycle environmental impacts from fuel products, and the extraction, production and especially consumption of the fuel causes far greater environmental damage. The cost of distributing fuel products is also relatively low in comparison with underlying fuel prices, although the cost of distribution increases the further the consumer if away from a major fuel terminal which can be supplied by ship or pipeline.

 Highway works ultimately benefit the whole community. Occupies of premises may be entitled to compensation if something is done improperly (for example, the blocking of access without authority) but not otherwise. Businesses have no right in law to any given level of passing trade, and may suffer temporary loss owing to disruption of traffic flows. Trade may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, and accurately assessing the losses directly attributable to works in the highway can be difficult. There is, too, an element of 'windfall' profit and loss: often when one trader suffers a rival business in the neighbourhood stands to gain custom as a direct result of the same works. There are therefore no plans to

<P>

<a name="00721w06.html_para3">During the negotiation of the Directive, my Department consulted closely with a range of bodies--including those representing the UK shipping, ports and waste industries and environmental non-governmental organisations--on the practicalities of the proposal that ships calling into a port of an EC member state contribute to the costs of waste reception facilities, irrespective of actual use of the facilities. The consensus was that ease of use and meeting the operational needs of the ships regularly using the ports were the key factors. Latterly, I have received representations from the Kommunenes Internasjonale Milj organisasjon (KIMO) supporting the principle of a charge being levied irrespective of use. I have also received representations from the North Sea Commission and the Wadden Sea Cooperation which have focused on the manner in which the charge should be calculated.

 The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, currently before Parliament, contains provisions to enhance the protection given to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), including those designated for wetland interests in the inter-tidal area. The Bill will provide for, among other things, for a more structured approach to management advice and a new power to refuse consent for damaging activities, the development of management schemes to help combat neglect, the introduction of management notices, increased penalties for deliberate damage, a new court power to order restoration of the damaged special interest, where this is practicable; and a new general offence to apply to damage by any person. 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 2000 : Column: 355W</I><P>
In addition, public bodies will be under a statutory duty to further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs, both in carrying out their operations and exercising their decision-making functions.
<P>

<a name="00721w07.html_para0">My Department has also set up a review to evaluate the success of previous statutory and voluntary marine nature conservation measures and to put forward proposals for improving marine nature conservation in England. Among other things, this involves looking at the protection currently afforded to inter-tidal areas. The Review may also inform separate proposals for marine conservation in Wales.

 Part 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) SI 1995 No. 418 grants a general planning permission for the temporary use of land for up to 28 days in any calendar year, subject to a number of restrictions and conditions. In the case of markets, the permitted use is limited to a total of 14 days in recognition of the parking, litter and noise problems that often arise from such uses. We have no current plans to relax these provisions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 When the guidelines for the Objective 2 programmes were drawn up, it was agreed that any funds provided by the EU would have to be "matched" by corresponding funds drawn from the public and private sector of the member state.
<P>

<a name="00721w07.html_para3">In England it was decided that to emphasise the fact that the drawing up and implementing of these programmes rested with the local partnerships, they should be responsible for securing the match funding.
<P>

<a name="00721w07.html_para4">This approach to match funding is designed to ensure that there is local commitment to pursue the projects that are to be funded and that an innovative approach is taken to securing the funding.
<P>

<a name="00721w07.html_para5">The role of the central Government in the framework of the structural funds is to provide advice, guidance and monitoring. In terms of match funding, its role is to guide partnerships toward the many sources of potential funding, both private and public.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 2000 : Column: 357W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00721w07.html_para6">While the Government make no guarantee of direct match funding, the spending review has increased funding available in the regions for those programmes which local partners can look to for match funding. This is obviously good news for those areas with EU Structural Funds.

<P>

<a name="00721w08.html_para1">The report lays the foundation for raising standards of expertise and ensuring best practice across the Panels. A flexible, more simplified process for all parties and changes to the way in which the Panels are managed and organised will reduce the time taken for decisions to be reached by committees and tribunals. We are looking to implement the report recommendations as soon as possible.

 We are at present receiving about 700 postal applications for asylum a month and estimate that about half come from applicants living in London. We take the view that asylum applications should normally be made in person so that the proper checks, including fingerprinting, can be made to establish identity and prevent fraudulent or multiple applications. From 31 July, postal applications received from persons living in any of the London boroughs will be required to attend for screening at Croydon before their claim is recorded and processed. We will be seeking to extend similar arrangements to other parts of the country as soon as possible.

 The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, which was introduced in the House of Commons on 20 December 1999 and in the House of Lords on 16 March 2000, will implement the recommendations of the Neill Committee's fifth report on the funding of political parties. The funding of political parties is a reserved matter and the controls on political parties' income and expenditure set out in the Bill will apply throughout the United Kingdom. The Bill, however, contains a number of provisions which relate specifically to the National Assembly. In particular, the Bill enables the Electoral Commission, at the request of the Assembly, to prepare a report on the administration of a poll held under section 36 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 (clause 4(3)); empowers the Assembly to transfer the functions of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales to the Electoral Commission (clause 18); and amends the Government of Wales Act so as to enable the Assembly to make payments to groups of Assembly members to assist them in performing their functions as Assembly members (Paragraph 10(4) of schedule 20). The Government are giving consideration to a request from the First Minister to expedite the commencement of the last of these provisions once the Bill receives Royal Assent.

 In May 1997, a Ministerial Group, working closely with the Portman Group, was set up to examine problems surrounding the marketing of "alcopops" and other alcoholic drinks to people under 18. A statement of the Group's conclusions was published in July 1997, and placed in the Library. A range of new controls were added to the industry's Code of Practice, and these have had a significant impact on the merchandising and packaging of alcoholic drinks. The additional controls included:

<a name="00721w09.html_para13">In addition, the White Paper "Time for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of Our Licensing Laws" published on 10 April this year, set out proposals for a new positive duty on licensees not to sell to minors, arrangements for test purchasing and tougher sanctions against those who breach these laws.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures <i>(a)</i> are currently in place and <i>(b)</i> his Department is evaluating to prevent adults purchasing alcoholic drinks for consumption by under-18s.  [131936]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is an offence under section 169(3) of the Licensing Act 1964 for any person to buy, or attempt to buy, intoxicating liquor for consumption in a bar in licensed premises by a person under 18. This offence does not extend to purchases made by adults in off-licences on behalf of minors. The Private Member's Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), the Licensing (Young Persons) Bill, which was successful at Second Reading in the House of Lords on 14 July, would create a new offence of buying alcohol in off-licences on behalf of minors. The Government have given their full support to this Bill. In the White Paper, "Time for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of our Licensing Laws" published on 10 April this year, we have made clear that if my hon. Friend's Bill is not successful, we shall introduce this measure in a Bill reforming licensing law generally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 4 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 166W, on the Schengen Agreement, if it his practice to assess the requirement to modify legislation resulting from accession to agreements with other countries prior to negotiating such agreements; what timescale is envisaged in the case of the Schengen acquis; and if he will make a statement.  [130834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Government's approach to agreements is taken on a case-by-case basis. In the case of partial participation in the Schengen acquis, the Government's objective was to benefit as far as possible from European Union co-operation on policing and judicial matters, commensurate with our Frontiers Protocol. We therefore accepted that legislation might be necessary and would be justified if better European Union co-operation was achieved as a result. As indicated in my reply to the hon. Member on 4 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 166W, the need to legislate was already implicit in the United Kingdom's agreement to a number of European Union instruments providing for judicial co-operation. Work on Schengen implementation has only recently begun and the timescale will be dependent in part on the Government's legislative timetable, in addition

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to amend the working holiday visa scheme to allow greater flexibility in respect of the employment of overseas teachers; and if he will make a statement.  [130778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 We have no plans to relax the working holidaymakers rules. Flexibility already exists for working holidaymakers in the teaching profession in that they are not precluded from continuing their career in the United Kingdom and may work as supply teachers.
<P>

<a name="00721w10.html_para0">The purpose of the working holidaymaker scheme is not to enable overseas teachers to secure employment. As the title implies, any work is to be incidental to an extended holiday here and participants are not expected to work for the whole of their time. There are already a number of existing mechanisms under the Immigration Rules to facilitate the employment of overseas teachers, including the work permit scheme and the approved exchange scheme for teachers and language assistants.

<P>
<a name="00721w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I regret that the available information--on working holidaymakers admitted to the United Kingdom--does not separately identify those who are teachers nor their place of residence in this country.

Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

 The table illustrates that the number of nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff employed by the Royal Shrewsbury Hospitals National Health Service Trust declined between the years 1994 and 1997. However, numbers remain constant for 1998, and have increased in 1999, demonstrating our commitment to increase the number of nurses working within the NHS. It should be noted that inflated figures for nursing staff in 1994 are not comparable with later years, due to a new classification system introduced in 1995 (see notes).

<a name="00721w11.html_para0">Any NHS consultant who carries out private work is expected to devote substantially the whole of their professional time to their NHS work. It is for employers and employees to agree the balance between private and NHS work and for employers to take appropriate action if individual consultants do not meet their contractual commitments. Their responsibilities for the clinical care of their NHS patients must come first.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to introduce a decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels.  [132560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00721w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We had envisaged that a limited fishing vessel decommissioning scheme might have been needed to meet our EU obligations to reduce capacity of fixed gear vessels. However, capacity in the lines and nets segment of the fleet is already within the MAGP IV objectives for end 2001, and the tonnage of shellfish fixed gear vessels is close to the 2001 objectives. We do not therefore plan to hold a decommissioning scheme in present circumstances.

<a name="00721w12.html_para4">The council unanimously agreed Commission proposals on CAP prices and aids for the 2000-01 marketing year, reform of the flax and hemp regime and changes to the EU school milk scheme. The flax and hemp reforms will increase the market-orientation of this sector and, following pressure from the UK and others, the agreement includes significantly higher processing aid for the types of flax and hemp produced in this country.
<P>

<a name="00721w12.html_para5">The Council's changes to the school milk scheme represent a major improvement over the Commission's proposal. Following rejection of their proposals originally to abandon this scheme and subsequently for 50 per cent. co-financing, the Council has limited the changed to a reduction of aid from 95 per cent. to 75 per cent. of the milk target price and provision for the dairy sector to contribute to the scheme. Local authorities which wish to do so will thus continue to have the facility to apply the scheme.
