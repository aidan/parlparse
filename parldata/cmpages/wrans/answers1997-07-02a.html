To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his Department plans to spend on advertising the availability of postal votes before the proposed referendums on <i>(a)</i> Welsh devolution and <i>(b)</i> a greater London authority. [5855]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 There will be no Home Office expenditure for these purposes.
<P>

<a name="70702w01.html_para0">Responsibility for publicity on the availability of postal votes in the Welsh devolution referendum and the referendum on the strategic authority for London will be the responsibility of the Welsh Office and the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 Absent voting facilities were publicised at the general election through a television campaign and advertisements in the national press, at a cost of &#163;700,000.

<a name="70702w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if sufficient collection centres will be made available in each police constabulary area to ensure that firearm certificate holders do not have to travel unreasonable distances to hand in weapons prohibited by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997; [5828]
<P>
<UL>(2) what guidance he has given to chief constables on reasonable distances between collection centres which are used for weapons to be handed in as a result of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997; [5827]
<P>
(3) if he will list the police constabularies which intend to make available only one collection centre in their area for weapons which are to be handed in as a result of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997. [5830]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Decisions about the collection arrangements for weapons and equipment surrendered under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 are for the chief officer of police for each force area and we are grateful for their co-operation in this important task. The arrangements in place will differ from one area to another, taking into account such factors as the need to ensure public safety, numbers and locations of firearm certificate holders and registered firearms dealers and police resources. These are matters for local decision and we have not sought to establish a central record of the arrangements in each area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the level of disabled access to polling stations in Wales in the last General Election; and if he will ensure that failures to provide adequate access are remedied before their next use. [6086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Information on the accessibility of polling stations in use in Wales for the General Election is not available centrally. County and County Borough Councils in Wales are statutorily required to designate as polling places for parliamentary elections, so far as is reasonable and practicable, only places which are accessible to the disabled. Acting returning officers may apply to the Home Office for grants towards the cost of providing temporary ramps, where it is not possible for them to use a building for the purpose of a polling place at a parliamentary election which affords easy access for the disabled. Grants are also available for specially adapted polling screens for use by the disabled.
<P>

<a name="70702w01.html_para1">The same provisions will apply at the forthcoming referendum to be held in Wales. In this instance, grants will be available from the Welsh Office towards the cost of temporary ramps.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has to ensure that children are protected from convicted sex offenders. [5601]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government give a very high priority to ensuring that children are protected from sex offenders. There are a number of proposals under consideration, including legislating to enable sex offenders on release from prison to be supervised by the probation service for much longer periods of time, and making it an offence for a convicted sex offender to seek work with, or offer services to, children.
<P>

<a name="70702w01.html_para2">We also plan to implement the Sex Offenders Act 1997 as soon as possible. It will require offenders convicted of serious sex offences against children to notify the police of their name and address and any change in these details and we are determined to make sure the information is used to protect children rather than gathering dust in a file or sitting unused on a computer database.

<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce <i>(a)</i> random breath testing of motorists by police, <i>(b)</i> a reduction in the current legal limit for drink driving, <i>(c)</i> a complete ban on drinking and driving, <i>(d)</i> a ban on carrying alcohol in lorry drivers' cabs and <i>(e)</i> all-year-round campaigns against drink driving. [5968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We have no plans to introduce random breath testing, a complete ban on drinking and driving or a ban on the carrying of alcohol in lorry cabs.
<P>

<a name="70702w01.html_para4">The law already provides the police with wide powers to test drivers for drinking and driving: they may administer a test in the event of an accident, a moving traffic offence or if they have cause to suspect a driver of having alcohol in his body. These powers are used extensively; in England and Wales in 1996 it has been calculated that some 781,000 roadside breath tests were carried out, the highest number ever.

<P>

<a name="70702w01.html_para6">It is the Government's intention to continue with regular drink-drive publicity campaigns, including at Christmas but not only at Christmas.

 A model byelaw is available to local authorities to prohibit the consumption of intoxicating liquor in designated areas. Byelaws do not apply selectively to particular age groups.
<P>

<a name="70702w01.html_para7">We will be implementing the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997. Under this legislation, a police constable may confiscate alcohol from under-aged drinkers and it will be an offence to refuse to hand over the drink.

 The Commissioner informs me that the Head of Number 2 Area Complaints Unit in the Metropolitan Police District has been appointed to investigate the initial response to Mr. Samad's murder, which occurred on 21 May 1997. Upon receipt of his report, a decision will be made as to whether a full disciplinary enquiry is required. At this stage no formal complaint against a Metropolitan Police officer has been made. The murder of Mr. Samad is currently being investigated by a team of detectives.

 I met Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence on 24 June. I was deeply moved listening to the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of their son Stephen. We also discussed broader issues, including racially motivated crime and the relationship between the police and ethnic minority communities. I recognise that a strong case has been made by Mrs. Lawrence for some form of inquiry and I am actively considering what she put to me. I will also consider carefully the other issues that were raised during our meeting and reflect on the best way to address the widespread concern resulting from this case. I hope to make an announcement soon.

Where the release has been agreed on flexible terms, the main differences between these and the terms which would apply in the case of voluntary redundancy are in the length of notice required to be given or compensation payment made to those individuals concerned.

 We have not had any discussions with the British Medical Association on this subject. Department of Health officials, including professionals, are keeping the available research into the medicinal use of cannabis under review. At present, the evidence is inconclusive. The key point is that a cannabis--based medicine has not

been scientifically demonstrated to be safe, efficacious and of suitable quality. This is what has to happen before any drug can be licensed for medicinal use. Misuse of drugs legislation allows for research involving cannabis under Home Office licence. Any proposed clinical trial would have to be submitted to the Medicines Control Agency for approval or exemption in accordance with the Medicines Act 1968. Any application for a licence or a certificate, or both, would be carefully considered.

<a name="70702w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. The arrangements for fraud reporting, which are described in Chapter 37 of <i>Government Accounting</i>, do not require non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) to report frauds to the Treasury. Rather, they report to sponsoring Departments, which are asked to tell the Treasury only of any novel or usual frauds occurring in NDPBs. This approach, which was adopted some years ago, was part of an effort to encourage sponsoring departments to take closer and more direct responsibility for the oversight of NDPBs.

 The Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS) is the European Commission's classification of sub-national areas for statistical purposes, and is managed by Eurostat, the Commission's statistical office.

The draft structure was the subject of wide consultation last summer, and the results of that consultation are incorporated in the final proposals. Dr. Holt, the Director of the Office for National Statistics, has submitted the proposals to Eurostat for their consideration.

<P>
<a name="70702w06.html_spnew15"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 It is for the Environment Agency, in the first instance, to protect controlled waters from pollution through the operation of the discharge consents system set out in the Water Resources Act 1991 and other water pollution legislation. In relation to the proposed sewage outfall at Carrick Roads, Falmouth, the Agency has negotiated the scheme with South West Water as an interim measure to secure water quality improvements to meet the requirements of the Bathing Water Directive, pending completion of the full scheme planned for compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive at the end of the year 2000. The Agency will have had in mind the need to ensure that the discharge meets the water quality requirements of all relevant legislation. This includes the need to meet the requirements of the Shellfish Waters Directive for those designated waters in the Fal estuary at Turnaware Bar and the Percuil River. In addition, the Agency operates a policy whereby, in relation to discharges where the commercial use of an area for harvesting shellfish has been established, no deterioration in water quality should 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 1997 : Column: 186</I><P>
normally be allowed which would be expected to cause a deterioration in the classification of waters at the time of consent determination.
<P>

<a name="70702w06.html_para1">The Agency is minded to allow a discharge consent on certain conditions and subject to post-scheme monitoring of the discharge to demonstrate that its objectives have been met and to request adjustments to optimise the discharge regime in the light of operational experience. However, my Department has received 32 representations regarding South West Water's plans and is currently considering whether the Deputy Prime Minister should call-in for his own determination the associated application for discharge consent.

 There are no specific requirements. However, the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 place a duty on gas transporters and/or emergency service providers to attend the scene of a reported gas emergency and make the situation safe. The Regulations also require those undertaking the work to have the necessary skills, competence and hardware to enable them to discharge their duties effectively and safely.

The Government also provides core funding for the Association of Town Centre Management (ATCM), which has a lead role in the promotion of town centre management. The Government has also provided financial support for three ATCM research projects, two of which I launched on 18 June, "Town Centre Partnerships: A Survey of Good Practice" (undertaken by Hillier Parker and URBED) and "Managing Urban Open Spaces" (undertaken by Chesterton's), and one on "Town Improvement Zones" (undertaken by KPMG) which will report shortly.

 I will launch tomorrow Round Three of the Estates Renewal Challenge Fund and invite Local Authorities to apply for places on the 1998 Housing Transfer Disposal Programme. Transfer will remain a voluntary process and will take place only with the consent of tenants and the local authority.
<P>

<a name="70702w07.html_para1">Local authorities should consider housing transfer as one of the options when developing their housing strategy.

<a name="70702w07.html_para2">Bids for money form the Estates Renewal Challenge Fund must also be set firmly within the context of authorities' housing strategies, and I am keen for authorities to package better and poorer quality housing together.

 Enforcement of the legislation concerning the welfare of animals during transport is the responsibility of local authorities, and Ministry staff liaise with them in relation to this work. In April officers from the enforcement authority for the Welfare of Animals during transport Order 1994, (North Somerset District Council), and the Ministry's veterinary service monitored the arrival of 227 cattle at the Royal Portbury Dock which had been transported from Canada. One heifer calved on the dockside and the movement of these two animals was authorised, after their welfare had been assessed, under a statutory notice to specified premises near Chepstow. A subsequent visit was made to these premises when both the heifer and calf were reported to be in good condition. The remaining cattle were reported to be in excellent condition and were transported to their destination. The containers provided suitable accommodation during this, and on other, sea voyages. No incidents of abrasions, lameness or injury to the animals whilst in the containers were reported.

<a name="70702w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Commission proposal for a regulation concerning the production and marketing of honey was adopted at the Council of Ministers meeting of 23-25 June. The regulation's main aim is to assist the beekeeping sector in dealing with the burden of the bee disease varroa.
<P>

<a name="70702w10.html_para0">The programme will cost 15 mecu annually from 1998 (&#163;10.81 million using the June 1997 exchange rate of 1 ecu = &#163;0.7208). The gross United Kingdom contribution to this new expenditure would be 2.2 mecu (&#163;1.6 million). However, the regulation will involve 50 per cent. reimbursement of eligible items of expenditure made under approved programmes. There could thus be some receipts from the Commission under the bee programme to set against the expenditure, but no final decision has yet been taken. At present we spend &#163;1.5 million annually on bee health measures, some of which would be eligible for reimbursement.

 In general terms, NHS employees who transfer to the employment of a private operator are protected by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE). TUPE protects the contract of employment at the point of transfer to the new employer. Thereafter, pay and other terms and conditions of service may only be changed as a result of the normal joint process of negotiation between employer and staff, and with the agreement of both sides. Under 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 1997 : Column: 198</I><P>

 The Northern Ireland Office is responsible for providing the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland with staff, accommodation and other resources. The Director, who is independent of government, is superintended in the due performance of his functions under the Prosecution of Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1972, by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="70702w11.html_para1">The Northern Ireland Office, both in relation to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and, as part of its general responsibility for criminal justice in Northern Ireland, seeks to maintain and improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system as a whole. Measures in hand include responsibility for an administrative time limits scheme, research commissioned in conjunction with other criminal justice agencies on the time taken to investigate and process prosecutions, and, facilitating work by inter-agency working groups tackling delay issues.
<P>

<a name="70702w11.html_para2">Under the administrative time limits scheme, an overall time limit is set for custody cases of 10 months from first remand before the Magistrates' Court to arraignment at the Crown Court. Within this scheme, time limits are set for individual stages; performance in these stages will depend on various criminal justice agencies including the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Northern Ireland Court Service and not solely the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions. The overall target from receipt of a police investigation file by the Director to committal for trial to the Crown Court is 97 days. In 1996, this was met in 73 per cent. of scheduled cases and 86 per cent. of non-scheduled cases respectively.

 Representations have been received from the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) and the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady), some local councils and the Trade Unions. The need to expand the car parking facilities has been driven by the loss of some 500 spaces subsumed by the planned development scheme. The Royal Group of Hospitals and Dental Hospitals Health and Social Services Trust considered that the private finance route was the only feasible option to expand and improve the car parking facilities. The Trust thinks that the imposition of a car parking charge is preferable to diverting resources from the provision of patient care. Discussions have taken place with the Trade Union side and I am hopeful that the situation will be resolved to the benefit of patients and staff and all those involved in this matter.

From April 1998, local authorities will be expected to produce early years development plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 24 June, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>490,</i> in what circumstances child support assessments may exceed 30 per cent. of an absent parent's net income. [6051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 An absent parent may be required to pay more than 30 per cent. of his net income, as assessed under the maintenance formula, if he is subject to an interim maintenance assessment because he has not co-operated with the Child Support Agency or if he owes arrears. Any absent parent who has co-operated with the

Agency will retain at least 70 per cent. of his net income. In exceptional circumstances, an assessment may also exceed 30 per cent. of an absent parent's net income where the &#163;1 de minimis rule on a change of circumstances applies and assessment is not immediately revised; or where the absent parent is required to pay the minimum amount (currently &#163;5 a week) and his total income is &#163;16.66 or less a week.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit can be paid if a person has worked for an employer for 10 years in certain jobs where noise is a hazard, and they have suffered a hearing loss of at least 50 decibels in both ears due to damage in the inner ear, and in at least one ear this damage was due to noise at work. A person must have worked in one of the specified jobs at some time during the five years before they make their claim. A wide range of jobs is specified in the regulations, and the Government are advised by the independent Industrial Injuries Advisory Council about those jobs which they consider are particularly at risk and should be added to the regulations. The Council is currently reviewing the list of diseases for which benefit can be paid, including occupational deafness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70702w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 My main priorities are to tackle social division and worklessness. Work is the best form of welfare and our New Deal will be an investment in the future of lone mothers, the young jobless and the long-term unemployed. We will also bring forward proposals to extend the New Deal to sick and disabled people. My Department's spending will no longer be used as an alternative to the proper strategy of ensuring that all of our people share in our economic prosperity.
<P>

<a name="70702w13.html_para1">Spending plans for the immediate future, 1997-98 and 1998-99, assume that a number of measures announced in the November 1996 Budget will be taken forward. I have undertaken a rigorous review of this unwelcome legacy and have made some changes. The details of the New Deal for lone mothers and the changes to the proposals I inherited are as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>Lone mothers</i><i></i>
<BR>
We have today announced our New Deal for Lone Parents to help them take-up work. We will offer help and advice on jobsearch, childcare and training to 40,000 lone parents this year and half a million next year.
<BR>
<i>Childcare</i><i></i>
<BR>
The allowance for childcare costs in Family Credit, Housing Benefit, and Council Tax Benefit will be extended and improved to make it easier for lone parents and breadwinners with disabled partners to return to work.
<BR>




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>2 Jul 1997 : Column: 208</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From April 1998 the disregard for childcare costs will be increased from a maximum of &#163;60 to &#163;100 a week where there are two or more children in the family and the maximum eligible age will be increased from 11 to 12.
<BR>
These measures will be financed from the windfall levy and will cost some &#163;200 million over this Parliament.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70702w13.html_para2">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>Child Support Agency</i><i></i>
<BR>
An additional &#163;15 million a year will be invested from 1998-99 to assist lone mothers. This funding will help them by raising an extra &#163;120 million in maintenance and will ensure that absent parents face up to their obligations.
<BR>
<i>Housing Benefit</i>
<BR>
The extension of the single room rent to those aged 25 to 59 will not now proceed in October. The cost of this will be met in part by adjusting the level of non-dependent deductions from next April. We intend to protect the position of those in greatest need.
<BR>
<i>Jobseeker's Allowance</i><i></i>
<BR>
The previous Government decided that the waiting days before Jobseeker's Allowance becomes payable will be increased from 3 days to 7 days from April 1999. However, by managing the cycle of Jobseeker's Allowance payments, we will ensure that nobody will have to wait more than the current maximum time before they receive their first payment of benefit.
<BR>
I am committed to keeping my spending within the ceiling for social security expenditure already announced. I am also committed to modernising the social security system. The following measures will ensure that overall spending is contained and represent a step forward in modernising the system.
<BR>
The time limit of three months for claiming social security benefits will be reduced to one month, in line with the current backdating rules where there is a change of circumstances. These limits will apply to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
<BR>
The intention is that the new provisions will come into force from June 1998, except for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit which is subject to necessary legislation and has a planned date of introduction from October 1998.
<BR>
The alignment of the time limits will be an integral part of modernising and streamlining the social security system and underlines the importance of people making their claims promptly.
<BR>
In addition improved Social Fund loan recoveries allow for the planned level of gross funding to be delivered with &#163;3 million less net budget, releasing these savings to be used elsewhere. The discretionary Social Fund gross budget for this year remains at &#163;467.5 million, an increase of &#163;27.5 million over 1996-97.
<BR>
Other measures announced in the November 1996 Budget but not implemented by the time of the General Election will go ahead as planned. They are as follows:
<BR>
new arrangements for Compensation Recovery;
<BR>
the abolition of the 50 per cent. top-up which allowed certain rents above the average to be met in Housing Benefit;
<BR>
restricting Council Tax Benefit so that claimants with property in Bands F, G and H, have their Council Tax Benefit restricted to that of Band E;
<BR>
removing the right to claim Disability Living Allowance for those aged between 65 and 66;
<BR>
standardising the date on which child allowances are reviewed in Family Credit and Disability Working Allowance.
<BR>
Withdrawal of entitlement to Lone Parent Family Premium in Income Support for new claimants will take effect in April 1998. Withdrawal of the lone parent rate of Child Benefit is subject to necessary legislation, and is now expected to come into effect from June 1998.

<a name="70702w13.html_para3">These measures are necessary to ensure that social security expenditure remains within the previously announced ceilings. The re-prioritising of expenditure in this package is the beginning of an urgent and long overdue reform of the social security system. We have no illusions about the size of the task, but the rewards for getting it right for individuals, for society and for public expenditure are enormous.

The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what was the performance of the Benefits Agency in 1996-97 against its target for processing claims from newly unemployed people.
<BR>
The information is not available in the format requested. Claims made by unemployed people between 1 April 1996 and 6 October 1996 would have been for Income Support and Unemployment Benefit. Performance data on Income Support is not broken down into individual client groups and Unemployment Benefit was administered by Employment Services.

Consultation always takes place before a decision is taken to close a Benefits Agency (BA) advice shop. Preliminary consultation with customers and customers' representatives on the future of Camborne benefits advice shop and alternative possible ways of meeting customers' needs has already commenced.

We are running a two month pilot exercise from 9 June to deliver an advice service from Camborne Employment Services Job Centre (ESJ) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. For the duration of the trial, the advice shop will be closed on those days and open on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The ESJ is situated five minutes walk from the advice shop.
<BR>
Following the trial, an evaluation of its effectiveness will take place, taking into account views of the public and their representatives. We are directing our resources to where they are needed most and BA Divisional Managers, using their local knowledge, will continue to review the service they provide to ensure that the needs of our customers are met and that the tax payer receives value for money.
