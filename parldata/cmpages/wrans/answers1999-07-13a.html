<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister when he intends to publish the Social Exclusion Unit report on 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment or training; and if he will make a statement.  [91008]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Last summer, I asked the Social Exclusion Unit to assess how many 16 to 18-year-olds are not in education, work or training, to analyse the reasons why and to produce proposals to reduce the number significantly. I am publishing the Unit's report today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para0">At any one time, more than 160,000 16 to 18-year-olds--one in 11 of the age group--are not in education, training or work. The young people most likely not to participate in education, training or work during this period of their lives come from backgrounds of poverty or unemployment in the family, have truanted or been excluded from school, have been in care or live in the poorest neighbourhoods. There are clear links between non-participation and other problems encountered in adolescence. Half the young women who are outside education, work or training are teenage parents or carers, and there are links also with homelessness, offending and serious drug misuse.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para1">Non-participation at this time in their lives has a dire effect on young people's future life prospects. By their mid-twenties, they are much more likely than their peers to have no qualifications, to be unemployed, to be poor, to experience poor health and depression and, if they are men, to have a criminal record which damages their prospects of work. The Government have a number of programmes in place to tackle educational under-achievement and youth disaffection, including the setting up of youth offending teams. But more needs to be done. The Unit's Report shows that there is little joined-up delivery of services to young people, and that the end of compulsory schooling at 16 is seen by too many young people as the end of education, rather than as a basis for its continuation. For too many of them, no one is responsible outside the family for guiding them through adolescence and there is not enough effective support to help them overcome personal problems that get in the way of learning. There are also strong arguments for giving more financial help to young people from poor families who want to stay on in education.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para2">The Unit's Report plots a way forward in combating social exclusion among this age group. The Government believe that young people should be given every encouragement and support to stay in full-time education after they are 16 and reach at least a Level 2 qualification. It will ask the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to consult on ways of giving young people who stay in education until 16 recognition for what they have 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 1999 : Column: 90</I><P>
achieved in education and elsewhere. It will build on improvements already in train in education and skills for 13 to 19-year-olds, with a particular emphasis on the education received by young people in custody.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para3">To extend the financial support available to young people to stay in education, the pilots of the Education Maintenance Allowance will be extended to include homeless and disabled young people, and those with high transport costs, for example in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para4">The Report also provides more detail on the new Youth Support Service, which was announced in the White Paper "Learning to Succeed" (Cm 4392) on 30 June. The aim of the new service will be to provide for young people between the ages of 13 and 19 individually tailored guidance and support, in places and ways which meet their needs. The youth support service will be a new service operating in a radically different way. It will look at the broad range of needs which a young person may have, focusing on those who require most help with the clear goal of supporting participation in learning. It will link closely with other agencies in doing this.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para5">It is clear that the best defence against social exclusion is having a job, and the best chance of having a job is to be well educated. This will be more the case in the information age of the future than it has ever been. The years between 16 and 18 are crucial ones; making the wrong decision at that stage can affect a young person's prospects for the rest of their life. This action plan for the whole of Government will help to put young people firmly on the right track.

<P>
<a name="90713w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Jackie Ballard: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what new data series separated by gender, race, disability and age have been commissioned by his Department since June 1997.  [90534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Treasury Solicitor's department holds, as a matter of course, information as to the age and gender of all its staff. In 1998, the department conducted fresh surveys of staff then in post, requesting information on ethnic origin and disability. The survey information is regularly updated as new entrants are invited to complete survey forms on joining. No new 'data series' (internal surveys) have been commissioned by my other departments (the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office).
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para8">All my departments contribute to the 'Mandate' database maintained by the Cabinet Office from which data are taken for the publications "Civil Service Statistics" and "Equal Opportunities in the Civil Service". Furthermore, my departments contributed to the Schneider-Ross report on under-representation of women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities in the Senior Civil Service, published on 7 July by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office.

<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to review the operation of CPS promotion boards following the Bamieh case;  [90378]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w01.htm_spmin3"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The recent decision of the Employment Tribunal, to which I believe my hon. Friend refers, concerns a case brought by Mrs. Bamieh against the Crown Prosecution Service relating to events which took place after 1 July 1997 and before 22 June 1998. The Tribunal found for Mrs. Bamieh in respect of the conduct of a promotion board that took place in 1998 but against her in the other three matters that she put forward.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para9">Mrs. Bamieh's complaint in relation to her performance appraisal report in 1998 failed; however, the Crown Prosecution Service, in any event, introduced a new performance appraisal report that year. The appraisal system is being kept under regular review.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para10">Equally, the Tribunal did not find that Mrs. Bamieh was discriminated against in relation to deputising and temporary promotion procedures; however, it did make observations about the systems in place. The deputising and temporary promotion procedures are currently under review and are being discussed with the departmental Trade Unions. The comments made by the Tribunal are being taken into account.
<P>

<a name="90713w01.htm_para11">The Tribunal's Decision in relation to the conduct of the promotion boards is being taken very seriously by the Crown Prosecution Service, which is currently reviewing its promotion board procedures.

To ask the Attorney-General how many kilometres have been travelled on his Department's business in each of the last three years broken down by <i>(a)</i> foot, <i>(b)</i> bike, <i>(c)</i> bus, <i>(d)</i> train, <i>(e)</i> tram, <i>(f)</i> light-rail, <i>(g)</i> plane, <i>(h)</i> motorbike, <i>(i)</i> car, <i>(j)</i> taxi, <i>(k)</i> river-taxi and <i>(l)</i> other modes of transport; what plans and targets his Department has to reduce the kilometres travelled by private transport by his Department's employees; and if he will make a statement.  [91023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w02.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The information on business travel is not collected in the form requested and therefore cannot be provided. As published in the integrated transport White Paper in July 1998, the Government have set a target that all Government Department headquarters buildings and main buildings occupied by Executive Agencies and Government Offices for the Regions should have green transport plans by March 1999 and all other key buildings by March 2000.
<P>

<a name="90713w02.htm_para0">My Departments have completed green transport plans for their headquarters buildings and are developing plans for all other key buildings in line with the target set in the White Paper. The plans include measures to reduce single occupancy car use by employees for commuting and business travel, including ensuring that journeys are necessary, by making available loans for the purchase of season tickets for public transport and bicycles, and by providing secure bicycle storage facilities and showers.

The approach and climb out routes to and from the base are dictated by the position of the runways and the prevailing weather conditions, and although they do not take aircraft over major residential areas, overflight of some individual properties is unavoidable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We are making every effort to review the case files of pre-1973 Army pensioners to identify the widows/widowers of individuals who might be eligible for a tax refund. Because of the numbers of files, their age and the way in which they are indexed, the process is not straightforward. Individual cases can be processed more quickly if widows who believe they may be entitled to a refund submit a claim to my Department. We have therefore sought to publicise the possible entitlement, and we are grateful for the assistance of the ex-Service organisations in this. It is more difficult to trace more distant entitlements where no pension is in payment because the scheme member and his immediate dependants have died or (in the case of children's pensions) have reached adulthood. But if claims with supporting evidence were submitted, the Inland Revenue would consider them and make a refund if entitlement is proved.

 We support a significant number of initiatives around the world aimed at assisting children with disabilities to secure their rights.

aims to support the implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and other associated agreements.
<P>

<a name="90713w04.htm_para5">Our work in education provides a good illustration of our approach. One of our key priorities is helping meet the International Development Goal of Universal Primary Education (UPE) in all countries by 2015. In many developing countries, the disabled are a group whose chances of gaining access to primary education are slim. We recognise that reaching them and other disadvantaged groups is a distinct challenge for national governments which requires resources, political commitment and flexibility of response.
<P>

<a name="90713w04.htm_para6">In India, we have recently agreed to provide substantial support (up to &#163;34.5 million over five years) for Lok Jumbish, a grass roots movement in Rajasthan, which seeks to support UPE through a range of interventions including the enrolment of vulnerable groups such as the disabled in school. This offers a potential model for developing a more equitable approach to primary education in general, as well as bringing immediate benefits to disabled children. Initiatives such as this are contributing to a wider assessment we are undertaking, with partner countries, of the effectiveness of our support for reaching the "missing children" within the context of overall sector strategies for education.

 We currently spend about &#163;35 million per year directly on HIV/AIDS activities. We expect this to increase in the future.

 Of the 2.5 million people who died of AIDS in 1998, 510,000 were children under 15. Infection runs faster in children than in adults. Children are not only infected with HIV, but also affected: many have lost one or both parents as a result of HIV/AIDS.
<P>

<a name="90713w05.htm_para1">As a consequence, we attach great importance to the particular needs of children. Without a cure, our primary objective is to prevent transmission to children and we are working with others, particularly UNAIDS, to identify ways in which this can be achieved more effectively, for example in preventing mother to child transmission.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Eligibility for resettlement licence, which replaced home leave in 1995, is set out in Prison Service Instruction 36/1995, a copy of which is in the Library. Some prisoners are automatically excluded from release on temporary licence and would not, therefore, be risk assessed. These are: category A prisoners, those subject to extradition proceedings, and those who are remanded on further charges.
<P>

<a name="90713w05.htm_para3">In addition, a prisoner serving four years or more is not eligible for resettlement licence until he or she has completed half the single term, which is the prisoner's parole eligibility date. If the prisoner is refused parole, he or she must wait for six months after a first refusal of parole, or two months from any subsequent refusal, before being able to take resettlement leave. The purpose of a resettlement licence is to assist in the prisoner's resettlement on release from custody. Where parole is refused, this, of course, delays a prisoner's release and accordingly eligibility to take resettlement leave.

<a name="90713w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 A prisoner's behaviour is one of the issues taken into account in assessing risk in a parole review.

All of the mandatory requirements are audited by the standards audit unit of the Prison Service and their implementation determines a prison's success or failure in the audit.
<P>

<a name="90713w06.htm_para5">It is a mandatory requirement that in all establishments, ethnic monitoring and analysis must cover allocation to work, accommodation, education/training, adjudications, temporary release, segregation and requests/complaints. Furthermore, the Prison Service recommends ethnic monitoring is undertaken in other areas, such as random drug testing and random searches. It is also strongly recommended that ethnic monitoring takes place on a monthly basis, collated quarterly and forwarded to the appropriate area office at Prison Service headquarters. These measures are taken to ensure that any possible racial discrimination in the decision making process is quickly identified so that suitable action can be taken.

<a name="90713w06.htm_para6">All members of Prison Service staff in a prison, including civilian and auxiliary grades, must be provided with race relations training at local level. A revised and updated local race relations training pack has recently been piloted in a number of prison establishments and the completed document should be distributed in the autumn. Every prison establishment has a race relations liaison officer and a race relations management team, meeting at least quarterly. It is a mandatory requirement that the liaison officer and all members of the race relations management team attend the appropriate central training course.
<P>

<a name="90713w06.htm_para7">The race relations management teams develop local race relations strategies and monitor performance to ensure implementation of the national policy. Prisoner representation is recommended on this team in order to increase both staff and prisoner perceptions about ethnic minority issues. Where there are practical difficulties in having prisoner representation on the team, such as at a local prison with a high turnover of prisoners, prisons are advised to have a prisoner sub-group chaired by the race relations liaison officer. An increasing number of prisons are involving prisoners in this way and Prison Service headquarters is encouraging them to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Criminal Justice Act 1991 sets out the arrangements for the release on licence of determinate sentence prisoners. Under the Act, prisoners serving a sentence of 12 months or more but less than four years must be released on licence at the half-way point of the sentence. Those serving a determinate sentence of four years or more are eligible for release on licence at the half-way point of the sentence and in any event must be released on licence at the two thirds point. Prisoners serving a sentence of less than 12 months must be released unconditionally at the half-way point.
<P>

<a name="90713w07.htm_para0">Under the home detention curfew arrangements introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, there is now provision for some determinate sentence prisoners to be released on licence up to a maximum of two months earlier than under the arrangements above. These provisions apply only to prisoners aged 18 or over who are serving a sentence of more than three months but less than four years. Prisoners released on this scheme are monitored by electronic tagging.
<P>

<a name="90713w07.htm_para1">Finally, under section 58 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, where a court proposes to impose a custodial sentence for a sexual or violent offence, and considers that the normal licence period under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 would not be adequate, it may now pass an extended sentence on that offender. This means in effect that the offender will be subject to a longer period of supervision on licence.
<P>

<a name="90713w07.htm_para2">The Government have no current plans to change these arrangements.

<a name="90713w07.htm_para5">The 1997 National Survey of Volunteering from the Institute for Volunteering Research found that, across the United Kingdom, an estimated 21.8 million volunteers were contributing an average of 88 million hours per week--an annual total of nearly 4,600 million hours. This compared with the 1991 figure, the date of the previous survey, of 23.2 million volunteers contributing 62 million hours per week--an annual total of around 3,200 million hours. These figures refer to all types of formal volunteering and include sports, arts and politics. Much of this volunteering will have taken place in public sector organisations, for example, schools and hospitals, but the 1997 survey found that 84 per cent. of volunteers were active in the voluntary sector.

<a name="90713w08.htm_para11">The Home Office is committed to reducing the impact that its business travel has on the environment. Before undertaking any business travel, staff and their line managers consider whether the visit/attendance at a meeting is really necessary, whether the objectives of the meeting could be met through correspondence, e-mail, fax or telephone and whether video-conferencing facilities could be used. If it is considered necessary, staff must use public transport unless there are operational grounds for using private vehicles/hire cars e.g. carrying heavy equipment, or if the route is poorly served by public transport.

 No prisoner is allowed to participate in the Home Detention Curfew scheme (HDC) unless he or she satisfies both a prison service risk assessment and the strict eligibility criteria set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Prisoners are not released on HDC if the release would present an unacceptable risk to the victim or members of the public, or if they have a pattern of offending which indicates a likelihood of re-offending during the HDC period, or if they are considered unlikely to comply with the conditions of the curfew.
<P>

The mathematical problems posed will also be available on the Motivate website for others to explore.
<P>

<a name="90713w10.htm_para1">NESTA will support the project for one year. The impact of the project will be evaluated as it progresses and it may be expanded to more students once its impact has been assessed.

 The Regional Development Agencies will later this month publish for consultation their draft regional strategies; final versions will be submitted to Ministers in October. The Secretary of State has issued statutory guidance to Regional Development Agencies about the content and coverage of regional strategies which includes the requirement that strategies should take account of the particular features of the region's rural areas. Separate non-statutory guidance has also been issued which includes a section on rural policy designed to assist the RDAs in considering the rural dimension of their brief, in particular in preparing their strategies.

 The 1997 National Road Traffic Forecasts already take into account our policy of annual 6 per cent. increases in fuel duty until 2002. Continuing the escalator for another two years would reduce the forecast traffic levels for 2011 by broadly 1.6 per cent., assuming there is no significant change in vehicle fuel efficiency.

In periods of severe congestion, because of incidents elsewhere on the road network, vehicles using the bus lane have had savings of up to 16 minutes on journey time.

The Attleborough Bypass and the Fiveways to Thetford Improvement were not sufficiently advanced to be included in the TPI but will be the subject of public consultation exercises in 2000-01 so that if, after full appraisal and statutory procedure, they are eventually endorsed, they can be taken foreword without delay.

The Warwickshire Wildlife Trust assesses the projects carried out by schools as part of its EAF funded work. We in turn assess their performance during each year of grant funding, and will carry out a more detailed terminal assessment at the end of the grant in April 2001.

The values attributed to the prevention of death and injury in a road accident in 1997 prices were <i>(a)</i> fatal &#163;902,500; <i>(b)</i> serious accident &#163;102,880; and <i>(c)</i> slight accident &#163;7,970. The value of the prevention of an accident is slightly higher in each case, because there may be more than one casualty. Detailed figures are published in Highways Economic Note 1, copies of which are in the Library of the House.

 The information on business travel is not collected in the form requested and therefore cannot be provided. As published in the Integrated Transport White Paper in July 1998, the Government have set a target that all Government Department headquarters buildings and main buildings occupied by Executive Agencies and Government Offices for the Regions should have green transport plans by March 1999 and all other key buildings by March 2000.
<P>

<a name="90713w14.htm_para6">We have completed green transport plans covering all our headquarters and main buildings and we are developing plans for all other key buildings in line with the targets set out in the White Paper. These plans include a range of measures intended to reduce the environmental and transport impact of DETR operations, including future reductions in business mileage. The plan for our headquarters buildings includes a target to achieve a reduction of 10 per cent. of business travel miles by car over three years, i.e. by March 2000.

 I am concerned about the practice of some airlines of displaying PSC as a tax. My officials have recently discussed the issue of PSC with representatives of the airlines, and are considering their proposals for ensuring that passengers cease to be misled. The Local Authority Co-ordinating Body on Food and Trading Standards believes that such airlines may be in breach of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 and the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988, and has recently issued guidance to this effect to local authority trading standards officers.

<P>

<a name="90713w16.htm_para7">A Common Position (1999/318/CFSP) confirming these measures was adopted and came into force on 10 May. A Council Decision (1999/319/CFSP) listing those individuals to be covered by the travel ban was adopted and came into force the same day. Immediate steps were taken to implement the ban in the UK.
<P>

<a name="90713w16.htm_para8">The Council adopted Regulation 1064/1999 imposing a ban on flights between the European Community and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 21 May 1999.

The ban allows for exemptions, subject to a consultation procedure, for strictly humanitarian purposes.
<P>

<a name="90713w16.htm_para9">On 15 June, the Council of the European Union adopted a further Regulation 1294/99 concerning a freeze of funds and a ban on investment in relation to the FRY. The Regulation came into force on 19 June. The regulation provides that:

<a name="90713w16.htm_para16">The Council also decided on 26 April to widen the scope of the prohibition on the export of equipment to include provision and export of certain goods, services and technology to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to prevent the restoring/repairing of assets damaged in airstrikes. In line with this decision and pending the preparation of a Regulation to implement it, the UK, while continuing to scrutinise individually all applications for licences to export dual-use goods to the FRY, has granted licences only where the goods are to be used for clearly humanitarian purposes. Following the Council decision, the Commission and member states began preparations to adopt the necessary Regulation. This work has been put on hold, following the end of NATO'S military campaign against the FRY. The UK practice remains in place.

 The information on business travel is not collected in the form requested and therefore cannot be provided. As published in the Integrated Transport White Paper in July 1998, the Government have set a target that all Government Department headquarters buildings and main buildings occupied by Executive Agencies and Government Offices for the Regions should have green transport plans by March 1999 and all other key buildings by March 2000.
<P>

<a name="90713w16.htm_para18">The FCO has completed a green transport plan covering its entire United Kingdom estate. This includes the Department's headquarters buildings in Central London and its sole provincial site at Hanslope Park, some 5 miles north of Milton Keynes. The plan aims to reduce car use by employees for business travel by such measures as reviewing rates of mileage payable to users of private cars and bicycles for official journeys and providing improved facilities for secure storage of cycles on official premises and improved locker and shower facilities for cyclists in order to promote cycling and encourage greater use of public transport.

 A large-scale study by the Medical Research Council, which receives its grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon.

 We are committed to the development of patient-centred care across the National Health Service. It is at the heart of the Calman/Hine report, "A Policy Framework for Commissioning Cancer Services".

<P>
<a name="90713w18.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 I am advised that cordless telephones operate at much lower powers to mobile telephones although they are very similar in their principles of operation. There is a substantial body of evidence relating to the effects of high intensity exposure to radio waves and there are national and international exposure guidelines based on the avoidance of these effects. The advice of the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) is that exposures of the users of modern mobile telephones will comply with these guidelines. It is expected that exposures from cordless telephones will be far lower than those from mobile telephones and the relevant European Standards group has said that measurements are not required at these lower powers.
<P>

<a name="90713w18.htm_para1">The NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation continues to review research on the health effects of electromagnetic fields and NRPB have been instructed to set up an independent working group to assess the current state of research into the use of mobile phones. The findings would be relevant to exposures from cordless telephones also. The group will be chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE. The membership and terms of reference will be announced shortly.

<P>

<a name="90713w19.htm_para0">A small number of bankrupts, an estimated 7-12 per cent., may be deemed to be culpable, including those who deliberately set out to mislead and deceive others. But for those who fail for reasons beyond their control, despite their best efforts to save their businesses, we need a new attitude.
<P>

<a name="90713w19.htm_para1">The Insolvency Service's study suggests that the bankruptcy laws could be changed to allow people who have put money into their business to hold on to enough to cover the deposit for a new home on a pound-for-pound basis matching their investment up to a maximum limit of, say, between &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000. This concession would not apply to culpable bankrupts.
<P>

<a name="90713w19.htm_para2">We now plan to consult on this proposal and on the possibility of differentiating between bankrupts who have been simply unfortunate and those whose behaviour has been unacceptable. The Insolvency Service study suggests that culpable bankrupts could face disqualification from between three and five years, with exceptionally bad cases being extended to fifteen years. On the other hand, responsible risk-takers could be discharged earlier than at present. Six months instead of three years is suggested.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what powers the Government have to revoke export licences; and if he will list the occasions on which licences have been revoked.  [90694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w20.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Powers to revoke export licences are contained in Regulation 3(2) of the Dual-Use and Related Goods (Export Control) Regulations 1996 and in Article 7(1) of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para0">Over the years, a large number of standard individual export licences have been revoked for a range of reasons; for instance, because of the introduction of UN trade sanctions or arms embargoes or in response to wrongdoing. It would entail disproportionate cost to provide details of all these licences.

<a name="90713w20.htm_para1">Details of licences revoked between 2 May and 31 December 1997 were set out in the annual report published on 25 March by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This information would also be included in future annual reports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on progress with the Information Society Directive.  [90398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w20.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The draft EC Directive on copyright and related rights in the Information Society is still under discussion in a Working Group of the Council of Ministers. The European Parliament gave its Opinion in February, and the European Commission have recently published their amended proposal which takes on board many of the Parliament's amendments. As the outgoing German Presidency reported at the Internal Market Council on 21 June, progress has been made on the Directive. However, the common position of the member states is not expected for some time owing to the complex and controversial nature of some of the proposals.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para2">The electronic environment necessitates international harmonisation of copyright laws, and the Government therefore welcome the broad thrust of this Directive and wish to see it adopted as soon as possible. However, there are concerns about certain aspects of the Directive, including the treatment of temporary copies, the approach on exceptions to rights for a broad range of users, and provisions on technical measures. We are pressing in the Council for solutions on these issues which will allow a fair and reasonable balance to be maintained between the interests of all the key players.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Discrimination against a prospective purchaser by an estate agent on the ground that the purchaser will not be, or is unlikely to be, accepting services is an undesirable practice under the Estate Agents (Undesirable Practices) (No. 2) Order 1991. I understand that the Office of Fair Trading is currently considering a number of complaints it has received on this issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the number of employers, broken down by size of firm, who have been fined for paying less than the statutory minimum wage.  [91166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w20.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 No employers have been fined. The overwhelming majority of the non-complying employers discovered by the minimum wage inspectors have subsequently agreed to make good the underpayment, without the need for further action. But we expect a number of enforcement notices to be issued shortly against recalcitrant employers. If these are not complied with, they will be followed by financial penalty notices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if it is his policy to make it a criminal offence after 1 January 2000 for butchers and greengrocers to sell loose goods using imperial measures; and if he will make a statement.  [91076]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w20.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Weights and Measures Act 1985 prohibits the use, for trade, of units of measurement other than those defined and authorised by the Act. The Act was amended in 1994 to authorise metric units only for the sale of loose goods by weight after 31 December 1999. Imperial units are authorised after that date only as optional supplementary indications of quantity and price, alongside the mandatory primary indications in metric units.

<P>
<a name="90713w20.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have regular discussions with both industry and my European counterparts on the future structure of Airbus. All sides are committed to transforming the existing Airbus consortium into a single corporate entity working along fully commercial lines in order to maximise its competitiveness. The Government hopes this will happen in the near future. However, it is for the industrial partners to lead the process and to determine what steps are necessary. At a meeting of the Airbus Governments and industry at the Paris Airshow last month, Ministers asked the partner companies to report by the end of the Summer on their proposed way ahead in transforming Airbus.

<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para7">I understand that Royal Mail are currently looking at a number of initiatives for transferring letter mails from road to rail and the first of these will be introduced between London and Glasgow at the end of August.

<a name="90713w20.htm_para9">On 11 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>222</i>, my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Industry announced that KPMG were carrying out an initial review of the options for BNFL's future structure including, but not restricted to, some form of Public Private Partnership (PPP).
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para10">BNFL is pursuing an ambitious strategy designed to achieve global market leadership in nuclear business. Its objective should be to grow and flourish in a fast-growing global market by exploiting the benefits of its unique expertise in nuclear clean-up and decommissioning. The acquisition of Westinghouse and winning the opportunity to take part in two major nuclear waste clean-up contracts in the United States at the US Department of Energy's 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 1999 : Column: 159</I><P>
Hanford site in Washington and at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory are an integral part of this strategy.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para11">I have now considered KPMG's report and the subsequent work which my Department asked KPMG to undertake. The report states that the need for Government to approve these major transactions has thrown into sharp relief the difficulties which it can face in judging major commercial transactions of this nature. I agree with this analysis.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para12">It is clear from KPMG's work that a public-private partnership, involving a partial transfer of BNFL to the private sector, possibly by a flotation of part of the equity of the company, would be the best way of injecting private sector expertise and entrepreneurial spirit, while holding to the Government's priorities of rigorous safety, health and environmental standards.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para13">I have therefore decided that, in principle, a PPP would be good for the company, the employees, the taxpayer, and the wider community. Accordingly, I am asking my officials to tender for advisers to provide advice on a PPP for BNFL. Our current working assumption is that a PPP would involve BNFL as a whole. The KPMG report noted that there would be major operational and regulatory obstacles in separating the businesses and that such an approach would run counter to BNFL's vision as an integrated nuclear services provider. Existing legislation provides for the sale of up to 49 per cent. of the business.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para14">Before a PPP is introduced into the business, I want to see BNFL achieve improved safety and environmental standards and I must be sure that the taxpayer will get proper value for money, reflecting the company's commercial performance.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para15">I have therefore decided to take an innovative approach, which will set this PPP apart from the privatisations of the previous Administration, and which will focus on BNFL achieving improved safety and environmental standards, sustained and progressive improvement in its commercial performance, and a constructive partnership between management and workforce in developing the skills and capabilities of all those who work in the business. To this end, the Government will, together with the company, explore the scope for developing an employee partnership scheme, with the aim of ensuring that the employees share in the future success of the business, and that they are rewarded for their part in the progress the company makes towards achieving a successful PPP.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para16">In considering my approach to this PPP, I have taken careful consideration of the recent work and advice of the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and the Trade and Industry Committee about the lessons to be learned from past Government share offerings to enable the taxpayer to receive due value from the introduction of private capital, reflecting the company's performance and potential for future earnings.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para17">I have therefore set BNFL a number of specific performance targets.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para18">The targets relating to safety and the environment are being developed with the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agencies.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 1999 : Column: 160</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para19">Both BNFL and I attach great importance to the health of the company's workforce and to its safety. No less important is care for the environment and the need for BNFL to strive towards continuous improvement in this area with the aim of bringing work practices, culture and performance into line with world-class international standards.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para20">The company will therefore build on its recent record in safety, health and environmental performance by aiming at continuous and measurable improvement in these areas against a new and challenging index, based on best practice and developed in consultation with the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agencies.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para21">The new index will reinforce the efforts the company are making to achieve this sustained improvement in achievement in their record on safety, health and environmental protection.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para22">The company, and all the trade unions representing the workforce, will build on their recent success in developing the concept of partnership. This has led to proposals for a new single contract which will enhance skill levels, introduce new competencies and create a flexible mobile workforce generating high value employment opportunities in the communities where BNFL operates. Under the existing Partnership Council involving union representatives, it is intended to monitor progress in implementing the new contract, including measuring targeted improvements in skill enhancement and productivity levels. The company and the unions are agreed that the introduction of a PPP into BNFL could help create a climate in which initiatives to improve productivity would be encouraged and which would underpin and enhance recent progress in establishing a partnership approach within the company. The company will also aim to achieve improvements in productivity as expressed in sales per unit of cost.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para23">The company will seek to enhance its financial performance further through material and progressive growth in the profits generated from ordinary activities. It will also aim to increase the overall contribution made by its US business to BNFL profits, and increase towards 15 per cent. the proportion of BNFL profits derived from the US business. BNFL's progress in winning an increasing share of the US clean-up business will help contribute towards this goal.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para24">In 1997 BNFL set itself the target of achieving cumulative reductions in controllable costs of 25 per cent. by March 2001. This remains the aim: thus far BNFL has achieved reductions in controllable costs of some 14 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para25">The company has established a Liabilities Management Unit to reinforce the strategic management of its liabilities and will, without compromising safety and consistent with the regulatory framework within which it operates, seek to identify ways to manage them more efficiently and effectively through the development of new techniques, skills and strategies.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para26">The company will also continue to sustain a Research and Technology capability which will contribute to the company's overall business performance and enable it to continue to meet high standards of safety and environmental protection.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 1999 : Column: 161</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para27">These targets reflect the company's commitment to high standards of safety, health and the environment; they focus on the key drivers of value in the business; and they acknowledge the importance of developing the skills of the workforce and of productivity gains. Each target is backed up by an understanding between my Department and the company of how it will be measured, the precise details of which must, for obvious reasons, remain commercially confidential. They form a balanced scorecard of stretching targets which provide BNFL--both management and the workforce--with the opportunity to demonstrate that the company can realise its full potential, in line with its "Beyond 2000" Strategy.
<P>

<a name="90713w20.htm_para28">The Government will look to introduce a PPP into BNFL before the end of the current Parliament, subject to BNFL's overall progress towards achieving these targets, as well as the further work which will now be undertaken by my Department and its advisers.

 The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was deliberately designed to be non-discriminatory. If somebody is employed under a contract of employment or any other worker's contract as defined in the Act, he or she is entitled to the national minimum wage. I have received a number of representations on this issue. The independent Low Pay Commission concluded in its first report that "there are compelling arguments for treating disabled people in the same way as other workers". The Commission is monitoring the national minimum wage and will report by December. Officials from my Department, as well as the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security, have been in continual discussions with various organisations connected with disabled and therapeutic workers about the effective implementation for workers with disabilities and in respect of therapeutic earnings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w21.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Court Service, with other users of the criminal justice system, will use interpreters from the National Register of Public Service Interpreters (NRPSI) as the need arises. In civil proceedings, the courts do not provide interpreters; it is for the party concerned to obtain and pay for them. The court can recommend the Institute of Linguists or any other appropriate body.

 The Government received over 4,000 responses to "Who Decides?" on the Law Commission's recommendations about decision making for mentally incapacitated adults. Respondents included many charities working on behalf of incapacitated people; local authorities; doctors; professional organisations and those working with the law. We also received a large number of contributions from individual members of the public. There was much support for the key principles: the functional approach to assessing capacity; the factors to be taken into account when assessing best interests; and the General Authority. There was wide-ranging support for Continuing Powers of Attorney. Many respondents also supported the proposals for Managers appointed by the court to replace the current system of Receivers, with appropriate safeguards. Since consultation closed in March 1998, we have been giving very careful consideration to all the issues involved. The Lord Chancellor intends to publish a Policy Statement in October 1999, which will set out the Government's thinking on a number of the issues raised in the consultation paper.

 Under the Access to Justice Bill, civil legal aid will be replaced by the Community Legal Service fund.

The Government believe that it would be premature to make any decisions on extending publicly funded representation to tribunal proceedings until the review has been completed. The wider Community Legal Service, through Community Legal Service Partnerships (CLSPs), will provide the framework for comprehensive local networks of good quality legal and advice services supported by co-ordinated funding, based on the needs of local people. The CLSPs will base their planning and funding decisions on an assessment of local needs, which will include the need for help with employment disputes.

 The figure was originally derived from national surveys carried out by the Central Council of Physical Recreation. But our calculations, based on experience in the grant-maintained sector (which the Government monitored from 1988) suggest that the 5,000 figure could well be an under-estimate.

 The Department does not currently collate statistics on the number of schools which have their own sports grounds.

 The cost to higher education institutions of undertaking the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise was estimated to be &#163;27.3 million, less than 1 per cent. of the public funds for research which will be distributed by funding bodies with reference to the 1996 RAE results.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the Government's policy in respect of higher education under the auspices of further education colleges.  [90526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w23.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 We are committed to ensuring that everyone who has the capacity to benefit from higher education has the opportunity to do so. The Dearing Report into higher education recommended that the Government respond to increased demand for higher education at sub-degree level and that priority in this expansion should be given to further education colleges. Over the next two years, we are making available an additional 34,000 sub-degree places, the majority of which will be delivered by further education colleges.
<P>

<a name="90713w23.htm_para0">Further education colleges have an important role to play in the delivery of higher education. They widen participation by bringing higher education within reach of most communities and attracting people from households with little or no tradition of higher education. Through their strong links with local business, they are also well placed to provide the skills needed by the local labour market and to help students into work.
<P>

<a name="90713w23.htm_para1">Our confidence in the contribution played by further education colleges is reflected in the latest figures which show that colleges account for 11 per cent. of people studying higher education in the United Kingdom.

<P>

 The Further Education Funding Council published a Circular on the Use of the Standards Fund on 1 June 1999. The Standards Fund is intended to recognise

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90713w23.htm_para6">It is not possible to list the individual financial allocations to colleges at this stage. The Council's first priority is to arrange support for those colleges causing concern and therefore eligible for funding under Strand 1 of the Standards Fund. These colleges have been asked to prepare costed action plans and to submit these to the Council no later than 16 July 1999. Colleges eligible for funding under Strands 2 and 4 have been asked to prepare action plans as soon as possible and by the end of October 1999 at the latest. Strand 3 of the Standards Fund will require consultation and development before training initiatives can be finalised.
<P>

<a name="90713w23.htm_para7">The adequacy of costed action plans provided by colleges will be assessed by the Council before funding is agreed. All action plans submitted to the Council will receive a response within five working weeks. To date, an action plan from Knowsley Community College has been approved under Strand 4 funding and a payment of &#163;50,000 made to this accredited and Beacon college.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the timetable for the development of a national system of individualised pupil records which will assess <i>(a)</i> the value added by each school and <i>(b)</i> the progress made by pupils within them. [90419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w23.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Value added measures, based on the results of individual pupils and measured between two stages of education require each pupil to be reliably identified. Early National Curriculum test results were not collected in this way but suitable data are gradually becoming available. The 'Unique Pupil Number', which we intent to introduce nationally this autumn, will streamline future data collection exercises. In the meantime, we are aiming to publish Key Stage 3 to GCSE/GNVQ value added measures for each school in the 2000 secondary performance tables.
<P>

<a name="90713w23.htm_para8">Schools are also already able to compare the progress made by their pupils (between all the National Curriculum Key Stages, and up to GCSE/GNVQ) with average national progress using a package of information produced jointly in the autumn by the Department, QCA and Ofsted. This is the second year for the package, following an enthusiastic reception from schools when it was introduced in 1998.

 Birmingham local education authority have indicated that they intend to spend over &#163;516 million on education (other than capital expenditure) in their schools during this financial year.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 1999]:</i> There is no obligation on schools to notify my Department or the Health and Safety Executive when pupils suffer serious injury or death on school visits abroad.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) of 5 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 623, if he will describe the special procedures for the All-Work test that apply to claimants with mental health problems.  [90819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90713w26.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Where the medical condition that has caused the incapacity for work relates to a mental disease or disablement, further information is sought from the General Practitioner or psychiatric specialist in order to establish whether the condition is severe enough to justify exemption from the All-Work Test. If this is not the case, or where the position is unclear, a questionnaire will be issued to allow the claimant an opportunity to describe the effect of any physical disabilities and also the general effect of any mental problems they have. Unless it is clear from the questionnaire that the person satisfies the All-Work Test, a medical examination will be carried out. The examination will be offered even where the claimant does not respond to the questionnaire, in order to give people with mental conditions every opportunity to be fully assessed for benefit purposes. This arrangement is different from that for people without mental conditions, who are disallowed benefit if they do not return the questionnaire.
<P>

<a name="90713w26.htm_para0">All doctors undertaking examinations meet minimum recruitment standards which must include at least three years broadly based post-registration experience. Most have a background in general medical practice but many will also have additional experience and qualifications in relevant specialities such as occupational medicine and psychiatry. The stringent approval process requires them to undergo training and assessment. This ensures that they have the special skills and knowledge to fulfil their role in providing good quality expert advice to enable a decision on benefit entitlement to be made.

 The information on business travel is not collected in the form requested and therefore cannot be provided. The number of officials supporting the Secretary of State for Wales now consists of about 30 people and therefore there is not a formal green transport plan. The Department is co-operating with the green transport strategies for Government offices in London.

 The numbers of basic rate and higher rate taxpaying individuals between 1991-92 and 1998-99 are given in table 2.1 of <i>Inland Revenue Statistics 1998;</i> figures for the total number of higher rate individuals for the earlier years 1978-79 to 1991-92 are given in the 1994 edition of Inland Revenue Statistics 1994. For these earlier years, the number of basic rate paying individuals can be derived by deducting the number of higher rate individuals from the total number of individuals.

<a name="90713w26.htm_para4">For 1999-2000, there are estimated to be 20.7 million basic rate individual taxpayers and 2.3 million higher-rate individual taxpayers. These figures were derived from the 1996-97 Survey of Personal Incomes.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 1999]:</i> Our package of corporation tax reforms included not only the abolition of payable tax credits, but also a 2-3 per cent. reduction in the rate of corporation tax. The overall effect on pension funds of these changes will vary depending upon factors like the type of scheme and the investment policy adopted. So it is not clear that steps are necessary to limit the impact on pension funds of the abolition of payable tax credits. But during 1997, when tax credits were available for only 6 months, the average British pension fund manager delivered an overall investment return of 16 per cent. and a real return of 12 per cent., which compared very favourably with an average return for the previous year of around 9 per cent.

The first estimate is that published about 12 weeks after the end of the quarter concerned. The first estimates up to and including Q1 1998 were based on definitions of profits based on earlier accounting definitions. The other estimates are based on the European System of Accounts (ESA) 1995. The difference in definition had little effect on the estimates of growth. The latest estimates were those published on 22 March 1999. The initial estimate of company profits for the first quarter of 1999 will be published in the Quarterly National Accounts Press Release, a copy of which will be available in the House of Commons Library, on 29 July.
