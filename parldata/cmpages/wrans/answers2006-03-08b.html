General Synod however has not resolved to disinvest and the Synod&#039;s resolution does not alter the fact that the Church Commissioners have legal responsibility conferred by Parliament to make their own investment decisions.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60308w04.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 extends the night noise provisions in the Noise Act 1996 to licensed premises. Local authorities will be able to fine those responsible for excess noise from licensed premises between 11 pm and 7 am. Those found responsible for exceeding the permitted level of noise will be liable to a fine of up to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2006 : Column 1499W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
&#163;5,000 upon summary conviction. A local authority will be able to offer the responsible person the option to discharge liability to conviction with the payment of a fixed penalty notice of &#163;500 within 14 days. It is planned to bring these provisions into force in the autumn. They will complement the power to close licensed premises on noise grounds introduced by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also gives local authorities new powers to designate alarm notification areas in which it will be a requirement for those with intruder alarms to register key-holder details with the local authority. Local authorities will be able to contact key-holders in the event that an alarm sounding for 20 minutes continuously or one hour intermittently causes annoyance to those in the vicinity. Local authorities will also be able to enter premises without force, where possible, to deactivate an alarm, and to obtain a warrant to force entry where this is not possible. Silencing misfiring intruder alarms as quickly as possible is particularly important at night. These new powers, which will be commenced in April, are additional to the existing statutory nuisance powers under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

<a name="stpa_39">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste.

<a name="60308w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_40">Legislation is one way of reducing packaging, but consumers have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought &#039;loose&#039; food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers might be encouraged to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.

 Estimates of the type sought are not normally made or held by Government.

In turn, planning authorities are expected to prepare local development documents that reflect their contribution to delivering the regional spatial strategy. At the regional level, regional technical advisory bodies support the work of regional planning bodies and have a key role in assembling data and information on waste including from the Environment Agency.

Local/European electorate and Parliamentary electorate counts for districts in Gloucestershire can be found in Table 2. The 2004 figures are given for comparison with population estimates and the 2005 figures are the latest available data. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are a number of reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">The most recent population estimates for wards are for mid-2002. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care. The margin of confidence for population estimates is proportionately larger at ward level than at local authority level.</p>

</ul>
<p>

 As part of the Government&#039;s Climate Change Programme, various policies are in place to promote energy efficiency across the economy, including in the road transport sector where most oil is consumed. These include EU level voluntary agreements with car manufacturers on the fuel efficiency of new cars and company car tax rules. In addition, the Government recently announced the creation of the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) to introduce renewable fuels into the transport system. The RTFO announcement said that, by 2010, oil companies would be obliged to ensure that 5 per cent. of the fuel that they sell is made from renewable bio-sources.

1. Figures are the total local transport capital allocations (in &#163;000) made for 1998&#150;99 to 2005&#150;06. 1997&#150;98 is not included as some councils&#039; boundaries were changed, abolished or created between 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99.<br>

2. London authorities and the Isles of Scilly council are not included as they are not included in the local transport plan system. The Greater London Authority makes transport capital allocations to London boroughs.<br>

3. Figures for metropolitan areas are county wide and relate to the sum of allocations made to district councils and passenger transport authorities.<br>

4. A few other councils have been combined as they produce joint transport plans.<br>

 This Department has funded research in recent years into different aspects of biofuel production and use, but not detailed consideration of these individual biofuels. Our research has focused instead on the potential environmental and other impacts of significant use of biofuels in the longer term, and on the emissions consequences and economics of various bioethanol and biodiesel blends. We have also contributed to projects being managed by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership which are aiming to create the carbon and environmental assurance schemes to underpin the Renewable Transport Fuels obligation. Taken together, this Department&#039;s expenditure on this research amounts to a little under &#163;200,000. Copies of the reports are available via the DfT website (and can be found by following the links to Roads, Roads and Vehicles, Vehicles, and Vehicles and the Environment).

Defra has published various research reports on the environmental and other impacts of biofuel production in the UK. All of these reports are available via their respective websites.

 I have placed a copy of the Buncefield Investigation Progress Report in the Library. The report describes the incident of 11 December 2005 and the response to it. It sets out what the investigation has determined so far about the likely nature of the explosions and fire that occurred, but contains no conclusions about how they occurred. This information is not yet available. The investigation is continuing its work to identify the root causes of the incident, including establishing exactly how the flammable mixture that gave rise to the explosions was able to form. Further information will be published as it emerges from the investigation.

Notes:<br>

1. An application is defined as cleared if a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a maintenance collection method has been set up and agreed with the non resident parent; a case has been identified as being subject to a reduced benefit decision, claiming good cause, as a change of circumstances to an existing case, as opposed to a new application, or has been closed.<br>

2. Cases in which a maintenance direct arrangement has been facilitated have been included in addition to first payments of maintenance via the collection service, as the former also represent a positive outcome generated for the parent with care by the agency.<br>

3. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>

 Under the Local Authorities&#039; Cemeteries Order 1977, local authorities have a general power to do whatever they consider necessary or desirable for the proper management, regulation and control of their cemeteries, and may put and keep in order any tombstone or other memorial.

 The citizenship curriculum is very broad, giving teachers the scope to adapt the programme of study to respond to the needs of their pupils and local circumstances. Citizenship education helps pupils to develop a full understanding of their roles and responsibilities as citizens in a modern democracy. There are no plans to expand the national curriculum requirements for citizenship at this time.

<a name="stpa_2">The Government&#039;s priority in citizenship education is to support teachers and to equip them with the skills and knowledge to deliver the subject well. We are doing this through both initial teacher training and continuing professional development initiatives. In parallel, in line with recommendations from Ofsted and the Adult Learning Inspectorate, we are commissioning a support programme (to be managed by the new Quality Improvement Agency) which will promote the best practice lessons from the successful Post 16 Active Citizenship Development Programme (which ends in March) to practitioners across schools, colleges, work-based and community-based training.

 Invest NI&#039;s direct support for business is targeted at firms in the manufacturing and internationally-traded services sectors and is aimed at helping them create sustainable employment opportunities through becoming more entrepreneurial, innovative and internationally-focused. Where the agency needs to employ consultants to assist with its work, it is normal practice for such appointments to be made using a competitive tendering process managed by the Central Procurement Directorate of the Department of Finance and Personnel who may seek expressions of interest from both Northern Ireland and external consultants.

<a name="stpa_15">Where energy issues are concerned, Invest NI influence the provision of energy consultancy in Northern Ireland through its support for the Carbon Trust. The Carbon Trust is a UK-wide programme and commissions energy consultancy centrally from a pool of approximately 450 registered with the Energy Institute for the Carbon Trust. In the past year in excess of 300 commissions for energy advisory and technical appraisals were issued for Northern Ireland with around 25 per cent. of these having been serviced by Northern Ireland based consultants.

 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines are used by people suffering from sleep apnoea to ensure they continue to breathe while asleep.

NITB&#039;s bid was unsuccessful however they have reprioritised core activity and ring-fenced &#163;500,000 per annum in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 for regional tourism delivery.

 All of the 351 crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRP) in England and 22 community safety partnerships (CSP) in Wales have responded positively to our seed funding for antisocial behaviour co-ordinators in each CDRP area. Many areas have now gone further and are using funding from a range of sources to establish and support antisocial behaviour teams. Findings from the antisocial behaviour unit&#039;s second national survey of CDRPs in 2005 indicated that 60 per cent. of those CDRPs who responded had more staff than a year ago. Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w28.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour. For example, Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need.

<a name="stpa_22">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and their work in tackling litter and fly-tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour. The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of antisocial behaviour activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w28.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_23">In relation to specific Home Office funding to tackle antisocial behaviour in the last two financial years we have allocated &#163;25,000 to every CDRP in both England and Wales to fund an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator. This amounts to &#163;9.4 million per annum, the funding for 2005&#150;06 is now part of the Safer, Stronger Communities Fund (SSCF) and this arrangement will continue for the next two years (2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08). In order to deal with antisocial behaviour problems effectively, housing providers, local authorities, the police, the courts and the Crown Prosecution Service, and other relevant agencies need to play a full role.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w28.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_24">Local authorities drive many aspects of our work including tackling graffiti, removing abandoned vehicles, dealing with noise nuisance and many antisocial behaviour housing issues. In order to help local agencies tackle antisocial behaviour, we have provided guidance and support to help them to target resources and use appropriate tools and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated.

The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 has been fundamental to our work and has changed the culture of public services and protected our communities. However, while attitudes are shifting, the public&#039;s concern is not yet adequately reflected in the priorities of all our services. The Respect Programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today. People need to see and feel that a difference can be made.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60308w28.html_spnew9"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The information requested is not available centrally. A 2004 Home Office study into the cost of obtaining an ASBO reports that costs have significantly reduced. An earlier review of costs published in 2002 (known as the Campbell report) indicated that the cost of obtaining an ASBO averaged &#163;4,000 to &#163;5,000. The later study showed that the costs of obtaining an ASBO had fallen to an average of &#163;2,500. Costs have fallen as a result of more efficiency as practitioners become more familiar with ASBOs, and the introduction of orders on conviction, which removes the need for separate hearing. The study found that, overall, police and local authorities using ASBOs find them cost-effective. The cost to communities and to society generally of not taking action against persistent antisocial behaviour is much higher. Information on the length of time taken to obtain an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) is not collected centrally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w28.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_25">Immediate respite from antisocial behaviour can be obtained by the use of interim and without notice orders. Orders on conviction and county court orders can avoid the need for a separate court hearing, and can therefore speed up the process. Four ASBOs have issued in the Swindon borough council area: three to males under the age of 18 years, and one to a female aged over 21 years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are being taken to tackle antisocial behaviour in Swindon; and if he will make a statement.  [54565]</p>




<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60308w31.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 There are a number of approaches currently under way in seeking to step up the drive in tackling and preventing antisocial behaviour in Swindon. Swindon has made good use of the range of tools and powers available to them to tackle antisocial behaviour. Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs) are used at an early stage to try to divert an individual away from further antisocial behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_31">The success of this approach has meant that only a small number of those individuals on ABCs have been subject to an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO). Dispersal Orders have also been used, however only where a designated area could be policed appropriately. Swindon has also made excellent use of Crack House Closure powers to tackle drug related antisocial behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w31.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_32">In addition to the use of powers a number of campaigns have been conducted to tackle antisocial behaviour. These include: Operation Graffiti&#151;a multi-agency initiative using Home Office Action Area funding of &#163;40,000 to tackle environmental crime and specifically the issue of graffiti focussing on West Swindon. Operation Crackdown&#151;a publicity campaign to highlight the effects of substance misuse on an individual and in the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w31.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_33">Anti-begging&#151;a campaign to educate the public about where their money that they give to beggars goes, namely Class A drugs, and that most of the street beggars actually do have homes. Operation Pinehurst Safe and Clean&#151;a multi-agency operation to tackle community antisocial behaviour and environmental crime in Pinehurst. There are several multi-agency environmental operations planned for different areas in Swindon throughout the year.

<a name="stpa_34">In terms of preventative work, the Youth Offending Service leads on a number of projects including Positive Activities for Young People, Positive Futures programmes and Splash, all of which aim to divert young people away from crime and antisocial behaviour. Action Area funding of &#163;25,000 is also used to work with those families engaged in antisocial behaviour in the community. There are two types of intervention: a group based programme, facilitated through New College Swindon and an intensive one to one support programme for families who need help.

<p><a name="qn_64"><a name="60308w31.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 17 January 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1282W, on shellfish toxins (use of animals), how many protocols for the detection of toxins in shellfish intended for human consumption were assigned a substantial severity limit in 2004; how many animals these involved; what adverse effects <i>(a)</i> were anticipated and <i>(b)</i> occurred; and on what basis he concluded that the cost benefit assessment required by section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2006 : Column 1604W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Procedures) Act 1986 justified the granting of a project licence in those cases where substantial suffering was anticipated.  [56147]</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60308w31.html_spnew2"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Home Office records show that all protocols for the detection of toxins in shellfish intended for human consumption were assigned a substantial severity limit. In total there were three such protocols for the detection of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) and three for the detection of diarrheic shellfish poison (DSP).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w31.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_35">A total of 6,468 animals were used in the relevant procedures during 2004. The predicted adverse effects associated with PSP are that all animals are subdued after injection. Animals injected with samples not containing toxin will frequently then go on to behave in an apparently normal fashion after a few minutes. If toxin is present, clinical signs of sudden, uncontrolled muscle contractions (which can include jerking movements of the limbs) will occur after a period of time related to the level of toxin present in the sample. Death usually occurs two or three minutes after the onset of initial signs and is due to respiratory muscle paralysis. For PSP testing the predicted adverse effects reflect the actual adverse effects seen. The predicted adverse effects associated with DSP are that animals are subdued after injection. Some animals will appear to recover and behave normally after a period of time that can range form a few minutes to around one hour. Behaviours associated with pain can be observed within this period. Additional adverse effects sometimes seen include diarrhoea and piloerection. Animals injected with samples that contain toxin may, in addition, show signs of torpor, cyanosis of the extremities, a drop in body temperature and weakness/inability to maintain balance, prostration, coma, or may die. These signs are seen within five hours of initial injection, and animals showing typical signs of DSP are humanely killed. Additionally, an atypical DSP response has been seen in some animals within 30 minutes of initial injection, whereby animals show convulsions, spasms of the back legs, prostration, and respiratory difficulties including gasping for breath. Signs may be severe and lead to death or less severe and animals may recover. The adverse effects predicted within the protocols in place reflected the actual adverse effects seen. Section 5.4 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act requires that the Secretary of State shall weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefits likely to accrue as a result of the programme to be specified in the licence. In the case of testing for the presence of marine biotoxins, the benefits of such testing are the protection of public health by ensuring that consumers are not exposed to biotoxins present in molluscan shellfish. European legislation sets the definitive test for detection of the DSP and PSP groups of marine biotoxins as a mouse bioassay. These toxins pose a significant risk to human health because they can cause serious disease, and in the case of PSP, death, in people. The Home Office is committed to replacement of both bioassays when non-animal tests have been developed and validated to a level that ensures the protection of human health. To this end inspectors within the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate are working actively with other UK agencies, the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods, EU

Finished consultant episode (FCE):<br>

1. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

All diagnoses count of episodes:<br>

2. These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):<br>

3. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnoses:<br>

4. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

Patient counts:<br>

5. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HES identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Ungrossed data:<br>

6. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data is ungrossed.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The drop in registrations between September 1997 and September 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in re-registration period from two years to 15 months.<br>

2. The percentages of the population registered with a dentist (or registration rate) have been estimated by including patient registrations in the area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient&#039;s address. Therefore, the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.<br>

</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_6">Jane Kennedy: For many years, patient organisations and health care professionals have sought improvements in the domiciliary oxygen service. The Department asked the Royal College of Physicians to lead a multi-disciplinary working group, which reported in 1999, to review the clinical assessment and prescribing of oxygen therapy in the home. Following a further review, we announced plans for change in June 2003. Organisations representing patients contributed to the specification for the new service&#151;as patients want better access to modern equipment that can help improve their quality of life, including portable systems that enable them to leave the home. These are important features of the new service.
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_7">Health care professionals also contributed to the development of the new service specification, which supports clinical best practice guidelines on the assessment and prescribing of oxygen therapy in the home.</p>

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60308w35.html_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The service has seen little change in nearly 60 years and patients and health care professionals have been pressing for a modernised home oxygen service for some time&#151;one that keeps pace with clinical practice and improves patients&#039; access to equipment that can improve their quality of life. The new service supports clinical best practice in the assessment and prescribing of oxygen therapy in the home and makes available a much wider range of up-to-date equipment to patients.

 A weighted-capitation formula is used to inform revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs). The aim of the formula is to ensure there is sufficient funding to provide equal access for equal need in all parts of the country, and to reduce health inequalities. The weighting applied to populations reflects differences in the level of need.

 The full implementation of the Sentinel programme will transform all the MHRA&#039;s regulatory responsibilities from a paper-based system to electronic working both internally within the MHRA and externally with its stakeholders. The programme, which will run for 10 years, takes forward the MHRA&#039;s information management strategy which was developed in 2000. There have been some technical operational and performance issues in certain areas of the programme which in turn have lead to delays in the day-to-day work of the MHRA. These have or are being resolved and urgent cases are being processed promptly. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. A core part of the Sentinel programme relates to the MHRA&#039;s ability to interact electronically with its stakeholders and several pilots have been piloted with a number of companies prior to implementation. In preparation for electronic working, some 25 million pages of historical data and documents were digitised and loaded into the system. Pharmaceutical companies will therefore have no need to re-submit this original data and will benefit from being able to immediately start working electronically.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for delivering sexual health services to their local populations and resource this from their baselines allocations. Sexual health and access to genito-urinary clinics is one of the six top priorities for the national health service in 2006&#150;07.

<p>

A further &#163;111.5 million will be allocated in 2007&#150;08. Also, an extra &#163;15 million for capital was allocated this financial year for sexual health services and a further &#163;25 million allocated in 2006&#150;07.

In addition to increasing consultant numbers, our strategic aim is to achieve greater diversity of sexual health service provision, which should help to relieve pressure on GUM consultants. This is being supported through measures such as the GUM service review, the audit of contraception services, and greater service provision outside of the GUM setting.

 The inclusion of sexual health in the six national health service key priorities for 2006&#150;07 is a further demonstration that sexual health is regarded as important and mainstream. The national strategy for sexual health and HIV (2001) sets out our long term plan to improve sexual health and modernise services, and identified young people as being one of the groups most vulnerable to poor sexual health. A new sexual health campaign focusing on younger men and women was announced in the White Paper Choosing Health and this builds on previous commitments to public health information aspects of this strategy.
