<P>
<a name="80217w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Lilley: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the proposed system of advanced payments of corporation tax had been in force, how many companies would <i>(a)</i> have benefited and <i>(b)</i> have been disadvantaged if their size had been determined using previous years' profits rather than an accurate estimate of current year profits in each of the last three years.  [29192]




<P>
<P><I>17 Feb 1998 : Column: 525</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> The following table gives broad estimates of the numbers of companies standing <i>(a)</i> to benefit and <i>(b)</i> be disadvantaged if the criterion for allocating companies to the small, medium or large categories for the purposes of instalments (under the modern system for the payment of corporation tax published as a consultative document in November 1997) was related to profits of the previous rather than the current year.
<P>

<a name="80217w02.html_para1">Companies would benefit if their previous years' profits placed them in the small company category rather than a larger profit category, or the medium-sized category rather than the large company category for instalment purposes. Disadvantaged companies would be placed in larger profit groups on the basis of their previous years' profits. The table shows that there would have been substantially more companies benefiting than losing from using previous year profits in 1993-94 and 1994-95 as profits increased quickly after the earlier recession in company profits, but by 1995-96 the difference would have been small.
<P>

<a name="80217w02.html_para2">The estimates however exclude the cashflow benefits to many small companies from the proposed abolition of advance corporation tax and their exclusion from instalment payments. The table assumes that the use of the suggested previous year criterion would include protection against manipulation of accounting periods aimed at lessening the impact of instalments.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the tax burden as a percentage of gross domestic product in each year from 1997-98 to 2002-03 on current taxation plans.  [29183]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> Projections of the tax burden, based on the usual assumption that there are no tax changes beyond those already announced in past Budgets, were published in Table B3 of the November 1997 Pre-Budget Report.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> The only Budget 97 measure likely to have a direct effect on the disposable income of individuals aged under 60 is the reduction from 6 April 1998 in the rate at which mortgage interest relief is given from 15 per cent. to 10 per cent. Relief is limited to the interest on loans of &#163;30,000. As a result an individual and a married couple on average earnings and a &#163;50,000 mortgage will receive

Friend the Prime Minister told the House on 9 July, Britain, together with our NATO Allies at the NATO Summit on 8 July invited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to begin accession talks to join NATO. On 16 December, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, together with his NATO colleagues, signed the Accession Protocols. A debate on NATO enlargement will take place in the House before the Government ratify the Accession protocols.

 We want to see an early enlargement of the Security Council and better representation on it for developing countries. It is widely expected that India, given its long and important contribution to the United Nations, would be a candidate for permanent membership of the Security Council if additional permanent seats were created.

<a name="80217w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The financing of the annual European City of Culture programme is primarily a matter for the authorities of the city concerned. Cities raise funds from their own resources, normally with some support from their national Governments and, increasingly, from private sector sponsors.
<P>

<a name="80217w04.html_para1">The role of the EU is mostly limited to the process of designation. Each City of Culture receives only a nominal sum from the relevant Community cultural programme, Kaleidoscope, to help finance its operations, amounting to approximately 1 per cent. of the City's budget. In 1997, this sum was 400,000 ECU (&#163;273,000).
<P>

<a name="80217w04.html_para2">As part of the overall programme, each City of Culture is also required to produce a report within six months of the end of the year. The report for 1997 by Thessalonika is due by the end of June 1998.

 There are no plans at present to introduce a needle exchange scheme in prisons in England and Wales but I have commissioned advice on this subject.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to implement the recommendations of "Women in Prison: A Thematic Review" by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons.  [29199]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w05.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Prison Service welcomed the report "Women in Prison: A thematic review by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons". The Prison Service is already progressing work in a number of areas highlighted by the Chief Inspector's report.
<P>

<a name="80217w05.html_para7">In his thematic review, the Chief Inspector recommended that there should be a Director of Women's Prisons. This was considered within the structural review of the Prison Service which was completed recently. The Director General accepted the recommendation of the review and has created a Directorate of Regimes within which there will be a number of Assistant Directors responsible for developing policy for specific groups of prisoners. An Assistant Director for Women and an Assistant Director for Young Offenders have been appointed.
<P>

<a name="80217w05.html_para8">Work to develop regimes for women encompasses the areas of concern highlighted by the Chief Inspector. The Prison Service in the coming year will be piloting new constructive regimes in two women's establishments. Initiatives also in hand at the moment include: re-examination of the policy on age mixing; the development of programmes to address offending behaviour specifically tailored to women's needs; training 



<P>
<P><I>17 Feb 1998 : Column: 539</I><P>
programmes for those working with women in prison; and work on a protocol for dealing more effectively with disruptive women prisoners.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the appropriateness of custodial sentences for the majority of women offenders.  [29200]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Prison is necessary for the most serious offenders, whether male or female, when the court considers such a sentence is necessary in order to protect the public or when other penalties are not appropriate. The Government wish to see full use of community sentences for women and we are seeking to increase the effectiveness of such sentences. Where prison is the sentence decided by the court, we want the time to be used constructively so that offenders are less likely to reoffend when released rather than more likely to offend or to offend more seriously. This principle applies to both men and women in prison. Last month, we announced a pilot programme of work with young prisoners before release to increase the likelihood that they will be able to succeed in the New Deal after release and go on to find work.
<P>

<a name="80217w05.html_para9">A number of new developments are taking place specifically in relation to Prison Service establishments for women. An Assistant Director for Women has recently been appointed. New regimes will be piloted in two women's establishments in the coming year. The Service is re-examining the policy on age mixing. Programmes for women to address offending behaviour are being designed. Work is in hand to deal more effectively with difficult and disruptive women prisoners. New training programmes are being brought in for staff. The Prison Service is working towards the standards set out in the Department of Health publication 'Changing Childbirth', revising policy on pregnant women in prison and mother and baby units; and medication levels in establishments for women are being reviewed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if Clause 27 of the Data Protection Bill [<i>Lords</i>] applies to those personal data processed by the Security Service which are intended to assist the police in relation to serious crime; and if he will make a statement.  [29116]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Clause 27(1) provides that personal data are exempt from the data protection principles and from Parts II, III and V and clause 52 of the Bill if the exemption is required to safeguard national security. Clause 27(2) provides for Ministerial certification of the need for exemption and clause 27(4) allows appeals by people directly affected. The form of exemption in respect of personal data processed by the Security Service is under consideration.

 I am afraid that the information is not readily available in the precise form requested. However, following is a table giving a percentage breakdown of the costs to non-Government organisations by reference to the main categories of additional spending.

<a name="80217w06.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the compliance of measures in the Data Protection Bill [<i>Lords</i>] with the requirement for a definition of consent set out in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46/EC; and if he will make a statement.  [29041]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Directive does not require us to amplify the terms it uses. We consider that the Bill gives proper effect to the requirements of Community law.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list those cases, with respect to the lawful processing of sensitive personal data under Schedule 3 to the Data Protection Bill [<i>Lords</i>], where the Secretary of State has used Article 8(4) of Directive 95/46/EC to specify additional exemptions; if he will list the reason for each exemption; and if he will indicate the nature of the suitable safeguards which are intended to protect the data subject.  [29115]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Article 8(4) of the Directive, relating to reasons of substantial public interest, is reflected in paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 to the Bill. The latter provides an exemption for processing which is necessary for the administration of justice, the exercise of functions conferred by any enactment or the exercise of any function of the Crown, Minister of the Crown or Government Department.
<P>

<a name="80217w06.html_para2">The exemption is necessary to enable the conduct of legitimate functions as authorised by Parliament. The safeguards are the legal constraints on the discharge of the functions in question and more specific provisions included in some of the relevant statutes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the protection afforded to the media in the Data Protection Bill [<i>Lords</i>].  [29044]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Clause 31 of the Bill exempts processing for special purposes (journalistic, literary or artistic purposes) from some provisions of the Data Protection Bill. The processing must take place with a view to publication and the data controller must reasonably believe both that publication, having particular regard to the special importance of freedom of expression, is in the public interest and that complying with the data protection rules is incompatible with the special purposes.
<P>

<a name="80217w06.html_para3">Clause 42 allows the Data Protection Commissioner to serve a special information notice on the data controller for the purpose of ascertaining whether the processing is being undertaken only for the special purposes and with a view to publication. Clause 44 restricts the ability of the Commissioner to serve an enforcement notice on a data controller in respect of processing for the special purposes unless it does not meet the necessary criteria and the court has granted leave for the notice to be served.
<P>

<a name="80217w06.html_para4">Challenges may be made after publication; but the exemption still applies if the conditions are satisfied.
<P>

<a name="80217w06.html_para5">In line with Article 9 of the European Communities Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), these provisions are intended to reconcile the privacy protections in the main data protection regime with the needs of freedom of expression.

<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to <i>(a)</i> Recital 10 of Directive 95/46/EC and <i>(b)</i> the exemptions in the Data Protection Act 1984 relating to crime and taxation, if he will make a statement on Clause 28(4) of the Data Protection Bill [<i>Lords</i>] in respect of <i>(a)</i> the UK's obligations towards Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention and <i>(b)</i> the lessening of protection afforded to data subjects.  [29043]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Clause 28(4) provides a power for the Secretary of State, by order subject to affirmative resolution, to exempt from the first data protection principle, subject access rights and non-disclosure provisions any processing relating to the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of taxes.
<P>

<a name="80217w06.html_para6">No decision has been taken on the precise use of this power. Before taking such a decision, we would have full regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and the 1995 European Communities Directive on Data Protection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how frequently, after what delays, and with what precision, he publishes information on the number of people convicted for the first time of a standard list offence.  [29672]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Information is published annually on people convicted of a standard list offence for the first time. The most recent figures are for 1995 and were published in November 1997. They appeared in Chapter 9 of "Criminal Statistics, England and Wales, 1996" (Cm. 3764). Information is based on a sample of those convicted of a standard list offence in three sample weeks and is presented as a percentage of the total sample.
<P>

<a name="80217w06.html_para7">In 1995, the sample size was 18,000 (out of an annual total of 353,000). In 1995, the estimated percentage of offenders with a first conviction was 35 per cent. The chance that the annual rate differs from this by more than one percentage point is about 1 in 200.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on how many occasions during the past six months his Department has been unable to reply to letters from hon. Members within one month of receiving them; what assessment he has made of the adequacy of his departmental performance in replying to inquiries by hon. Members; and if he will make a statement.

 Between 1 September 1997 and 13 February 1998, 5,681 of the 9,948 letters received from hon.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is my Department's policy to acknowledge or reply to all correspondence received from the general public. I am not able to state how many times over the past six months a reply has been given that an original letter cannot be traced, since at present there are no systems in place to monitor the progress of general correspondence. However, a monitoring system is shortly to be installed as part of a project to improve the handling of correspondence.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The class (A, B or C) under which a controlled drug is listed under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 determines the maximum penalty for offences (essentially unlawful productions, supply or possession) involving that drug. The broad principle governing the classification of a drug is its harmfulness. The greater it is the higher the classification. The benzodiazepines, of which flunitrazepam is one, are used as hypnotic and anxiolytic medicines and are all in class C.
<P>

<a name="80217w07.html_para6">It is the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985 which determine the degree of regulation over a controlled drug and, following a decision by the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, we plan to lay before Parliament shortly amendments which will, subject to Parliamentary approval, impose tighter controls on flunitrazepam with effect from 1 May 1998 by moving it from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3 of the Regulations. The change was agreed by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. As a result of the re-scheduling, it will become an offence to possess the drug without lawful authority; imports and exports will become controlled; and safe custody requirements will apply. We have no plans to consult the Council further at this stage.

It estimates that the prison population will increase from the current level of around 64,000 to an average of 69,600 in 1999 and 72,200 in the year 2000. If trends in court sentencing practice continue as in recent years the population is expected to reach 82,800 by 2005. Alternative scenarios in the projection give a population for 2005 of between 64,400 and 92,600.
<P>

<a name="80217w08.html_para0">The projection does not take account of Home Detention Curfew which is expected to result in a fall of around 3,000 prisoners by the end of 1999. Nor does it take account of the measures in the Crime and Disorder Bill or possible changes in trends in community sentences.
<P>

<a name="80217w08.html_para1">To accommodate the rising population, my right hon. Friend has made an adjustment to the additional resources made available to the Prison Service last July. I refer the right hon. Member to the reply my right hon. Friend gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) on 13 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>402-03</i>.
<P>

<a name="80217w08.html_para2">The additions to capacity together with the implementation of Home Detention Curfew should contain the projected prison population below planned capacity until 2001. The building of new prison capacity beyond 2001 is under discussion as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

Prisoners in England are not routinely tested for hepatitis C. We understand from Her Majesty's Prison Service that information on the numbers of prisoners infected with hepatitis C is based on voluntary disclosure or testing. This information has been collected only since 1995. In the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97, there were 543 and 760 reports of prisoners infected with hepatitis C respectively.<P>

 Low flying continues to be an effective means of penetrating hostile air defence systems. It require rigorous training and continuous practice in a realistic environment, subject to stringent regulation to ensure that it is carried out safely while minimising disturbance to those on the ground.

<P>
<P>

<a name="80217w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The amount of low flying training undertaken throughout the United Kingdom is limited to that strictly necessary for aircrews to achieve and maintain operational effectiveness.

<a name="80217w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 18 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>280</i>, on Land Rovers, if he will list the planned changes in EU Regulations concerning exhaust emissions with which it would be difficult for the 110 series Army Landrover to comply; and what representations the Government have made to the EU about such exhaust emission regulations.  [27195]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 1998]:</i> EU Directives to reduce vehicle emissions apply at the date of vehicle manufacture and are not retrospective. All Land Rover Defender 110 Series vehicles in service with the MOD complied with the emission regulations in force at their date of manufacture, and the Trucks Utility Medium (High Specification) vehicles now being delivered comply fully with current EU regulations. Future EU Directives will require the motor industry to comply with more stringent emission limits. As such, EU Directive 96/69/EC will set tighter limits for mass carbon monoxide, combined hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, and particulates for this class of vehicle manufactured after 1 October 1998. Beyond that date, future legislation has not been fully defined. It is not MOD policy to seek exemption from EU Directives on emissions levels relating to these vehicles.
<P>

<a name="80217w11.html_para3">The Government are committed to reducing pollution by cutting emission levels. We are, therefore, exploring ways in which the emissions of all the in-service Land Rover vehicles, including the 110 Series vehicles, could be reduced.

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> Since 1 May, the Regional Director for the North East has taken early retirement. Most Senior Civil Servants have taken leave during that period, but we do not keep central records. None has been dismissed. There have been ten staff moves within the department involving posts at or above a level equivalent to what was formerly Grade 3. These have all been routine moves for career development or operational reasons (for example because a post has been abolished or a new one created). There have also been two loans and one permanent transfer at that level to other Government Departments; one case was because of Machinery of Government changes; the others involved progression to more senior levels in the Senior Civil Service. Moves at this level are the subject of discussion with individuals and their line managers during which it is normal for a number of options to be considered.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what representations she has made to the Government of Japan concerning the tax regime for whisky in that country and on the need for adequate regulations on the definition and labelling of whisky.  [27902]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> The long-standing dispute with Japan over discriminatory taxation of imported spirits, including Scotch Whisky, was resolved during December 1997. An agreement has been negotiated with Japan, building on the interim settlement reached in January 1997. Letters were exchanged between the European Commission and the Japanese Government on 24 December 1997. The new agreement now guarantees a level playing field on taxation for our spirits exports to Japan. In addition to accelerated equalisation of tax rates, exports of whisky and brandy will also benefit from the total elimination of import tariffs by 2002. These significant, new tariff concessions will also apply for the very first time to gin, vodka, rum and liqueurs. DTI officials were closely 



<P>
<P><I>17 Feb 1998 : Column: 569</I><P>
involved in negotiations with the Japanese Government and the final agreement was concluded with the full support and endorsement of the Scotch Whisky Association and the Gin and Vodka Association.
<P>

<a name="80217w14.html_para5">Whisky exports to Japan were worth &#163;129 million in 1996, and have already seen a 33 per cent. rise since 1 October 1997, when the first tranche of tax cuts were introduced. This new agreement presents even greater opportunities for the growth of British spirits exports, which this Government will continue to help the industry to pursue as appropriate. This case also shows the effectiveness of the WTO in dealing with trade disputes and sends an important signal to other countries which continue to tax foreign spirits at a higher rate than those produced domestically.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w14.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what discussions she has had with her European counterparts regarding action to ensure Japan and Taiwan introduce non-discriminatory taxation for (i) EU spirits and (ii) Scotch whisky.  [27903]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> In the case of Japan, I refer the hon. Member to my earlier answer.
<P>

<a name="80217w14.html_para6">In the case of Taiwan, officials in this Department continue to work closely with their colleagues in the European Commission and in fellow EU Member States to press Taiwan to put an end to its discriminatory taxation of imported spirits. The current discrimination particularly affects the UK's Scotch whisky and the Irish whiskey industries, but France has concerns over brandy, as do other Member States on white spirits. As a result of such consensus between the UK and other Member States, the European Commission has maintained a strong line with Taiwan during its bilateral market access negotiations over Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
<P>

<a name="80217w14.html_para7">In November last year, the Head of the British Trade & Cultural Office in Taipei and his French counterpart wrote a joint letter to Taiwanese President Vincent Siew urging immediate equalisation of taxation on all spirits. Disappointingly, this request was rejected. Nevertheless, the UK, other Member States and the Commission are continuing to keep up the pressure.
<P>

<a name="80217w14.html_para8">UK officials both in London and Taipei have conveyed their disappointment to Taiwan over this response and their expectation of a speedy end to the tax discrimination, as has Sir Leon Brittan, Vice-President, European Commission, in a recent letter to the Taiwanese Minister of Finance, Paul Chiu.
<P>

<a name="80217w14.html_para9">The discriminatory taxation on imported spirits, along with other concerns--notably on the lack of Taiwanese legislation on spirits definitions--is one of the key issues holding back an EU-Taiwan market access agreement in relation to Taiwan's accession to the WTO. Officials in this Department will, therefore, remain in close contact with the European Commission to ensure that it continues to reflect the UK's and other Member States' concerns on spirits in negotiations with Taiwan on WTO accession, the next round of which takes place in Taipei from 23-25 February.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 1998]:</i> In the Commission's communication "Agenda 2000" published on 16 July 1997, it was suggested that the proportion of EU population covered by the geographically targeted Objectives of the Structural Funds should be reduced from 51 per cent. to between 35 per cent. and 40 per cent. The Government are still considering this proposal. While geographic concentration of some kind may be one way of containing the overall cost of the Funds and thus assist EU enlargement, the Government have suggested that this should not increase the average per capita Structural Funds allocations of regions retaining eligibility for the same Objective, particularly if other regions lose eligibility.

<a name="80217w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The UKAEA has developed a strategy for the safe management and disposal of the sodium contained within the Prototype Fast Reactor and the Sodium/Potassium in the Dounreay Fast Reactor. These strategies, and the resultant programmes of work, are agreed with the DTI and the independent Regulators (the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) and are currently being implemented. The UKAEA have used a large number of external advisers in the formulation and implementation of their strategies and plans for the two reactors. The choice, selection and record of which advisers have been used is an operational matter for the UKAEA. As it is Government policy to ensure good value for money by tendering for the work, the cost estimates for this work and the contract value which will be subject to tender are commercially confidential.

 It is not possible to isolate the impact of currency fluctuations from other factors that determine farm incomes.

 Forecasts of road traffic growth for Scotland are not produced separately from the National Road Traffic Forecasts for Great Britain published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The latest forecasts, published in October 1997, take no account of our developing transport policies. On the central estimate, the forecast shows an increase in road traffic of 38 per cent. between 1996 and 2016 and 60 per cent. from 1996 to 2031.

<a name="80217w18.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will list the scientific organisations which have been consulted about the composition of the NESTA Board.  [29048]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The National Lottery Bill would require me, before appointing NESTA's Trustees, to consult representatives of bodies active in science, technology and the arts. In preparation for the establishment of NESTA, my Department is seeking the views of a wide range of bodies and individuals, many of which are active in more than one of these fields. It is not, therefore, possible accurately to identify scientific organisations alone. The complete list of bodies being consulted is given. In addition, all those who responded to the proposals for NESTA in our consultation paper "The People's Lottery" have been informed of the process for identifying candidates for these posts and their views are welcomed. The posts of Chair and Trustees of NESTA are also being advertised in the national press.

 Environmental appraisal, whether for policies, projects or programmes, covers a range of skills which are acquired by staff across Government through various routes, including formal training, learning on-the-job and reading guidance documents. Figures are not collected centrally for the numbers of staff, in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions or in other Government departments, trained in these various ways. I understand, however, that the Civil Service College gives formal training on environmental appraisal in courses on Option Appraisal for economists and on "Spending Public Money Wisely" for fast-stream administrators; both of these normally run twice annually with an attendance of about a dozen each time, and each has run once since 1 May 1997.

 In 1996, there were 270 children (aged 0-15) killed in road accidents in Great Britain. In 1995, the most recent year in which sufficiently detailed data is available to analyse drink drive casualties by age, it is estimated that 15 children were killed in accidents involving a driver with an illegal level of blood alcohol. No figures are available for children killed in accidents involving a speeding driver or a driver under the influence of drugs although research suggests that around one third of all accidents involve excessive speed. Recent research is also beginning to indicate a greater presence of drugs in drivers killed in road accidents, although we have no evidence as to the causative effect of drugs in such accidents and no information is available regarding child casualties in such accidents.

 The work of English Nature is under regular scrutiny. The annual Corporate Planning round provides an opportunity to assess performance, identify priorities and assist the allocation of resources.
<P>

<a name="80217w21.html_para7">English Nature was brought into existence in 1991 as a result of the re-organisation of the former Nature Conservancy Council. Its work was reviewed in 1994 when a study was carried out into the possibility of merging English Nature with the Countryside Commission. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee, through which English Nature in conjunction with Scottish Natural Heritage and the Countryside Council for Wales, carries out some of its functions assigned to it by the Environmental Protection Act 1990, has also recently undergone a strategic review. In common with Government Departments and the other Countryside Agencies, the role of English Nature is being examined as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w22.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I have no proposals to remove gas bullets from residential areas. Gas bullets are used to store gas at high pressure and currently there are twelve such notifiable hazardous installations in Great Britain. All are subject to health and safety legislation requiring operators to submit a safety report which sets out the measures taken to ensure safety at the installation to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Assessment of these reports takes into account predictive, technical and operational elements, and consideration of the causes and consequences of major accidents on the site. An assessment of on-site and off-site risks and details of control measures on the site are also made.
<P>

<a name="80217w22.html_para0">HSE also sets a "consultation distance" around these installations. The Local Planning Authority (LPA) is required to consult HSE on planning applications within the consultation distance, to give HSE the opportunity to provide advice on safety issues affecting the proposed development. However, the ultimate responsibility for deciding on planning permission rests with the LPA.
<P>

<a name="80217w22.html_para1">HSE's advice is based on residual risks posed by an installation of this type, after the overall risks have been reduced to a level which is as low as reasonably practicable. The basis for the advice and the criteria used by HSE in formulating such advice are set out in "Risk criteria for land-use planning in the vicinity of major industrial hazards", published in 1989 by HMSO.
<P>

<a name="80217w22.html_para2">HSE has set a consultation distance around the notifiable hazardous installation operated by BG Transco, Gloucester Road, Cheltenham. In 1997 HSE was asked to advise the LPA in Cheltenham on two planning applications within the consultation distance of the Gloucester Road site. Both cases were passed to HSE's Major Hazards Assessment Unit (MHAU).
<P>

<a name="80217w22.html_para3">The first case involved the conversion of land adjacent to the BG Transco site into a play area for Gloucester Road Primary School. MHAU's assessment led HSE to advise against granting planning permission. The assessment was based on developed policy which is to advise against developments involving vulnerable populations (such as school children) in the consultation zone.
<P>

<a name="80217w22.html_para4">The second case also involved the provision of a play area for the same school; it required the demolition of a house and social club and conversion of a small area of land adjacent to the school. This was further away from the BG Transco site than the first case, but still within the consultation zone. MHAU's assessment took account of the overall reduction in the population at risk and the small increase in area of the school. It was felt that this development would not put children at greater risk and in this case HSE did not advise against granting planning permission.
<P>

<a name="80217w22.html_para5">Formal assessments of the safety risks at the Gloucester Road site were undertaken during 1992 and 1995. A further safety report is due shortly.

 The purpose of the Peat Working Group has been to collate factual information and to advise my Department on the relevant issues. Its membership comprised organisations with a statutory responsibility for either conservation or planning control over peatlands together with the peat industry, who have property and working rights on a number of the bogs. Nature conservation interests were covered by the statutory countryside conservation agencies. The conservation non-governmental organisations (NGOs) together with other interested parties were invited to provide the Group with factual information. Meetings were held between these and officials from my Department on a number of occasions. These organisations were also consulted on the contents of the draft Mineral Planning Guidance Note No. 13 issued in 1995. However, at a recent meeting between officials and representatives of the conservation NGOs, an invitation was extended to them to be represented on the Group when it next meets. I understand that the invitation has been accepted.

Upon first finding evidence of varroa infestation in Devon in 1992, a SIA was declared with movements across the boundary being strictly controlled.

Now that the SIA covers the whole of England and Wales, the need for formal searches there has been removed. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, random Spring and Autumn searches continue to be carried out.

 Foreign investment can make a substantial contribution to development and the elimination of poverty. Many developing countries, particularly the least developed, are currently marginalised from global investment flows. The Government believe that a better international framework for investment has an important part to play in helping to meet the objective of eliminating poverty. My Department is commissioning a study of the development implications of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) which will be ready in good time to present to our negotiating partners before the agreement is concluded.

 Provision for suspending payment of benefit pending resolution of a factual or legal doubt as to entitlement has existed since 1946. We are committed to the principle that benefit should go only to those entitled to it. It would be irresponsible to allow irrecoverable overpayments to accumulate during periods when entitlement is in doubt. This principle is safeguarded by the power to suspend payment in certain circumstances--a power which is being carried forward in the Social Security Bill currently before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="80217w26.html_para9">Regular statistics are not kept on the numbers of suspensions imposed. However, a scan of the Income Support computer system in July 1997, found that, of all those entitled to Income Support at any one time, less than 0.5 per cent. had payment of benefit suspended or withheld. Estimated numbers are significantly less for most other benefits.

 The Winter Payments scheme will help all pensioner households with fuel bills to pay, and give the most help to the poorest. It is an unprecedented initiative, which dwarfs any action taken by any previous Government to tackle winter cold.
<P>

<a name="80217w26.html_para10">It is important that pensioners know as soon as possible how much they will receive, as well as how and when the payment will be paid so that they can plan with confidence and turn up their heating if there is a spell of cold weather. The simplest and most cost-effective way to let them know that a payment will be made is through publicity. Therefore, a multi-media campaign, including television advertising was launched in conjunction with Help the Aged, Age Concern and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux.
<P>

<a name="80217w26.html_para11">Approximately &#163;850,000 is being spent on television advertising, in 1998, to inform pensioners about Winter Fuel Payments.
<P>

<a name="80217w26.html_para12">Television slots are purchased regionally according to the audience profile of programmes. On average, approximately 82 per cent. of the slots fall between 9am-5pm and 18 per cent. between 5pm and 11pm. No slots have been purchased between 11pm and 9am.
<P>

<a name="80217w26.html_para13">The television campaign, which is still running, has been designed to reach over 70 per cent. of the target audience with at least five opportunities to see the advertisement.
<P>

<a name="80217w26.html_para14">There has been no expenditure, in 1998, on television advertising on other benefits.

 We would encourage anyone who thinks that they may be entitled to a benefit to make a claim, wherever they live in Britain. We are particularly concerned about the million pensioners not claiming Income Support. We have commissioned research to find out why they do not make a claim, and from April we will be spending &#163;15 million on a number of pilot projects to find the best way of encouraging them to claim. We will take into account any factors which may effect their reluctance to make a claim, including the type of area in which they live.

1. By way of comparison average equivalised incomes for the whole population were &#163;289 per week BHC and &#163;250 per week AHC.<P>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest pound and are in June 1997 prices. The measure of DLA used is combined measure of both the care and mobility elements.<P>

3. Average figures given show equivalent &#163; per week where income has been adjusted for household size and composition. The table also show the money values this average represents for different household types.<P>

4. This answer draws on the departments Households Below Average Income series based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the 1995-96 financial year and covering Great Britain, and as such the following points should be noted:<P>

(i) Recipients in institutions are not covered by the Family Resources Survey.<P>

(ii) The FRS is a sample survey and all estimates must be treated as approximate.<P>

 The latest available information is for the 1995-96 tax year. 11,000 recipients of Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) (in Great Britain) would have had their earnings related element of SMP reduced if there was a limit on the amount of SMP paid equivalent to the weekly upper earnings limit on which National Insurance contributions are payable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will assess the advantages of allowing invalid care allowance to be paid in addition to a state-funded pension.  [23351]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It remains a basic principle of the Social Security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid to a person for income maintenance. Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) is designed to provide a measure of income maintenance during periods in which the claimant cannot work because of caring commitments. To pay in full in addition to another income maintenance benefit such as Retirement Pension, would be duplicating provision for the same need.
<P>

<a name="80217w30.html_para5">When a person is eligible for more than one benefit at the same time however, there are safeguards to ensure that she does not lose financially. In practice, Retirement Pension (RP) is paid in full taking precedence because it is the contributory benefit. If RP is higher then ICA, as frequently happens, no ICA is payable. However, if ICA is higher, then the "extra" is used to top-up the RP to the ICA rate.

[25412]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80217w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Payments from mortgage payment protection policies are treated differently from payments from other creditor insurance on which subject Departmental officials and representatives of the insurance industry have recently held a number of meetings. Mortgage payment protection insurance used to pay the normal liabilities associated with a mortgage, such as capital, endowments and PEPs is generally ignored in the calculation of benefit. If payment is made direct to the lender, the full amount is ignored. If paid direct to the borrower, the amount of income taken into account in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance is the excess after payments for housing costs and other related insurance liabilities are deducted. Where benefit includes an amount for mortgage interest (ISMI), the insurance income is taken into account up to the amount of ISMI payable. In Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefits, payments for building insurance and mortgage payment protection premiums are taken into account.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information is based on gross unequivalised weekly income before housing costs at July 1995 prices. Reported incomes from the State pension and all benefits were subtracted to give the income distribution shown. The results are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income, and therefore are subject to mis-reporting. It is not possible to distinguish between the different elements of the State pension on the Family Expenditure Survey. Therefore, the estimate of State pension income will include basic, SERPS and the graduated pension. As the estimates are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income the estimates are subject to mis-reporting.<P>

2. The Pensioners' Income Series gives estimates for pensioner units. A pensioner unit is defined as a single person over State Pension Age (SPA) or a couple where the man, defined as the head, is over SPA.<P>

3. Numbers of pensioners units are rounded to the nearest 50,000 percentages to the nearest 1 per cent.<P>

1. The information is based on gross unequivalised weekly income before housing costs and benefit income at July 1995 prices. Reported incomes from the State pension and all benefits were subtracted from gross income to give the income distribution shown. The results are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income, and therefore are subject to misreporting.<P>

2. The Pensioners' Income Series gives estimates for pensioner units. A pensioner unit is defined as a single person over State Pension Age (SPA) or a couple where the man, defined as the head, is over SPA.<P>

3. Numbers of pensioner units are rounded to the nearest 50,000, percentages to the nearest 1 per cent.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will estimate the effects of a change in the way the standard interest rate is calculated by including mortgage lenders which have converted to banks on <i>(a)</i> the level of the standard interest rate and <i>(b)</i> the cost to the Government.  [24400]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80217w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The standard rate for mortgage interest payments for people on benefits would currently be 8.17 per cent. if mortgage rates of the largest banks, including building societies which have recently converted to banks, had been included equally with the main building society rates. This estimate is based on current averages of the largest building societies and banks basic mortgage rates. However, historically the gap between the mortgage rates of the two has been significantly smaller than at present and the rates might converge once again in the future. How the interest rates of banks and building societies move relative to each other in the future is, however, impossible to tell.

(40) Represents less than 0.1 million.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.<P>

2. The figures are based on information from the 1995 General Household Survey (GHS). The 1995 survey is the latest for which data is available.<P>

3. All figures refer to Great Britain.<P>

4. The figures refer to people who belong to their present employer's occupational pension scheme, or who currently have a personal pension.<P>

5. Proportions estimated from the 1995 GHS have been applied to Office of National Statistics (ONS) total population estimates for mid-year in 1995 in order to give an indication of the likely number of people in each category. In doing this, it is assumed that the respondents are representative of the overall population of Great Britain. The figures may not be representative in all aspects and so should be treated with caution.<P>

6. The General Household Survey does not include citizens currently living in institutions such as prisons, hospitals and university halls of residence.<P>

7. Data is only available for both male and female homemakers combined rather than just housewives.<P>

8. The data for full-time and part-time workers who have accrued personal pension benefit entitlements excludes self-employed people.<P>

9. Data giving the number of dependent children in the 0 to 4, 5 to 10 and 11 to 16 age groups that respondents had was not available. Figures are shown by whether the respondents had at least one child aged between 0 and 4 or all their children aged between 5 and 15.<P>

10. No estimates have been made of how these figures will change in the future.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP is looking again at designated DLA beneficiaries' current care and mobility needs. Information is collected through a programme of visits and postal enquiries. Selection of customers who will receive either a visit or a postal enquiry will be done monthly, on a random basis, by computer scan. The customers involved will be those with awards of the higher rate of the mobility component combined with either the highest or the middle rate of the care component. During the period covered by BIP, some restricted awards in the above categories will expire and fall due for renewal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will estimate the number of people who are <i>(a)</i> claiming benefits fraudulently and <i>(b)</i> not claiming benefits to which they are entitled in (i) Great Britain and (ii) Scotland.  [26091]

 <i>[holding answer 3 February 1998]:</i> The estimate of the number of people claiming fraudulently is informed by an extrapolation from the results of a series of benefit reviews. The Benefit Review programme which 



<P>
<P><I>17 Feb 1998 : Column: 642</I><P>
commenced in 1994 is looking at the extent of fraud and incorrectness in all major benefits. The benefit reviews were conducted under the previous administration and the definition of fraud used to produce results is currently being evaluated. All the figures presented are consistent with the results of the benefit reviews. The results should not be added together as some people will be committing fraud on several benefits and the reviews all refer to different periods. All the figures refer to Great Britain, separate estimates for Scotland are not available.

<a name="80217w32.html_para4">An additional indicator is the number of successful investigations. These are cases where, following a fraud investigation, one or a combination of the following conclusions occurs: benefit is reduced or stopped, an overpayment is calculated or a prosecution instigated. During 1996-97, 524,966 successful fraud investigations into claims administered by the Benefits Agency were carried out in Great Britain, of which 58,891 refer to investigations within Scotland.
<P>

<a name="80217w32.html_para5">Not all successful investigations result in a prosecution. The Benefits Agency prosecutes only the more serious cases of benefit fraud to act as a deterrent. Local authorities are responsible for the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. The total number of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit cases where fraud was established and a weekly benefit saving claimed for the year 1996-97 in Great Britain was 190,000, of these, 12,000 were in Scotland.
