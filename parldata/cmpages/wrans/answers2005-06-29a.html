 The Carbon Trust is responsible for providing the Government with technical advice on technologies for the Energy Technology List (ETL). Each proposal for a new technology group is considered and prioritised based on the potential to save carbon dioxide emissions and ease of incorporation within the scheme. To date we have not received any detailed or quantitative proposals to include kilns on the ETL from the relevant industry representatives and our own market assessment indicates that kilns offer relatively low EGA accessible abatement potential compared to other technologies not yet listed. Therefore we have no plans to undertake a detailed evaluation of kilns for the ETL at the moment.

 Information is not available on the amount of construction and timber waste produced each year. Current estimates for all types of wood waste vary from 1.9 to 7.5 million tonnes per annum. This includes municipal, commercial and industrial waste as well as that from construction and demolition. A significant proportion currently goes to landfill, which could be used instead as a valuable energy source. As part of the current review of the renewables obligation, the Government has just consulted on options for incentivising a broader range of mixed waste energy projects. The Biomass Study Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, is looking at the barriers to developing biomass energy and will recommend ways to overcome the problems. The use of wood waste as an energy source is one of the areas they are looking at and we will consider the way forward in the light of their recommendations.

 The UK Conditionality Policy which I launched in March this year aims to reduce the overall burden of conditionality on developing countries. UK aid will be subject to only three fundamental conditions, which ensure that aid is used to reduce poverty, is not misused through corruption and supports good governance and human rights. We will no longer make UK aid conditional on specific policy choices by partner governments&#151;including in sensitive economic areas such as privatisation or trade liberalisation.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50629w05.html_spnew6"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The number of appeals which may be received following a revaluation are dependent upon a number of issues, which include the characteristics of the banding scheme, the extent of information provided to individual taxpayers about how their assessment has been arrived at, and also the level of payments to be made including whether any transitional relief scheme will apply. A number of these issues are currently under consideration by the Inquiry being undertaken by Sir Michael Lyons which is due to report in December 2005. It is therefore too speculative to provide estimates of appeal rates at this stage.

 The Parliamentary Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service (OHSWS) have been recording cases of work-related stress as a separate category from other cases of stress only since the latter part of 2003; therefore accurate statistics are only available for 2004. In that year six cases were dealt with, representing approximately 0.38 per cent. of the House work force. Subsequent benchmarking has confirmed this to be a relatively low figure. Departments of the House and the OHSWS have proactively sought to support such staff, and consequent absence from work has been low. Long-term absence has been the exception rather than the rule. In most cases of reported stress, work is one of a number of contributory factors, including personal problems. No cases have resulted in civil action and resultant compensation.

 It is an essential, mandatory and routine requirement to operate a Royal Navy nuclear submarine, that a safety justification is maintained which demonstrates it is safe to do so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50629w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_78">The theoretical safety concern on HMS Torbay and HMS Tireless centred on the potential effect of a number of small manufacturing imperfections in their nuclear reactor plant. A previous analysis had indicated that these imperfections were acceptable but a more modern analysis, using the latest information on material properties and component stress values, showed an increased theoretical risk of failure in some of these components. While there was no new defect, as part of the Royal Navy&#039;s commitment to safety, the decision was taken that the two submarines should not be operated further until the technical aspects had been fully examined and their continued safe operation could be justified. For HMS Torbay a safety justification is now in place to allow the operation of her nuclear reactor plant. The safety justification work required for HMS Tireless will be undertaken during her programmed maintenance and upgrade period, which is under way at Devonport.

Nevertheless, the trial did demonstrate that the number unable to record any biometric information is statistically small and special arrangements, including improved enrolment facilities are being considered for this group. Specifically, the result of this trial demonstrated that, of the total sample, 99.954 per cent. of participants could successfully record at least one biometric successfully. 0.29 per cent. of the entire sample were only able to record the facial biometric on its own.

 According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&#039; (UNHCR) figures, the rate of return of displaced persons to their pre-war homes has dropped in the last five years, as most of those willing to return have now done so. The overall number of returns has. however, continued to increase slowly. By September last year, a million refugees and displaced people had returned to their homes, from an estimated 2.2 million displaced by the conflict of the 1990s.

 Of the approximately one million refugees and displaced people who had returned to their pre-war homes by January 2005, over 450,000 had returned to areas where they were not the ethnic majority. But there is more work to be done. Some minority returnees still face discrimination in access to jobs in public services and private employment and to education, health and social security. The failure to bring to justice all war crimes indictees has also reduced confidence in the return process. Economic development remains a priority to ensure the sustainable return of minority returnees.

As such there is no central database of all the Information Communication Technology (1CT) contracts in the FCO. We have recently installed a new Electronic Resource Management (ERM) system in London and are in the process of installing this system in all our posts overseas. Until this is complete, and our new reporting systems are in place, we are unable to produce the information requested without exceeding the disproportionate cost threshold. We are. however, able to provide information on our major ICT contracts (in excess of &#163;1 million) as required by the question. A full list of contracts, including costs, will be made available in spreadsheet format to the Library of the House.

Notes:<br>

1.The data are snapshot information at the end of each month.<br>

2.The information includes any dentist who had at least one active registration.<br>

3.There are various reasons why a dentist may not have any registrations: in particular, specialists such as orthodontists.<br>

4.It should be understood that personal dental service PDS registrations&quot; generally have a longer re-registration period than general dental service (GDS) registrations. This means that a patient registered&quot; under PDS might not have been still registered under GDS, had the dentist remained in GDS.<br>

 The Department has commissioned the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health to undertake a two-year national review of genito urinary medicine (GUM) services, which will help to assess capacity issues and disseminate good practice. This began in autumn 2004 and will cover all GUM clinics. Visits to services are already under way in nine strategic health authorities, and reports are being fed back to the primary care trusts as the review proceeds.

 Improved sexual health performance management has been introduced to ensure that the new investment of &#163;300 million over three years, provided through the Public Health White Paper, achieves the desired outcomes. In addition to the public service agreement target to reduce the under-18 conception rate by 50 per cent., by 2010 as a part of a broader strategy to improve sexual health, primary care trusts must now include sexual health in their local delivery plans. These plans must include measures to achieve improved genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic waiting times, reduced gonorrhoea rates and improved uptake of Chlamydia screening. In addition, the Department has commissioned the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health to undertake a national review of GUM services, which is now under way. A national audit of contraceptive services is also in preparation and we are working to strengthen the monitoring role of strategic health authorities. Data collection is being improved, to provide information against which performance can be measured, including the Health Protection Agency&#039;s published data on GUM waiting times.

 All maintained schools must provide religious education (RE) for all registered pupils. Locally agreed RE syllabuses must reflect the fact that religious traditions in the country are in the main Christian while taking account of the teaching and practices of other principal religions. The new national framework for RE will provide opportunities to develop pupils knowledge and understanding of Christianity, other principal religions, other religious traditions and other world views, in line with Government&#039;s goals of inclusion, tolerance and diversity.

Notes:<br>

1.Price Base: Real terms at 2003&#150;04 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 23 March 2005.<br>

2.Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education SSA/EFS settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS.<br>

3.Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged three to 10 and 11 to 15 and exclude Education Maintenance Allowances and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those LEAs in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2006&#150;7 to 2008&#150;9, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

4.The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC three-year-old maintained pupils and estimated three to four-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5.Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

6.Status: 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

 Provision of Counselling Services is a matter for individual higher education institutions. Counselling Services in UK universities have responded positively to the changes in student populations resulting from the HE Widening Participation agenda. The Government have supported a number of initiatives to improve all core support services to students, such as the Developing Modern Higher Education Careers Services&quot;, report in 2001. A key focus of Developing Modern Higher Education Careers Services&quot; was the need to ensure greater and more targeted access to those students and graduates who might be disadvantaged and/or in need of support. The follow-up report Modernising HE Careers Education&#151;a framework for good practice&quot; showed that universities had reviewed their provision of support services, and recognised the need to improve their standards of service.
