 The A127 is not a trunk road and so is the responsibility of local highway authorities; these are Southend on Sea borough council for the section of the road within the borough boundary and Essex county council for the section beyond to Basildon. Plans for future improvements to the road, and details of any which have already been carried out, are therefore matters for these authorities.</p>

 There is no specific national legislation which proscribes vehicle parking on pavements.

The pedestrian footway is part of a highway. The police may issue a fixed penalty notice for such obstruction. However, in London, by virtue of section 8 of the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003, authorised officers of borough councils and Transport for London are also empowered to issue a fixed penalty notice for the offence of obstruction under section 137 of the 1980 Act.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what formula is used to calculate the average rate for households in Northern Ireland. [82598]</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="06071722000525"><a name="60717w0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="06071722002673"><b>Mr. Hanson:</b>
 The average domestic rate for households in Northern Ireland consists of the average of the 26 district council domestic rates plus the domestic regional rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="60717w0005.htm_para0"><a name="06071722000526">The formula for calculation of the average rate for households is as follows: Each year, district councils' estimated net expenditure is reduced by anticipated general grant payments and any balance that councils have indicated they wish to apply, to determine the net amount to be raised from district rates. This figure is divided by the total penny product (the income from one penny in the rates) to give the average non-domestic rate. The average non-domestic rate is then multiplied by the Northern Ireland growth factor to determine the average domestic rate. The average domestic rate for 2006-2007 is 157.33 pence</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="60717w0005.htm_para1"><a name="06071722000527">The regional domestic rate is a single rate applied uniformally across Northern Ireland. It is determined by dividing the domestic rate revenue required in the Budget by the domestic tax base, currently defined in rental values.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="60717w0005.htm_para2"><a name="06071722000528">The average domestic rate in 2006-07 is 355.50 pence, which is the sum of the uniform regional domestic rate of 198.17p and the average district rate of 157.33p.</p>

Half of this extra money will go to Africa, so that by 2010 it will be receiving $50 billion a year&#151;double the aid it received in 2004. DFID met its pledge to provide &#163;1 billion in aid to Africa through its country programmes in 2005-06 and is on track to double its bilateral programme by 2010-11. The Gleneagles pledges represent a long-term agenda and the Government remain committed to ensuring that all 2005 promises are fully implemented.</p>

 Improving infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth in developing countries. There is also a pressing need to increase the efficiency of infrastructure to give greater access to the poor and better value for money. Current investment flows are insufficient to fund these additional needs and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and efficiency gaps. A significant contribution from the private sector will be required. However, attracting private capital and participation is difficult&#151;according to World Bank figures, private investment in developing country infrastructure fell from US$ 49.6 billion in 1997 to US$ 12.5 billion in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="60717w0010.htm_para11"><a name="06071722002382">Among the main constraints to successful private sector participation in infrastructure are the lack of appropriate policies, laws, regulations and institutions and the weak capacity of the public sector to effectively manage private sector involvement. The PPIAF is a global technical assistance facility managed by the World Bank to address these constraints and, where requested to do so by developing country governments, facilitate and, where appropriate, raise the quality of private sector involvement in infrastructure. The PPIAF is a good example of successful donor harmonization in development. It is supported by 14 donors with a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. As of April 2006, it had approved US$ 108.7 million funding for 495 activities in 101 countries. This funding mobilised an additional US$ 59.8 million co-financing from Governments and other donors.</p>

Once approved, all activities follow World Bank procurement rules that require open and transparent competition to ensure value for money. A sample of activities are systematically evaluated by the Technical Advisory Panel of independent experts that reports to the Programme Council. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per cent. of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="60717w0011.htm_para3"><a name="06071722002444">In 2004, PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation&#151;the &#145;Strategic Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The objective was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original objectives and identify ways for improving its performance. The report, issued in the final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that the PPIAF is making an important contribution to development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="60717w0011.htm_para4"><a name="06071722002445">A number of recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the Program Council, more focus on outcomes rather than outputs; enhancing PPIAF's identity as an autonomous multi-donor facility and improving impact measurement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="60717w0011.htm_para5"><a name="06071722002446">Changes facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed.

The PPIAF has played an important supporting role. For example, the PPIAF has supported the development of a series of training courses on utility regulation and finance that have been targeted at key stakeholder groups including Ministers and senior Government officials, journalists and consumer associations. The aim of the training courses is to equip stakeholders with a sound knowledge with which to appraise reforms. Two training workshops have also been held for stakeholders. The first workshop was held in South Africa in June 2005 and the second was held in Costa Rica in February 2006. Feedback provided to PPIAF on the workshops has been very positive.</p>

This review drew heavily on the findings of the independent strategic review and progress on implementing its recommendations. The strategic review reported that the PPIAF has a comparative advantage over other facilities by demonstrating clear focus, global reach, strong donor support and efficient management. It confirmed that demand for PPIAF services by Governments of developing countries is growing and that continued DFID support is critical to growth and increasing the leverage of funds required for scaling up. On this basis, DFID agreed to continue its contribution to PPIAF for a further three-year period&#151;July 2005 to June 2008.</p>

 Improving infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth in developing countries. There is also a pressing need to increase the efficiency of infrastructure to give greater access to the poor and better value for money. Current investment flows are insufficient to fund these additional needs and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and efficiency gaps. A significant contribution from the private sector will be required. However, attracting private capital and participation is difficult&#151;according to World Bank figures, private investment in developing country infrastructure fell from US$ 49.6 billion in 1997 to US$ 12.5 billion in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="60717w0011.htm_para11"><a name="06071722002457">Among the main constraints on successful private sector participation in infrastructure are the lack of  <br>

appropriate policies, laws, regulations and institutions and the weak capacity of the public sector to effectively manage private sector involvement. The PPIAF is a global technical assistance facility managed by the World Bank to address these constraints and, where requested to do so by developing country Governments, facilitate and raise the quality of private sector involvement in infrastructure. The PPIAF is a good example of successful donor harmonization in development. It is supported by 14 donors with a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. As of April 2006, it had approved $US 108.7 million funding for 495 activities in 101 countries. This funding mobilised an additional US$ 59.8 million co-financing from governments and other donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="60717w0011.htm_para12"><a name="06071722002458">A particular strength of the PPIAF is its open and transparent systems of governance. These include procedures governing the application for, and allocation of, activity funds.

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="60717w0011.htm_para13"><a name="06071722002459">DFID fully endorses the PPIAF's objective to help developing countries to improve the quality of their infrastructure for the benefit of the poor through effective public-private partnerships. In practice, this is largely achieved by helping governments improve their policies, laws regulations and institutions (their &#147;enabling environment&#148;). Our other objectives are to encourage greater donor coordination in designing solutions to meet the demands of developing countries, reducing transaction costs for developing countries and effective dissemination of lessons learned.</p>

 Code of practice A issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 regulates contacts with the police and the public in the exercise of police powers to stop and search.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="60717w0015.htm_para0"><a name="0607186001018">Code A requires that a record of the stop or stop and search must be made at the time unless there are exceptional circumstances. If the record is not given at the time, the person must be notified by the officer of their entitlement to a record if requested within 12 months and informed how a copy can be obtained. The decision to retain records after that period is a matter for individual chief officers, irrespective of whether the record relates to an adult or a juvenile and the outcome of the stop or stop and search.</p>

Officers exercising these powers must do so fairly, responsibly and with respect for people being stopped or stopped and searched. It would be an operational matter for the officer concerned to determine whether any additional support or action would be required owing to the vulnerability of the individual; and guidance due for publication this summer by the National Centre for Policing Excellence highlights the need for officers to take account of the person's age and vulnerability .</p>

 All public service schemes pay cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in respect of accrued rights in compliance with pensions law. Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under Public Private Partnerships or Public Finance Initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

 Applicants for legal aid in housing cases can obtain legal aid for legal advice and information, investigative help, or legal representation, if they pass the standard tests of financial eligibility and if their case meets the criteria for the grant of funding, as set out in the Funding Code. Housing cases are considered a priority for funding, and the Funding Code criteria for legal representation in housing cases reflect this. Cases in which the roof over the applicant&#146;s head is directly at issue are considered to be of &#147;overwhelming importance&#148; to the applicant and can be funded in a wider range of circumstances than other housing cases.</p>

In the DCA command paper &#145;A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid&#146; we clearly stated our aim to improve the financial control and overall management of the highest cost cases, achieving more timely and effective disposal.</p>
<a name="0607186001520">
<p>We have put in place a number of measures to work towards this aim, such as the High Cost Cases Review Board, a cross-CJS board which aims to bring greater scrutiny to the way that high cost cases are managed.</p>

 The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) has an important role in the social exclusion agenda. We are promoting the benefits of good early advice services for those most in need. Evidence shows that this can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues spiralling into more complex problems. We are also encouraging closer working across Whitehall. Our role is crosscutting in highlighting the worth of advice services to Government colleagues.

 Good, early advice services can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues developing into more complex and numerous problems. This is evidenced by the recent Legal Services Research Centre&#146;s &#147;Causes of Action&#148; publication, which also highlights the tendency for inter-related problems to develop around a key theme (broadly around &#145;family&#146;, &#145;homelessness&#146; and &#145;economic&#146; clusters). The Legal Services Commission&#146;s new Community Legal Service Strategy is informed by this research, and proposes that newly created Community Legal Advice Centres are located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most vulnerable. My Department&#146;s recent Getting earlier, better advice to vulnerable people document underlines the need for ensuring advice is people focussed, with problems not being considered in isolation. It also highlights the importance of getting advice right first time, and ensuring more effective referral networks are in place so that people get the service they need regardless of their point of access to the system.</p>

 As part of its role in delivering legal aid, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) considers the need for its services to help prevent social exclusion. The LSC can play its part by ensuring that services are better co-ordinated, focussed and effective, and that acts of advice/assistance increase. The new Community Legal Service (CLS) Strategy proposes that Community Legal Advice Centres (CLACs) are located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most vulnerable. In less densely populated areas Community Legal Advice Networks (CLANs) will ensure that clients are able to access a range of high quality advice services regardless of their geographic location. Community Legal Service Direct also allows easy access for clients. The new CLS Strategy, in proposing that CLACs and CLANs will cover all five areas of social welfare law (Community Care, Housing, Debt, Employment and Welfare Benefits), will further promote social inclusion.</p>

 At its meeting in December 2005 the Commission gave outline approval to the NAO's proposed refurbishment of its headquarters building in Buckingham Palace Road, London, subject, however, to three conditions. First, that the NAO should produce a detailed, fully costed business case for the project. Second, that the NAO should carry out a cost-benefit analysis of an alternative approach to its accommodation requirements, namely moving its headquarters to a North of England location. And third, that the NAO should provide a fuller explanation of its decision to rule out the possibility of acquiring alternative accommodation in London as part of the Government estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="60717w0021.htm_para9"><a name="06071818000543">At its meeting on 4 July 2006, the Commission considered the NAO's response under each of those headings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="60717w0021.htm_para10"><a name="06071818000544"><i> The Business Case</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="60717w0021.htm_para11"><a name="06071818000545">The business case produced by the NAO gives the total cost of the project as &#163;77.44 million, spread over five years starting in 2006-07. In the longer term, there will be a small increase in annual resource costs to the NAO, resulting from higher business rates, capital charges and depreciation, partially offset by reduced running costs through greater building efficiency. Since submitting its original proposals the NAO has revised its approach to the decanting of staff which will be necessary while the building work is in progress. It is now hoped to carry this out in a single rather than a two or three stage process, depending on the availability of suitable decant accommodation. On the basis of the business case, the NAO made a persuasive argument in support of refurbishment as the most cost-effective way of avoiding what would otherwise be&#151;because of the building's current deficiencies&#151;an unacceptable risk to the Office's continued ability to function efficiently. The Commission was, however,  <br>

conscious of the sensitivity surrounding the timing of the project, since, under the NAO's plans, the bulk of the expenditure would occur in the years covered by the next, and potentially difficult, comprehensive spending review. We therefore pressed the NAO on the implications of deferring the project (which, because of the need to avoid coinciding with the competing demands on the construction industry from Olympics-related activity, would entail a delay until 2013). The NAO satisfied the Commission that, given the deteriorating condition of the current building, waiting a further seven years before undertaking remedial work would pose an unacceptable risk to the NAO's operations and therefore to the service it provides to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="60717w0021.htm_para13"><a name="06071818000547">In response to the Commission's request, the NAO examined Manchester as a possible location for a provincial headquarters building. Of a number of cities considered, Manchester was judged to come nearest to meeting the Office's principal requirements: good transport connections; and a sufficiently large local pool of qualified accountants to enable the NAO to recruit and retain key professional staff. On the latter count, the available pool in Manchester, though large in comparison with other provincial cities, is much smaller than London's and is insufficient to support the NAO's requirements. The cost-benefit analysis carried out by the NAO indicated that the basic costs associated with relocating would be broadly similar to those for the option of staying on in a refurbished Buckingham Palace Road. On the other hand, the analysis suggested that the uncertainty over the number of staff who would be willing to relocate posed a risk both of additional, but unquantifiable costs of redundancy and resettlement packages, and of disruption of core business activity. The Commission was satisfied that, for these reasons, relocation was not a realistic option. The NAO is, however, proposing to expand its presence in the North, concentrating on its existing team in Newcastle.</p>

The NAO's assessment, which the Commission accepted, is that there is at present no building available of a size and configuration to meet the NAO's requirements on a long term basis, and at a cost competitive with the headquarters refurbishment option, taking account of the resultant loss of the current peppercorn rent. Taking all these factors into account, and having carefully considered the NAO's business case, the Commission gave its formal approval to the proposed refurbishment of the Buckingham Palace Road building. The Commission noted that, depending on how quickly the refurbishment work can begin, it may be necessary for the NAO to submit a supplementary estimate for the financial year 2006-07. The Commission will consider any such request if and when it is received. In the meantime, the Commission looks to the Treasury to make room within the public expenditure envelope for the relevant years for the  <br>

 In July 2005, the industry regulator, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) required gas and electricity suppliers to establish an independent ombudsman scheme to deal with billing disputes that had not been satisfactorily resolved under standard complaints procedures. The suppliers have now established the Energy Supply Ombudsman scheme, which was launched on 1 July 2006. The Ombudsman will handle both billing and transfer disputes, can reach decisions that are binding on suppliers and may award compensation of up to &#163;5,000 to customers.

create problems for the competitiveness of industry, and take very seriously the potential loss of jobs and investment. The Government are leaving no stone unturned, working closely with industry, to find solutions and reduce the impact. The new Business Energy Forum, co-chaired by the Secretary of State and Richard Lambert of the CBI, met for the first time on 5 July and is monitoring this work and looking at other strategic energy issues impacting on business. Higher energy prices in the UK reflect higher global prices, caused by rising demand and supply constraints (for oil and gas), the lack of EU energy market liberalisation, and domestic factors, such as the tight winter supply demand balance in the UK gas market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="60717w0027.htm_para2"><a name="06071821001059">The importance of the Government&#146;s activity in pushing for European energy market liberalisation was highlighted in a Global Insight report in 2005. The report estimated that the lack of effective liberalisation and the dominance of oil-linked long-term supply contracts in Europe would cost UK industrial consumers of gas some &#163;2.6 billion over the following year. Ofgem analysis suggests that the cost to UK gas consumers of Interconnector flows not always being in line with price signals during the last winter was &#163;1.5 billion and would cost &#163;3 billion if repeated during the coming winter. The European Commission has been active in reviewing competition in gas and electricity markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="60717w0027.htm_para3"><a name="06071821001060">During the past two years there have been several investigations and reports into competition in UK gas and electricity markets. These include the Ofgem gas price probe, and two inquiries from the Trade and Industry Select Committee. The Ofgem gas price probe found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in the UK gas market. More recently, Ofgem published a &#147;Domestic Retail Market Report&#148;, which concluded that, &#147;competition remains effective and vigorous in all segments of the domestic energy market.&#148; Independent research by Oxera concluded that in 2004 the UK had the most competitive electricity and gas markets in the EU and G7 (available at www.dti.gov.uk/files/file28425.pdf).</p>

 The Government introduced statutory controls on spam emails by means of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which were enacted on 11 December 2003. The regulations provide a first line of defence against spam originating in the EU where the recipient has no knowledge of the advertiser of the products being marketed. The regulations require that spam must not be sent to an individual subscriber without prior permission or unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the EU. There is regular contact between my Department, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office on the operation of these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="60717w0029.htm_para4"><a name="06071821001037">The Government recognise that most spam does not come from the UK and have therefore extensively promoted international co-operation. A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed on 2 July 2004 between the enforcement authorities of the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, to reduce the problem by working together to investigate those sending spam. The UK also plays a leading role in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&#146;s Anti Spam Task Force and other multilateral initiatives. In late 2004, the UK launched the world&#146;s first and only anti-spam enforcement network, the London Action Plan, which now spans five continents and includes authorities and industry from countries particularly affected by this issue, such as Nigeria, China and India.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="60717w0029.htm_para5"><a name="06071821001038">The end user has a role to play in acting to avoid being a target for those sending spam, as well as acting to filter spam. Information has been made available to the public and to business by the DTI, the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office, the Office of Fair Trading as well as a number of sites provided by service and software providers. These messages have been reinforced by the Get Safe Online initiative launched on 27 October 2005. This is an initiative between Government and Industry to help individuals and businesses protect themselves against internet threats, including spam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="60717w0029.htm_para6"><a name="06071821001039">Our response to the problem of spam continues to develop. I have taken careful note of the views of the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office on the powers available to him, and DTI officials are working with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office on this matter. The Government are actively considering whether to revise the relevant legislation. DTI officials have a continuing dialogue with internet service providers regarding steps that can be taken to reduce spam. We also continue our efforts to achieve greater international co-operation.</p>

 There has been a substantial fall in UK-Zimbabwe trade in recent years. In 2000, UK and Zimbabwe two-way trade amounted to &#163;143 million. Imports from Zimbabwe were mainly agricultural products with tobacco, making up approximately 31 per cent. of the total imports. Exports were mainly manufactured goods, with office machines and ADP equipment topping the table at &#163;5.3 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="60717w0030.htm_para2"><a name="06071821001073">By 2005, two-way trade had fallen to &#163;66 million. The principal change was in tobacco imports, which fell to &#163;4.8 million from &#163;31 million in 2000 down 85 per cent. Exports also fell, with the leading export, road vehicles, topping the table at &#163;3.5 million. The decline in trade can be attributed to the policies of the Government of Zimbabwe which have brought about the fall of both imports and exports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="60717w0030.htm_para3"><a name="06071821001074">A breakdown of UK exports and imports by sector for 2004 and 2005 is shown in the following table.</p>

It is our view that economic sanctions would harm the people of Zimbabwe at a time of humanitarian crisis, while having very little impact on the ZANU (PF) leadership. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered enough.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the response by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury of 4 July 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 729, on the Finance (No. 2) Bill, if he will place in the Library a note setting out the basis for his calculation of the &#163;100 million cost of amendments to the rules on the compulsory purchase of annuities. [83603]</p>

<p><a name="st_323"><a name="06071876000162"><a name="60717w0030.htm_spnew3"><a name="06071876005778"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 The Exchequer cost arising from this proposal depends upon behavioural responses. But, assuming that the technical deficiencies with the proposal would be corrected, we stated a conservative overall initial cost of the measure of around &#163;100 million per annum. Our longer term estimate of the overall costs is around &#163;175 to &#163;225 million per annum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="60717w0030.htm_para5"><a name="06071876000163">This potential cost consists of two main elements. First, allowing larger lump sums to be taken out and taxed at marginal rate at age 75 would have a tax cost because additional pension savings would be induced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="60717w0030.htm_para6"><a name="06071876000164">The up-front tax cost of these additional pension savings is estimated to be in the region of &#163;300 to &#163;500 million per annum. Around three quarters of this would be reclaimed as income tax on the resulting retirement benefits. This gives a broad range for this part of the costing of &#163;75 to &#163;125 million per annum. We used the lower range of this estimate for our conservative initial cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="60717w0030.htm_para7"><a name="06071876000165">Secondly, allowing individuals to leave pensions untouched until death and then bequeath the capital would reduce income tax on pensions in payment. As any additional savings held in pension assets at death would largely displace other liquid assets, held inheritance tax (IHT) would not increase to offset this income tax lost. Even if wealth held at death were to increase as a result of the tabled amendments, the average effective rate of IHT on such assets would still be far below the rate of income tax. Only 6 per cent. of estates have an IHT charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="60717w0030.htm_para8"><a name="06071876000166">The longer term costs of this behaviour are very uncertain but are estimated at &#163;100 million per annum in lost income tax. But this would take time to build up and we have used one quarter of this amount for our conservative initial cost.</p>

The quality review made recommendations for improving the estimation of total migration flows to and from the UK and the allocation of international migration to local areas. This work includes investigating administrative sources that may be used in producing or quality assuring the international migration estimates (such as the Worker Registration Scheme data), investigating potential sources of information about short-term migrants and making improvements to the current source of information on international migrants, the International Passenger Survey (IPS).</p>

These aim to get a better understanding, from a local perspective, of the administrative data sources that are currently used in the population estimation procedure. They will also investigate any other high quality sources that the local areas use themselves for population purposes. The local areas selected for these studies are ones that are known to have reasons which make their population difficult to estimate, e.g. those with a high volume of migratory moves. It is intended that these studies will contribute towards the improvement of both internal and international migration statistics.</p>

 Child tax credit (CTC) includes a family element of &#163;545 per year. It also includes a baby addition at a rate of a further &#163;545 per year for families for periods when they are responsible for a child aged under one year. Equivalent payments are made to families receiving their child support via income support or jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Abolishing these elements would reduce expenditure on CTC by around &#163;3.3 billion per year, based on 2004-05 awards. The extra child benefit expenditure resulting from adding the weekly equivalents to the rate for the eldest child would be around &#163;4.3 billion per year. Therefore, the net cost would be &#163;1 billion per year.</p>

Care leavers in West Lancashire also have opportunities to take up work experience arranged by the Looked After Children Employment Skills (LACES) project.</p>

Up until the age of eighteen, the local authority will usually be his/her primary source of income. Lancashire, as is the case for other local authorities, is responsible for funding accommodation, maintenance and other expenses (e.g. travel and leisure costs). Once care leavers reach 18, they are entitled to have access to the same mainstream arrangements for obtaining financial help as other young people. It will be the role of their leaving care personal adviser to assist them to access this help. However Lancashire, as the responsible local authority, has a continuing duty to provide assistance, for as long as the young person remains in an approved programme, with the costs of education or training.</p>

In Lancashire, where young people entitled to care leaving services continue to remain looked after by the local authority, their social workers must visit at least every three months. However, when young people are being actively prepared to leave care, contact will be far more frequent than this and where a young person requires intensive support, contact might take place several times a week. The team estimates that, on average, all care leavers in West Lancashire are seen at least fortnightly.</p>

 As at November 2001, some 2.6 million individuals in England had opened an individual learning account through the national framework launched in September 2000. Of these, over 347,000 were opened during 2000. (Prior to the launch of the national framework, over 200,000 members applied  via TECs, of whom, nearly 80,000 transferred their membership to the national framework and are included in the overall total.)</p>

ILAs were not intended to be a guarantee of quality for learning or learning providers. Nevertheless, many account holders who used their account to book a course stated that the learning met or exceeded their expectations (York Consulting Research Report 295). The Government initially made the decision to withdraw the programme in light of an increasing number of complaints. Subsequently, Ministers closed the programme early because of the compelling and growing evidence of abuse.</p>

 The Government remain committed to protecting school playing fields. In this respect there is a general presumption against the need to change the current pattern of school playing field provision by disposal or change of use. However, some playing fields can be genuinely surplus and it can make sense to allow them to be sold and the proceeds used to provide new or improved sports or education facilities.</p>

We will consult them further on next steps in relation to safety guidance once the manifesto is published.</p>

Prior to 2001-02 funding was made  available through the FEFC, for which we do not hold information. UFI (initially called the &#147;University for Industry&#148;), the organisation responsible for learndirect, has successfully pushed the boundaries of learning methods, by making innovative use of technology to make learning more flexible. It is the largest Government supported e-learning initiative in the world, and provides high quality learning for the post-16 learning and skills sector. It particularly reaches those with few or no skills and qualifications who are unlikely to participate in more traditional forms of learning. It is not an awarding body and does not have the status of a university.</p>

Since April 2003, over 120,000 people have achieved their first skills for life test pass in literacy or numeracy through learndirect. UFI is now delivering over one fifth of the post-19 sector&#146;s skills for life test passes annually. Almost 200,000 small and medium sized employers have also used learndirect services. The learndirect advice service has delivered more than 33 million information and advice sessions on the telephone and online.</p>

These contracts and the Alliance Agreement cover the key demonstration phase of the work and involve shipyards and industry in maturing the design to the point at which we can commit to manufacture. When we are satisfied that all this work is sufficiently mature, the main investment decision can be taken and orders placed. At this point, we will also set the in-service dates.</p>

 New entrants to the armed forces on or after 6 April 2005 have joined the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2005. The impact of recent improvements in life expectancy was fully taken into account in developing the benefit structure of this scheme, including by setting a preserved pension age at 65. There have also been changes to the benefit structure of the old pension scheme, the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975, to ensure its long term affordability. The age at which a preserved pension is paid was delayed from 60 to 65 for all service, from 6 April 2006. Some of these savings were reinvested in the scheme in the form of an increase in the death in service lump sum to three times pay. The impact of changing life expectancy and other relevant factors is monitored by the Government Actuary's Department, the actuary for the schemes, through regular assessments of the employer's contribution for the two AFPS schemes.</p>

Whereas question 66 in the seventh Serving Personnel survey provided a menu of possible responses, question 39c in the ninth Serving Personnel survey is an open-ended question, and does not offer a menu of responses. This approach is designed to provide a richer source of data by enabling respondents to answer the question in their own terms. The breakdown of negative comments in my answer of 6 July reflects an analysis of actual responses to question 39c conducted by occupational scientists. A sample of respondents&#146; comments was extracted and similar types were summarised into a category. Categories were arranged under appropriate headings to provide a coding framework, which was validated using a further sample of comments. Respondents typically made more than one comment and all comments were read and assigned the relevant code(s) to calculate their frequencies.</p>

 There have been no recent discussions on the subject between Secretaries of State. Since 1948, it has been the policy of successive Governments that health care for veterans should be provided by the NHS. Priority NHS treatment applies to veterans who are war pensioners for their accepted disorders. Officials in the Ministry of Defence and the four UK Health Departments work closely together, and they are at present developing delivery models to ensure high quality mental health services for veterans across the UK. My predecessors and I have been closely briefed on this and other work in the area of veterans' health. Should there be any issues following this work, or otherwise, I will discuss these with Ministers  from the Department of Health and devolved Administrations through the Veterans Ministerial Task Force, as appropriate.</p>

The Department is not currently undertaking any research into veterans in prison but is leading a project with the Home Office, ex-Service charities and other voluntary sector organisations to assist ex-Service offenders in custody and on release, and their families, to reduce the risk of re-offending. In a related area, the Department has funded research on the possible merits of mentoring for vulnerable veterans which looked in particular at the needs of personnel discharged from the Military Corrective Training Centre.

The proportion of front-line staff remains at 21 per cent. of HSE staff in 2006 as it was in 2005, so essentially front-line delivery remains the same.</p>

 The Health and Safety Executive carries out no work under contract for overseas Governments, public bodies and commercial interests.

Explosives that meet the requirements of the directive and POMSTER may be marked with the CE mark. HSL currently has 80 overseas commercial applicants for certification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="60717w0047.htm_para5"><a name="06071876004597">HSL collaborates with a large number of overseas laboratories, principally in the area of quality control.

Together with 11 other laboratories in member states of the EU, HSL is a signatory to the Framework Agreement on the Foundation of the Partnership for European Research in Occupational Safety and Health (PEROSH); and is also a World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre.</p>

 New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) services are available to people with a health condition or disability, including those who are partially sighted, who are in receipt of a range of benefits. Eligible benefits include incapacity benefit and income support with a disability premium, but not jobseeker's allowance (JSA).

However, NDDP job brokers have the flexibility to use their funds to provide equipment, if they feel it is appropriate to do so. Equipment can also be accessed through other provision, for example, the adviser discretion fund (ADF), which enables the purchase of almost anything, up to a limit of &#163;100 within a 12-month period, that will help a customer obtain a job or take up an offer of employment. NDDP customers can access ADF through Jobcentre Plus advisers.</p>

 Details of the public appointments to public bodies sponsored by The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) can be found in &#147;Public Bodies&#148;, copies of which are in the Library. &#147;Public Bodies&#148; has been published annually since 1980 and the most recent edition provides figures for 2005. Each edition of &#147;Public Bodies&#148; contains details on the number of public appointments and remuneration details for that particular year. DWP was established in June 2001 and stewardship of those of its public bodies in existence before this time sat within its predecessor Departments. Comparable information for 1976, 1986 and 1996 in respect of DWP public bodies could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

However, in its deliberations leading to recommendations on occupational exposure limits, SCOEL undertakes an assessment of the evidence on all aspects of the substances under consideration, including whether or not a substance may have particular properties, including the potential to cause cancer in humans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="60717w0051.htm_para0"><a name="06071876005538">In relation to sulphuric acid mist, for which a Recommendation for an occupational exposure limit was published in October 2004, SCOEL felt that the balance of evidence from studies in worker populations was sufficient to indicate that sulphuric acid mist has the potential to cause laryngeal cancer in humans. However, there were insufficient data to reliably inform on the airborne exposure conditions that were associated with the increased incidence of laryngeal cancer in these studies. In relation to the mechanism whereby sulphuric acid mist causes laryngeal cancer, SCOEL concluded that it is based on long-term chronic irritation of the laryngeal epithelium, and that airborne exposures that are below the threshold for the induction of such irritant effects would not lead to any increased risk of cancer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="60717w0051.htm_para1"><a name="06071876005539">SCOEL recommended that an 8-hour time-weighted average occupational exposure limit, set at 0.05 mg.m-3, would not lead to any adverse health effects in workers, and would not be associated with any increased risk of cancer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="60717w0051.htm_para2"><a name="06071876005540">In November 2001 the Health and Safety Executive published a Chemical Hazard Alert Notice for sulphuric acid mist, which recommended that employers should control mist exposure to below 0.3 mg.m-3, in line with advice from the National Sulphuric Acid Association. The 8-hour time-weighted average occupational exposure standard (OES) for sulphuric acid, formerly set at 1 mg.m-3, was withdrawn by the Health and Safety Commission in May 2003. There is currently no British occupational exposure limit.</p>
