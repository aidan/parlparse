The Government are seeking to introduce flexibility into the fixed penalty system for speeding offences to address this link by ensuring that the more extreme the speed, the greater the penalty that applies. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 15 June that the Government take the view that greater flexibility in the fixed penalty system would be fairer and better, and plan to take legislative powers, when the opportunity arises, to introduce graduated fixed penalties, subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny of proposed penalties.

 The vast majority of personnel on operational deployments overseas receive the existing standard Operational Welfare Package (OWP) which caters for communication with families. Where it is not practicable to offer the OWP, personnel are given a cost of living allowance which assists them to meet any additional costs of communicating with their families at home.

 It has been a long standing policy of successive Governments that the cost of erecting memorials and associated projects are not usually met from public funds, but from private donations or public subscription. The MOD receives many requests from individuals, ex-Servicemen&#039;s groups and charitable organisations seeking assistance with various projects. The vast majority have worthy goals and can make an equally compelling case for support. It would be divisive and open to criticism from unsuccessful applicants, if the Government were to pick and choose which projects to support.

 A farmer must apply for a calf passport within 27 days of the animal&#039;s birth. An application received after this time will be refused. However, a farmer has the right to appeal against the decision to refuse a passport if he thinks there are special or extenuating circumstances. A successful appeal would lead to the issue of a passport.

An animal refused a passport is still registered onto the national cattle database and may live out its life on the farm it is on. If it is female and has calves, these can be registered in the usual way. If the animal is a dairy cow, its milk may be sold as normal. However, the animal may not be moved to other premises and it may not enter the food chain at the end of its life. If the keeper does not wish to keep the calf, it may be moved under licence to a knackers yard or hunt kennel for destruction.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps have been taken by her Department and its agencies over the last three years to ensure that eggs imported into the United Kingdom from <i>(a)</i> Spain and <i>(b)</i> other EU countries are free from salmonella.  [192804]</p>




<p><a name="41025w05.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Eggs are a raw product and are not required to be Salmonella free. Although the levels of contamination of UK produced eggs are now very low, occasional eggs may still be contaminated with salmonella, but, evidence from the testing of eggs associated with premises where outbreaks have occurred, suggests that levels of contamination of Spanish eggs in the UK are greater than those in UK produced eggs, and that this is resulting in outbreaks of Salmonella. Food Standards Agency officials have been in regular contact with Spanish and Commission colleagues on this issue since 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w05.html_para7">
Those outbreaks where a direct link has been made between Salmonella in cases and in eggs supplied to the caterer have been notified to the European Commission via the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) system. This enables the Spanish authorities to instigate follow-up investigations and take control measures on the farms supplying those eggs. Because eggs have often been used up before outbreaks are identified and investigated, it has not been possible to provide this type of information for many of the outbreaks where Spanish eggs are suspected to be the source.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w05.html_para8">
In order to minimise Salmonella contamination of eggs, it is necessary both to control Salmonella in laying flocks and ensure that eggs are subsequently handled appropriately. The new EU Zoonoses Directive requires member states to introduce Salmonella control programmes for laying flocks. The Spanish authorities 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Oct 2004 : Column 955W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
have drawn up a control programme which FSA and Defra officials will be discussing with them on 21 October 2004.

<p>
<a name="41025w05.html_para9">
As part of the Directive, a one year EU wide baseline study of the prevalence of Salmonella in laying hens will be undertaken, beginning in October 2004. Targets for reduction will then be introduced which all member states will have to comply with. This survey will also enable us to compare UK flock contamination levels with those in other member states.

<p><a name="41025w06.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the cash flow implications for farmers of the change in payment date between integrated administration and control system payments and the single farm payment.  [191475]</p>




<p><a name="41025w06.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) may have an impact on the cash flow of an individual farmer in a number of respects. The eligibility criteria and conditions attached to the SPS differ from those of existing schemes and this will affect the sums that a farmer is able to claim. The timing of payments may be different as a result of a slightly later opening of the payment window, though this may be off-set for some farmers as the entire sum will be paid as one payment as opposed to an advance in October/November followed by a balance payment the following April. In each case, the fact that the payment window was agreed in September 2003, over two years before the opening of the first Single Payment Scheme payment window, will have allowed farmers to plan their business well ahead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w06.html_para3">
The SPS is a decoupled scheme which will allow farmers to adjust their production to the needs of the market. The impact this will have on the volume and timing of individuals&#039; expenditure on inputs and market returns may well have a more significant impact on cash flow than on the amount and timing of subsidy payments.
</p>





<p><a name="41025w06.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what guidance regarding entitlement to the single farm payment she will give to farmers and growers who lease land <i>(a)</i> to and <i>(b)</i> from other farmers for growing a specific crop for a fixed sum of money for which some husbandry is provided.

<p><a name="41025w06.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 To establish an entitlement for the new single payment in 2005, the applicant will have to show that any eligible land supporting a claim forms part of his holding. A lease would constitute acceptable evidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w06.html_para4">
To claim payment against an entitlement so established, the claimant will have to show that the land in question has been &quot;at his disposal&quot; for a 10-month period. This period may start at any time from 1 October this year to 30 April next year. The definition of &quot;at the farmer&#039;s disposal&quot;is discussed at some length in a booklet that was sent to all farmers in England in August and which is available on Defra&#039;s website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w06.html_para5">
If the claim relates to land that is supporting a so-called negative list crop, the entitlement that has been established must have attached to it a special authorisation to claim against such crops. These authorisations will be attached to payment entitlements as they are established at the request of growers according to the level of their production of such crops in specified years (within regional ceilings).

The publication of farm-level data showing the names and amounts of Common Agriculture Policy subsidy payments generally come within this definition.

<p><a name="41025w07.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There are over 6,750 different species of flies (Diptera) in Britain, many of which are beneficial insects, being natural enemies of pests, pollinators of plants and decomposers of organic material, thereby playing an essential role in the functioning of ecosystems. Many flies are also important as food for other animals (fish, birds and mammals etc.). There are 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Oct 2004 : Column 959W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
few fly species that cause problems for people, as agricultural pests or vectors of disease, and for these species there are established preventive or control measures that can be taken. It would be both impossible and undesirable to take steps to reduce the UK abundance of flies overall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w07.html_para0">
Scenarios of climate change published by the UK Climate Impacts Programme indicate that the UK is likely to experience warmer, wetter winters, and hotter, probably drier, summers, with extreme high temperatures and rainfall events likely to occur more often. A Defra-funded research project (MONARCH) used these climate change scenarios to investigate impacts on the UK&#039;s flora and fauna. It is unlikely that flies will become more abundant overall under possible climate change scenarios. Some species may increase while others will decline, according to their temperature and humidity preferences etc.

<i>[holding answer given 14 October 2004]:</i> The Government monitors European research on the contribution of fluorinated (fluoridised) greenhouse gases to climate change. Research in this area tends to show that the contribution of fluorinated greenhouse gases to radiative forcing over the next century is small in comparison to some other greenhouse gases, and in particular CO <sub>2</sub> , which is expected to be responsible for approximately three quarters of the global warming experienced over this century. However, due to the persistence of fluorinated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere their contribution to climate change will extend well beyond this century.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to ensure that the red squirrel will be included in Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive.  [192518]</p>




<p><a name="41025w09.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Annex IV of the Habitats Directive lists the species for which member states must ensure a system of strict protection, including prohibiting taking, killing and trade in such species. This system of strict protection is applied in the UK by means of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994. Although the red squirrel is not listed in Annex IV of the Directive, it is strictly protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. It is also a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w09.html_para0">
The Department has recently begun reconsidering the scientific and technical information available on the conservation status of the red squirrel in other member states, and the best means of addressing the threats

 No data are currently available for these statistics. The Environment Agency does not collect data on the number of fridges that may have been dumped. Individual local authorities may collect some data, but these data are not currently collated on a national basis.

<a name="41025w09.html_para1">
The Government have been working with the Environment Agency and the Local Government Association to develop the Flycapture database, which will allow better national data to be collected in future on levels of fly tipping. The database will record levels of white goods that have been dumped. Data should be available within the next few months.

<p><a name="41025w09.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The EU Regulations governing the CAP Single Payment Scheme refer to &quot;other herbaceous forage&quot; in the definition of &quot;permanent pasture.&quot; We believe the intention behind these words was to clarify that those species which are commonly grazed alongside grasses should be regarded as permanent pasture. We do not believe that fodder crops such as maize are meant to be similarly regarded. However, we cannot be more definitive at this stage as the European Commission is considering the position with a view to inserting an amendment to the relevant EU Regulation which would provide a legal definition of &quot;other herbaceous forage.&quot; We will provide additional advice to interested parties as soon as the outcome of those considerations is known.

<p><a name="41025w09.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Tenancy Reform Industry Group reported to Ministers with recommendations for tenancy reform in June 2003. The recommendations included proposals for amendments to agricultural tenancy legislation, and a voluntary code of practice to assist landlords and tenants to reach agreement on proposals for diversification and participation in agri-environment schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w09.html_para2">
The Government accepted all the group&#039;s recommendations for legislative change, and, accordingly, issued a consultation document on proposals for amendment of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 and the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 in September this year.

The &quot;Code of Good Practice for Agri-environment Schemes and Diversification Projects within Agricultural Tenancies&quot; was published by the Tenancy Reform Industry Group and Defra at the end of September this year.

 The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1<i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). It provides that waste means, . . . any substance or object . . . which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.&quot; Whether or not a substance, such as used vegetable oil, is discarded as waste is a matter which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the interpretation of the definition of waste and the meaning of &quot;discard&quot;.

It is not within the power of the Government to exclude any particular substance, including waste vegetable oil, from the definition of waste.

<p><a name="41025w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Recent reports in the media have drawn attention to the anomalously high increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in 2003. This is the second year for which the increase has been unusually high.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w11.html_para0">
Following consultation with scientists working in the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research and elsewhere, we attribute the increases to three factors. These are greater emissions from forest fires, higher emissions from soils in areas where the climate was affected by the El Nino phenomenon in 2002, and acceleration in fossil fuel combustion in both years. In 2003 these factors together increased global emissions by an estimated 1 billion tonnes of carbon, or around 13 per cent. of the annual emissions in 2001.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w11.html_para1">
Although the increases do not necessarily indicate a departure from the long term trend, they will add to the cumulative economic and environmental risks associated with climate change, which include increased risk of flooding, health impacts, impacts on water availability, and loss of ecosystems and biological species.The Government is taking action nationally and internationally to reverse the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere including the ambitious goals set out in the Climate Change Programme and the Energy White Paper, and the identification by the Prime Minister of climate change as one of two priorities for the UK&#039;s Presidency of the G8.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of the average cost of setting up a nursery in <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> England.  [192097]</p>




<p><a name="41025w11.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 My Department has not made any estimate of the average cost of setting up a nursery. A range of factors give rise to considerable variation in costs including size of nursery, its location and size of the nursery provider. Under the neighbourhood nurseries initiative, &#163;243 million of revenue funding from the Sure Start Unit has been made available to local authorities to support the development and delivery of 45,000 new, affordable childcare places in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards. This will help to create new places in approximately 1,380 nurseries. Revenue funding of up to &#163;5,400 for each new childcare place created is awarded from when the nursery opens and paid on a sliding scale over a rolling three year period. This means that a new 50-place nursery would receive a maximum of &#163;270,000 set up costs over three years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w11.html_para2">
In addition, &#163;128 million from the Big Lottery Fund (formerly the New Opportunities Fund) and the Sure Start Unit has also been made available for the capital costs of setting up these neighbourhood nurseries. &#163;22.5 million of this capital has been made available to local authorities in London which will help to create 8,223 places in 237 nurseries ranging in size from six new places in an existing nursery up to 104 places in a new build project. Some of these projects involve building or refurbishing premises while other projects aim to create places in existing nursery settings. In many cases, neighbourhood nursery projects have also been able to take advantage of significant additional sources of capital funding from regeneration initiatives and other programmes. The capital costs incurred in setting up different neighbourhood nursery projects will therefore often vary widely.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Oct 2004 : Column 988W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41025w15.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 It is anticipated that all countries affected by Ivan, as well as those struck by other hurricanes this season, will review their preparedness and risk reduction capabilities. A variety of initiatives are already under way to identify lessons and, as importantly, to further engage decision makers in the process of advancing longer term risk reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w15.html_para0">
For example:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Caribbean Disaster Emergency and Response Agency (CDERA) will facilitate National Evaluations by affected countries and then host a high level forum to agree a future plan and priorities for action. The Department for International Development is considering support for this initiative.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A number of Caribbean organisations that provided immediate assistance to Grenada in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan, such as the Regional Security System and CDERA, as well as donor groups such as the Eastern Caribbean Donor Coordination Group, will be evaluating lessons learned from this year&#039;s hurricane season.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) is already assisting with socio economic impact assessments in Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. These assessments will provide valuable information for determining the investments required to reduce hurricane risks.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) will, early next year, undertake a study on best practice in disaster management in the Caribbean, based upon a case study done in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Department for International Development, in collaboration with the Cayman Island Government, has just commenced a study to determine Hurricane Ivan storm characteristics and consequential physical infrastructure damage. The study will aid the development of planning and preparedness criteria throughout the region. Also, both the Foreign Office and Department for International Development&#039;s Overseas Territories Departments are reviewing their mechanisms for responding to major hurricane strikes in the Overseas Territories together with additional requirements to promote longer-term risk reduction.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The World Conference on Disaster Reduction will be held in Kobe, Japan, in January 2005. Although planned over a year ago, well before the recent hurricane events in the Caribbean, the Conference will want to include consideration of the impact of hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne, and measures to mitigate against future shocks in the region.</p>

<p><a name="41025w15.html_wqn1"><b> Hugh Bayley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much has been contributed by each <i>(a)</i> OECD or Development Assistance Committee country and <i>(b)</i> multilateral aid donor in Official Development Assistance to (i) Kosovo, (ii) Afghanistan and (iii) Iraq since the start of allied military action in each country.  [192406]</p>




<p><a name="41025w15.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Details of expenditure (where available) are given for each member country of OECD DAC and the multilateral institutions for the years since allied military action started in each of the countries in question. However, as Kosovo has no legal entity as a separate country, development aid from donors has been delivered through regional programmes which include assistance to other areas in the region including Serbia and Montenegro. Disbursements from donors (apart from the UK) to these regional programmes are shown in the first table followed by DFID bilateral assistance provided to Kosovo.

The very small number of video games that fall into this category (32 of the 1,484 published in the UK in 2003), are submitted to the British Board of Film Classification. The BBFC carefully assesses all such games against published guidelines. Under the 1984 Act, it is a criminal offence to supply or offer to supply a legally classified game to a person below the specified age; the penalty is a fine of up to &#163;5,000 or imprisonment of up to six months, or both. It is also an offence to supply or offer to supply an uncertificated video game that should have been legally classified by the BBFC; the maximum penalty is an unlimited fine or imprisonment of up to two years, or both. Trading Standards Officers are the enforcement authorities for the 1984 Act.

<p>
<a name="41025w16.html_para1">
All other video games offered for sale or rental in the UK are subject to a voluntary classification system introduced by the industry itself. This is the Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) system, which now applies across 16 European countries, and is administered in the UK by the Video Standards Council. Between 1994 and the Spring of 2003, nearly 70 per cent. of published video games were rated as suitable for playing by people of all ages.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will estimate the <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> maximum time taken to process (i) a Criminal Records Bureau check, (ii) a full protection of vulnerable adults check (POVA) and (iii) a POVA first check;  [190528]

<p>(2) if he will make a statement on delays by the Criminal Records Bureau in processing protection of vulnerable adults first checks;  [190529]

<p><a name="41025w19.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 On the introduction of the POVAFirst service, the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) published the following service standard:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">To complete 98 per cent. of valid POVAFirst requests within 48 hours and 100 per cent. of checks within 72 hours. (This target does not include weekends or bank holidays).</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Oct 2004 : Column 1002W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w19.html_para0">
The CRB is now delivering 80 per cent. within 48 hours and 96 per cent. in 72 hours and these figures will improve further. However, it is important to note that CRB&#039;s service standard applies only once the Bureau has received a fully completed/valid Disclosure application form and a fully completed POVAFirst request. The average time taken by the CRB to process a POVAFirst check is one day. The maximum time taken to process checks in October was 25 days, while clearing the last few old applications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w19.html_para1">
For the first few weeks following the launch of the POVAFirst service the Bureau operated outside of its service standards. This dip in performance was largely due to the volume of POVAFirst requests received and because a number of registered bodies have been failing to follow the POVAFirst guidelines correctly, resulting in over 72 per cent. of all initial requests being returned to the registered body for correction. These have caused the Bureau&#039;s resources to be diverted away from processing correctly submitted requests in a timely manner. The situation has now improved and I can confirm that the overwhelming majority of POVAFirst requests are now being cleared within service standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w19.html_para2">
The POVA check is incorporated within the CRB&#039;s overall Disclosure process and the only indicator available to measure the time taken by the CRB when checking the POVA list is the figure provided for completion of full criminal records checks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w19.html_para3">
Over the past 12 months, on average, 94 per cent. of Standard Disclosures have been issued within two weeks; and 91.5 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures have been issued within four weeks. These performance figures exceed the Bureau&#039;s published service standards of issuing 90 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w19.html_para4">
The processing of Standard Disclosures is entirely within the control of the CRB, however, Enhanced Disclosures involve an additional level of checking with local police forces. On 22 June Sir Michael Bichard published his report on Soham, in which he criticised local police forces in their handling of their local intelligence searches. Since then many forces have reviewed their handling and recording of local police information. This has impacted the CRB&#039;s public service standard for processing Enhanced Disclosure applications. The CRB are working very closely with each force to help them improve the time it is taking them to process these local checks. The CRB has in the past seconded a number of staff to forces to help them reduce the number of outstanding checks as quickly as possible. This action has already seen a rapid improvement in the performance of a number of forces.

Primary responsibility for legislation on the protection of badgers rests with colleagues in Defra. I noted the organisations&#039; particular concern that there should be clear statistics. Although the principal offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 carry the possibility of imprisonment, in common with very many others on the Statute Book they are triable only by a magistrates court. Only offences triable in the Crown court are notifiable to the Home Office for the purpose of crime statistics. I made it clear that we are anxious to explore other options and Home Office officials continue to seek, with the Association of Chief Police Officers, a solution that will address the concerns of all parties and that will inform the decisions of chief police officers about the deployment of resources to tackle these deplorable offences.

The growth in the size and importance of the UK private security industry operating overseas strengthens the case for regulation of this sector. Developing such regulation is a complex undertaking, as set out in the Government&#039;s Green Paper &quot;Private Military Companies&quot;, published on 12 February 2002. There are a number of difficult questions of definition and enforcement in deciding how to approach such regulation. The cost of regulation is also potentially high, for both Government and industry.

When considering regulation the Government recognises that there is a legitimate role for the private sector in providing security in post-conflict situations, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Notes<br>

1. Maternity payments (MP) were abolished in 2000&#150;01 and replaced by Sure Start Maternity Grants (SSMG). The change was phased in from 27 March 2000.<br>

2. The Government Office Region (GOR) of Yorkshire and Number was created in April 2002. However, data on the area covered by this GOR is available only from December 2002. Prior to that, data is given for the Area Directorate of Yorkshire, which corresponds to a large part of the Yorkshire and Humber GOR. Therefore the tables refer to different areas, and the data is not comparable.<br>





3. City of York parliamentary constituency used to be part of North Yorkshire Social Fund District and is now part of North Yorkshire Jobcentre Plus District. The latter was formed in November 2003 from North Yorkshire Social Fund District and part of Bradford and Keighley Social Fund District. Therefore the tables refer to different areas, and the data is not comparable.<br>

4. The very small number of SSMG awards for 1999&#150;2000 has been excluded for data protection reasons.<br>

5. All Sure Start Maternity Grant awards have been included not just those awarded to mothers.<br>

 Poverty is about more than low income, it also impacts on the way people live&#151;their health, housing and the quality of their environment.

The reductions in staff numbers are being managed through recruitment controls, natural wastage, redeployment and voluntary releases.

From 1 April 2005, the tariff will apply to all national health service providers and, to ensure uniformity of approach and data flows, the single episode is being replaced with a dual tariff for first attendance and follow up attendance.

<p><a name="41025w30.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Research that involves the use of human embryos requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA charges a fee of &#163;200 for a research licence application. It costs the HFEA an average of &#163;6,000 to consider and process a research licence application and, if awarded, regulate it. Earlier this year, the HFEA undertook a public consultation exercise on proposals to increase the fee to make it more representative of the cost to the Authority of considering and processing research licence applications and regulating the licence once awarded. Following the consultation, the HFEA proposes to increase the fee to &#163;500 for small research projects, rising to &#163;750 for more substantial projects. Although a significant increase, it would not cover the full cost to the HFEA of handling the licence applications, as to do so might jeopardise research in the United Kingdom, including important stem cell research. The proposed fee increase would therefore continue to require subsidisation from the funding that the HFEA receives from the Department.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the future of EMIS.  [192806]</p>




<p><a name="41025w30.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 October 2004]:</i> Egton Medical Information Systems (EMIS) are suppliers of significant numbers of medical information systems to primary care practitioners. Currently around 55 per cent. of general practitioner practices use the EMIS suite of software products on annually renewed contracts.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Oct 2004 : Column 1045W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w30.html_para2">
The position in relation to the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) in England is that EMIS are working co-operatively with NPfIT to make their systems compliant for the programme&#039;s electronic booking service. EMIS also co-operated with the recent upgrade to GP IT systems to support the quality and outcomes framework introduced under the new general medical services contract.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w30.html_para3">
In terms of commercial arrangements, EMIS have told NPfIT that they have not been able to reach a satisfactory contractual arrangement with any of the programme&#039;s local service providers who are responsible for delivering NPfIT applications at a local level. They have indicated that for the time being they intend to continue managing their business on the current basis. The NPfIT would prefer that EMIS were participating more directly in its on-going programme. However, there are certain contractual and operational conditions that come with direct participation, which EMIS have, to date, had difficulty in accepting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w30.html_para4">
It is a matter for EMIS to decide whether the company will contract with one or more local service provider. If they are unable or unwilling to do this, it is open to them to continue to supply their systems as long as GPs choose to buy them.

Notes:<br>

Time waited statistics from hospital episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the &quot;admission&quot; and &quot;decision to admit&quot; dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

 The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety carry out an annual review of the consultant work force in each of the hospital-based specialties and the number in training are adjusted to meet the assessed need, subject to available resources. Work force plans for consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists indicate a need for sustained investment in training.

 On 13 September 2004, I announced my proposals for the basis upon which household water and sewerage charges will be set. The announcement made clear that the new charges would be phased in from 2006&#150;07, or as soon as practicable thereafter. In my statement I acknowledged the strong preference for metering by those who had expressed an opinion in the 2003 consultation exercise. In recognition of this, and despite the fact that metering was ruled out by the Northern Ireland Executive in its 2002 consultation on rating policy, I am proposing to make provision for household metering once charges are fully phased in&#151;that is, the third year of charging. This will provide time to develop an approach to metering which promotes reduced consumption, is fair and affordable and which does not have unacceptable consequences for those on low incomes or vulnerable groups.

 The assessments of housing need that underpin Local Housing Strategies should include the accommodation needs of gypsies and travellers. Clauses in the current Housing Bill would give statutory force to this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w40.html_para0">
These assessments are an essential part of the evidence base that informs Regional Housing Strategies (RHSs) and Regional Spatial Strategies (RSSs). Regional Assemblies and Regional Housing Boards have an important role to play in working with authorities to ensure that these assessments are robust and consistent across the region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w40.html_para1">
There will be close co-ordination in the production of revised RHSs and RSSs to ensure that they reflect the need for gypsies&#039; and travellers&#039; pitches. The RSS will set out the level of pitch provision to be provided in each local authority area. The identification of where the sites should be in each authority&#039;s area or how &quot;windfall&quot; sites will be determined will be the responsibility of the local planning authorities in preparing their Development Plan Documents (DPDs). Under the 2004 Act, it is a requirement that DPDs are in general conformity with the Regional Spatial Strategy.

<a name="41025w41.html_para2">
<i>(a)</i> In the case of Warrington, it is of course for the borough council to make an assessment of affordable housing needs. They have done so in their draft unitary development plan (UDP) which has recently been tested at a public inquiry. The council has identified a current shortfall of 42 dwellings per year. A policy has been included in the UDP to enable the council, when determining planning applications, to negotiate for an element of affordable housing on proposed schemes.

<p><a name="41025w41.html_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The assessment of demand for housing is best carried out by those responsible locally for such matters. In February this year, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published a Housing Market Assessment Manual. This encourages local authorities to work in partnership with each other and other stakeholders to develop a more strategic view of housing need and demand at the sub-regional housing market level.

The North East Housing Board is currently considering the issue of affordable housing in the region as part of the work being carried out to update the regional housing strategy which will be submitted to the Government in May 2005. The local demand for affordable homes should therefore feature in the work currently being undertaken by the Tyne and Wear Housing Partnership.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on reform of local government since 1997; and what the costs of that reform have been.  [191165]</p>




<p><a name="41025w42.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The measures the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has taken to modernise local government are leading to an improvement in local authorities&#039; performance. For example, the second year of Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) results for single tier and county councils showed that councils are making real improvements in their delivery of key services. Nearly a third of all 150 authorities achieved a higher star rating for Social Services and only two local authorities failed to make any improvements in education. Furthermore, 55 per cent. of all single tier and county councils are now rated &#039;good&#039; or &#039;excellent&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w42.html_para0">
Also, the interim findings of the Cardiff Business School&#039;s evaluation of the long-term impact of best value in English local authorities from 2001 until 2005 suggest that best value is having a positive impact on the internal culture of many local authorities and better outcomes for local people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41025w42.html_para1">
Furthermore, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recognised the need to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy for councils and last year (2003&#150;04) saw a reduction in inspection for local authorities of around one third and a reduction of 90 per cent. for top performers. We have also cut the number of plans authorities are required to produce by 75 per cent. Apart from the money that is set aside for schools, we are reducing the percentage of grant that is ring-fenced and expect this to be in single figures by next year.

Since 1997, the Government have undertaken a wide-ranging number of reforms as part of the Local Government modernisation agenda. However, information about the costs of these reforms is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
