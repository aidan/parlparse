 The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a loan guarantee to encourage additional bank lending to viable SMEs that lack collateral to secure a normal commercial loan. As such, the Department does not allocate funds to particular sectors or businesses. But rather it is for the accredited lender to make commercial lending decisions to individual SMEs seeking finance on a case-by-case basis. The Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process.</p>

 The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) uses two mechanisms to ensure the value for money of its expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="101203w0001.htm_para8"><a name="10120320000185">Firstly, NERC adopts standard HM Treasury guidance on its decisions regarding major equipment purchases, conducting a rigorous business case process that accommodates investment appraisal evidence. NERC ensures the level of delegated authority afforded to individual budget holders and the sub-committees they manage is appropriate to their level of experience and training. For example, approximately £100 million of NERC's expenditure is awarded as research grants, each of which are subject to a rigorous and independent process that assesses value for money before authorisation. All of these internal mechanisms are then supported by NERC's involvement with the Research Councils' Shared Service Centre whose strategic and operational procurement functions ensure NERC's expenditure is spent with the most competitively priced suppliers who have met their assessment of quality goods or service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="101203w0001.htm_para9"><a name="10120320000186">Secondly, NERC contributes to Research Council targets for value for money savings, administrative efficiency and asset disposals. The original targets were set out in the NERC allocation of the science budget for 2008-09 to 2010-11 (dated October 2007) and have since been increased as part of the April 2009 Budget. The specific level of the NERC contribution to these targets is agreed collectively by Research Councils through the Value for Money Efficiency Delivery Project Board. This board reports quarterly to my Department, recording savings achieved and forecasting savings for the remainder of the spending review period. These savings are subject to independent audit by the Research Councils' Internal Audit Service.</p>

NERC met ship owners in the UK, Ireland and Germany and three private sector ship operating companies. The review demonstrated that NERC manages its ship operations to a level of efficiency and effectiveness that matches industry standards. NERC continues to monitor its performance against that of commercial operators of Government research ships. In addition, since 1987 NERC has been a member of the International Research Ship Operators' Meeting which shares best practice in Government research ship operations. The group now consists of 19 countries.</p>

 There is no agreed definition of net neutrality. However, the Government are absolutely committed to an open internet. The internet has brought huge economic and social benefits across the world, precisely because of its openness and that must continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="101203w0001.htm_para29"><a name="10120320000281">A contributing factor to the success of the internet has been the lack of legislative restraints that have been placed on it. It is our belief that improved transparency requirements provided by recent revisions to the Electronic Communications Framework, along with a competitive market place and the ability to easily switch providers will mean that regulation in this area will be unnecessary. It is important that we give the market the opportunity to self-regulate, but Ofcom will closely monitor how the market develops and if it develops in an anti-competitive way they will intervene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="101203w0001.htm_para30"><a name="10120320000282">In addition, I have made it clear that the Government expect all operators providing an internet access service-both fixed and mobile-to offer all legal content. Consumers should always be able to access any content or service they want to and at the speed they have contracted with their ISP to receive, while content providers and applications should be able to access consumers. ISPs should not be able to discriminate unfairly against services or users. That means no blocking or discriminatory degradation of services or applications for commercial reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="101203w0001.htm_para31"><a name="10120320000283">There is not yet any evidence that discriminatory practices are emerging in the UK, or that there is a problem with regards to how ISPs or networks manage the traffic that flows over them (something they all engage in for technical reasons to deliver the best possible service to consumers). And this is reinforced by the initial responses to Ofcom's recent consultation on the issue. However, I would like to stress again that should the market develop in a way that damages openness or impedes innovation in spite of the safeguards I have detailed above, we will not hesitate to step in to ensure that the internet remains the open, innovative place we all benefit from.</p>

These requirements include shared responsibilities for the safety of spectators and visitors between transport hubs and sporting venues where existing budgets cannot cover the additional requirement, and specific extra responsibilities for host local authorities where the burden imposed for Games-time operations is of such a scale that it should not be borne solely by local council-tax payers. The Government also remain committed to the public sector funding half of the incremental cost of the Paralympic Games. The remainder of the funding package-around £0.5 billion-will be held as an Olympic contingency for cross-programme issues, including any major changes in security circumstances. Further details will be included in the next Annual Report for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games which is due to be published in February 2011.</p>

 Benzodiazepines have been used for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia since the early 1960s. When the Medicines Act 1968 came into force in 1971 all medicines that were on the United Kingdom market at the time were automatically given a Product Licence of Right (PLR). The licence for lorazepam (brand name Ativan) was originally issued by the then Medicines Division of the Department of Health and Social Security in 1972. For products with a PLR, product information had been prepared by the manufacturers and the PLRs were subsequently reviewed by the Committee for the Review of Medicines (CRM), an independent scientific advisory body set up for this purpose. CRM advised that full product licences should be granted for lorazepam.</p>

Article 10.1 of the directive enables applications for generic medicinal products to refer to the safety and efficacy data of the reference product provided bioequivalence to the reference product has been demonstrated. After a period of clinical use (10 years in the UK) safety and efficacy will have been better established and repetitive tests on humans or animals are not justified without over-riding cause. Since 2003, approximately 5,200 product licences have been granted under Article 10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, encompassing around 400 drug substances.

While in Nigeria, I visited the PrOpCom agriculture programme, designed to enhance commodity and services market development in the agriculture sector. I have also witnessed how private sector investment and innovative business models are providing livelihood opportunities in Ghana, through the Ghana Grains Partnership (GGP) Maize Farm. I also visited a tree nursery in Ghana and stayed with a family in their hut in Gupanerigu, Northern Ghana, who were maize and groundnut farmers. In Sierra Leone I met farmers from Bo district where we discussed the issues of land licensing, market access and labour skills, especially for women.
