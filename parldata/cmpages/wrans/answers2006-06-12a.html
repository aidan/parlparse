Whether or not a claimant was represented by a company providing claims
handling services, rather than by solicitors, can therefore only be
ascertained by retrieving the relevant files and examining the
correspondence in order to discover the identity of each claimant's
representative. Such an exercise would be labour intensive and would be

Bradshaw</b><i> [holding answer 5 June 2006]:</i> Defra issues
licences to allow the interference with badger setts to prevent serious
damage to property, and to permit agricultural, forestry or drainage
operations. The majority of licences involve interference to exclude
badgers from part or all of a sett, sometimes followed by sett
destruction. Very few licences for translocation of badgers are
granted. Some licensed activities include maintenance works undertaken
by transport infrastructure
companies.</p><p><a name="06061224000092">Badgers
typically have more than one sett which they use in their territory.
Thus there is no reason to believe that the closure, or partial
closure, of a sett would necessarily cause badgers to move outside
their normal range. My Department has commissioned a study which
involves looking at badger movements when licensed sett interference is
carried out in urban situations. However it is too early to draw any
conclusions from this work which is currently under way.</p><p><a name="06061224000093">Defra's wildlife management
advisers ensure that a proportion of licences is assessed through
monitoring. 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>12 Jun 2006 : Column 887W</b><br>The method, timing and amount of monitoring will vary depending upon a
number of factors such as the species, site or activities being
licensed. Defra aims to monitor around 30 per cent. of badger licences;
a proportion of these will be targeted towards sensitive or complex
cases such as those involving translocation or cases that have
attracted a high level of public attention. The results of monitoring
are recorded and if a breach of licence conditions has been identified
Defra will consider an appropriate course of enforcement
action.</p><p><a name="06061224000094">English Nature
issues licences to permit the disturbance of badgers and destruction of
setts during the course of development activities, which would include
some activities associated with the maintenance of transport
infrastructure. English Nature does not licence the translocation of
animals in these cases&#151;it licences disturbance to setts, and
where setts are to be lost as a result of the activity the licence
allows animals to be excluded from the sett before it is destroyed.
Where no suitable alternative setts are available nearby for the
badgers to move to, an artificial sett must be constructed within the
animals' existing territory, before they are excluded from their
existing sett. No significant movement of badgers is likely to result
from these
activities.</p><p><a name="06061224000095">In the
very few cases where Defra has licensed the translocation of badgers to
another part of the country, it has been a condition of the licence

Bradshaw</b><i> [holding answer 8 June 2006]:
</i>On26 May, Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VMS) was
confirmed in samples of fish taken from a trout farm in the River Ouse
catchment area of North Yorkshire. VMS is a notifiable disease and the
Department has a contingency plan in place for dealing with outbreaks
of VMS and other serious fish
diseases.</p><p><a name="06061224000517">In line with
these arrangements, Fish Health Inspectors from the Centre for
Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), under DEFRA's
direction, immediately formed a National Control Centre (NCC) to
co-ordinate action to manage the outbreak with other partners,
including the Environment Agency. The NCC is based at the CEFAS
laboratory in
Weymouth.</p><p><a name="06061224000518">Fish from
the affected farm were slaughtered humanely with full co-operation from
the farm owners. The fish have been disposed of in accordance with
animal by-products
legislation.</p><p><a name="06061224000519">DEFRA has
placed restrictions on the movement of fish into and out of the Ouse
catchment area, and specifically on all farms in that
area.</p><p><a name="06061224000520">The cause of the
VMS outbreak has not been identified, but extensive epidemiological
investigations are underway to try and determine the source. A
comprehensive sampling programme is also taking place, targeting fish
farms and wild sites in the Ouse catchment as well as other possible
contacts. Results are expected within the next 14 days. No further
disease cases have been identified by recent sampling and
inspections.</p><p><a name="06061224000521">Stakeholders
make regular representations to the Department about compensating fish
farmers for the compulsory slaughter of stock due to an outbreak of a
serious fish disease. We have made it clear that it is not our policy
to make compensation available in these circumstances. However, EU
legislation does allow fish from an infected site to be on-grown for
marketing, provided they do not display any clinical signs of
disease.</p><p><a name="06061224000522">VHS has no

purposes of the Waste Incineration Directive (WID),
&#147;waste&#148; means any solid or liquid waste as defined in
Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). Whether or not a
substance is &#147;waste&#148; within the meaning of Article 1(a)
of the WFD is a matter that must be determined on the facts of the case
and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the
courts.</p><p><a name="06061224000528">In addition
the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) ((EC) No. 1774/2002)
requires a range of animal by-products, and substances derived from
them (for example, tallow), to be disposed of as waste. Where the
method of disposal is incineration or co-incineration (that is, use as
a fuel), the ABPR requires it to be carried out in compliance with the
WID. The ABPR is directly applicable in all EU member
states.</p><p><a name="06061224000529">We understand
other member states are at various stages in discussing the
implications of the regulations on burning tallow in their own
countries. However, in response to representations by the UK
Government, the European Commission has set up a study to help
establish whether such controls are proportionate and necessary to the
protection of the environment. The study is expected to report by the
autumn, and the Government are pressing the Commission for the study to
be completed as soon as
possible.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06061224000044">Waste

non-governmental organisations

State</i></p><a name="06061311000775"><ul><p class="tabletext">This includes support
for the transition institutions (such as the Parliament, Electoral
Commission and High Media Authority), the establishment of a
professional and impartial media sector, and preparation for elections.

Reconstruction</i></p><a name="06061311000776"><ul><p class="tabletext">Support for
infrastructure within the Government&#146;s reconstruction plan,
especially transport links; the development of a poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP); support to the social sectors (health, education
and water) largely through NGOs; and the fight against HIV/AIDS through
the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and
NGOs.</p></ul><p><a name="06061311000380"><i> 4. Natural Resources
and Enhanced Revenue
Generation</i></p><a name="06061311000777"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have funded
research by Global Witness into the current state of natural resources
management in the DRC. We are supporting the implementation of the

other international obligations; and strengthening financial management

the WFP were forced earlier in the year to halve food rations to Darfur
temporarily, though ration levels elsewhere have been maintained.
Recent additional support from two key food aid donors (the EU and the
US), and a contribution of 20,000 tonnes of Sorghum from the Government
of Sudan, has since enabled the WFP to increase the ration level in
Darfur to 84 per cent. Reinstatement of full ration may be possible by
October, though this is still not
certain.</p><p><a name="06061311000552">This year,

includes specifying how the relevant services should undertake separate
management reviews, and how the LSCB should commission an overview
report which brings together and analyses the findings. &#145;Working
Together&#146; states that the LSCB should consider carefully who
might have an interest in reviews, for example, elected and appointed
members of authorities, and what information should be made available
to each of these interests, considering a number of factors including
the need to maintain confidentiality in respect of personal
information, and the accountability of public services. In all cases

local partners and key stakeholders as well as by the inspectorates.
Elected members&#146; role, through their membership of governance
bodies such as the cabinet of the local authority or a scrutiny
committee or a governance board, is to hold their organisation and its
officers to account for their contribution to the effective functioning
of the LSCB. The lead member for children's services within the local
authority will have a particular focus on how the local authority is
fulfilling its responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of

Association of British Insurers, insurance issues related to school-age
work experience. The ABI confirmed the continuation of the
long-standing convention by which school students on placement are
considered to be covered by the employers&#146; liability policy, as
if they were employees. Generally, insurers make no charge for this
insurance, provided they are notified of the placement in advance or
have a longer-term agreement that the employer will regularly offer
work experience. There should not therefore be premiums to pay which
might act as a barrier to the employer&#146;s involvement. This is
also the case where employers take on apprentices. Further discussions
on these questions would be welcome.</p><p><a name="06061315001513"><b><a name="06061315001751">Mr.

the start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT),
without pre-conditions, which we view as the next logical step towards
achieving the goals of nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons. In this regard, the UK fully supports the US
initiative in tabling a draft FMCT text on 18 May. We hope that all CD
member states are able to accept the very broad mandate proposed and
agree to open negotiations towards a treaty without delay.</p><p><a name="06061317000098">The UK believes that the CD

disruption, the Agency could broker a new fuel supply agreement between
a state and an alternate supplier. Suppliers, and their Governments,
could give an undertaking to provide a back-up if relevant

make supplies available from a multilateral reserve of uranium,

estate is 1,700 spaces less than the certified operational capacity.
This operating margin reflects the constraints imposed by the need to
provide separate accommodation for different groups of prisoners such
as gender, age, security category and conviction status, as well as the
necessary provision of single cells, accommodation out of use and the
geographical distribution of prisons and prisoners.</p><p><a name="06061319000746">In April 2004, a database was
introduced to assist with the management of the prison population. The
more accurate information it provides enabled us to reduce the
operating margin in stages from 2,000 to 1,700 places. The reduction
added 300 places to the useable operating capacity while still
maintaining a sufficient operating margin to manage the prison
population safely.</p>

the UK. It does not matter whether the evidence was obtained here or
abroad.</p><p><a name="06061319000815">During the
individual appeals against certification under powers provided under
part four of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act (ATCSA), the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) emphatically rejected any
suggestion that evidence relied upon by the Government was, or even may
have been, obtained by torture. The Court of Appeal later confirmed the
view of SIAC. This issue is currently before the House of Lords&#146;
Judicial Committee. It is not always possible to know where all
intelligence information has come from or the precise circumstances
under which it was obtained. The Security Service and Secret
Intelligence Service receive material from a wide range of foreign
intelligence services. The agencies evaluate the reliability of this
intelligence against other information available to them. It is then
passed, together with an assessment of reliability, to the
Government.</p><p><a name="06061319000816">It may be
necessary in some circumstances to rely operationally on material which
may have been obtained through the use of torture where it is
considered necessary to do so, in particular for preventing terrorist
attack and protecting life. The Government do not believe there is an
absolute exclusionary rule preventing the use of such evidence in legal
proceedings to assess the lawfulness of such executive action. Such a
rule could endanger national security as it would undermine our ability
to defend in court the decision made and therefore inhibit executive
action to protect national security.</p><p><a name="06061319000817">We do not condone torture in
any way, nor would we carry out this completely unacceptable behaviour.
However, we do have an obligation to protect national security and
