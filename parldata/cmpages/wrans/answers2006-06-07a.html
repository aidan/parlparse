frequency of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd testing is determined by EU
legislation but this does not establish the frequency of tests on
individual cattle. In Great Britain, cattle herds are tested every one,
two, three or four years depending on how widespread bTB is in their
respective regions; these frequencies are reviewed on an annual basis.
The percentage of herds and parishes being tested annually has
increased over the last few years; currently, about 25 per cent. of
herds are tested annually and another 14 per cent. are tested every two
years. In 2005, approximately 43,500 herd tests were carried out on
4.85 million
cattle.</p><p><a name="06060874000215">An analysis of

which had lived through the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak when bTB
testing was severely
disrupted.</p><p><a name="06060874000216">Many of the
animals not being tested do not present a disease control risk. For
example, some animals in low risk herds are slaughtered prior to a herd
test becoming due. However, we accept that a small percentage of
animals missing a bTB test may present a disease risk. Defra is
supporting further work in this

Primarolo:</b> Child care costs are affected by a number of
factors, such as the availability of child care provision, local wage
levels, or land or rental prices where child care is offered. The child
care element of the working tax credit has had a significant impact on
the affordability of child care for low to moderate-income families,
reducing the proportion of child care costs that they pay. Through the
child care element of the working tax credit, working parents receive
financial assistance with up to 80 per cent. of the costs of registered
and approved child care, up to a maximum of &#163;300 per week
(&#163;175 for one child). In April 2006 374,000 families were
benefiting from the child care element, and they were receiving an
average of &#163;50 per week towards their child care
costs.</p><p><a name="06060874000890">The Government

individual localities, the figures may be subject to some variation but
they provide a useful estimate. 3. City of London has been omitted

advice of the School Meals Review Panel and the School Food Trust was
that only very young children require full-fat milk as part of their
diet; and that once children are at school, semi-skimmed and skimmed
versions of milk are entirely adequate. This approach reflects current
nutrition advice, which is based on advice from the Committee on
Medical Aspects of Food Policy (now replaced by the Scientific Advisory
Committee on Nutrition) who considered this issue in relation to
cardiovascular disease. Current advice highlights the important role
that milk and dairy products play in children&#146;s diets,
particularly their contribution to children&#146;s calcium intake;
and states that school-aged children should have the opportunity to
choose lower fat versions of milk as these contain at least the same
amount of calcium as whole milk, but less

Dhanda</b><i> [holding answer 18 June 2006]</i>:
Schools&#146; core business is teaching and learning, but teachers
themselves recognise that to achieve the best results they must
supplement their focus on teaching and learning with appropriate
additional support, and work with other professional agencies to remove
barriers to achievement. The Every Child Matters reforms will help them
do this by enabling schools to link in with wider children's services,
and access their expertise and experience. This is particularly useful
in helping schools respond to the needs of more vulnerable young
people, such as those who may run away. In addition, the Every Child
Matters: Change for Children programme is improving integrated working
at the local level along with enhanced information sharing between
children's services leading to earlier identification of young people's
needs.</p><p><a name="06060874002334">More broadly,
there exist opportunities within the current curriculum, under PSHE and
Citizenship Frameworks, for schools to explore issues to do with
recognising and managing risks (i.e. if you runaway, what risks would
you face); understanding emotions and strategies for dealing with
stress; the importance of family and stable relationships; and knowing
where to get help. We are not prescriptive with schools about what
issues schools explore to achieve the learning objectives set out
within the Frameworks, and local need determines local
provision.</p><p><a name="06060874002335">In
addition, DfES has run 6 development projects to test out how best to
provide safe, flexible and responsive community-based services that can
be easily incorporated into mainstream children's services. When we
disseminate the lessons learnt so far from these, later this year, they
will include information, materials and support models from work with
schools in the pilot
areas.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060874000092">School

implications for voter participation of extended polling time in
elections. [75184]</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 677W</b><br><p><a name="06060874002691"><b><a name="06060874005105">Peter
Viggers:</b> In its review of election timetables in 2003, the
Electoral Commission recommended standardising the hours of polling for
all elections at those used for parliamentary general elections and
other national elections, to increase participation and reduce
confusion between local and parliamentary
elections.</p><p><a name="06060874002692">The
Government agreed with this recommendation and the standardised polling
hours of 7 am to 10 pm applied generally at local government elections
in England for the first time in May 2006. The Commission informs me
that it is collecting data from returning officers on levels of voting
during the additional polling hours, and intends to publish the results
of its analysis in late summer
2006.</p><p><a name="06060874002693">The Commission
has also evaluated a number of electoral pilot schemes trialling
extended polling hours at local elections since 2002. In these, between
5 and 10 per cent. of people voting in person at polling stations chose
to take advantage of the extended polling
hours.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06060874000016">Prime

[75488]</p><p><a name="06060874002699"><b><a name="06060874005110">Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> It is a basic principle of the social security
system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for income
maintenance and there are no plans to change this
rule.</p><p><a name="06060874002700">Bereavement
allowance is an income maintenance benefit for those who have lost a
spouse who had worked and therefore contributed to the national
insurance scheme, whilst carer's allowance provides a measure of income
maintenance for those forgoing the opportunity of full-time employment
to care for a severely disabled person who is entitled to attendance
allowance or the middle or highest rate of the disability living
allowance care
component.</p><p><a name="06060874002701">In
practice, where there is entitlement to both benefits, bereavement
allowance as a contributory benefit takes precedence. However, where
the rate of bereavement allowance is less than the rate of carer's
allowance, an amount of carer's allowance can be paid to make up the
difference. Even where no carer's allowance can be paid, underlying
entitlement to the allowance gives access to the carer premium in
income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, and to the
carer's additional amount in pension
credit.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06060874000018">Northern

Lidington:</b> To ask the Secretary of State
forte forte for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answer of11
May 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 541W, on sex offenders, for
what offences each of the people whose addresses are not known to the
police were convicted; whether any of these people have been assessed
as a danger to public safety; and whether they were subject to
supervision and control orders at the time they moved from their last
known residential address.
[74314]</p><p><a name="06060874003784"><b><a name="06060874005186">Mr.
Hanson:</b> Sex offender compliance with the notification
requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is high at around 97 per
cent. in Northern Ireland. Notifications are recorded by the police on
a live database and the number of unregistered offenders in breach of
the requirements may therefore fluctuate on a daily basis. A search of
the database to provide the information in reply to the hon.
gentleman's question showed that the number of offenders subject to the
notification requirements and for whom the police did not have a
current residential address has now reduced to 11. The offences for
which these offenders had been convicted were as follows: three for
rape; one attempted rape; two unlawful carnal knowledge; two indecent
assault on a female; two making/possessing indecent images of children;
one buggery. One person with a conviction for making/possessing
indecent images of children was subject to probation supervision at the
time they failed to comply with the notification requirements. Of the
eleven offenders, four had been subject to a multi agency risk
assessment with no one being assessed as Category 3 High Risk i.e.
someone whose sexual offending has been assessed as currently likely to
lead them to seriously harm other people. PSNI pursue a policy of
actively seeking to trace offenders who fail to comply with the
notification requirements. This includes placing the offender's details
on ViSOR and PNC to alert other UK police forces, checking with
agencies such as social security to establish if the offender is
claiming benefits etc, and providing full details to colleagues in An
Garda Siochana who then complete similar checks for the offender in the
Republic of
Ireland.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060874000160">Smithsonian

Coaker:</b> The Government's Drug Interventions programme
(DIP) which began in 2003 is providing a route out of crime and into
treatment for drug misusing offenders who commit crime to feed their
habit. DIP uses contact with the criminal justice system as an
opportunity to engage drug misusing offenders in treatment and
support.</p><p><a name="06060876000190">Individuals
who are arrested for certain offences including theft&#151;which
includes shoplifting&#151;in the98 areas with the highest
levels of acquisitive crime are tested for Class A drugs as a part of
DIP. Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a
drugs worker. Testing on arrest is a way of identifying drug misusers
at an early stage in the criminal justice process. Other key elements
of the programme are operating across England and in
Wales.</p><p><a name="06060876000191">The Drug
Interventions programme continues to have a positive impact in
communities not only by the interventions that it offers but also by
delivering a more integrated approach by local agencies to the problems
of offenders. Since the programme began over 43,000 drug misusing
offenders have entered treatment through
DIP.</p><p><a name="06060876000192">Acquisitive
recorded crime&#151;to which drug related crime (including theft)
makes a substantial contribution fell by 12 per cent. in the year to
April 2005 compared with the previous 12
months.</p>

Witness Care Units (WCUs) were piloted in 2003 in 5 areas, Gwent,
Essex, North Wales, South Yorkshire and the West Midlands. An
independent evaluation of these pilots found that witness attendance at
court improved by nearly 20 per cent. and that there was an overall
increase of six per cent. in victim and witness satisfaction. It also
showed that the number of trials which had to be adjourned as a result
of witness difficulties decreased by 27 per cent. and that there was a
17 per cent. reduction in &#145;cracked&#146;

There was a 10 per cent. increase in the number of
&#145;positive&#146; cracked trials where the defendant entered a
late guilty
plea.</p><p><a name="06060876000446">Building on the
success of these pilots, Witness Care Units were rolled out across all
42 criminal justices areas in England and Wales under the No Witness No
Justice project. Full coverage was achieved in line with our target of
December 2005, with 165 Witness Care Units now in
operation.</p><p><a name="06060876000447">Although
relatively new, Witness Care Units have already demonstrated their
effectiveness. The number of trials that did not go ahead as planned
because a witness did not attend was reduced from a national average of
908 in September 2004 to 727 in August 2005, a decrease of almost 20
per cent. In those cases handled by Witness Care Units, the witness
attendance rate has increased from 78.5 per cent. in the 3 months
before WCUs went live to 84 per cent. in August
2005.</p><p><a name="06060876000448">A sustainability
plan for the project is currently being developed which will provide a
detailed analysis of the benefits of Witness Care Units, taking into
account savings in time for the police, prosecutors and court
officials, reductions in cracked and ineffective trials and savings in
legal
costs.</p><p><a name="06060876000449"><b><a name="06060876001255">Mr.

better services for the
public.</p><p><a name="06060876000452">It is
important that witnesses are valued, kept informed and looked
after?whether or not they are called upon to attend court. Witness Care
Units ensure that witnesses receive a more thoughtful and tailor-made
service, with their individual needs considered from the time a
statement is first taken by the police. If the case proceeds to court,
witnesses will have a single point of contact to keep them up to date
on how the case is proceeding, if and when they are required to give
evidence and what the final outcome is.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060876000029">Post-Retirement

Fixed Penalty Notice, or prosecution. Licensees selling to uder-18s
additionally risk having their licence reviewed and conditions applied,
or even having their license
revoked.</p><p><a name="06060876001133">The Violent
Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament establishes a new
offence of persistently selling alcohol to under-18s. If three sales
are made in3 consecutive months, the new offence will be
committed, and the licensee risks a fine of &#163;10,000 and having
their licence suspended for 3 months. The police can offer the licensee
the option of avoiding prosecution by closing their premises for 48
hours.</p><p><a name="06060876001134">In addition to
enforcement activity, Ministers and officials from the Home Office and
the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are working very closely
with the licensed industry, and have secured commitments from both the
off-licensed sector and the on-licensed sector to seek to eliminate
sales of alcohol to children. Progress against these commitments will
be monitored closely through test-purchase failure
rates.</p><p><a name="06060876001135">The Government
are aware of the problems faced by young people when wishing to prove
their age or purchase age restricted products, also by retailers when
requesting proof of identity. Consequently, the Government are working
with the British Retail Consortium&#146;s Proof of Age Standards
Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes
available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under
PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic
logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people
and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should
be accepted. The logo is trademark registered, making it an offence to
forge. In the longer term, the identity card can be used as proof of
age as well as proof of identity, however, this is a few years away
