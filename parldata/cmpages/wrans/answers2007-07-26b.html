<i> [holding answer 25 July 2007]:</i> The Fleet relies on a layered defence approach to defeat an aerial attack. The backbone of the Fleet's ability to defend itself from air attack in the outer layer of maritime air defence will continue to be provided by destroyers. At present, this is achieved using the Type 42 Destroyers equipped with the medium range Sea Dart surface to air missile system. Type 45 Destroyers will gradually replace the Type 42 destroyers. These new ships will be armed with the Principal Anti Air Missile System, enhancing the Fleet's capability to counter the most sophisticated aircraft and anti-ship missiles in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70726w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07072670000042">In the inner layer of Maritime Air Defence the Fleet's close range air defence capability will continue to be provided by Type 22 and Type 23 Frigates equipped with the Seawolf point defence missile system. Additional air defence capability will also come from a combination of close-in weapon (gun) systems, such as Goalkeeper and Phalanx, and decoys.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence has current research programmes relevant to enhanced blast munitions valued at approximately &#163;10 million, spread over more than five years. These are to investigate the underlying science and are aimed at the assessment of the threat to UK armed forces, what protection is appropriate, and the advantage of incorporation of such technology into weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70726w0001.htm_para2"><a name="07072670000046">The MOD has one programme which incorporates enhanced blast technology, the Anti Structures Munition (ASM), as announced by my predecessor on 6 February 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 34WS, due to enter service at the end of 2009. It will enable infantry to defeat hardened structures such as buildings or bunkers, reducing casualties to our forces while minimising collateral damage. In the interim an 'off the shelf system has been procured until the ASM becomes available. There are currently no plans for future procurement of enhanced blast munitions.</p>

 The cluster munitions of humanitarian concern are those fired in the indirect role, whereas certain sub-munition variants are direct fire weapon systems. In the direct fire role the firing crew has line of sight from the platform to the target and has a sophisticated target identification and acquisition system to aid discrimination. In seeking the balance between humanitarian concern and military necessity the UK&#146;s definition of cluster munitions therefore excludes direct fire systems.</p>

The Government&#146;s view is that there are no substantive issues to be addressed by a public inquiry and that, in particular, it would not help to resolve the long outstanding issue of why veterans are ill; only scientific research might do this.

These programmes include swapping ship&#146;s companies of HMS Edinburgh and HMS Exeter (Type 42 destroyers), and several Mine Counter Measure Vessels; and providing temporary relief for some personnel on the extended deployment of HMS Sutherland and HMS Monmouth (Type 23 frigates).

regularly reviewed as circumstances change. North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust has recently provided information to the Department on projected numbers for paramedics. I understands that the trust intend to have 1,347 whole time equivalents in employment as paramedics in 2007-08, 1,361 in 2008-09 and 1,375 in 2009-10.</p>

This included the introduction of a code for emergency care practitioners and the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust recorded 39 ECPs in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70726w0009.htm_para7"><a name="07072712001156">More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.</p>

This means that the requirement for the provision of social housing will need to be negotiated and agreed with the local planning authority. The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply for housing. A register of surplus public sector land held by central government bodies has been established. English Partnerships review the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As at June 2007, there were over 700 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interest are received after a site has been marketed.</p>

 There has been extensive consultation leading up to the publication of the White Paper in February. The White Paper anticipated the need for new legislation on a number of issues. Some may require primary legislation but other changes can be made under section 60 of the Health Act 1999. The procedures for the latter require that a draft order is published and consulted upon at least three months before the amended order is laid before Parliament. Other matters requiring legislation will be considered by the stakeholder working groups which will be advising on implementation of the White Paper.

 The 2010 inequalities targets for life expectancy, cardiovascular disease and cancer are based on narrowing the gap in mortality between the population as a whole and the fifth of local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators (the Spearhead Group), and the primary care trusts that map to them, by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70726w0018.htm_para9"><a name="07072712003432">Life expectancy has increased for both males and females for England as a whole but it has improved more slowly in the Spearhead areas. In England, average life expectancy for males is 76.9 and for females 81.1, in the Spearhead group it is 74.9 for males and 79.6 for females. The slower rate of improvement in has led to a widening of the relative gap in life expectancy between England and the spearhead group. The latest data for 2003-05, show that the average life expectancy in the Spearhead Group was 2.61 per cent. lower than the England average for males, and 1.91 per cent. lower than the England average for females. Therefore, the relative gap has widened by 2 per cent. for men and 8 per cent. for women since the baseline (1995-97).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70726w0018.htm_para10"><a name="07072712003433">However, although the 2010 target for life expectancy is a challenging one, data for 2003-05 also show that some 60 per cent. of the 70 Spearhead areas are on track to narrow their own life expectancy gap with that of England by 10 per cent. by 2010, compared to baseline for either males or females or both. The information is set out in the following table, with comparison data for 2002-04.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70726w0018.htm_para11"><a name="07072712003434">Data for 2003-05 have also shown continued improvements in CVD and cancer mortality inequalities between Spearhead areas and the national average since the 1995-97 baseline.

1. ICD-10 Code: I50.0 Congestive Heart Failure<br>
2. Bed Days During the Year<br>
Bed days within the year include only those days falling between 1 April and 31 March of the data year including unfinished episodes, unless otherwise stated.<br>
3. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
4. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
6.Ungrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

2. Data are for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes V01 to X59, which cover external causes of accidental injury. Data represent a count of all episodes where this diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
3. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
4. When analysing time series of HES data, the impact of improvements over time in data quality and coverage, and of changes in NHS practice need to be borne in mind. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 5. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Mental health nurses are those qualified nurses who work within the community psychiatry, other psychiatry, community learning disabilities and other learning disabilities areas.<br>
2. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>

 Aluminium salts are an essential ingredient of some vaccines in enhancing the protection offered by the vaccine. The safety record of aluminium in vaccines has been demonstrated over more than 50 years of use. There are no serious health risks associated with the small quantities of aluminium in some vaccines. As with many vaccine ingredients, aluminium can cause localised reactions such as redness, swelling and/or tenderness at the injection site.</p>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
2. Main Specialty<br>
The main specialty refers to the specialty under which the consultant is contracted.<br>
3. Specialty<br>
Care is needed when analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>
4. Low Numbers<br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146;(an asterisk).<br>
5. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. Ungrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

 Sponsorship for the first academies was provided in the form of a financial contribution towards the capital cost of buildings. However, we have changed the sponsorship model and sponsors will now, in most cases, establish an endowment fund.

Trusts submit the invoices to the Department to confirm that sponsorship has been paid and used in accordance with funding agreements. In many instances, the invoices sent to the Department to confirm the capital contribution by the sponsor, also shown in the following table, do not keep pace with the actual payments made by the sponsor to the trust. If confirmation of the sponsor's capital contribution falls significantly behind the expected payment profile, officials approach academy trusts direct seeking explanations for apparent shortfalls, with a view to regularising the position.</p>

All Cafcass practitioners are qualified to work on both public and private law cases and, because of variations in demand in any local area at any given point in time, this is essential to ensure capacity to cover all types of cases. Local demand can vary by up to 20% in any type of case in a year. We are developing new services such as duty schemes, and extending our dispute resolution (DR) schemes, evidenced by the increase in DR hours during 2006/07: a rise in 33.6%. Currently Cafcass has 1340 employed practitioners who may complete either around 55 private law cases a year, or around 12 public law cases or work on dispute resolution or extended dispute resolution which we measure in hours worked. In addition Cafcass has access to self-employed contractors and staff registered on a bank scheme. These are used as budget permits to cover peaks in referrals.</p>

Based on a sample of Feb/March 2007 data, only 20.7 % of section 8 referred for dispute resolution were not resolved at least in part and referred for a section 7 report.</p>

 Knife incidents in schools in England are extremely rare. To help maintain that, we gave head teachers a power, from May 2007, to search a pupil without consent when, after screening with metal detectors or on other grounds, they suspect the presence of a weapon. This supports the efforts of the police to reduce crime by and against young people on the streets around schools and supplements initiatives by the Department for Children, Schools and Families on, for example, improving behaviour and learning about responsibility, conflict resolution and safety. We do not burden schools by asking them to report whether they do or will screen. We intend to continue taking the views of our Working Group on School Security on all aspects of screening and searching, in particular in order to review the statutory power to search after three years.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. The revenue funding per pupil figures only run to 2005-06 because the Department cannot provide a consistent time series beyond that year as the introduction of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br>
2. In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means we have a break in our time series as the two sets of data are not comparable, an alternative time series is currently under development.<br>
3. To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, we have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described this does not represent the totality of &#145;education&#146; funding in that year.<br>

This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DFES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.  <sup>(3)</sup> The school based expenditure calculation for 2005-06 is broadly similar to the calculation in 1997-98. However, 1997-98 includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses whereas only the schools element of these categories is included in 2005-06. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 onwards and hence would be excluded from the 2005-06 school based expenditure figures, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.  <sup>(4)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for the 1999-2000 financial year. Comparable figures for school based expenditure in local authority maintained nursery schools are not available from 2002-03 onwards and consequently direct comparisons should not be made between the pre-primary and primary figures and total (including pre-primary) figures for 1997-98 and 2005-06.  <sup>(5)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is not available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under fives funded by the authority and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.  <sup>(6)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme.

(This amounts to &#163;2,730 million and excludes the additional grants to local authorities which do not currently have the deprivation element separately identified). It is not possible at present to say how much is passed on by local authorities to schools on the basis of deprivation. However, over the summer and early autumn of 2007 the Government Offices Children&#146;s Services Advisors are to discuss with their local authorities how much funding each authority is passing on to schools on the basis of deprivation and how this can be improved where necessary. As part of the process, Department officials will be collecting baseline information regarding the distribution in 2007-08 in order that change can be tracked in future years.

 Numbers of persons, by age group, convicted of possession of an offensive weapon and of having a bladed article on school premises for 1999 to 2005 (the years for which figures are available) are on the following table. One pupil was killed with a weapon on school premises in the past 10 years (in a community secondary school, with a knife), and no members of staff. Neither this Department nor the Home Office collects any other relevant data. In the main, schools are very safe places: most pupils never carry a knife in school. Schools can screen for weapons if they wish, and have a statutory power to search pupils they suspect of carrying one. Safer School Partnerships, programmes to improve behaviour, curriculum opportunities for learning about responsibility, conflict, and safety, and other DCSF programmes for young people and parenting can also help.</p>

 14-19 remains a key priority for the Department for Children, Schools and Families. We want to ensure that all young people are prepared by their education and training for success in life. Immediately this means that we must raise participation at 17, cut the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment or training (NEET) and raise attainment at 19. We have stretching targets in all these areas and will be introducing legislation to make participation in education or training compulsory up to the age of 18. In parallel, we are reforming curriculum and qualifications to make them more engaging and more relevant to the needs of the economy; and building a system of schools, colleges and other providers working collaboratively to deliver the reformed curriculum effectively.</p>

 Standards in secondary schools have risen dramatically since 1997. Record numbers of 16-year-olds are now achieving five good GCSEs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="70726w0042.htm_para8"><a name="0707302003504">Over 86,000 more pupils achieved five good GCSEs last year compared with 1997 and 62,000 more achieved five good GCSEs including English and maths compared with 1997. In total over 375,000 more young people have gained five or more good GCSEs over the period 1997 to 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="70726w0042.htm_para9"><a name="0707302003505">This is as a result of a number of factors, as set out in my reply to PQ119851 on 19 February 2007. I would like to draw particular attention to challenge and support through the secondary National Strategy; of swift and targeted intervention to tackle school failure; more effective use of data by schools and local authorities, helping to track and monitor the progress of pupils; and a system within which schools and local authorities are setting ambitious targets for their pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="70726w0042.htm_para10"><a name="0707302003506">The new secondary curriculum, to be introduced from 2008, will raise standards further still. Less prescription will allow for more time in the school day to concentrate on English and maths, particularly where pupils are struggling with literacy and numeracy. It will also allow schools to personalise learning in order to make teaching more engaging.</p>

Until then, the LSC will retain the legal responsibility for securing and funding all forms of post-16 education and training outside higher education, including sixth-form colleges. It will continue to work with the FE sector as a whole to raise standards and to ensure that it plays a full and effective part in driving forward our 14-19 reform agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para0"><a name="0707302003523">For comparison, in January 2006 there were 56,800 full time equivalent teachers in the leadership group in maintained schools in England. (Source: 618G Annual Survey of Teachers in Service and Teacher Vacancies).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para1"><a name="0707302003524">The leadership group encompasses head teachers, deputy heads and assistant heads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para2"><a name="0707302003525">Research commissioned by the Department and published in 2003 looked into the factors influencing teachers&#146; decisions to leave the profession. It identified five main reasons: Workload (eg workload too heavy), New Challenge (eg attracted by another job), School (eg way school is run), Salary (eg offered higher salary elsewhere) and Personal Circumstances (eg opportunity to travel). Of these, workload was the most important factor and salary the least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para3"><a name="0707302003526">The research found that head teachers were less likely, and deputy heads more likely, than classroom teachers to cite workload as being of great importance in their decision to leave the profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para4"><a name="0707302003527">Considering all teachers, the research found that most of those taking early retirement were doing so because they felt they had worked long enough or because they could afford to. Some wanted time to themselves, others to be with a partner who had retired. Some were prepared to leave without an immediate pension and were contemplating other employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para5"><a name="0707302003528">The research report is available on the Department&#146;s website at</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para6"><a name="0707302003529">From 1 January 2007, new provisions have been introduced into the Teachers&#146; Pension Scheme that will provide teachers with greater choice and flexibility over the way they manage the transition from work to retirement. The new provisions will allow teachers to wind down in the years leading up to retirement, for example by moving to part time working or taking a post with less responsibility, while protecting their pension rights. New phased retirement provisions have also been introduced that will enable teachers to remain in the workplace in a reduced capacity while at the same time drawing some of their pension benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="70726w0043.htm_para7"><a name="0707302003530">The Department has commissioned research into the impact these changes to the pension scheme may have on the retirement behaviour of teachers. The fieldwork for this study has already taken place and the project is due to report early in 2008. The research will help inform the key work that the National College of School Leadership is taking forward on succession planning to ensure that we have the right quantity and quality of school leaders both now and in the future.</p>

 It is hoped to announce the planned draft Bills for next session at the beginning of the session in the normal way. Plans for draft Bills are more tentative than those for Bills expected to be introduced into the main programme and it is too soon to give an indication of a likely number of such Bills at this stage. Some indication of Bills being considered for publication in draft is given in Chapter 3 of the White Paper on the Government's Draft Legislative Programme (Cm 7175, P19).</p>

 The responsibility for carrying out such an assessment lies with the Mayor of London. This work was undertaken and published in July 2005, in the London Housing Capacity Study. This study provides a comprehensive technical analysis of London&#146;s potential for future housing growth. It was used to inform the Early Alterations to the London Plan (published December 2006) which provided a minimum target for housing provision in London from 2007-08 to 2016-17, of 30,500 additional homes per year. The study can be found at:</p>

From the Mayor&#146;s study, the distribution of identified housing capacity in London for the period 2007-08 to 2016-17 is shown in the following table. About half of identified capacity for housing in London over the next 10 years is located in seven boroughs: Newham, Tower Hamlets, Greenwich, Barnet, Redbridge, Southwark and Brent.</p>

Individually identified sites over 0.5 hectares.<br>
<i> Small site allowance:</i><br>
An allowance from sites less than 0.5 hectares, based on past performance but adjusted for future identified housing opportunities and intensification.<br>

Residential units that do not fall within the planning use class of dwelling houses.<br>
<i> Vacants:</i><br>
Long-term vacant dwellings returning to use<br>

 Two separate schemes of emergency financial assistance have been set up to assist local authorities affected by flooding in June and July.

Each authority claiming grant must have spent 0.2 per cent. of its revenue budget on eligible activities in the financial year to date. Above that threshold, 100 per cent. of eligible costs will be reimbursed, an increase from the normal 85 per cent. Authorities will also be able to claim grant on eligible expenditure up to six months from the beginning of the emergency. This is an increase from two months under normal Bellwin schemes.</p>

 In &#147;Delivering Housing and Regeneration&#151;Communities England and the Future of Social Housing Regulation&#148;, launched on 19 June 2007, the Government proposed accepting Professor Cave&#146;s proposals for regulatory reform and began a consultation to determine stakeholders&#146; views.

The Government have proposed immediately accepting the new system for housing associations, but is exploring in more detail how local authority and ALMO performance could be regulated.</p>

</ul><a name="70726w0053.htm_brev6"><a name="0707302007029"><ul><p class="tabletext">The table below shows the average direct and indirect tax paid by households in each income decile group as a percentage of gross household income. They have been calculated from the numbers appearing in Table 14 of the taxes and benefits analysis.</p>
</ul><a name="70726w0053.htm_brev7"><a name="0707302007030"><ul><p class="tabletext">Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits, all before tax. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes - these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
</ul><a name="70726w0053.htm_brev8"><a name="0707302007031"><ul><p class="tabletext">Indirect taxes, when expressed as a proportion of gross income appears particularly high for the bottom income decile, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. Estimates of indirect taxes are estimated based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for the bottom income decile where average measured income is significantly lower than average expenditure. For these households, indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are not being met solely from current income, and so indirect taxes are very high when expressed as a proportion of gross income.</p>
</ul><a name="70726w0053.htm_brev9"><a name="0707302007032"><ul><p class="tabletext">There are a number of plausible reasons why for some households, expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EPS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>

UNMIS Human Rights also reported that the UN's Special Rapporteur for Human Rights, Sima Samarm, will visit Sudan soon to take this forward. UNMIS have asked her to raise the Kajbar Dam incident with her Sudanese government interlocutors.</p>

 We have carefully considered both the responses to our &#145;naming and shaming&#146; policy and the initial impact that this policy has had since the first set of names were posted on the Child Support Agency website last month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="70726w0060.htm_para2"><a name="0707302006174">We have also listened carefully to the concerns raised by stakeholders and others around the potential impact of the current policy. The interests of children are paramount in everything we do.</p>

However it quickly returned to previous levels&#151;suggesting low levels of patronage of this part of the website and therefore questioning its potential effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_556"><a name="70726w0060.htm_para4"><a name="0707302006176">In light of this we will not publish further names at this time whilst we would keep under consideration whether this policy has a role to play in the future. In the mean time the CSA will be focusing its expanded debt and enforcement team on a wider range of initiatives that are intended to help improve compliance. These methods include making more use of credit reference agencies and HMRC data and introducing more flexible payment methods. In the future the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission will be building on this, introducing further enforcement measures to maximise compliance.</p>

 DFID&#146;s has not given any direct funding to flood relief as we work through multilateral mechanisms, ensuring more effective co-ordination and response. In 2007, we have contributed &#163;40 million to the UN&#146;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and &#163;40 million to the Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), a pioneering multi-donor fund that allows the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator to direct resources to the most pressing needs. Both mechanisms have funding available and are awaiting appeals to be submitted to them by relief agencies involved in the flood response. DFID is working with the UN to ensure that these appeals will be promptly considered and, where approved, quickly processed. A multi-agency emergency response, including the Sudanese Government and co-ordinated by the UN, has created a shared mechanism to deliver food and other types of assistance to those most in need.</p>

This will enable farmers to get on to the land and do what they can to rescue their crops.

We have great sympathy for those who are uninsured but there is no general right to compensation, since that would undermine the decision of those who did take out insurance and in the longer term undermine the competitive insurance market in this area that the UK currently benefits from. The Government are keen to help farmers manage risk more thoroughly themselves as part of establishing a more market focused farm industry.</p>

The FC and DEFRA are collaborating on the application of this method for grey squirrel control with partnership funding from DEFRA, FC and Scottish Natural Heritage. However, it is likely that immuno-contraception will not, at least in the short to medium term, be a viable option for grey squirrels. Even if a suitable vaccine is found, there will still be a challenge to establish how to deliver it to grey squirrels without affecting other wildlife, especially the red squirrel.</p>

 Recycling and composting of household waste has doubled in the past four years and more than tripled in the past eight years. Government support for, and engagement with, the poorest performing local authorities, challenging national and local targets and the escalating landfill tax are all helping authorities drive forward even higher recycling rates.</p>

 Sport England is working closely with those areas badly affected and has made an initial assessment of the recent flooding affecting public and community sporting facilities in the regions of Yorkshire, East Midlands and West Midlands. Initial assessments show that there is not a wide-scale problem affecting sporting facilities in Yorkshire but that some individual facilities in the worst affected areas are badly damaged. It is still too early to assess the extent of damage from flooding in the Midlands but Sport England&#146;s regional offices are monitoring the situation and will be able to make a fuller assessment when it becomes possible to do so.</p>

 The cost of introducing smartcards will depend on local circumstance and will vary from authority to authority. The Department commissioned independent Consultants, Deloitte, to produce an estimate of the indicative costs of all stages of introducing a national concessionary bus pass for older and disabled people in England. Their report was received in January 2007, and estimated that the cost, per smart card, would be between &#163;2.64 and &#163;3.59.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment she has made of <i> (a) </i>the effects on human health of increased levels of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic and <i> (b)</i> the level of HGV movements per day on a public highway at which there would be an increased risk to people living (i) a quarter of a mile, (ii) half a mile, (iii) three-quarters of a mile and (iv) one mile from a public highway.

 The Department for Transport does not have health expertise but relies on the advice of the Department for Health&#146;s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP). COMEAP estimated that in 1996<sup>(1)</sup> airborne particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (the two main road traffic pollutants) resulted in 19,200 hospital admissions. More recently concentrations of particulate matter in 2005 were estimated to reduce average life expectancy by eight months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_731"><a name="70726w0075.htm_para10"><a name="07073029001617">It is not possible to separate the health impacts of specific vehicle types from other sources. However, in 2001 road traffic accounted for 55-60 per cent. of particulate matter and 85-90 per cent. of nitrogen dioxide at roadside, and 20-25 per cent. of particulate matter and 65-70 per cent. of nitrogen dioxide at background locations, in London (the worst case location). In this same year heavy goods vehicles were responsible for 13 per cent. and 17 per cent. of urban road traffic emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_732"><a name="70726w0075.htm_para11"><a name="07073029001618">The Department is committed to reducing road transport emissions. The most effective mechanism for this is via new vehicle emissions standards, often known as &#145;Euro&#146; standards. These have already brought about substantial reductions in emissions, however further reductions are required if we are to meet our air quality objectives. I am pleased to report that new standards (&#145;Euro 5&#146; and &#145;Euro 6&#146;) which will give major reductions in light duty vehicle emissions were adopted by the European Council in May 2007. We are also expecting a proposal from the European Commission late this year to further tighten heavy goods vehicle emissions requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_733"><a name="70726w0075.htm_para12"><a name="07073029001619">For particulate matter, there is no known threshold below which there are no effects on health, this makes it impossible to identify a number of vehicle movements below which there are no health impacts. However, maps showing ambient concentrations of pollutants<sup>(2)</sup> on a one kilometre square basis relative to Air Quality targets are available from national emissions modelling. In addition the Highways Agency routinely assesses the impacts of trunk road projects on emissions and exceedences of air quality objectives.</p>

 A new campaign to re-invigorate the UK Register was launched in February 2006 when the then Minister for Shipping (the hon. Member for South Thanet) held a reception for shipowners/operators at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich with the theme of &#147;Safety through partnership&#148;. In addition, a review of the MCA&#146;s Marketing Strategy was undertaken during the second half of 2006 and the recommendations from this are now being implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_743"><a name="70726w0081.htm_para4"><a name="07073029003899">A measure of the success of this campaign is that at the end of March 2007 the number of merchant vessels on the UK Ship Register was 1,459, of which the gross tonnage was in excess of 13 million for the first time in 10 years. (If we include all sea-going vessels over 100 gross tonnes, as in the Department for Transport&#146;s published statistics, the number of vessels is over 1,900 and the gross tonnage over 14 million).</p>

The support available under SMarT at present amounts to roughly half of the cost of training provided by maritime colleges.</p>
