<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House what visits <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> Ministers in his Office (i) have made and (ii) plan to make using public funds in connection with the Big Conversation; how many civil servants accompanied each Minister in respect of such visits; what the cost to public funds was of visits by (A) each Minister and (B) civil servants in connection with the Big Conversation; and if he will make a statement.  [143101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Labour Party is consulting its members and the wider community on the Government's progress and challenges ahead. The Big Conversation is a party document and has been issued by the Labour Party.
<P>

<a name="31209w01.html_para0">Ministers and special advisers have of course participated in this process according to the rules laid out in the Ministerial Code and the Special Advisers Code. No events have been held using public funds, and no civil servants have attended them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House whether it is the policy of his office to use fair trade products, as a matter of course, in <i>(a)</i> sales on Departmental premises and <i>(b)</i> receptions and meetings involving staff and visitors.  [142808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 My office does not have a refreshment facility in which it could stock and sell fair trade products.
<P>

<a name="31209w01.html_para1">While there is currently no Government-wide approach to the procurement of fair trade products, we will endeavour to use them for official entertaining, subject to this being value for money.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the result was of the investigation held into the death of Private David Shipley by the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch; on what date a board of inquiry was convened; and what its principal recommendations were.  [142114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Board of Inquiry convened on 15 September 2003 and is on-going. Her Majesty's Coroner has yet to convene his inquiry. It would therefore be inappropriate to release details of the police findings at this stage.

<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the tanker programme.  [142720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We are currently considering proposals from two consortia that are bidding for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft programme. We plan to make a decision on this complex and important PFI competition as soon as possible in the new year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the protocol is for debriefing soldiers who have served an operational tour in Northern Ireland.  [142739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are no formal protocols for debriefing soldiers after they have served an operational tour in Northern Ireland. However, as with any operational deployment, on their return, units are required to produce a Post Operational Tour Report.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the incidents in the Troubles since 1973 involving members of the British Army which resulted in deaths and injuries to members of the armed forces; and which regiment was affected in each case.  [142746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Since 1973 a total number of 474 members of the Army died as a result of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland. The number of Army personnel injured from 1973 is 4,645. This figure relates primarily to injuries which were incurred while on duty, however, the manner in which data has been historically complied means some injuries off duty may have been included.
<P>

<a name="31209w01.html_para2">It is not feasible to list each death, injury and which Regiment was involved since 1973 as the data is not held on one particular format and that information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many of his Department's private finance initiative projects were completed <i>(a)</i> on time and <i>(b)</i> on budget; and of those that overran in terms of (i) time and (ii) budget, who bore the cost.  [141663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Each schools PFI project involves a separate contract between the relevant local authority and a private sector contractor, and, for a variety of reasons, timetables of work may change from that which was envisaged when the contract was signed. It is not possible therefore, for DfES to hold a record of the circumstances of each completion. However, where there have been difficulties, these have generally been brought to our attention by the LEA concerned. These cases have been a small proportion of the total number of completions.
<P>

<a name="31209w02.html_para0">The responsibility for any overrun in terms of time and budget in any PFI project rests with the PFI contractor. Overruns in traditionally funded building projects are fairly commonplace but happen less frequently in PFI projects as the financial consequences of any overrun rest with the private sector.

<P>
<a name="31209w04.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have kept the safety of HRT under constant review and provided targeted advice to women and health professionals in response to important new evidence as it has emerged.
<P>

<a name="31209w04.html_para12">In August 2003, the United Kingdom "Million Women" study provided important new information about the risks of breast cancer in long term HRT users. 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 2003 : Column 370W</I><P>
On the day of publication, the CSM informed women of the increase in risk that was observed in association with each different type of HRT preparation. The CSM further advised that these risks increase the longer that HRT is used, but return to normal within five years of stopping HRT. All women using HRT have been encouraged to attend regular breast screening and regularly check their breasts for any changes. Women have also been advised not to use HRT if they have breast cancer or if they have had it in the past.
<P>

<a name="31209w04.html_para13">In addition, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has placed a comprehensive review of the risks, including breast cancer, associated with HRT use for women on its website. Detailed information has also been published in the safety bulletins issued by the MHRA and the Chief Medical Officer, which are also available on their respective websites.
<P>

<a name="31209w04.html_para14">The patient information leaflet that accompanies each pack of medicine has contained information about the risk of breast cancer in association with HRT use for some years. This information has been regularly updated to fully reflect all important new evidence as it has become available.
<P>

<a name="31209w04.html_para15">Very recently, a Europe-wide review of the overall risks and benefits of HRT has been completed. UK experts participated in this review and the CSM has endorsed its recommendations, published on 3 December 2003, that HRT should no longer be considered as the first choice treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis, for women over the age of 50 years. As with earlier advice, this information has been made available to health professionals and women through targeted communications and the MHRA website.

 The Department has no plans to carry out further research on angiosarcoma. The independent expert advisory Committee of Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and Environment that any potential risk of cancer from residency near to municipal solid waste incinerators was exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological methods. Therefore, no further research is planned on cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators.

This study is nearing completion and the Department has asked COMARE to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations in Great Britain have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity which are statistically outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE hopes to report on this aspect of the study to the Department early next year. When complete, the database will also allow investigation of other environmental factors and their potential relevance to the temporal and spatial distribution of childhood cancer.

 Defra has set up the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) to help local authorities meet their targets for reducing the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste under the Landfill Directive. One of WIP's programmes being taken forward by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is to promote kerbside recycling and composting best practice in local authorities.
<P>

<a name="31209w06.html_para3">This sub-programme has two components:

2. An Organics Materials Programme which provides material-specific support and investment to the growing composting sector. It aims to develop markets in compost, with headline targets of increasing the market share of compost in the landscaping and horticultural markets by 35 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively, by end 2006. This is supported by &#163;12.2 million over the next three years.
<P>

 The Port of Tyne Authority (PoT) applied for a licence in February 2003 to dispose of 315,123 cubic metres of sediment dredged from wharves within the port to the Souter Point disposal ground. Some sediments are contaminated with Tributyl-tin and heavy metals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) on what basis the herbicide regime for use on GM maize was chosen for the farm-scale trials; what role Aventis (now Bayer) had in its choice; what international research was conducted to establish whether this was a commercially realistic regime to control weeds; and what research she has conducted on whether farmers in other countries use more aggressive herbicide mixes;  [142304]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> The herbicide regime used by farmers growing GM maize in the farm-scale trials was proposed by the product manufacturer, AgrEvo (now Bayer Crop Science). The way farmers could then use the product was further specified under the terms of the draft product label in line with the experimental approval. The draft product label gave farmers the freedom to apply more than one application of the herbicide if they required, providing it was within the specified crop growth stage limits.
<P>

<a name="31209w07.html_para8">The experimental approval assumed use of the herbicide under UK conditions. No research was conducted on the method of use of this or any other herbicides in other countries as this was not considered necessary.
<P>

<a name="31209w07.html_para9">The Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the farm-scale evaluations (FSEs) were content from the outset that the proposals for the use of the pesticide provided by the manufacturers and specified in the draft product label were capable of delivering cost-effective weed control under UK conditions. A full audit of herbicide use was conducted as part of the FSEs and published as part of the results (Champion et al. 2003). This paper also gives details of the number of GM maize fields that received more than one application of herbicide. In the published results it was concluded that cost-effective weed control had been achieved. This conclusion was endorsed by the steering committee and was further validated by the publishing journal through their peer-review process.

<i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> The European Commission approved the Hazardous Waste Directive in December 1991. Its requirements are currently transposed in England by the Special Waste Regulations 1996, but these are to be replaced by new regulations for hazardous waste in 2004. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was established in June 2001 and all staff that had worked on hazardous waste policy issues in the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions transferred to Defra to continue this work. The Hazardous Waste Branch of Waste Management Division takes the lad on these issues as well as policy work on the transfrontier shipment of waste and consists of eight staff.

 No specific resources are committed directly to support the work of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) other than an annual subscription of approximately &#163;130,000. However, an indirect resource commitment to ICES arises from the participation of scientists from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), a Defra agency, in ICES science and advisory working groups, and in the governance of ICES itself. These working groups cover areas of marine and freshwater fisheries, aquaculture, the environment and the ecosystem. The Current chairs of the Resource Management Science Committee and the Advisory Committee on the Ecosystem are currently also CEFAS scientists.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what estimate he has made of the number of <i>(a)</i> violent crimes, <i>(b)</i> gun-related crimes and <i>(c)</i> burglaries which were drug-related in Merseyside in each year since 1992;  [141288]

<P>
<a name="31209w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Statistical data on numbers of offences recorded in different areas do not indicate which may have been committed due to drug taking. However, results from the NEW-ADAM research programme of interviewing and drug testing arrestees between 1999 and 2000 sheds some light on the links between drugs and crime in 16 sites throughout England and Wales. Summary data published in 2001 found that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> 56 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for an illegal drug with up to 29 per cent. testing positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> of those arrestees who reported using illegal drugs in the year prior to arrest, 40 per cent. acknowledged a link between their drug use and offending. Past year users of heroin and/or cocaine/crack were nearly twice as likely (78 per cent.) to acknowledge a link.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> Those not reporting any drug use in the last year reported an average of 46 acquisitive crimes (including theft, burglary, shoplifting, fraud, handling stolen goods, drugs supply and prostitution offences) over the same period. Drug use in general and especially use of heroin and/or cocaine/crack (hcc), was associated with much higher levels of offending. Among hcc users, respondents reported an average of 432 acquisitive crimes. This was nearly ten times higher than for non-drug users.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="31209w13.html_para2">However, it should be noted that because an arrestee tested positive for drugs it does not necessarily mean that the consumption of drugs caused the crime to be committed. As a result, while the NEW-ADAM study advanced our knowledge of the links between drugs and crime, it will always be difficult to calculate precisely what proportion of crime is drug-related.
<P>

<a name="31209w13.html_para3">In September 2003, the Home Office Arrestee Survey commenced at 60 randomly selected custody suites in England and Wales. The survey is ongoing, and involves interviewing and drug testing a representative sample of around 9,000 arrestees per year about their offending and drug use. The survey will enable research into the links between drugs and offending and will also provide robust data at a national level to allow tracking of the Home Office Public Service Agreement target to reduce drug related crime.
<P>

<a name="31209w13.html_para4">Numbers of crimes recorded by the police in St. Helens are collected and published at Basic Command Unit (BCU) level. At this level, data is available from 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;2003, and the number of crimes recorded are published for six key offence groups, as given in the table.

 We are encouraging more people to report crimes in all areas by improving the way in which crimes reported to the police are recorded. The National Crime Recording Standard, formally introduced in all forces in England and Wales in April 2002, aims to bring greater consistency to the way in which crime is recorded by the police and to ensure a more victim centred approach to crime recording.
<P>

<a name="31209w14.html_para2">There have also been crime specific initiatives aimed at increasing the numbers of such crimes reported to the police, particularly, domestic violence and sexual offences. For example, the British Crime Survey shows that there was a 5 per cent. Increase in the proportion of violent crimes being reported to the police in 2002&#150;03 compared with the previous year.

<a name="31209w14.html_para3">With a total sample size of 40,000 interviews a year, more emphasis is now being placed on the British Crime Survey as a way of measuring crime, as it covers unreported and unrecorded crime as well as offences which are reported to the police. As the survey is unaffected by changes in the level of public reporting to the police or police recording, it provides a more accurate picture of crime across England and Wales.

<a name="31209w15.html_para1">The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) was introduced across England and Wales in April 2002. Some forces adopted the principles of the Standard prior to this date. Of the eight metropolitan forces, both Greater Manchester (January 2002) and West Midlands (April 1999) adopted the Standard early. Broadly, the NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of crimes recorded by the police. Therefore, following the introduction of the Standard, numbers of recorded crimes are not comparable with previous years.

 The Home Office New Car Security Guidance published in 1998 encouraged car manufacturers to fit glazing that would resist attack by methods commonly used by criminals for a minimum of 30 seconds. This standard applies whether conventional laminated glazing or security film is fitted. Officials are considering the merits of using the recently issued German test standard to measure whether products meet this Home Office requirement. In addition, any glazing (laminated or when fitted with security film) has to meet the appropriate standards set out in the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, Directive 92/22/EEC and UN/ECE Regulation 43 to ensure safety and durability. We will encourage the fitting of any laminated glazing or security film that meets statutory requirements and makes a significant contribution to vehicle crime reduction.
<P>

<a name="31209w15.html_para2">We aim to raise motorists' awareness of the benefits of laminated glazing through Home Office publicity material, particularly the booklet "Steer Clear of Car Crime" and our website www.secureyourmotor.gov.uk. We also provide links from our Department for Transport websites to the insurance industry website (www.ncsr.co.uk) which provides motorists with information about their assessment of each car's ability to resist criminal attempts to gain entry.

This year the Government plan to fund the provision of 213 new units in Northern Ireland, specifically for homeless families and single people, at a total cost of around &#163;13.5 million. It is also overseeing the implementation of new arrangements for providing housing support services which include provision to help sustain and improve the existing support services provided to homeless people. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has published the Northern Ireland Homeless Strategy and is working in partnership with all of those who have a part to play in tackling the problem of homelessness. In addition, an inter-departmental, cross sectoral Promoting Social Inclusion Review Group has been set up to consider how to ensure, firstly, that the risk of homelessness is reduced and secondly, that the full range of appropriate services is available to homeless people.

 The new subsidy system will be introduced on 1 April 2004 to all local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland. All claims relating to the 2004&#150;05 subsidy year will be made under the new rates and rules. We issued a subsidy Circular (S9/2003) to authorities on 1 December to explain all the detailed changes; a copy of this circular is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31209w17.html_para0">Although the overall levels of funding under the new system will be cost neutral compared to the old system, we recognise that individual authorities may gain or lose under the new arrangements. A transitional protection scheme has therefore been put in place. At the end of 2004&#150;05 subsidy claims from each local authority will be compared with the amounts of subsidy they would have received had they claimed under the subsidy rules in place in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Although scattered elements of Al Qa'ida and the Taliban remain in Afghanistan and continue to mount attacks against international and Afghan targets, the perpetrators cannot be said to control the areas in which they operate. Many attacks are carried out by insurgents who cross between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Others are mounted on a hit-and-run basis by groups within Afghanistan. Extremists are undoubtedly attempting to establish bases from which to operate. But successful military operations conducted by the Coalition and units of the Afghan National Army are preventing them from doing so. Apparent isolated instances of low-level control generally amount to no more than evidence of Taliban intimidation of local communities.

 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that 81,400 hectares of land were utilised for opium production in Burma in 2002. The UNODC figures for 2003 are not yet confirmed and initial indications suggest that they may show little overall change from 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 There are reports that some production and trafficking of opium from Burma is carried out with the knowledge of the Burmese authorities. The Burmese authorities' overall response to the continued production and export of heroin and methamphetamines has been limited. According to figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Burma is the world's second largest source of heroin and one of the largest sources of methamphetamines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We welcome and support the aims of the European Union's action plan to help tackle the issue of drugs in central Asia. The plan covers Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Ukbekistan and should also be seen in the context of significant UK and EU action in Afghanistan, which is the main source country for heroin trafficked through central Asia. The UK does not directly fund the action plan. However we provide bilateral assistance to countries in the region which supports the plan's overall aims and objectives.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary makes a point of raising our grave concerns about both countries' human rights record whenever he is able to. In 2003 he has done so with his Iranian counterpart on 6 February, 29 June and 24 September. He has not met the Syrian Foreign Minister this year. But we regularly raise human rights concerns with Syria, both bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners. I spoke of Syria's human rights failings in a Syria adjournment debate on 2 July and my hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the contracts which the Office of the Iraq Programme reported in November 2002 had been approved but for which no funds were available due to political disagreements between the governments of the US and UK and the then government of Iraq; what these contracts were for; and if he will make a statement.  [141117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Gaps in funding for approved contracts were due to insufficient revenues from Iraqi oil exports, exacerbated by the former regime's unilateral decision on several occasions to halt exports. These contracts covered a range of sectors. The UN regularly urged the Iraqi Government to prioritise its requirements and ensure that minimal funds required to fund priority sector contracts were available, but the former regime refused to do so. Instead, Saddam Hussein continued to abuse the Oil For Food Programme, ordering many non essential goods, such as equipment for a new Olympic sports stadium.

<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Coalition forces are not responsible for the distribution of medicines in Iraq, but assist where appropriate. The public health system was left an empty shell by the former regime, but since May the Iraqi Ministry of Health has estimated that 15,000 tons of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies have been delivered. New drug supply systems are not yet fully operational. Until the supply accounting and reporting systems are in place, some difficulties will continue to occur.
<P>

<a name="31209w18.html_para5">Work is under way in the Iraqi Ministry of Health to develop a national drug formulary. This will form the baseline for future purchases throughout the country and will improve the sourcing of drugs. The Iraqi Ministry of Health, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and the World Health Organisation are also furthering a complete review of missing drugs and supplies. This is scheduled to finish in three months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 From 1979 Saddam Hussein's regime was involved either directly, or indirectly in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, the large majority of whom were Muslims. These deaths occurred during conflicts with neighbouring countries and through internal repression. Since 1 May, a large quantity of documentation has been found in Iraq relating to killings and persecution by the former regime. We are working with Iraqi Ministries and other organisations to analyse this documentation. Until this work is complete, a final figure will not be known.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w18.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Since 1 May, some 270 mass graves have been reported to the Coalition Provisional Authority, with more sites still being discovered. Of these, about one third have been assessed so far, with one third of these confirmed as mass graves. The UK has seconded a forensic team to the CPA to co-ordinate and prioritise forensic work. From documentary and physical evidence found so far, it is estimated that around 300,000 people may be buried in mass graves in Iraq, although the true number will not be known until full investigations have been completed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The draft resolution before the UN Security Council on 16 September did not recognise both parties' obligations under the roadmap. It could have been detrimental, had it been adopted, to the implementation of the roadmap. As our Permanent Representative to the UN said at the time, we regret that the Security Council was unable to pass a balanced resolution. But the resolution's sponsors would not accommodate UK amendments intended to achieve a better balance, and the UK therefore abstained. A resolution on the situation of President Arafat was subsequently put to an Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly. European Union proposals for a more balanced text were then accepted and the UK, with our EU Partners, voted for the resolution.
<P>

<a name="31209w19.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has made clear the Government's view that expelling or harming President Arafat would be wrong and counterproductive.

<a name="31209w19.html_para8">The information needs to be interpreted with care, since it is dependent on a number of factors, including the Post Office's updating of postcode information on a quarterly basis. The table shows total sales since the lottery started, including year to date sales up to the end of September 2003. The data has been extracted from Camelot's sales database and will not directly reconcile to Camelot's financial reporting.
<P>

<a name="31209w19.html_para9">It is worth noting that the funds that the National Lottery generates for the good causes are shared between 15 distributing bodies&#151;some of which are UK-wide, while others operate only in one of the four home counties&#151;in fixed proportions. There is no necessary correlation between the way in which the proceeds are divided between the 15 distributing bodies, or the way in which grants are allocated by each of the distributors, and the level of ticket sales generated in particular areas. The address of a lottery grant recipient is not necessarily a reliable guide to the area or region which is benefiting from the expenditure (for example, London-based organisations often receive lottery grants but spend the money elsewhere).
<P>

<a name="31209w19.html_para10">Information on the value of grants awarded is not available as a proportion of sales. The following table shows the amount of money awarded to good causes in Northern Ireland in each of the past five calendar years. This is derived from the Department's Awards Database, which is based on information supplied by the distributing bodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport by what means the policy for purchasing timber and timber products of <i>(a)</i> the Department and <i>(b)</i> the Royal Parks Agency ensures that they are obtained from legal and sustainable sources.  [141344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 DCMS and the Royal Parks Agency have sustainability as a major consideration in all procurement. Contracts for the supply of timber or timber products specify the need for Forest Stewardship Council or equivalent certification. Recent purchases of timber desks at DCMS had full Forest Stewardship Council certification and World Wildlife Fund accreditation.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the A419 between Cirencester and Swindon, three cross-over accidents occurred between April 1996 and September 2003. There were no such accidents on the Cirencester to Nettleton Bottom section of the road during the same period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of these accidents was on a section of road which, due to design constraints, is without central reserve safety fencing. An improvement to the route at this location is included in the Government's Targeted Programme of Improvements. A second accident occurred on the section of the road through Cricklade where, at the time of the accident, there was no safety fencing in place. However, the Agency has recently completed an improvement scheme which included the provision of safety fencing at this location. The third, and most recent accident occurred at a location with safety fencing. We are investigating and reviewing the causes.</FONT></UL>

 The Highways Agency has undertaken detailed research into the use of barriers and accidents involving single vehicles leaving the nearside of English roads.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will take steps to amend section 20 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and the Use of Invalid Carriages on Highways Regulations 1988 to allow a mechanically propelled invalid tricycle which is capable in other circumstances of travelling at more than eight miles per hour to be used on public footways at a speed of less than eight miles per hour.  [142201]<P>

<P>
<a name="31209w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 "Invalid Carriages" as they are known in law, provide invaluable independent mobility to many disabled and older people. The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 permits the use of these vehicles on footways and their maximum permitted speeds are set out in the Use of invalid Carriages on Highways Regulations 1988. These vehicles must not travel faster than 4mph on footways and must be incapable of exceeding 8mph on the level under its own power on carriageways. These speed limits are fixed with the safety both of the users of these vehicles and of other road users and pedestrians in mind.
<P>

<a name="31209w21.html_para0">We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of the legislation beginning with a research study to establish basic facts about current usage and to canvass views of users and other key stakeholders. Subject to the outcome of this investigation we will be considering what changes may need to be made to current legislation governing the construction and use of these vehicles on the highway. The question of speed limits will be included in this review.

<P>
<a name="31209w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department for Transport's Transport Security Directorate (TRANSEC) is carrying out a programme of assessments of all the UK ports which fall within the scope of the IMO International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, leading to the approval of Port Facility Security Plans and implementation of security measures. TRANSEC is also approving Ship Security Plans (SSPs) and issuing International Ship Security Certificates (ISSCs) for UK flagged cruise ships and ferries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 None. I understand that the project was approved following the submission to Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) by Network Rail of a rigorous safety case. This document demonstrated compliance to Network Rail's Railway Safety Case and safety management systems. The scheme also followed the rail industry internal approval process, which included the appointment of an independent safety assessor.

<P>
<a name="31209w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No specific estimate has been made of the value of anti-retroviral drugs traded illegally in the last five years.
<P>

<a name="31209w23.html_para0">However, with the increased emphasis on trade in differentially priced drugs&#151;including anti-retroviral drugs&#151;to developing countries, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of attempts made by unscrupulous traders to divert differentially priced drugs from their intended markets in developing countries to markets in developed countries in order to take advantage of the higher prices (and therefore higher profit margins) which can be obtained in markets in developed countries.




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 2003 : Column 440W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31209w23.html_para1">It is important that we address this issue, both in order to ensure that such drugs reach the people in developing countries who need them most and to ensure that diverted drugs do not undermine the market in developed countries which is necessary to allow for further research and development into new drugs.
<P>

<a name="31209w23.html_para2">The Government have consistently supported suitable measures to combat the diversion of differentially priced drugs. We have supported the introduction of a new EU Regulation intended to combat the diversion of differentially priced drugs; worked with our G8 colleagues to secure commitments to action on this issue at the G8 summit in Evian; and ensured there were suitable provisions addressing the issue of diversion in the recent agreement in the WTO on how countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector can make effective use of the compulsory licensing provisions in the WTO TRIPS Agreement.

<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment she has made of the impact of raising the audit exemption threshold to &#163;5.6 million on the business environment, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> standards of business behaviour, <i>(b)</i> quality of financial information available to stakeholders and <i>(c)</i> levels of economic crime.  [140888]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31209w23.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government estimate that raising the audit exemption threshold has the potential to save small companies around &#163;94 million a year. There are inevitably risks as well as benefits associated with raising the threshold. The Government concluded, following consultation, that these risks are small and are outweighed by the benefits in terms of costs savings and greater flexibility for small businesses. The Government's consultation document on the proposal contained a draft impact assessment discussing the risks and benefits. The consultation document "Raising the Thresholds", which was published on 11 July 2003, is available on the Department's website at http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/published.htm. A final version of the impact assessment will also be available there in due course.

 The Government has taken a number of steps to improve the financial environment for the biotechnology industry. The R&D Tax Credit system, has benefited many bioscience companies. UK-based companies can also take advantage of the DTI's business support products. Four products have been launched to date, all of which may be of use to biotechnology companies:

<a name="31209w23.html_para3">The Higher Education Innovation Fund (&#163;187 million over 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06) and Public Sector Research Exploitation Fund (&#163;15 million over 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06) are examples of Government's support for commercialisation of research.
<P>

<a name="31209w23.html_para4">Commercial funding of the industry through financial markets is essential, however, for its long-term success. Government will normally intervene only in financial markets where it can identify a clear market failure, but where such failures are identified, the track record of intervention is strong. For example the UK High Technology Fund (UKHTF), an element of the &#163;180 million Enterprise Fund was announced in 1998. Other initiatives include the Regional Venture Capital Funds launched on a national basis for England through the Small Business Service in 2002, and funds set up by the Regional Development Agencies and Devolved Administrations to tackle localised market failures.
<P>

<a name="31209w23.html_para5">The UK has the most liquid capital markets in Europe and the most developed venture capital sector in the world after the USA. Optimism about the long-term prospects for bioscience is starting to return to public markets after a global downturn and good UK biotechnology companies are still receiving venture capital investment. The UK is also home to some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, providing long-term finance for biotechnology companies through deals to purchase or license technology.




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 2003 : Column 442W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31209w23.html_para6">The Government is not complacent, however. The DTI and Department of Health prompted the establishment of the Bioscience Innovation and Growth Team, to identify and clarify the issues that are critical to the future competitiveness of the UK biosciences sector. The BIGT report was published in November 2003 and includes recommendations on the flow of seed capital, improvement of public sector technology transfer activity, and the provision of a favourable regulatory and fiscal environment. The Government will examine these recommendations carefully and respond to them all in due course.

<a name="31209w24.html_para4">EMBC management is proposing an increase, over the next three years, of around 18 per cent. extra in 2004 rising to 44 per cent. extra in 2006 (about &#163;700,000 per annum extra for the MRC). This is currently under discussion with EMBC and the UK contributions are not therefore known.
<P>

<a name="31209w24.html_para5">It is a matter for the MRC to decide/agree what level of subscription they should pay to EMBC, taking into account other commitments and priorities. They undertake periodic reviews of the relevant EMBO schemes in preparation for EMBC budget discussions. The main benefits of participation are association with, and access to, prestigious and well-run fellowships schemes that have added value to the development of the European molecular biology.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps the Government are taking to promote the take-up of family friendly options at work by men.  [142659]<P>

<a name="31209w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> In April this year, the Government introduced new laws for working parents which cover fathers as well as mothers, including the right for fathers of children aged under six or disabled children under 18 to request flexible working and the right to two weeks paid paternity leave. These new rights together with the existing rights to parental leave and time off for dependants recognise that men increasingly want to play a greater role in the family and provides them with more choices for doing so.
<P>

<a name="31209w24.html_para8">To facilitate take-up, the Government are running an on-going awareness raising campaign which includes national newspaper adverts targeted specifically at fathers. In addition posters have been circulated to CAB's GP's surgeries and libraries. We are working in partnership with stakeholders to raise awareness. We provided support to the charity, Fathers Direct for their pilot magazine aimed at new fathers&#151;'Dad', launched in five different maternity units in April 2003 and distributed to all new fathers coming into contact with those units.

<a name="31209w24.html_para9">The Government's Work-Life balance campaign also encourages employers to adopt best practice and provide family-friendly policies right across the work force.

 The overall impact of EU trade arrangements on developing countries is determined by a number of factors. The European Union offers preferential access to European markets to developing countries under the Cononou Agreement with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, the 'Everything But Arms' initiative for Least Developed Countries and the Generalised System of Preferences for Developing Countries. In addition to preferential arrangements, other instruments have a direct or indirect impact on developing countries, including anti-dumping measures, the common agricultural policy, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and technical regulations. The impact of such factors differs from country to country, and there is little research on the aggregated net effect either on specific developing countries or on developing countries as a group.

<a name="31209w25.html_para4">We continue to work closely with the European Commission and other member states to ensure the greatest benefit to developing countries of increased international trade through, for example, the WTO negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda, and Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations under the Cotonou Agreement.

 ISO 9001:2000 is the latest version of the quality management systems standard.

It is already the most widely recognised management standard in the world and I am sure that the advantages and benefits of the new version will encourage its use still further. The DTI welcomes tenders from suppliers that have certification to this standard for a relevant scope but it is not a mandatory requirement and it is acceptable for a potential supplier to use other means to demonstrate how it has implemented its quality policy.
