<a name="11112w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions were held with Sport England on the establishment of the new opportunities fund for sport.  [14108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I and my officials have held a number of meetings and conducted detailed correspondence with Sport England about the new opportunities for PE and school sport initiative.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the <i>(a)</i> start up and <i>(b)</i> operating costs are of the new opportunities fund for sport.  [14107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The new opportunities school sport initiative is one of 13 programmes operated by the fund in the areas of health, education and the environment. The estimated direct costs for this programme to 31 March 2002 are &#163;767,600 of which &#163;97,600 represents start-up costs. Over the lifetime of its programmes, the new opportunities fund aims to keep its running costs within 5 per cent. of its lottery income.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to merge the New Opportunities Fund for Sport organisation with Sport England; and if she will make a statement.  [14106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The new opportunities fund is the body designated in the National Lottery Act 1998 to distribute lottery funds to initiatives concerned with health, education and the environment, one of which is the new opportunities for PE and school sport initiative. I have no plans to merge the new opportunities fund with Sport England.

<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer of 1 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 802W, on departmental assets, if he will estimate the value of the Government art collection; and if he will make a statement.  [13125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the value of the Government art collection, which, as a non-operational heritage asset, has no current market valuation. The current monetary value of a work of art can be accurately assessed only at the time of its purchase or sale or by professional valuation. The collection is not actively traded, and it would not be a justifiable expenditure of public funds to have the whole collection valued professionally.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para0">However, from 1 April 2000 additions to the collection have been included at cost in the asset register of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, on the grounds 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 2001 : Column: 502W</I><P>
that the purchase price provides a reliable basis for capitalisation. This accounting policy will apply to national museums and galleries and other collections from 1 April 2001. The value of purchased additions to the Government art collection as at 31 March 2001 is &#163;124,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if the Rough Sleepers Unit will compile information about the number of hotel places in major centres of population.  [10780]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Rough Sleepers Unit already compiles information on the hostel bedspaces that it funds. In addition, local authorities around the country hold information on hostel bedspaces in their area.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para1">The RSU required local authorities with significant numbers of rough sleepers to assess the provision of hostel accommodation in their areas in order to develop local rough sleeping strategies. This information is held and reviewed locally but has not been compiled centrally by the RSU.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para2">However, the RSU is now considering its future beyond April 2002 and information on hostel provision will be an important feature of any future work. Therefore such information will be compiled in the new year.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para3">Under the provisions of the Homelessness Bill, local housing authorities would be expected to review the resources available to the authority and its partners in their periodic homelessness reviews: this should include reviews of hostel and other accommodation available to homeless people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_wqn6"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he has asked the National Audit Office to evaluate the PPP bids for the London Underground once the final bids have been prepared; and if he will make a statement.  [11614]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The National Audit Office produced a report into the financial analysis of the London Underground PPPs in December 2000. The NAO has examined the further work London Underground and its advisers are undertaking on the financial analysis of the PPPs, and found that London Underground intends to take the issues raised by the NAO in its earlier report on board. I understand that, while the NAO will continue to monitor the situation, it does not believe that a further report at this stage would be useful.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what assumptions regarding the cost to the public sector of cost overruns he is planning to include in the guidance for the public sector comparator for assessing the public-private partnership bids for London Underground;  [12387]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to make changes to the assumptions underlying the public sector comparator for assessing bids under the public-private partnership for London Underground; and if he will make a statement.  [12388]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's plans for a publicly run, privately built tube will deliver around &#163;13 billion of investment to improve the underground's infrastructure over the next 15 years. The Secretary of State has made clear that he will only be prepared for these plans to go ahead if he is content that they represent value for money.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para4">London Underground is carrying out a thorough evaluation of the value for money of bids, guided by the results of a public sector comparator. The detailed assumptions made in this comparator, including those on cost overruns, have been developed by London Underground, assisted by its engineering advisers Ove Arup and its financial advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers. I understand that London Underground, again assisted by its advisers, is currently reviewing the comparator to ensure that it represents a level-playing-field test for evaluating final bids.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para5">The value for money evaluation of the London Underground PPPs will be made publicly available, but not until London Underground has concluded its negotiations with bidders. To publish the value for money evaluation any earlier would reveal London Underground's negotiating position and so undermine its ability to achieve best value.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what information he collates on the incidence of crime in underground stations.  [13265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 This is a matter for the British Transport Police (BTP). The BTP collate all data in relation to incidences of crime on London Underground. They publish annual crime statistics for London Underground, using Home Office guidelines, within their annual report. A Crime and Disorder audit is carried out annually for underground stations and this is also

<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_wqn10"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what external validation <i>(a)</i> will be and <i>(b)</i> has been applied to the use of New Earnings Survey statistical data used for distribution of the area cost adjustment for 2002&#150;03;  [12998]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps he <i>(a)</i> will take and <i>(b)</i> has taken to ensure that small sample sizes in the New Earnings Survey data used for distribution of the area cost adjustment for 2002&#150;03 are within acceptable statistical confidence limits;  [12997]
<P>
(3) what criteria he uses to assess the acceptability of statistical confidence limits for data used for distribution of the area cost adjustment for 2002&#150;03;  [12996]
<P>
(4) what discussions his Department has had with the Office for National Statistics about the use of the New Earnings Survey in the calculation of the area cost adjustment for 2002&#150;03.  [12995]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The use of New Earnings Survey (NES) data for the purposes of calculating the area cost adjustment have been the same in every local government finance settlement since 1993&#150;94. Ministers at the time, after extensive discussion with local government, decided that the current methodology was the most appropriate use of the data for distributing grant to local government. When the methodology was developed, there was consideration of sample sizes and whether to base the area cost adjustment on one or two years of NES data.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para6">We announced on 20 July that we do not intend to change this long established methodology for 2002&#150;03, while we review the grant distribution formulae as a whole in time for 2003&#150;04. We have made careful checks that we are using the NES data in the usual way for 2002&#150;03. This includes confirming that the NES data supplied to us by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are correct, and validating the area cost adjustment calculations by ensuring that at least two members of our grant distribution team independently derive the same results. External validation by those outside Government is not possible because of the need to ensure the confidentiality of those included in the survey.
<P>

<a name="11112w01.html_para7">We have also been party to discussions between the ONS and the Association of London Government (ALG), who asked the ONS for an explanation of the movements in the data since last year. The ONS reply to the ALG confirms that the data that underpin the area cost adjustment for 2002&#150;03 are correct. The reply is also a helpful contribution to our formula grant review. For example, it has a bearing on whether we should address possible volatility around small samples by using an 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 2001 : Column: 505W</I><P>
average of two or three years of NES data for the area cost adjustment. Smoothing the area cost adjustment in this way is one of the options we are currently discussing with local government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what recent guidance he has given to local councils on the treatment of dry rot and which chemicals are permitted for its treatment.  [12892]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 My Department does not provide local councils with guidance on the treatment of dry rot in timber but refers such inquiries to authoritative sources of information such as the Building Research Establishment and the British Wood Preserving and Damp Proofing Association.
<P>

<a name="11112w02.html_para0">Chemicals permitted for treatment of dry rot are approved under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986. The labels of approved pesticidal products will state which of these can be used specifically against dry rot. A list of all approved products is published in "Pesticides 2001"; this annually updated publication can be found in the Research Section of the House of Commons' Library.

<a name="11112w02.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Working Time Directive</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the operation of the working time directive in respect of HGV drivers.  [10307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2001]:</i> There are two working time proposals that will affect drivers of large goods vehicles. First, parts of the horizontal amending directive (EC2000/34)&#151;due to be implemented by 1 August 2003&#151;will introduce some changes. Drivers will be subject to the 48 hour average working week, four weeks paid annual leave, health checks for night workers and a provision for adequate rest. As with existing working time legislation, workers will be able to sign an individual opt-out if they want to work longer than the 48 hour average.
<P>

<a name="11112w02.html_para1">The second proposal concerns mobile workers in the road transport sector and is still subject to negotiation in Brussels. The directive will only apply to drivers of large vehicles who are currently subject to EC drivers' hours rules (EC3820/85). It is clear that there will be no individual opt-out from the 48 hour average working week, but other significant issues have still to be resolved with the European Parliament. Negotiations should be complete by the end of this year, and we expect the new directive will be adopted in early 2002. Implementation in the UK will be in a further two to three years.

 It is estimated that, in 2000, 53 per cent. of all pedestrians fatally or seriously injured in road accidents received their injuries from being hit by the front of a car.
<P>

<a name="11112w02.html_para2">73 per cent. of pedestrians suffering fatal or serious injury in 2000 were hit by a car in a single vehicle accident; 19 per cent. were hit by other vehicles (i.e. not cars) in single vehicle accidents; and 8 per cent. were hit in accidents which involved more than one vehicle.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he will publish the timetable for the implementation of the ring-fenced budget for noise mitigation measures.  [13217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's policy of reducing the effects of traffic noise is being implemented through two programmes.
<P>

<a name="11112w02.html_para3">The Government's "Transport 2010: The 10 Year Plan" gives a commitment to surface at least 60 per cent. of the trunk roads, including all the concrete trunk roads, with quieter materials by 31 March 2011. We have a policy of using quieter surfaces as a matter of course whenever a road needs to be resurfaced and I recently announced the criteria to be used for prioritising the concrete trunk roads to be resurfaced with quieter materials.
<P>

<a name="11112w02.html_para4">The second programme, with an annual &#163;5 million ring- fenced budget, is to provide noise mitigation measures in the most serious and pressing cases where practical and cost-effective measures can be provided.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 While it is not for the SRA to support particular light rail projects, they have co-operated with franchise operators and local authorities in furthering the development of light rail schemes for Tyne & Wear Metro, Manchester Metrolink, Nottingham Express Transit and the West Midlands Metro. The SRA are also working to facilitate development of the currently proposed project in Bristol.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what information he has collated on the number of US states which have banned the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether; and what discussions he has held with his US counterparts in the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a petrol additive.  [13253]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department does not hold details on the use of MTBE in the United States. I understand that the US Federal Government is proposing to reduce significantly or eliminate MTBE in petrol due to public concern about MTBE in groundwater. MTBE is used significantly less in the UK and there is no evidence to indicate that contamination of groundwater presents a significant risk here.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Directive 98/70/EU (enacted by Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 3107) sets a limit of 15 per cent. on ethers containing five or more carbon atoms per molecule&#151;which includes MTBE. For the UK as a whole, usage typically averages less than 0.5 per cent., with most production having none.
<P>

<a name="11112w02.html_para5">The main risk identified with MTBE, particularly in the USA, is to groundwater. In the UK public consultation has recently finished on a draft groundwater protection code for petrol stations and underground storage tanks to be made under Regulation 21 of the Groundwater Regulations 1998. This will provide advice on what processes/precautions need to be in place at petrol stations and other underground fuel storage areas to ensure protection of groundwater and compliance with the Groundwater Regulations.

 No specific assessments have been made but all train operators have a general obligation in their franchise agreements to provide sufficient capacity to avoid excessive crowding. In the Metropolitan areas, Passenger Transport Executives specify overcrowding controls for the services they require. One of the aims of the new franchise policy announced by the Secretary of State in July was to instruct the Strategic Rail Authority to reduce overcrowding and negotiate new franchises or extensions to secure the necessary improvement in capacity.

<a name="11112w03.html_para10">Local fire authorities are responsible for the recruitment and selection of fire service staff. In general the fire service is a popular career choice and applications far exceed the number of vacancies available each year. However, in some areas fire authorities and brigades do experience difficulties in recruiting to the retained (volunteer) sections of the fire service. For more than 10 years the Home Office, which had responsibility for fire service matters prior to the transfer to DTLR in June this year, has helped to encourage people to join the fire service both in a full-time and voluntary capacity by providing recruitment literature and advertising posters for local use.Over the last two years the Home Office, and now DTLR, have been encouraging. Fire authorities to review their recruitment practices in order to ensure they reach groups that are currently under-represented in the service. To help authorities to do this DTLR has developed new national recruitment literature which will be launched shortly.

 There are no regulations requiring train operators to provide toilets on trains, nor are there any plans for such regulations to be introduced. Train operators will only make the most of their commercial opportunities if they provide the facilities that passengers demand. The Strategic Rail Authority do not think it is a priority for investment to specify the provision of facilities which train operating companies are likely to provide of their own accord. Where train operators provide toilet facilities they are subject to the same environmental health requirements as any other provider of these facilities.

Consideration of this number of appeals inevitably takes time. The VOA publishes programmes setting out when all appeals will be considered; these are reviewed in consultation with ratepayers. If, when an appeal is considered, the VOA and the ratepayer do not reach agreement on the valuation, the appeal will be heard shortly afterwards by an independent Valuation Tribunal.

<a name="11112w05.html_para0">The UK Government strongly support the impressive economic reform efforts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). As a result the UK will be seeking an agreement in the forthcoming negotiations between the FRY and its Paris Club creditors beginning on 13 November that reduces FRY's debt to sustainable levels. On the basis of current IMF projects HMG will advocate debt reduction by official creditors of 75 per cent. Consistent with our policy towards other recipients of debt reduction, any deal should be designed to provide the incentives for continued economic reform in the medium term.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what measures will be taken in response to the European Court of Human Rights decision in favour of Francis Devlin on 30 October; what compensation he will pay to Mr. Devlin; how many cases contesting procedures relating to national security exemption certificates are outstanding; and what steps will be taken to settle those cases prior to any court hearing in Strasbourg.  [12991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w05.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgment in the Devlin case on 30 October. The court found a breach of article 6(1) because Mr. Devlin had no effective way of challenging the certificate issued under section 42 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 in relation to his discrimination proceedings. The court rejected the Government's argument that Mr. Devlin could not rely on article 6(1) rights in the circumstances of his case. In rejecting this argument the court found a breach in the same terms as those found in the Tinnelly and McElduff cases. Following those judgments in 1998, the Government established a Tribunal, under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, to which an individual can appeal against a section 42 certificate. The remedial action required, should a similar situation to Mr. Devlin's case arise now, is therefore already in place. The court awarded &#163;10,000 to Mr. Devlin and the Government are considering the terms of the judgment and their next steps in relation to this. The Government are aware of only one outstanding case in Strasbourg contesting procedures relating to section 42 certificates and are considering what steps should be taken to seek to settle the dispute.

 Under the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) the Territorial Army (TA) was restructured to make it more relevant and usable and more fully integrated into our armed forces and defence plans. As a result, more TA units are now held at a higher state of readiness than pre-SDR and we continue to assess that the TA infantry battalions have the capability to be deployed on operations as formed units. As such they are an essential part of the Army's order of battle.

 Since January 2001, the Ministry of Defence has co-ordinated its written public consultation in line with the Cabinet Office's "code of practice" issued in November 2000. The Ministry of Defence issued six consultation documents during the period January 15 to April 14 and one document between April 15 to July 14. No documents were issued between July 15 to October 14. Prior to January 2001 these statistics were not held centrally and to establish accurate figures could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="11112w06.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I do not believe there is a requirement for a review of the regulations surrounding the defence medal. In 1946, the Committee on the Grants of Honours, Decorations and Medals discussed the awards, and their qualifying criteria, that should be instituted to reward service in the campaigns, operations and defence commitments during the Second World War. Members of the Committee included senior military and Government officers who had first hand experience and thorough knowledge of the events throughout the war. The regulations governing the qualification requirements for all Second World War medals were finalised in 1948, following approval from His Majesty King George VI, and were announced on 11 June 1948. These regulations have been strictly adhered to ever since.

 The proposed qualifying criteria for medals are submitted to the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals (HD Committee) for consideration, after which their recommendation is passed to the Sovereign for approval. Following Royal assent the Officer-in-Charge of the Army Medal Office is responsible for ensuring that all applications for Army and Home Guard medals fulfil the relevant qualifying criteria by checking eligibility against official service records. The Navy, Royal Air Force and Royal Marines have their own medal offices with the appropriate delegated authority.

 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> Inevitably on occasions minor technical or mechanical problems temporarily required individual Challenger 2 tanks and other vehicles to undergo short periods of maintenance, but overall the armoured vehicles deployed on Exercise Saif Sareea 2 successfully completed the tasks required of them.
<P>

<a name="11112w07.html_para0">The extent of the involvement of Challenger 2 was, however, adjusted during the exercise as further experience was gained in operating the tank in the harsh desert environment. Previous experience of operating other armoured vehicle types in desert conditions meant that maintenance could be more accurately programmed and no adjustment to their involvement was necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The extent to which logistic support to a major exercise is conducted tactically requires a very careful balance to be made between the effective conduct of the wider exercise, the training benefit to be gained and the costs both financial and on military manpower. In the case of Exercise Saif Sareea, the vast majority of logistic support was conducted tactically throughout the exercise play.
<P>

<a name="11112w07.html_para1">The sole major exception to this was third line logistic support to the deployed land forces: logistic support to land forces in the exercise area was conducted tactically, but was non-tactical along the 1,200 kilometre line of communication across Oman. To have deployed tactically at third line would have placed a major additional burden on army logistics staffs, with little or no gain in terms of training benefit.

 The cluster bombs used in Afghanistan have not been prohibited by any treaty or convention and they are employed only against legitimate terrorist and military objectives where they are the most effective weapon to attack the target concerned. All types of munitions can fail in various ways and cluster bombs are no exception. However, it is not for Her Majesty's Government to comment on the performance of US weapons.

[14265]<P>

 We are in close touch with the US on all aspects of the response to the 11 September attacks, including at the military planning level. I understand that the US authorities have recognised that there is a problem with bomblets from cluster bombs and food parcels both being yellow. They have, therefore, dropped leaflets with diagrams of the two explaining which should be approached and which avoided.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics for unemployment from surveys following the internationally standard International Labour Organisation definition. However, for the Buckingham parliamentary constituency the survey sample size is too small to provide estimates. ONS also compiles statistics of claimants of unemployment-related benefits. The claimant count consists of all people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance or National Insurance credits at Employment Service local offices. They must declare that they are out of work, capable of, available for and actively seeking work during the week in which the claim is made.</FONT></UL>

<a name="11112w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Income tax is deducted at source from bank and building society interest, and the tax deducted can be reclaimed where a saver is not liable to pay it. There is no tax deduction at source from dividends, and so no tax to reclaim. Dividends carry a tax credit which satisfies the tax liability of investors with income up to the basic rate limit, but non-taxpayers cannot claim payment of this tax credit.

 Part-time employees have always been able to join and contribute to tax approved pensions schemes on the same basis as other employees. Any restriction on the participation of part-time employees in an occupational pension scheme is as a result of scheme rules.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The complexity of smuggling routes means that Customs does not know the country of origin of all drug seizures. Of the heroin seized in the UK by Customs during the financial year 2000&#150;01, 83 kg is recorded as having Pakistan as the known country of origin. It is not policy to give details of investigative techniques as that could prejudice the investigation and detection of crime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The UK has consistently been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief for developing countries. The UK pushed for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative to be speeded up, and as a result 23 countries were receiving debt relief at the end of October. Those countries will receive $54 billion in debt relief, which will reduce their debts to below the developing country average.
<P>

<a name="11112w09.html_para2">The UK's 100 per cent. bilateral policy on debt relief means that it stands ready to write off &#163;1.9 billion of debt to all 42 HIPCs, and is one of the highest contributors to the HIPC trust fund.
<P>

<a name="11112w09.html_para3">In addition, the Chancellor also announced last December that the UK would hold in trust any payments from those HIPCs yet to receive debt relief, and we continue to call on other creditor countries to follow our lead.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w11.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 None. Small rural public houses, along with other business properties, are assessed for non-domestic rating purposes by Valuation Officers, appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, in accordance with the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (as amended). The method of valuation for such properties is a matter for those involved in the assessment process; i.e. Valuation Officers, ratepayers and their professional advisers, and is subject to a right of appeal to an independent tribunal in the event of disagreement.

<P>
<P>

 The Inland Revenue Solicitor, not the Treasury Solicitor, advises the Valuation Office Agency on rating litigation and he has been instructed in this case.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the decision of the East Wales Valuation Tribunal in the case of Sharp <i>v</i>. Valuation Office.  [14006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w11.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Treasury does not assess decisions of the Valuation Tribunal. Valuation Tribunals are independent bodies set up to deal with disputes in connection with, inter alia, non-domestic rating matters. Appeals against their decisions lie to the Lands Tribunal. It would be inappropriate for the Treasury to intervene with these independent bodies.

<P>

<a name="11112w11.html_para2">The Council noted Economic Policy Committee reports on the budgetary impact of aging populations and on the measurement of output gaps.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Local authorities and schools can already contract with the private and voluntary sector to support schools. The White Paper "Schools: achieving success" proposes partnerships between schools, local authorities and partners who might in some cases be from the private or voluntary sector. But schools will continue to be managed by the governing body and headteacher, even where they are supported by expertise from other sources. Local education authorities should secure high quality services from the most cost-effective source available, in accordance with best value principles. Sources include the education authority itself, or partnerships with other public, voluntary or private sector bodies, both profit making and not for profit. Individual local education authorities remain responsible and accountable for the services concerned, however they are provided.

<a name="11112w12.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> There are no plans to extend the flying restrictions applying to Sellafield at the present time. Flying restrictions over Sellafield prohibit aircraft from flying over the nuclear installation below a height of 2,200 feet above mean sea level in a two nautical mile radius. The regulations currently applying are the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Nuclear Installations) Regulations 2001 which came into force on 11 May 2001. The regulations do not prohibit flights for the purpose of landing at or taking off from the helicopter landing area at the installation. Such flights are made with the permission of the person in charge of the installation and in accordance with any conditions to which that permission is subject.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the B215 building at the Sellafield site has been designed to resist a plane crash.  [13231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> All nuclear licensees are required by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the safety regulator, to ensure that they maintain valid safety cases for operations on each of their sites. Safety cases need to take due account of external hazards such as plane crashes at nuclear installations. HSE is satisfied that the safety case applying to the Sellafield site, including building 215, took appropriate account of the risks of an accidental air crash.
<P>

<a name="11112w12.html_para1">The UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator. The security regulator works closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the safety regulator, which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations. Security and safety precautions at nuclear sites are kept under regular review. Both regulators are reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of the recent terrorist attacks in the USA. It is not Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites.

[14223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w12.html_spnew9"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We received representations from workers' organisations, employers' bodies, trade associations, agencies, employment businesses, individuals and other interested parties. The regulatory impact assessment for the draft conduct regulations found that they should reduce recruitment costs for employers across the economy, and make the labour market more efficient and flexible. In addition, clarifying the contractual position of temporary workers will help ensure they get the employment rights to which they are entitled.
<P>

<a name="11112w12.html_para2">Our objective in overhauling the existing regulations, which date from 1976, is simpler, clearer, regulations, which are relevant to the market of today and of the future.

Future regulations will cover these special circumstances.

 A very high priority has been given to the Royal Ordnance site, which is identified as one of 11 strategic sites in the North West Development Agency's regional strategy. A large part of the site has already been acquired by a development consortium, and Chorley Borough Council are currently in negotiations with the present owner to acquire 50 hectares of the site for re-use as a major inward investment site.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2001]:</i> It is the Government's policy to encourage people to use the type of account which is most appropriate for their needs. The Post Office card account is intended primarily for people who are unable or unwilling to open even a basic bank account, and it is the Government's intention to promote the take up and use of basic and other bank accounts. As a consequence, this matter is being considered within the context of an overall migration and marketing strategy on which a great deal of work is currently under way.

 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2001]:</i> The UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator. The security regulator works closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the safety regulator, which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations. Security and safety precautions at nuclear sites are kept under regular review. Both regulators are reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of the recent terrorist attacks in the USA. It is not Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites.

 802 units have been provided so far with agreements signed for a further 120 units due for occupation next year. We are well on target to deliver the additional 2000 units of affordable housing units for national health service staff in London which is the target set in the NHS Plan. We expect to exceed this target.

<a name="11112w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Blood Service appropriate use of blood group is looking at simple pre-operative measures to avoid the need for transfusion, including assessment of haemoglobin levels to determine whether transfusion is necessary; correcting anaemia with appropriate vitamin and iron supplements; volume replacement with solutions other than blood components and autologous blood transfusion in all its forms.

 Our policy on DNA is the same for combating all crime. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 included an amendment modifying the restriction on the use of DNA taken under the provisions of the Terrorism Act in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow their use additionally for the prevention and detection of any crime, the investigation of any offence or the conduct of any investigation.

<P>
<a name="11112w16.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Following a risk assessment, a prisoner receiving treatment at the North Manchester General Hospital was released on temporary licence so that he could receive treatment without escort and without the application of any restraints. However, he breached the conditions of his licence by disappearing from the permitted area of the hospital, and his licence was revoked pending a full reassessment of risk to the public. During this period, lasting six days, he was handcuffed and escorted by prison staff. On completion of the risk assessment, the Governor was satisfied that the prisoner had not deliberately breached his licence conditions. He was therefore again released on licence and all security measures have been withdrawn. It is Prison Service policy that restraints should normally be removed at the request of medical staff. No such requests were made in this case.

of the honourable member in relation to 'Camp Excalibur' in North Wales. I understand that North Wales Police have conducted a full investigation into such activities. They have assured me that no criminal offences have been committed. It is of course an offence under Section 54 (1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000 to provide instruction or training or to receive instruction or training in the making or use of firearms, explosives, or chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. In addition, under subsection (3) (b) a person commits an offence if he invites another to receive instruction or training and the receipt would constitute an offence under subsection (2) but for the fact that it is to take place outside the United Kingdom. Any concrete and verifiable evidence of such activities will be dealt with immediately.

I asked Home Office officials to examine further with the Metropolitan police the information which was provided. As a result, I am satisfied that the information given in the answers, which was based on information provided by the Metropolitan police, gave a misleading impression, for which I apologise. I am satisfied that there was no intention to mislead and that the errors arose because of misunderstanding between officials and the Metropolitan police about the information which the police had provided in order to answer the questions.

 In all of the Magistrates Court Committees in receipt of the Libra Office Automation service, access to the main legacy system is achieved, for almost all staff, via the Libra terminal on their desks. Access to some other legacy systems used in discrete areas is achieved by a communication link to the legacy network, again using the Libra terminal. Only a minority of staff require this facility. In some cases separate stand-alone terminals have been retained to provide this access, in addition to access for specific local systems where that access was not available on the legacy network, and is not currently available on the Libra service. This mixture of access is replicated in all MCCs.

 Risk assessments for each of the new Jobcentre Plus offices have been carried out within the framework of a generic risk assessment which was developed earlier in the year in consultation with staff representatives.

These include wide coverage by closed circuit television; training for staff in how to handle difficult situations; better management in each office to avoid difficult situations building up; panic alarms; and more visible and effective security guards. Additionally, in each pathfinder area there are screened facilities to deal with individuals and parts of the business which pose a greater risk.

 There are currently 387 CCTV systems installed and Land Securities Trillium has 1,179 permanent security staff members deployed in Benefits Agency offices. The number of security staff is supplemented by temporary staff where local needs demand.
<P>

<a name="11112w23.html_para0">The installation of CCTV cameras and the deployment of security staff are based on the recommendations of independent risk assessors in order to reduce risks for staff in those offices. The security teams regularly defuse situations at an early stage and where necessary take action to notify the police. No statistics are available on the number of occasions when security staff intervene or CCTV is used as evidence in a prosecution.

 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2001]:</i> Child poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional concepts, affecting many aspects of children's lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of the environment, and opportunities to learn. The third "Opportunity for all" report (Cm 5260) sets out the Government's strategy for tackling child poverty and social exclusion and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against this strategy.

 People who meet the whole cost of their place in a residential care home or nursing home entirely from their own resources and without help from public funds are termed self-funders and may be entitled to continued payment of attendance allowance which is based on care needs. Those self-funders who are entitled to attendance allowance can continue to be paid the benefit subject to their receiving no help from public funds.

1. Estimates are rounded to the nearest thousand.<P>

2. Data for England, Wales and Northern Ireland to estimate the number of self-funders in receipt of attendance allowance in nursing and care homes were not available. We did have reliable information from the Scottish Executive for Scotland. This was used to then estimate the numbers in the remaining nations.<P>

3. It is assumed that all those self-funders in residential and nursing homes are entitled to attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance.<P>

4. It is assumed that the percentage of over 65s in care who are self-funders is the same in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as in Scotland.<P>

 The Department for Work and Pensions will offer a new service to enable people of working age to more effectively plan their retirement incomes through the provision of combined pension forecast statements.
<P>

<a name="11112w23.html_para3">This voluntary service, which is a joint initiative between the Department's pension providers and employers, is being implemented in the three main phases.
<P>

<a name="11112w23.html_para4">Phase 1 saw the development of the service through a series of pilot exercises conducted with the pensions industry. The pilots, which began in January 2000, are now coming to a conclusion.
<P>

<a name="11112w23.html_para5">Phase 2, which commenced on 18 October 2001, sees the formal recruitment and registration of pension providers to the service.
<P>

<a name="11112w23.html_para6">Phase 3 represents the physical production of the new statement by the industry. This phase will take the form of a rolling programme building to a service which will aim to provide 15 million combined statements by 2005&#150;06.

1. Staff costs include basic salary and allowances plus employer's contribution to National Insurance and Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme.<P>

2. Staff Costs do not include ancillary matters such as accommodation, office services, stationery etc.<P>

3. The staff data from which these figures derive are as at 31 August 2001 as this represents the correct staffing position of DWP, which was formed in June 2001. Earlier DSS data is not comparable.<P>

4. Employment Service staff are included.<P>

5. War Pensions Agency Staff are included as they are still largely within the overall DWP administrative structure even though WPA is now technically part of the Ministry of Defence.<P>

6. Casual and other staff on temporary contracts are included.<P>

7. The grade groupings include specialist staff such as accountants, lawyers and auditors in their "generalist" grade equivalent.<P>

8. Because the staffing make-up of DWP is different from the DSS, the figures above are not comparable with those provided for DSS in Civil Service Statistics 2000.<P>

9. Overtime costs are not included as it would not be possible to collate the historical data required in sufficient detail in the time available.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many job losses have occurred in the UK as a result of the terrorist attacks of 11 September.  [9885]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Because normal labour market turnover is so large, it is difficult to assess how much is due to particular changes or events.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w24.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how many jobcentres have had electronic jobpoints fitted; how many jobs are accessible through this service; and what assessment has been made of the effectiveness of the service in placing people in employment;  [11260]
<P>
<UL>(2) how much has been spent on the development and installation of jobpoint kiosks in jobcentres across the country.  [11255]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Since the first jobpoints were installed, a little over nine months ago, over 650 offices have been equipped with almost 6,200 machines. By February 2002, when all 1,000 jobcentres will have been fitted with a total of 9,000 jobpoints it will be the largest managed network in the world of this sort of terminal.
<P>

<a name="11112w24.html_para0">The Employment Service typically handles around 400,000 vacancies at any one time and these can be searched on jobpoints by job type, location, hours or other factors. In addition, there are usually more than 10,000 vacancies from other public employment services in the European Economic Area and around 1,500 which are being displayed by a small number of private agencies and recruiters as part of an experiment.
<P>

<a name="11112w24.html_para1">Jobpoints are part of an extensive programme of modernisation of the Employment Service, which also includes vacancies taken through a single national telephone number, an internet job bank and new job matching tools for staff. It is not possible to separate the cost of jobpoints from other elements of the modernisation programme because of the interdependencies within it. As we have said before in a press release dated 31 October 2000 the work is being carried out through an eight year contract with Electronic Data Systems. The first phase of this, which included the jobpoints, is at a total of &#163;470 million. However, a substantial part of these costs will be offset through efficiency savings derived from the whole of the programme.
<P>

<a name="11112w24.html_para2">Evidence from an early evaluation of the Jobpoint Pathfinder offices is available in the House of Commons Library. It shows that the use of jobpoints is encouraging jobseekers to look at a larger range of jobs across wider geographical areas. Jobseekers are finding the machines easy to use and that they improve the effectiveness of their job searching. Evidence is emerging that people are applying for more jobs, and this should increase their prospects of moving from benefits to work, and doing so more quickly.
<P>

<a name="11112w24.html_para3">The effectiveness of jobpoints is currently being further assessed as part of a wider evaluation of the Modernising Employment Service (MES) Programme. Results from the first year of the evaluation will be published in 2002 with final results in 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the findings of his Department's research report number 149 "The Medium-Term Effects of Voluntary Participation in ONE"; and what steps he is taking to ensure that the findings of the report are acted upon.  [11262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The evidence from this report suggests that ONE has succeeded in providing a more individually tailored and work-focused service to clients. The report is only based on findings from the voluntary stage of ONE and so it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about ONE until evidence is available from the period when participation in work focused interviews became compulsory. However, emerging findings from ONE evaluation reports are being used to inform the development of the new Jobcentre Plus service.

<P>
<a name="11112w25.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Resistance to the slaughter of stock on contiguous premises has led to delays in some disease control operations, seriously hampering efforts to bring the epidemic under control. The longer that animals which are believed to have been exposed to the virus remain alive, the greater the risk of them developing disease and spreading infection to neighbouring farms.

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> The licensing arrangements for animal movements are kept under constant review and have been regularly amended to reflect the improving disease situation. Once foot and mouth disease has been eradicated, we will need to look closely at the way in which animal movements contributed to the rapid spread of disease.

<P>

<a name="11112w25.html_para0">There have been restrictions on the movement of pigs for many years. Any proposal to retain licensing for other animal movements would need to balance carefully the needs of the livestock industry and the inherent disease control risks associated with animal movements.

However, there is currently sampling and testing of the premises in the three to 10 kilometre surveillance zones in Herefordshire and until this has been completed satisfactorily, the county remains at "at risk" status.

 The Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme was opened on 22 March 2001, to deal with severe welfare problems arising from the foot and mouth disease movement restrictions that cannot be dealt with by any other means. As at 7 November, the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme had dealt with a total of 1,929,891 animals since it opened. Of these, 1,481,049 were sheep (76.7 per cent.), 279,126 were pigs (14.5 per cent.), 166,531 were cattle (8.6 per cent.) and 3,185 were other species (0.2 per cent.).

The proportion of the &#163;152 million RES budget allocated to rural tourism, like all other measures under the scheme, is determined at the regional level in the light of consultation with local stakeholders. DEFRA also offers assistance in the form of free planning consultancy advice to farmers who intend to pursue an eligible RES diversification project, which may include diversification into rural tourism. The RES is not available in objective 1 areas but equivalent funds are available through the objective 1 Programme for each area. Other funding for farm-based tourism projects which utilise existing farm buildings is available from Regional Development agencies in the form of redundant building grant.

 The Department introduced livestock movement arrangements for the autumn on 17 September, in consultation with a wide range of interested parties. The scheme rules have been kept under constant review in light of the changing disease situation across the country and are designed to allow the maximum movement compatible with eradicating foot and mouth disease. Detailed information on the autumn movements arrangements have been placed on the DEFRA website http://www.defra.gov.uk/. A movement licence helpline is also available on 01392 314941 and is open from 8:30&#150;17:30 on weekdays and 9:00&#150;13.00 on Saturdays.

 The Department has received a range of representations concerning the operation of the autumn livestock movement arrangements. Advice on licensing arrangements has been made available to farmers through leaflets, the DEFRA website and the movement licence helpline. My noble Friend Lord Whitty sent a detailed letter to all livestock farmers in England and Wales about the arrangements on 11 September. We have consulted regularly with stakeholders ever since the licensing

<a name="11112w27.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she plans to propose amendments to the Animal Health Act 1981 to give the Government powers to seize and destroy any animal; what right of appeal will be proposed; and what assessment she has made of compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998.  [13846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Animal Health Bill currently before Parliament does not give Ministers power to seize and destroy any animal. It provides for the Minister to cause animals to be slaughtered with a view to preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD). The term "animal" is defined in the 1981 Act and the Foot and Mouth Disease Order and the definition of animals for these purposes is restricted to FMD-susceptible animals.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para1">In addition, the Bill contains provisions to extend such powers to other diseases, by Affirmative Resolution Order.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para2">The two avenues of appeal against slaughter that are currently available remain unaffected. These are the ability to ask the local Divisional Veterinary Manager to review the case and to seek judicial review.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para3">Under the scrapie provisions, the Bill provides for Ministers to issue restriction notices requiring that genetically susceptible sheep should be either castrated 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 2001 : Column: 597W</I><P>
(or sterilised) or slaughtered by their keepers/owners, and for Ministers to enforce these provision in the event of non-compliance. Appeals against a restriction notice could be made to an independent assessor.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para4">In my view these provisions, and all others in the Bill, are compatible with the convention rights for the purpose of the Human Rights Act 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that once the foot and mouth disease export restrictions have been lifted UK animals exported under licence to France and the Netherlands are not then re-exported to southern European countries.  [13547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2001]:</i> Animals are not exported under licence although there is EU legislation covering the animal health requirements that must be met before animals move within the Community and the veterinary checks that must take place. EU rules governing animal welfare during intra-community trade in cattle, sheep and pigs lay down specific requirements which must be met during any journey. We enforce these rules rigorously within our jurisdiction. When a journey starts in another member state it is the responsibility of the authorities in that member state to ensure compliance with animal health and animal welfare requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make representations to other EU countries to end the payment of export refunds on the export of live cattle from the EU to the middle east and North Africa.  [13550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2001]:</i> Export refunds on live cattle exports to Third Countries are a component of the EU's market management measures for the beef sector. No refunds are paid in respect of trade from the UK because of the BSE-related export ban. Nevertheless, a number of member states, the UK included, wish to address the continuing animal welfare problems with this trade.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para5">We have always maintained the UK's preference for a trade in meat rather than live animals. This view was reflected in the Council Resolution on the protection of animals during transport adopted at the June Council. The Resolution not only invited the Commission to produce recommendations to improve implementation and control of current EU animal welfare legislation, but also to report

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many maximum tolerable daily doses of dioxin, as defined by the WHO, 1.1g represents.  [13439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11112w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In June 2001, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) proposed a provisional tolerable monthly intake of 70 picograms (pg) WHO toxicity equivalents (WHO-TEQ) per kilogram (kg) bodyweight for "dioxins" (that is polychlorinated dibenzo-p-doxins, polyclorinated dibenzofurans, and dioxin-like polychlorinated bephenyls). For an adult weighing 70 kilograms, this corresponds to a tolerable daily intake of approximately 160 pg. 1.1 g is 6,875 million times 160 pg.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para6">The 1.1 g figure which I quoted in my earlier response (23 October 2001) represents the emissions of dioxins and furans from municipal solid waste incinerators during 2000. This figure does not refer to human intake so it is not appropriate to make such a comparison with the TDI.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para7">The most recent (1997) estimate of average daily intakes for adults in the UK is 1.8 pg WHO-TEQ per kilogram bodyweight, which (for an adult weighing 70 kg) corresponds to an average daily intake of approximately 130 pg.
<P>

<a name="11112w27.html_para8">The Government believe there is a strong case for reducing emissions to the environment further, and my Department will shortly be consulting on measures to achieve this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of the future viability of local authorities' tenanted farms.  [12807]<P>

<a name="11112w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The 47th Annual Report to Parliament on Smallholdings in England was published in 1999. This report which is available in the Library of the House, covered the period to 31 March 1997. This showed that the total expenditure in the year to 31 March 1997, by local authorities with smallholdings, was &#163;16.9 million and total income in the same period was &#163;25.3 million. The Department also conducts an annual survey of tenanted land although this does not separately identify local authority tenanted farms.
<P>

<a name="11112w28.html_para1">We have also commissioned work to establish the role local authority tenanted farms play in providing farming lets to new entrants. A preliminary assessment of the impact of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 was conducted by the University of Plymouth in 1997. This indicated that county smallholdings play an important but reducing role in providing farming lets to new entrants. A full policy evaluation of the 1995 Act is currently under way and this explores this area further. This work should be completed in early 2002.
