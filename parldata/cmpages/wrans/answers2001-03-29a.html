<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the North Devon constituency, the effects on North Devon of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [155906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The North Devon constituency falls within the geographical area covered by the Devon and Cornwall Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In November 1999, in line with national policy, CPS Devon and Cornwall, in liaison with the police and the North Devon magistrates court, introduced procedures based on the Narey proposals. All adult defendants charged with a criminal offence in North Devon should make their first appearance before Barnstaple magistrates court within eight days.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para0">A CPS Crown court Unit based in Exeter deals with serious crime at Exeter and Barnstaple Crown courts. The CPS has set as a goal the better handling of serious cases in the interests of justice and the victims. From 15 January 2001, a fast-track procedure was adopted which will ensure that offences, which must be heard in the Crown court, normally come before a judge within eight clear days of their first hearing in the magistrates court.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para1">The CPS together with other agencies has been working to speed up youth justice, particularly Persistent Youth Offenders. The time taken for Persistent Youth Cases has fallen in the CPS Devon and Cornwall Area from 141 days in 1997 to 60 days in 2000. This places Devon and Cornwall at the top of the national league.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para2">All these changes illustrate the government's successful policy of speeding up the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para3">On 30 November 2000, the Exeter office of CPS Devon and Cornwall altered its structure so as to fall in line with proposals in the Glidewell Review. This represents a policy of more effective working between the police and prosecutors and will enable the CPS to place greater emphasis on the more serious criminal cases.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para4">Action and policies of the Treasury Solicitor's Department and the Serious Fraud Office do not directly affect the hon. Member's constituency.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> As a non-departmental public body, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) will release to the Public Records Office papers across the spectrum of the Millennium Experience project that are potentially of historic interest or significance. Other papers will be passed to my Department for archiving. NMEC's arrangements regarding the PRO and the Department have been informed by discussions between NMEC and my Department to ensure that public sector archiving guidelines and requirements are followed, and that they have due regard to NMEC's status as a Companies Acts company.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on how many occasions directors of insolvent companies have been disqualified under section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986; and what this is as a percentage of the total number of directors.  [156006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As at 28 February 2001 there had been a total of 9,734 directors disqualified since 1986 when the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 commenced. A further 1,721 cases are awaiting a court hearing of which 90 per cent. are expected to result in disqualification orders. The exact total numbers of directors returned as serving in office at any given time is not available (because, for example, some individuals hold more than one directorship) but an approximate number is 3.6 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has no plans to increase regulation specifically for small building contractors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he will announce his decision on AMEC Border Wind's proposal to build a windfarm at Humble Hill, Kielder, Northumberland.  [156637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I have today, reluctantly, decided that consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to AMEC Border Wind's application to build a 80 MW windfarm at Humber Hill, Kielder, Northumberland cannot be given. However keen the Government are to see new wind projects, we are not in the business of taking risks with aircrew lives.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para6">My decision was taken only after extensive discussions over a period of years to try to resolve the difficulties.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para7">Despite these protracted discussions and the willingness of everyone to try to reach agreement and enable the windfarm to proceed, the underlying concern of the Ministry of Defence could not be removed. That concern rested on the effect the proposed windfarm would have on the operation at the Spadeadam Electronic Warfare Tactics Range (EWTR).
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para8">The EWTR lies to the south of the site of the proposed windfarm and aircraft approaching it would have had to fly over the windfarm. There is no other route and the proposed windfarm would interfere with radar and with low flying, particularly at times of poor visibility.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para9">The MOD informed me that facilities at the EWTR are unique, as there is no other site like this in Europe, so it is imperative for the front line training of RAF crews and therefore the tactical training value of the range must be safeguarded. Safety is of paramount importance. DTI and MOD are working closely together to find solutions to the problem of developing commercial windfarms, both onshore and offshore, while preserving the UK's defence interests.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para10">This decision was due to the unique local circumstances and is not a general precedent. Our policy remains that each application will be considered on its merits, but in doing so it is quite right that we should look carefully at concerns over a particular siting. It also remains our intention that 10 per cent. of our electricity supply should be generated by renewable resources by 2010.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para11">Copies of the Press Notice and the decision letter are being places in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress the steering group on electricity security and stability issues has made in following up the recommendations made by the consultants Merz and McLellan in the White Paper "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation" and the Government response to the fourth and fifth reports of the Trade and Industry Committee, Cm 4071.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The steering group, chaired by my Department, published its final report today. The conclusions take into account the responses to a consultation paper issued by the group in April 2000, which set out their initial conclusions. The group concluded that the further work recommended by Merz and McLellan or raised in the responses to the consultation exercise has been undertaken or is in hand. In the responses to the consultation document, there was general agreement with the steering group's recommendation that following the introduction of New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA), the Regulator--the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem)--should keep under review system security to ensure that the electricity and gas systems remain robust, that roles and operational responsibilities are clearly identified, and that adequate emergency procedures are in place. Further work will therefore be taken forward by Ofgem in consultation with interested parties. The group's report also addresses the detailed points raised during the consultation exercise.
<P>

<a name="10329w01.html_para12">Copies of the report are being circulated, in the first instance, to all those who responded to the consultation document. I am placing copies in the Libraries of the House. The document, and the earlier consultation paper, are available on the DTI website at http://www.dti.gov.uk/ energy/ and on request from Natalia Davie, NEP, DTI, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET (Phone: 0207 215 6488).

<P>
<a name="10329w02.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how his Department ensures that investments made by UK companies overseas are in projects that comply with the international human rights commitments to which the Government are a signatory.  [155138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Advice on the prevailing market conditions is made available to UK companies on request. This reflects the Government's position on human rights elements, for example on the desirability of trade with certain countries. It is however for UK companies to judge whether to bid for projects or invest in particular markets.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para0">More generally, the Government have sought to raise the profile of human rights considerations in the operations of companies overseas, for example in promoting the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he will publish the draft Export Control and Non-Proliferation Bill.  [156094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am today publishing for consultation the draft Export Control and Non-Proliferation Bill. Copies of the "Consultation on Draft Legislation: the Export Control and Non-Proliferation Bill" (CM5091) will be laid before the House and will be available at the Vote Office. Copies will also be available from the Stationery Office and on my Department's website.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para1">The draft Bill replaces in full the export control powers in the Import, Export and Customs (Powers) Defence Act 1939. Export controls currently imposed under the 1939 Act include both strategic export controls which are the responsibility of my Department and export controls on cultural objects which are the responsibility of the 



<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2001 : Column: 719W</I><P>
Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Bill is intended both to provide for improved accountability for and transparency in export controls and to provide a more up-to-date and comprehensive legislative framework for export controls.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para2">The draft Bill establishes the purposes for which export controls can be imposed and will provide for parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation made under it. These measures will meet recommendations made by Sir Richard Scott in his report of the Inquiry into the Export of Defence Equipment and Dual-Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions. The Bill also provides for annual reports to be laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para3">The draft Bill provides Government with new powers to impose controls on the transfer of military and dual-use technology by intangible means and the provisions of related technical assistance, and on activities connected with international trade (usually referred to as trafficking and brokering) between overseas countries in military or dual-use equipment.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para4">The Introduction to the Bill in Part I of the "Consultation on draft legislation" sets out the controls which the Government propose to introduce in secondary legislation to be made under these new powers. These are as follows:
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Controls on the electronic transfer of military technology in line with similar controls already used for dual-use technology in the new European Dual-Use Items Regulation which came into force in September 2000.

<a name="10329w02.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Controls on the transfer of technology by any intangible means and the provision of technical services intended for weapons of mass destruction and related missile programmes. These controls will meet the requirements of a European Union Joint Action agreed in June 2000.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10329w02.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Controls on the trafficking and brokering of weapons and related equipment to any destination. In addition controls will be introduced which will be used to prohibit trafficking and brokering to embargoed destinations and trafficking and brokering in types of equipment whose export we have already banned because of evidence of their use in torture.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10329w02.html_para8">The Bill will also allow for the imposition of export licensing procedures and includes a power to require the provision of certain information which is intended primarily to ensure that the Government can meet their reporting obligations to international bodies, such as the UN Conventional Arms Register. The Bill allows for the maximum penalty for offences in respect of matters controlled under the powers in the Bill to be raised from the current maximum level of seven years' imprisonment to a maximum of 10 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what response the Government are making to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan; and if she will make a statement.  [156479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w02.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Afghanistan is currently suffering from its worst drought in 30 years. This, combined with continuing conflict and the absence of significant economic recovery, has led to dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation. The UN indicates that about 12 million people (over half the country's population) have been affected by the drought; 3 to 4 million of them seriously. One million people are thought to be at risk of famine. Neighbouring countries are becoming increasingly unreceptive to population flows from Afghanistan and there have been reports of border closures over recent months.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para10">We have continued to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan where this can be done effectively. This financial year, we have provided some &#163;10.5 million through UN agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs. As well as drought relief assistance, this includes a longer-term programme of humanitarian assistance to the Afghan population, both in Afghanistan itself and to Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran. We intend to continue with this programme in the coming year, and stand ready to respond to additional needs as required.
<P>

<a name="10329w02.html_para11">We have also reviewed our policy of not financing NGO activities that involved UK nationals, because of the personal security risks. There have been no serious security incidents involving expatriates for some time. With this in mind, we have decided to consider funding on a case by case basis for NGOs that send UK nationals into the country. As before, the appraisal proposals will continue to include an assessment of the agency's personnel security arrangements. Only if these arrangements are judged to be appropriate would the agency be eligible for funding.

The Mine Information Training Centre (MITC) at Minley has provided mine awareness training to over 30,000 people. The MOD has also continued to monitor minefields in the Falkland Islands.

 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2001]:</i> The statistical bulletin for the September 2000 figures was reissued on 16 January 2001 as a result of receiving revised police strength figures from the Metropolitan police. There have been three other publications where corrections to the figures for earlier periods have been made in the light of revised figures submitted by the police: figures for March 1998 were corrected in the statistical bulletin number 14/99, published on 26 August 1999, entitled "Police Service Personnel England and Wales, as at 31 March 1999", after Sussex corrected their data for that year. Revised figures for March 2000 were included in both the original and revised bulletins for September 2000, after the number of secondments to central services were corrected when double counting was discovered. This originated from the National Criminal Intelligence Service return being completed incorrectly. The revised bulletin for September 2000 was entitled "Police Service Strength England and Wales", published on 16 January 2001, and was statistical bulletin number 2/01. Figures for September 2000 had to be adjusted when the Metropolitan police reported that officers on loan to adjacent forces had been deducted from their figures twice. They also provided revised figures for ethnic minority officers. A revised bulletin for September 2000 was issued, with details as given in (2).
<P>

<a name="10329w03.html_para1">The forthcoming bulletin to be published in June will contain revised Northumbria strength figures for 30 September 2000 that became apparent during the preparation of the 30 January 2001 figures. It should be noted that it is a standard practice to include corrections in statistical publications when improved data are provided by data sources. Indeed, this practice is quite commonplace, although the corrections are minor in the vast majority of cases.

 Discretionary lifers, particularly those set a short tariff by the trial judge, are transferred from a local prison to a first stage lifer prison as soon as possible after sentencing (tariff being the minimum period the lifer is required to serve to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence). In order to enhance the working of the current system, the Government are investing an extra &#163;500,000 in the next financial year to fund work in local prisons with new and potential lifers. This will enable speedier assessment and identification of the risk factors which lifers need to address.
<P>

<a name="10329w03.html_para4">In addition, the Government are providing funding for nearly 800 extra lifer places, together with additional resources to increase the number of places available on the sex offender treatment programme. The Prison Service is also to introduce a simpler and more streamlined planning system for all life sentence prisoners which should ensure greater consistency of approach and improve the management of risk assessment and risk reduction as a lifer progresses through the system.
<P>

<a name="10329w03.html_para5">The Prison Service fully recognises the need to give particular priority to the needs of short tariff lifers. The aim is to manage the system so that the Parole Board can release such lifers on or near tariff expiry where it is satisfied that their risk factors have been addressed and release is consistent with the overriding need to protect the public.

 A non-compliance refusal is generated when the applicant fails without reasonable explanation to make a prompt and full disclosure of material facts either orally, or in writing or otherwise to assist the Secretary of State to the full in establishing the facts of the asylum case, for example not attending an interview, and any information provided does not establish that the applicant is not a refugee. In these circumstances the application falls to be refused under paragraphs 340 and 336 of HC 395 (as amended).

<a name="10329w04.html_para0">The higher rate is paid only if there is a need to seek, obtain and pay for accommodation. It is only paid to prisoners with no accommodation arranged in advance, if this arises through no fault of the prisoner. Except those being deported or removed under Immigration Act 1988 powers, discharged prisoners receive payment or a travel warrant for their journey home. If they have not received a discharge grant, they may be given an appropriate subsistence allowance for their journey. Prisoners who do not have their own clothing may receive appropriate clothing on release.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para1">Discharged prisoners are generally treated in the same way as any other claimants for social security payments and must satisfy the eligibility criteria for each benefit claimed. The available benefits include Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), Income Support, Housing Benefit and crisis loans and community care grants from the Social Fund. Exceptionally, the JSA regulations contain specific provisions for those released from detention. They may be treated as available for work for a period of seven days commencing with the date of their release. They may also be treated as actively seeking employment for the first full week of their JSA claim if they have been treated as available for work for part of that week.

<a name="10329w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Fire Brigade command course sets out the requirements for brigade commanders, including planning and directing responses to major emergencies. Underpinning competences which are developed are the qualities of leadership, interpersonal skill, analytical processing and dynamism. The competences trained for include: decision making involving longer term contingency planning; decision making after call-out and before arrival at a major incident; decision making on arrival, taking over command and the handing over process; and post-incident longer term decisions.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para2">Current Fire Service training on major emergencies is based on guidance prepared by the Government's Civil Emergencies Adviser and is comparable with that of the other emergency services. National occupational standards for operational command, which will include response to major emergencies, are in an advanced state of development.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para3">Occupational standards for the police service will be set by the Police National Training Organisation (NTO) once that is established. The Police NTO received recognition from the Department for Education and Employment earlier this month and is due to be incorporated in May 2001. In the meantime work is being done on the development of competences for various roles, including the management of major incidents. Police National Training provide training in the management of disasters and civil emergencies which can be taken either separately or as part of the strategic command course, which must be undertaken by officers who wish to seek appointment to the rank of assistant chief constable or commander.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to change the procedures for dealing with applications for British citizenship.  [156549]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 During April 2001, the Integrated Casework Directorate (ICD) of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) will devote some of its resources to starting applications for British citizenship on receipt. All cases, at both ends of the queue for consideration, will be considered using new procedures and working practices. New applicants will be asked to supply supporting documentation at the time of application and to respond more quickly to requests for further information than has previously been the case. The aim of these changes is to eliminate the current backlog of nationality applications by attacking it from both ends. This approach has been successfully used elsewhere in IND, for example in the production of travel documents.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para4">ICD will have achieved its target of 91,000 decisions by the end of March 2001, which is more than twice the total for 1997. By the end of February 2001, the average waiting time for all types of citizenship applications had fallen to exactly 12 months, as compared with nearly 20 months at the same time last year. These improvements flow from significantly increased investment in the system and the new service delivery culture now becoming established in the ICD.




<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2001 : Column: 730W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para5">Because of these improvements ICD is now in a position to deal with the remaining backlog of work from both ends, cutting out unnecessary handling. This approach has proven very successful in other parts of IND's work. More resources will continue to be devoted to those applications that have been waiting longest, but the ICD's intention is to reduce the waiting time for all applications to an average of six months by April 2002 and to three months by April 2004.

 On 2 April 2001 the Warship Support Agency (WSA) will be established as a Defence Agency through the merger of the Ships Support Agency (SSA) and the majority of the Naval Bases and Supply Agency (NBSA).

The WSA's first Chief Executive (CE) will be Mr. John Coles, currently CE SSA, who will initially be located at Foxhill, Bath together with the WSA Corporate Directors. The WSA Agency will employ some 9,000 civilian and 3,500 military staff at various other locations throughout the United Kingdom, including Bath and Bristol, HM Naval Bases Clyde, Devonport and Portsmouth, and HM Mooring and Marine Salvage Depot, Pembroke Dock.

<P>
<a name="10329w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce that the competitions for these two important new sonar systems have now been completed and that Thomson Marconi Sonar Ltd. (TMSL) has been selected as prime contractor for both. We intend to be in a position to place contracts for the sonars in April.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para9">Sonar 2087 will provide our Type 23 anti-submarine warfare frigates with the ability to detect, classify and track submarines beyond the submarine's ability to engage forces under protection. This advanced system will assure our detection advantage against modern nuclear and conventionally powered submarines. Following trials of the initial ship system, it will enter service in 2006.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para10">Sonar 2193 has been designed to replace the existing Sonar 193M mine-hunting sonar in our Hunt class mine counter-measures vessels. This new system will maintain the effectiveness of our forces in this increasingly important area. The first equipment will be installed in a trials vessel next year and the system will enter service in early 2004.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para11">At the same time, we are taking the opportunity to replace the Command System in the Hunt Class. The new system will be developed from the NAUTIS system which is already fitted in our Sandown class ships.
<P>

<a name="10329w04.html_para12">These orders will safeguard jobs at Thomson Marconi's sites at Cheadle Heath in Cheshire and at Templecombe in Somerset, as well as at a number of sub-contractor sites around the UK. The work will maintain UK industry's capabilities in this important technological area and, for the mine-hunting sonar, could lead to considerable export opportunities.

UK service personnel who are deployed to the Gulf have for some time been given free access to the US forces' own e-mail system, as a goodwill gesture. There is no information available to indicate when the US system was first deployed. Limited e-mail facilities were introduced in the Balkans in February 1999, and extended theatre-wide in November 2000, on completion of a programme of communication network infrastructure improvements. An e-mail facility was introduced in February 2001 for personnel deployed to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The system will be extended to all personnel in theatre in April 2001, with the deployment of an additional satellite terminal.

The annual cost of the e-bluey facility is &#163;1.39 million and forecast to rise to &#163;2.19 million from April. Information on the annual running costs of the e-mail facilities could be provided only at disproportionate cost, because call charges for this are contained in the telephone bills for each of the operational theatres.

 <i>[holding answer 28 March 2001]:</i> Previously, operational welfare support has been provided only to personnel who are deployed overseas on operations under the command of PJHQ. As of 1 April, however, such welfare provision will be extended to include personnel on maritime deployments that are expected to be away from the UK for two months or more and, also, other exercise deployments that are expected to last for two months or more outside the country in which the personnel are based. This will result in improvements to, among other things, the provision of shower and laundry facilities.

<a name="10329w05.html_para3">Currently, not all personnel deployed on operations have access to hot shower facilities. At Ali Al Salam, in Kuwait, the reliability and quality of the facilities is poor and the Ministry of Defence is currently addressing this problem. Also, Short-Term Training Team personnel in Sierra Leone do not have hot water shower facilities; they do, however, have access to cold water showers, which is regarded as satisfactory in view of the climate. All current operational deployments have access to laundry facilities.
<P>

<a name="10329w05.html_para4">Information on the availability of hot shower and laundry facilities during exercises is not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. We are, however, conscious of the fact that there have been significant shortfalls in this area and have therefore provided additional funding within the new Operational Welfare Package, amounting to more than &#163;6 million over the next four years, specifically to redress the problem. We expect future shower and laundry facilities to be incorporated in the Expeditionary Campaign Infrastructure Procurement programme, due in Service in 2004. It is expected that they will be cabin-based, similar to those procured under the Improved Tented Camp urgent operational requirement for Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="10329w05.html_para5">The senior deployed logistics officer is responsible for ensuring that hot shower and laundry facilities are provided. The one exception to this is that UK Service personnel deployed on UN operations are administered under UN arrangements.

 My Department sponsors the Energy Saving Trust's "Powershift" programme, providing financial support and other measures to encourage the purchase of new gas and electric vehicles. Powershift has been running since 1996, and my Department is today launching a consultation on proposals for the future direction of the programme, aimed at getting the greatest environmental and health benefits and encouraging the wider uptake of cleaner fuel vehicles in the cities and towns which have the biggest air quality challenges. The consultation document describes new initiatives designed to promote more use of natural gas for heavy public service and delivery lorries, which are cleaner and much quieter than diesel engines; and to encourage more use of electric vehicles, which have zero tailpipe emissions.

<a name="10329w06.html_para0">Powershift, dealing with new vehicles, is complemented by the Clean Up programme, which provides grants towards existing vehicles being fitted with pollution control measures.

The Agency allocates its resources on the basis of need and in accordance with the objectives laid down in our Business Plan as agreed with Ministers. I regret that since information is not held by the Agency in a format that allows comparison with other estuarial ports and cities of similar size to Hull, I am not able to supply this.
<BR>
As to the future, the Agency's recently produced Business Plan for 2001/02 places a continuing emphasis on maintenance with an increase in resources over the next 3 years. Also, construction will shortly begin on the Hedon Road Improvement at an estimated cost of &#163;53m. Construction will take place over a 2&#189; year period.

In addition to this, work is underway on the Hull East-West Corridor Multi-Modal Study. Led by the Government Office Yorkshire and Humberside the study will develop a sustainable and

 My Department is not responsible for roads other than those in England. We have not surveyed English roads for which the Secretary of State is not the highway authority, as these are the responsibility of local government. The Highways Agency carries out regular inspections of the condition of traffic signs on trunk roads and trunk road motorways, in accordance with the departmental standard for sign maintenance, which has recently been updated. The new standard is based more on the actual visual performance and effectiveness of the signs than the previous version, and is less reliant on subjective judgments.

I am satisfied that the present voluntary approach whereby taxi drivers have the choice of asking passengers not to smoke for the most part works satisfactorily and accordingly should continue.

<P>

<a name="10329w07.html_para11">The proposals are designed to encourage innovative partnerships with the private, voluntary and public sectors under Best Value and ultimately the delivery of better local services for all. They will give councils a toolkit of partnership powers to use in the pursuit of Best Value service delivery.
<P>

<a name="10329w07.html_para12">To encourage joint working, the new powers will allow councils to provide grants, loans and guarantees, and to second or loan staff to and from anyone in the public, private and voluntary sectors in the pursuit of Best Value public services. The proposed new powers will allow councils to pool budgets and take the lead role in commissioning goods and service.
<P>

<a name="10329w07.html_para13">The proposals will also provide council with a general power to form and participate in corporate bodies and to allow delegation of their functions to council-controlled companies.

<P>

<a name="10329w07.html_para14">In the case of waste management, these new powers will remove the current requirements which force councils to either divest to the private sector or transfer to "arms' length" the agency that provides this service. Councils will be allowed to determine whatever method of service delivery provides Best Value, including keeping those services in-house.
<P>

<a name="10329w07.html_para15">The closing date for comments on the consultation exercise is 25 May 2001. It is intended that Draft Orders will be laid before Parliament following the conclusion of the consultation exercise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what advice the High Commission in Belize has given to British businesses there as to the legality of their use of call-back services when telephoning the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [155056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The High Commission has not been asked by British business to advise on the legality of using call-back services when telephoning the UK.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations the UK authorities have made to the Chairman of Belize Telecoms about his threat to withdraw telephone services from the British High Commission and others in Belize; what has been his response; and if he will make a statement.  [155059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The High Commissioner in Belmopan has been in correspondence with the Chairman of Belize Telecommunications Ltd. and has pointed out that it would constitute an unlawful act if BTL were to cease to provide telephone services to the High Commission because of the disagreement about the legality of the High Commission's use of call-back services. The Belizean Government would be obliged under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to ensure that normal service is resumed if the High Commission's telephone services were cut off in these circumstances.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para0">The Chairman of BTL has responded reiterating BTL's claim that the use of call-back services is illegal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what contact there has been between Interoute (UK) Ltd. and the UK authorities about its right to offer its commercial services to clients and potential clients in Belize; and if he will make a statement.  [155058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 None directly. In October 2000, Interoute sent a promotional leaflet to the High Commission in Belmopan. The High Commission circulated it as part of its normal activities in support of UK business, and informed Interoute of this action.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if the dispute between Belize Telecom and the British High Commission in Belize has been resolved; and if he will make a statement.  [155055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 It has not yet been resolved. The British High Commission (BHC) in Belmopan has been in correspondence with the Chairman of Belize Telecommunications Ltd. (BTL). The latest position is that BTL stands by its claim that the use of call-back services by the BHC is illegal. They are insisting that the BHC stop using call-back services and have raised the question of compensation. BTL have claimed that they are not obliged to maintain telephone services to subscribers who use call-back services.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para1">The BHC believed the call-back services represented good value for money. The BHC is clear that the use of call-back services is lawful, and that any action by BTL to terminate its telephone services in these circumstances would itself be unlawful.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what has been the saving to the British High Commission in Belize from its use of call-back services; what has been the cost of its dispute with Belize Telecoms; if this cost is recoverable from the company; and if he will make a statement.  [155060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to his question on 25 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 662W, on the savings issue. We do not hold details of the number of man-hours used to deal with this matter. To date no other costs have been incurred.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para2">We estimate that the cost of the loss of call-back services to the High Commission would be in the region of &#163;10,000 per year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations have been made to the British High Commission in Belize by companies and others seeking to use call-back services when telephoning the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [155057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 A very small number of representations have been received by the High Commission. The High Commission has described its understanding of the situation and has recommended that companies and others take their own legal advice.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what legal proceedings have arisen from the dispute between Belize Telecom and the British High Commission in Belize; and if he will make a statement.  [155054]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps he is taking to reduce crime in Northern Ireland.  [156481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A number of significant steps have recently been taken to reduce crime in Northern Ireland, including my announcements last week of a strategy to tackle organised crime, a small business security grant scheme available from early April, and the introduction of Banknote Watch, an initiative aimed at providing enhanced security for the cash-in-transit industry.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para4">In addition, I have now decided to introduce specific crime reduction targets to address volume crime in Northern Ireland. After careful consideration I have set the following three targets to be achieved over a five year period: a 15 per cent. reduction in domestic burglary; a 10 per cent. reduction in vehicle thefts; and a 10 per cent. reduction in theft from vehicles.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para5">Baselines will be set during 2001-02 and the reductions sought over the following five years. The Government are committed over the same period to achieving a reduction in the rate of increase of overall crime.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para6">These targets are tailored to the specific circumstances of Northern Ireland. Research has indicated that these crimes, which between them account for over 20 per cent. of all recorded crime, are the crimes of greatest concern to the general public.




<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2001 : Column: 749W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para7">These targets will not be for the police alone to deliver. Experience has shown that the most effective way to tackle crime is for agencies to come together in a partnership-based approach. We shall be discussing with the First and Deputy First Ministers how the necessary partnerships might best be delivered.
<P>

<a name="10329w09.html_para8">While Northern Ireland has experienced a relatively low rate of crime compared to other jurisdictions, this initiative demonstrates that the Government are not complacent and that we continue to take the steps necessary to tackle this issue. Crime and the fear of crime affect everyone's quality of life and must be addressed in a robust and effective way.

 A memorial, to be known as the Ash Grove Memorial, has been sited within the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas in Staffordshire.

<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what discussions he has had with the pharmaceutical industry concerning the cost of drugs to <i>(a)</i> consumers and <i>(b)</i> the NHS following the requirement to dispense drugs in blister packs.  [144761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 No medicines are legally required only to be dispensed or sold in blister packs. The type of packaging used for medicines is a commercial decision for the manufacturer concerned, provided the quality and safety of the product are maintained. The Department for Health has frequent discussions with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry and those discussions have on occasions included issues relating to the packaging of medicines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hammond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if value-added tax is chargeable on <i>(a)</i> supplies of recombinant factor VIII for the treatment of haemophiliacs and <i>(b)</i> supplies of conventionally produced factor VIII; what representations he has made to HM Treasury in respect of charging VAT on these substances; on what date he made those representations; and what response he has received.  [146958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Value Added Tax is a matter for Her Majesty's Treasury Ministers. The United Kingdom exempts from VAT whole human blood and components and derivatives of human blood such as human Factor VIII fraction, when used for therapeutic purposes.

<P>
<a name="10329w10.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The chairman of the Food Standards Agency advised my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that the agency did not see an immediate human health risk from the use in animal feed of fish meal and certain animal material. Nor was there a need on purely public health grounds to launch a major recall scheme for feeds containing fish meal and the other material, although their use should be phased out as soon as practicable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assumptions about French BSE controls underlay the advice from the Food Standards Agency on French beef imports.  [144316]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w10.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that its advice on French imports was based on the assumptions given in Dr. Christl Donnelly's study published in "Nature" on 13 December 2000. These were that if the over-30-months (OTM) rule is fully enforced there is virtually no risk from French beef imported to Britain. If the OTM rule is only 75 per cent. enforced then risks posed by British and French meat sold in the United Kingdom would be comparable. The FSA estimates that enforcement levels in the UK are above 75 per cent. This allows for the fact that there may have been under-reporting of BSE cases in France and that the French feed ban may not have been fully effective until late 2000.
<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_para2">Inspection missions to member states are carried out by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO). An additional programme of urgent FVO missions is currently under way to all member states. France was visited in the week beginning 4 December 2000. The report of the mission will be published in due course in line with normal practice.
<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_para3">In advising on the safety of French beef imports, the FSA has made clear that it keeps the position under constant review, taking account of the latest available scientific and other information. This will include the outcome of the FVO inspection mission to France once it is available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of imported cattle carcases are individually checked for specified risk material contamination.  [147857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w10.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Imported cattle carcases are generally checked for the presence of specified risk material (SRM) on a targeted basis. Imports from other parts of the European Union (EU) are checked by the Meat Hygiene Service at licensed meat plants in Great Britain, or by local authorities at other meat plants. Imports from non-EU countries are checked at border inspection posts, where checks in all cases are made of the accompanying veterinary certificate (declaring that SRM has been removed) and where a sample of consignments are in addition subject to physical checks. Only imports from Australia and New Zealand are exempt from these requirements under the Specified Risk Materials Order 1997.
<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_para4">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has advised that the checks should be proportionate to the risk. Recently, and as a response to the identification of SRM in imported beef from Germany and the Netherlands, the MHS has been instructed by the FSA to check 100 per cent. of carcase beef imports from Germany at GB meat plants. The MHS has also been required to give special attention to imports from abattoirs in other countries from which previous consignments of beef with SRM attached were imported.
<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_para5">The FSA has also instructed the MHS to step up the level of checks on imported meat, in recognition of the likely increase in the volume of imports, due to the effects of the foot and mouth disease crisis on domestic supplies.

 The Government are advised on matters of food safety by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_para6">Controls on specified risk materials (SRM), such as spinal cord, are a crucial part of the protection of United Kingdom consumers against BSE, and the UK has had rules requiring the removal and safe disposal of SRM for several years. New, harmonised European-wide SRM controls were introduced with effect from 1 October 2000. Responsibility for ensuring that SRM controls are being enforced by all member states lies with the European Commission, which is currently carrying out inspection missions to all member states to check on this.
<P>

<a name="10329w10.html_para7">Where consignments of beef imported into the UK have been found with SRM attached, the issue has been taken up vigorously with the European Commission, and with the authorities of the member states involved--Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The FSA policy is to press for plant closures if evidence suggests that there is a system failure. It is for the national authorities to review the inspection systems at the abattoirs concerned, and three abattoirs, two in Germany and one in the Netherlands, have had their operating licences suspended by their relevant authorities until they can guarantee that no more contaminated meat will come into circulation on the market. The FSA has also instructed the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) (and its counterpart in Northern Ireland) to inspect every consignment of carcase beef imported from Germany to licensed meat plants in the UK, and all consignments from the other overseas abattoirs concerned. Reports from the MHS show that the large majority of consignments of imported beef have had the SRM properly removed. In addition, local authorities have been advised to check all consignment of imported carcase beef from Germany at meat plants under their supervision.

(United Kingdom childhood cancer study) the higher levels of magnetic fields are not attributable solely to proximity to power lines.

<a name="10329w12.html_para4">No such proposal has yet been made by the EC, although an EC working document, made available by the FSA to interested organisations earlier this year, sets out some initial ideas on what might form the main elements of a future risk-based meat inspection system. Any legislative proposals that flow from this working document would be subject to formal public consultation in the United Kingdom, negotiations with and agreement by the member states, and both EU and UK Parliamentary scrutiny, before any changes could come into force.

 A number of LEAs are currently reviewing their special needs provision. The prime aim of these reorganisations is to enhance and improve existing provision for all pupils with special educational needs. Many of these reviews will cover provision for children in mainstream schools, special units attached to mainstream schools and special schools. The overall population of pupils in special schools fell from 1.3 per cent. in 1991 to 1.2 per cent. in 1995 but has remained constant in the past six years with roughly 97,000 pupils. We do not envisage that this will change dramatically. The Department is aware that the following LEAs are currently reviewing their special school provision:

 <i>[holding answer 28 March 2001]:</i> From April work-based learning for adults, which is a programme designed to help unemployed people into work by equipping them with appropriate skills, becomes the responsibility of the Employment Service (ES). This transfer of responsibility will help achieve greater integration with the rest of the Welfare-to-Work agenda, and particularly the New Deal. The role of the ES will include contracting for, monitoring and evaluating the programme.
<P>

<a name="10329w13.html_para1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) will become fully operational from 2 April 2001. It will be responsible for planning, funding and improving the quality of all post-16 learning up to university level, focusing particularly on providing the skills needed in the labour market. The LSC and the Employment Service will work together at national and local levels to plan provision for unemployed people to get the skills and qualifications they need to find and stay in work. The ES and LSC will share a common approach on such issues as the quality framework and inspection which will help reduce the burdens on training providers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the North Devon constituency, the effects on North Devon of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [155900]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10329w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department's policies and initiatives have made a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of: eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10; promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need; and, combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and tomorrow's pensioners.
<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para3">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than constituency level data, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in North Devon since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para4">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para5">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about seven million families receive Child Benefit, and in North Devon 10,387 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para6">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in North Devon the number has reduced from 2,000 to 1,600. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally and in North Devon from 1,300 to 1,200.




<P>
<P><I>29 Mar 2001 : Column: 774W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para7">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 22,300 older people in North Devon have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.
<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para8">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 21,800 pensioners in North Devon will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State Pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s of whom we estimate there are about 9,700 in North Devon. 2,900 pensioner families in North Devon are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10329w16.html_para9">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of stakeholder pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the state second pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

Since taking up post as Chief Executive in 1999, initially of the Independent Tribunal Service and now of the Appeals Service, I have been fully committed to improving the services that we offer to appellants and others who use or rely upon our services. I have set about this systematically, in three ways:
<BR>
(i) The backlog of oldest cases I inherited has been tackled and largely cleared. At the end of February 1999, over half--some 77,000 appeals--of our outstanding appeals load were over six months old and many of them considerably older. Priority was given to clearing these appeals on the basis that all appeals were--and still are--dealt with on the basis of "First In, First Out", with staff and tribunal members alike seeing wherever possible to clear the oldest cases first. Of that original 77,000 just over 800 remain and these are almost entirely appeals awaiting decisions from higher courts on lead cases, the outcome of which will have a direct bearing on the outstanding appeals.
<BR>
(ii) At the same time and for newer appeals, we have sought to reduce both the waiting times that appellants have to wait to have their appeal heard and, where cases are adjourned by tribunals, the length of time they remain outstanding. These measures are now reflected in the targets the Secretary of State has set for the Appeals Service Agency and performance will be reported in the Agency's Annual Report. Currently, the national average waiting time for appellants is 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>29 Mar 2001 : Column: 776W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>13.7 weeks and some 23 per cent. of our outstanding appeals are over six months old, of which 7,600 appeals cannot proceed until lead cases with higher counts are decided. The current number of appeals outstanding and sitting with the Appeals Service is some 77,600. This progress reflects improvements in delivery of our services in all regions although the extent of the gains varies. Particular attention is now being paid to reducing variations in performance aimed at bringing performance everywhere up to the standards of the best of our offices and we have strengthened our direct service delivery teams accordingly.
<BR>
(iii) To secure these gains, the Appeals Service has had to become a learning organisation. We have secured Investors in People accreditation and place great importance on practical training programmes designed to improve service delivery. We use the European Foundation for Quality Management's Excellence Model to identify internally areas for improvement; we have run customer and staff surveys to tell us where those who use or operate our services believe improvements can best be made; and we make use of direct feedback from individual appellants, their representatives, Members of Parliament or the Ombudsman.
<BR>
Improvements are being made and will continue to be so.
<BR>
I hope this information is helpful.

Amending regulations to achieve this will be laid before the House shortly.

 Local authorities' expenditure on flood defence falls into three categories: the levy they pay to the Environment Agency, special levies paid to internal drainage boards, and the local authority's own expenditure on flood defence works. Government support for local authority expenditure on flood defence is allocated through the flood defence standard spending assessment (SSA), and distributed as revenue support grant (RSG). RSG is not ring-fenced, as it is one of the key principles of the local government finance systems that local authorities should be able to decide how to allocate their own, and their own taxpayers', money, taking account of statutory requirements and local circumstances. These decisions will reflect each authority's policies for which it is accountable

to local people. The SSAs for the local authorities and years specified, is set out in a table which is available in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="10329w18.html_para9">The Ministry provides grants (and Supplementary Credit Approvals to local authorities) rather than compensation to the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards for flood defence capital works that meet economic, technical and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. Responsibility for decisions on which works to promote and their timing rests with those operating authorities. Information on specific Ministry flood defence grants is not readily available in the form requested and could be produced only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="10329w18.html_para10">Many local authorities incurred costs in responding to flood emergencies in 2000. Eligible costs may be refunded by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions under a Bellwin scheme.

<P>

<a name="10329w19.html_para0">The strategies represent an important step towards achieving the Government's target that all services should be available online by 2005.

<P>

<a name="10329w19.html_para1">The Government's objective, though, is to do more than put individual services online, important though that is. It is to transform the delivery of Government services, so that they are based on customer needs rather than the structures of government. The departmental e-business strategies represent the first step towards that larger goal, but require further development if that wider objective is to be met.
<P>

<a name="10329w19.html_para2">Building on the foundation provided by the initial versions, Departments will therefore develop their strategies to address the major challenges of e-government: working across organisational boundaries to deliver joined-up services; transforming the internal efficiency of government by organising to meet consumer needs not producer preferences; putting e-government at the heart of strategic planning; and developing new partnerships in service delivery.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans the Lord Chancellor has to appoint more women judges.  [155973]<P>

<a name="10329w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor appoints to judicial office on merit from among those who are eligible, suitable and who put themselves forward for appointment. The number of women holding judicial office reflects the number of women practitioners in the legal profession with the appropriate period of experience. In the more senior positions there are now more women judges than every before. As of 31 March 2000, there were 11 women judges in the High Court and above and, of the 12 senior appointments made last year, five were of women. The Lord Chancellor has introduced a number of initiatives to encourage greater numbers to apply for judicial office, and to secure equality of opportunity. For example, he has made information about the appointments procedures widely available; he applies the procedures flexibly in relation to the age and sitting arrangements; he has introduced a work shadowing scheme; and he has reviewed the criteria for appointment. These efforts will continue and be developed with a view to progressive increases in numbers as the pool of suitable candidates grows.
