 My Department continues to give greater priority to prevention, but we also place great emphasis on reducing the personal, social and economic impact of illness and disease caused by HIV/AIDS. The fight against HIV/AIDS has to incorporate effective public health responses that engage in education, prevention, care and support, impact mitigation and related development concurrently. For any of these programmes to be successfully implemented, broad multi-sectoral approaches are crucial.
<P>

<a name="30313w01.html_para0">I have regularly met representatives of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), AstraZeneca and Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries (ABPI), as a result of their involvement in the high level working group on increasing access to essential medicines for AIDS, TB and Malaria.

<a name="30313w01.html_para1">Officials from my Department have been in extensive dialogue with representatives of these companies and MERCK, a member of the US PHARMA industry association, around taking forward the reports' recommendations in a number of initial countries.

 The Declaration of Commitment adopted by 189 delegations at the twenty-sixth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in June 2001 sets out a global consensus on action necessary to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Within this framework, my Department is working in partnership with governments, international agencies, the private sector, NGOs and others to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of combating HIV/AIDS.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on food security in Ethiopia; and what assessment her Department has made of the number of people who have died as a result of food shortages in Ethiopia in the last 12 months.  [102748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The overall response to the humanitarian crisis has so far averted mortality that could be directly attributed to levels of starvation. However, low levels of nutrition predispose people to disease, which can raise mortality rates. For this reason, we are working with the Ethiopian Government and other donors to provide assistance with health, water and sanitation in addition to food.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> performance and <i>(b)</i> future funding of the Global Health Fund.  [102814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The primary role of the fund is to provide drugs and commodities for the prevention and treatment of AIDS, TB and Malaria. Wherever possible the Global Fund should be providing support behind strategies that help deliver sustainable improvements in health care. The fund has strong founding principles in this regard, but performance to date to this end has been mixed.
<P>

<a name="30313w01.html_para3">The UK Government have pledged $200 million over five years to the fund, $80 million of which has been disbursed. In addition we have committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to support the development of health systems in poorer countries. Strengthening such systems is vital if drugs are to be safely and sustainably supplied to the poor. Our future support for the Global Fund will depend on its effectiveness. It is one of several possible instruments designed to improve basic health care in poor countries.

<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, what plans her Department has to increase its funding to the International Organisation for Migration. [101715]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has no current plans to increase funding to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). To date, DFID's funding of IOM has principally been for practical programmes aimed at improving IOM's capacity in the area of emergency response and preparedness. We will continue to consider any proposals put to us in this or other areas of mutual interest such as research in the field of migration and development. In addition, DFID is responsible for paying half of the UK's annual subscription to IOM. This will continue.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the reports of a ceasefire by the Lord's Resistance Army.  [102808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Both Government and Donors have greeted this announcement with cautious optimism. President Museveni has responded by ordering the Ugandan Army to pull back from frontline positions in one area for a period of five days so that religious leaders, traditional leaders, and a Government peace team can hold face-to-face talks with the LRA. It is too early to say what will come out of this process but we are hoping for positive developments so that this terrible conflict might be brought to an end.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of reports by the UN WFP on malnutrition in children in Anaka and Pabbo refugee camps in northern Uganda; and how much aid she is giving in response.  [102809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 An estimated 800,000 people have been displaced by this conflict in northern Uganda. Access to these groups is often difficult due to insecurity, but we are aware that the malnutrition rates in Anaka and Pabbo displaced persons camps are of grave concern. To date DFID has provided &#163;2.5m for humanitarian needs including &#163;1.6m to the World Food Programme for the emergency purchase and distribution of food supplies. This food, along with other donor contributions, is now being distributed in Pabbo and Anaka as well as other camps in northern Uganda. The DFID office in Uganda remains in close touch with agencies working in the area and is continually re-assessing the situation.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations she will make to the Government of Uzbekistan on its human rights record when she chairs the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development meeting in Tashkent.  [102191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The EBRD's new strategy for Uzbekistan clearly states the concerns about the situation in Uzbekistan and the need for progress 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 2003 : Column 356W</I><P>
with economic and political (including human rights) reforms. The strategy also sets out seven key benchmarks for political (including human rights) and economic progress, and states that the bank will monitor progress towards these benchmarks after one year.
<P>

<a name="30313w01.html_para4">At the annual meeting I will seek to ensure these messages are delivered strongly, so as to encourage the Uzbek authorities to undertake essential economic and political reforms, which will enhance the country's economic growth, attract investment and reduce poverty.
<P>

<a name="30313w01.html_para5">Central Asia is a region of desperate poverty, of high levels of debt and corruption, and of deteriorating infrastructure and public services. We hope that the EBRD Annual Meeting will focus international attention on the region, and will provide a forum for a full and open discussion of the need for progress in achieving economic and political transition, tackling poverty, strengthening the investment climate, increasing regional co-operation and improving human rights.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions she has had with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development regarding human rights in Uzbekistan.  [102247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w01.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 EBRD's new two-year strategy for Uzbekistan clearly states the need for improvements in the human rights situation. Encouraging progress with economic and political (including human rights) reform is a central part of the bank's work and the UK Delegation at EBRD has been closely involved in the bank's discussions on Uzbekistan. In addition I have met EBRD's President Lemierre twice in the last six months to discuss the EBRD Annual Meeting, and conditions in Uzbekistan and Central Asia more widely.

<a name="30313w02.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the decision-making process and timescale involved in the proposal to install a double barrier at the level crossing at Beddingham on the A27; what weight is being given to the views of the<i> (a)</i> local county and district councils and <i>(b)</i> the constituency hon. Member; what assessment is being made of the traffic conjunction implications of the proposal; whether the proposal is being considered in conjunction with the separate proposal to construct a flyover over this crossing; and if he will make a statement.  [102819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 An application for an Order has been made under the Level Crossing Act 1983 for a full barrier crossing at Beddingham. In accordance with the legislation the draft Order has been sent to all affected local authorities, including the highways authority. The Secretary of State for Transport will consider all representations made against this draft Order&#151;including the impact on road traffic&#151;before making a decision on the way forward. The consultation period 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 2003 : Column 357W</I><P>
closes on 1 April but the likely timeframe for decisions will be dependent on the level and content of the representations received. Careful consideration will be needed before any final decision on the way forward is made. Decisions related to the long-term future of the crossing will be taken within the context of decisions on the south coast multi-modal study. There is in any case a need to consider the short-term safety issues at Beddingham, which is the purpose of the consultation relating to the draft Order.

 The road safety research programme takes account of research conducted overseas through literature reviews and collaborative projects under the EU Framework programme. Our vehicle standards research feeds into international collaborative agreements where the combined research effort of all participants is used. Every attempt is made not to duplicate research unnecessarily, but the validity of results from research in other countries needs to be assessed to ensure that they are relevant in British road conditions and under our legal and regulatory system. A similar approach is taken in other parts of the Department.

 All ERDP schemes are being promoted both at national and regional level through joint working with partner organisations, at events such as agricultural shows and other public events, news releases and local publicity, and workshops for potential applicants.
<P>

<a name="30313w05.html_para9">In addition, a number of initiatives are in place to encourage uptake of particular ERDP land-based schemes. For example, the opening of the 2003 Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) application window was announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment on 7 November 2002 and applications have been encouraged through advertisements in the national farming press. In order to increase the number of farmers converting to organic production methods, the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) will be relaunched from May 2003 with a new option that allows payments to be made (over a five year agreement) for the management of organically farmed land in an environmentally beneficial way. In addition, steps are under way to improve the take up of the Energy Crops Scheme (ECS), which supports the establishment of short rotation coppice and miscanthus as renewable energy sources. The Government have allocated &#163;66 million to the development of end markets for such crops, and &#163;3.5 million for improvements to the fuels supply infrastructure. We will also be reviewing the rules in respect of the co-firing of energy crops with coal.
<P>

<a name="30313w05.html_para10">The payment of some claims has recently been delayed due to the need under EU regulations to cross-check land-based scheme agreements against the IACS database. Steps have now been taken to speed up the processing of applications and payments through the streamlining of administrative procedures. In addition, a simplified claim form for CSS payments was introduced last year, to significantly ease the burden on beneficiaries. Also, to allow more time for the preparation of CSS applications, the application window has been opened two months earlier than in previous years. Over the longer term, major reviews of both the agri-environment and forestry schemes are considering ways of rationalising and simplifying existing arrangements. To this end a pilot of the Entry Level Scheme, which is designed to encourage a large number of farmers across a wide area of farmland to deliver simple yet effective environmental management on their farms, was launched on 27 February. Together with the introduction of new IT systems in Defra, the Rural Payments Agency and the Forestry Commission, these developments should lead to significant improvements in the speed and efficiency of land-based scheme administration.

 The Forestry Commission operates a sponsorship scheme by which bodies with environmental responsibilities or interests and local communities may be given a preferential opportunity to acquire surplus property which has been identified for sale and which has either a recreational, conservation or amenity interest or is of interest to a local community for their social and economic development.
<P>

<a name="30313w06.html_para1">Communities may purchase such surplus on condition that they gain sponsorship from the relevant Government Department or Agency. The sponsorship is, in effect, a statement from the Department or Agency certifying that a sale direct to the community would be more in the public interest than selling the land on the open market. The District Valuer determines the sale price.
<P>

<a name="30313w06.html_para2">There is no specific policy in respect of sales of land to Smallholding Farmers. However, the Commission usually sells surplus agricultural land on the open market. Where the land is tenanted, the farmer would be given a prior opportunity to purchase.

 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2003]:</i> The Government are already voluntarily contributing nearly &#163;30 million annually for the collection and disposal of fallen stock for TSE testing purposes. The Government have been discussing with the livestock industry how we can build on the arrangements that are already in place to develop a wider service for collecting fallen stock when the new animal by-products regulation banning burial comes into force from 1 May. Any further progress is dependent upon the willingness of the livestock industry to make a financial contribution to a national scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many pesticides are <i>(a)</i> approved for use in the UK, <i>(b)</i> approved for use in the UK but not for use in the European Union and <i>(c)</i> manufactured in the UK and approved for use in third countries but not in the UK or the EU; and when each was approved for use in (i) the UK, (ii) the EU and (iii) third countries.  [101270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At present there are approvals for 4,112 individual pesticide products in the UK. The number of active substances for which there are one or more approved products is currently 336.
<P>

<a name="30313w07.html_para0">There are two active substances that are approved for agricultural use in the UK but not for use in other member states. Differences in approvals between countries can arise because different approval conditions are applied or because commercial approvals are not sought in all countries. A spreadsheet (named the 'Indicative list') giving details of pesticides approved in each member state can be found on the Commission's website at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/ph ps/pro/eva/existinq/index en.htm
<P>

<a name="30313w07.html_para1">The Government do not hold this information, as the UK's pesticide legislation does not extend to the manufacture of pesticides or to those pesticides intended solely for exportation from the UK. Neither do the Government have information on the details of pesticides approved for use in the third countries or information on when each pesticide was approved for use in the EU and third countries. Within the UK pesticides have been approved for use under the Control of Pesticides Regulations (COPR) since October 1986.

<a name="30313w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are no plans to deregulate raptor protection. All wild birds, including raptors are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, I recognise the problems presented by birds of prey to game bird managers and pigeon fanciers, and believe the recommendations from the Raptor Working Group's final report, published in 2000, will provide an integrated solution to the problems presented by birds of prey in these particular sectors.
<P>

<a name="30313w07.html_para2">Work is already being taken forward by the country conservation agencies, and other organisations, and includes research in Scotland examining levels of pigeon predation, at lofts and release sites and during races, and testing the feasibility of using radio tags to follow pigeons when training or racing. I look forward to hearing the results. In addition, English Nature has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Moorland Association on addressing the issue of raptor predation in the uplands.
<P>

<a name="30313w07.html_para3">Implementation of the Working Group's report's recommendations in Scotland and Wales is of course a matter for the devolved Administrations. Nevertheless, I have asked the Joint Nature Conservation Committee to report generally on progress.

<a name="30313w07.html_para7">We are committed to increasing the use of renewable energy. This includes the use of woodfuel from both traditional woodland and short rotation coppice. There is already considerable scope for increased sustainable harvesting for woodfuel in existing woodland in England, and we also expect the area of woodland to continue to increase at its current rate of around 5,000 hectares per year. Support for woodland creation is provided by the Woodland Grant Scheme and Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, while the Energy Crops Scheme offers financial incentives for the establishment of short rotation coppice as woodfuel. A review of the support for woodland creation has been carried out, and the results will be published in the spring.

 Economic and market-based instruments are one of the range of instruments that can be used to influence environmental behaviour. As stated in the European Economic Reform White Paper 'Realising Europe's Potential', published in February 2002, the Government are in favour of the use of such instruments at Community level where these are most appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30313w08.html_para3">The voluntary agreements with car manufacturers on carbon dioxide emissions from new cars and the forthcoming EU Emission Trading Scheme are good examples of the community, with the Government's support, developing economic and market-based instruments where these are most appropriate to address environmental issues with a strong trans-boundary or single market dimension.
<P>

<a name="30313w08.html_para4">Generally, the Government will only allow departures from member states' freedom to set tax rates and bases where there are strong, specific reasons for the UK to do so which would otherwise be undermined by a lack of community level action. For example, the Government recognise that there are strong and specific reasons to agree common approaches to tackle climate change. Otherwise, for example, businesses could relocate within the EU to member states that did not tax the causes of climate change&#151;thereby not reducing climate change at all.
<P>

<a name="30313w08.html_para5">For this reason, the Government are prepared to agree to the proposed EU energy products directive that would increase the minimum rates of duty on road fuels within the EU and introduce minimum rates on some other energy products.

 From 1 April 2003 the landfill tax credit scheme will be capped at a value of around &#163;47 million per year for spending on local community environmental projects, ensuring that the current level of support for these projects is maintained. The Government have been considering the detailed administration and criteria for the successor scheme in consultation with stakeholders and are considering how the management of the scheme might be improved to ensure greater transparency and accountability, more attention to value for money, and better evaluation of projects. The Government will set out their plans for reform on a Budget timetable.

 All Service personnel who own a private property remain liable to pay council tax on their own property to the local authority concerned. Council tax rebates are a matter for local authorities and it is for them to interpret the regulations concerning "sole or main residence". In reaching their decision they consider case law arising from earlier council tax appeals, which takes various factors into account including the amount of time spent at a property, whether it is the family home, and security of tenure.

<a name="30313w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Outside the hurricane season, May to November, the unit assigned to APT (N) is routinely at 14 days notice to be in the Caribbean theatre. HMS Iron Duke demonstrated, during her transit from the Caribbean to Sierra Leone, that she is well within that 14-day notice period. It is not planned to supplement the APT (N) unit at the present moment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Water for the personal hygiene of troops deployed in Kuwait is being provided under a joint UK/US arrangement. This provides for showers and ablutions. No specific consumption rates are being applied. Bottled drinking water is provided at a rate of six litres per person per day. All personnel are advised to ensure that they adhere to the recommended consumption levels in order to avoid the effects of dehydration.

<P>
<a name="30313w10.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 9 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 13W, which explained that the number of Army personnel who have been recommended for Manning Control Point review is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30313w10.html_para0">Only two individuals have been discharged under Queens Regulations for the Army paragraph 9.413, 'Not required for a full Army career', in the last 12 months. Both discharges occurred in April 2002 and neither individual has been re-engaged nor transferred to an s-type engagement.

 The French Ship (FS) Primauguet was integrated into the Naval Task Group (NTG) 03 between the dates 17 to 29 January 2003. There is currently no plan for FS Primauguet to re-integrate with the Task Group. While FS Aconit did participate in NTG 2000, there was never any intention for her to participate in NTG 03.

 The Ministry of Defence recognises that an affordable, regular and reliable postal service is vital for morale and consequently a high priority is given to achieving this. For operational reasons there is very limited transport capacity available for mail both into the Gulf region and for onward carriage within theatre. A parcels service is, therefore, not offered within the mail element of the Operational Welfare Package for Operation Telic, and only letters and packets within the weight and dimension limits of the air letter service can be accepted, the maximum weight being two kilograms. The charge for a two kilogram packet is &#163;6.89, which is the same as the United Kingdom inland first class letter rate. This is the limit of the concession currently approved and complies with the principle that Service personnel should not be disadvantaged by being deployed overseas.

<a name="30313w11.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) requires reservists who are served with a call-out notice to report for service at a specified time and place. Should a reservist fail to comply with a call-out notice, the Ministry of Defence will attempt to resolve administratively cases where an individual has inadvertently failed to comply with call-out instructions. This includes checking address information and sending a follow-up notice by recorded delivery. However, should it become apparent that the individual has deliberately failed to comply, a formal investigation will take place that may result in the reservist being charged with desertion or absence without leave. Such cases will be reported to the civil police and will be tried in a civil court. As at 10 March only one reservist is believed to have deliberately failed to report for service.

<P>
<a name="30313w14.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what proportion of his Departmental budget was spent on <i>(a)</i> pre-school education, <i>(b)</i> school age education up to sixth form level, <i>(c)</i> sixth form school and college education, <i>(d)</i> further education and <i>(e)</i> higher education in the last year for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement  [99819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The amount spent by the Department on various functions is set out in table 4.2 of the 2002 Departmental Report for the Department for Education and Skills (Command Number 5402).
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w14.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. McLoughlin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list the grants funded by his Department for which <i>(a)</i> LEAs, <i>(b)</i> primary and secondary schools, <i>(c)</i> further education institutions, <i>(d)</i> higher education institutions, <i>(e)</i> individual teachers and <i>(f)</i> students may apply; how much funding was made available in the last financial year; how many awards were made; and what their administrative costs were in each case.  [99946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 My Department makes grant payments to a wide range of education, voluntary and private organisations. Organisations and individuals can also apply to and receive grants from our NDPBs and other agencies, for which we hold no central records. Therefore this question could be answered only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w14.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 24 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 164&#150;65W, on pupil funding, for what reasons Havering receives lower funding than other London Boroughs for pupils aged <i>(a)</i> five to 10 and <i>(b)</i> 11 to 15; and what plans he has to increase funding for schools in Havering.  [102049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04, Havering's Education Formula Spending Share is increasing by 3.2 per cent. per pupil. In addition we will continue to provide Standards Fund grant funding for priority programmes to support improvements as in previous years: for 2003&#150;04 Havering's Standards Fund allocation so far is &#163;4.2 million not including the LEA contribution. Havering's schools will also continue to benefit from significant increases in the School Standards Grant.
<P>

<a name="30313w14.html_para1">In 2003&#150;04 Havering's average level of funding per primary pupil is &#163;2,237. Its average level of funding per secondary pupil is &#163;2,956.
<P>

<a name="30313w14.html_para2">Overall, the per pupil funding in Havering is lower than in London authorities because it benefits less than other London authorities from those aspects in the funding formula which reflect the additional costs of recruiting and retaining staff in high-cost areas (the Area Cost Adjustment&#151;ACA) and the additional costs of educating deprived pupils.
<P>

<a name="30313w14.html_para3">The ACA for London has three values: 1.2624 (inner); 1.1447 (outer London west); and 1.0912 (outer London east). Havering receives the ACA for those in outer London east: its lower value reflects the lower general wage rates in outer London east compared with those in outer London west. On the measures of deprivation in EFSS, Havering is 10th out of the 13 outer London east authorities for both income support and the working families tax credit and has the lowest proportion of pupils with English as an additional language and low achieving ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="30313w14.html_para4">We recognise that the recommendations of the School Teachers' Review Body will place an additional burden on schools in Havering. Consequently our response to the STRB report proposes an additional grant for those London authorities with a low increase in their education formula spending share or a floor increase in their Revenue Support Grant. Havering's share will be &#163;475,000: we intend to pay this grant in May; and the LEA will be required to pass it on to school budgets.

<a name="30313w15.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his Answer of 11 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 693W, on modern apprenticeship programmes, if he will make a statement on the achievement rates of full national vocational qualification <i>(a)</i> level 2 for Foundation Modern Apprenticeships and <i>(b)</i> level 3 for Advanced Modern Apprenticeships from 1994 to 2001.

<P>
<a name="30313w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 My earlier answer to the hon. Member provided figures for the achievement of the main National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) within Modern Apprenticeship (MA) frameworks. These have risen substantially since 1997. Over half of Advanced Modern Apprentice trainees now complete their level 3 NVQ; other positive outcomes include progression to higher education and continuing with the same employer.
<P>

<a name="30313w15.html_para1">On 25 February, the Government launched a new Modern Apprenticeship Task Force, under Sir Roy Gardner, to encourage a higher level of employer commitment to MAs. We expect, through their work and that of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), retention and completion rates to rise further.
<P>

<a name="30313w15.html_para2">MA framework completion involves achievement of the appropriate NVQ, Key Skills and Technical Certificate qualifications. The collection of information on whole framework completion was a recommendation of the MA Advisory Committee. The LSC aims to publish NVQ attainment and framework completion data from spring 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what proportion of 18-year-olds from the borough of Redcar and Cleveland who will meet the parental income eligibility criteria for Opportunity Bursaries in 2003 would be eligible for the proposed Higher Education Grant.  [102711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w15.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Department does not collect information about parental income by local education authority area. Opportunity Bursaries are not awarded solely on the basis of parental income. 11,000 Bursaries are available for those entering English higher education institutions in 2003. Students with Opportunity Bursaries will remain eligible to receive their payments in years 2 and 3 of the course, when the new higher education grant is introduced for new students from 2004. Eligibility for the Higher Education Grant will depend on household income. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State indicated in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) on 6 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 358W, that a decision on the income threshold at which the full &#163;1,000 is payable will be announced later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research his Department has conducted to assess the impact of increased pupil mobility on discipline in schools.  [101366]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Pupil mobility is a permanent feature of our school system. There is no evidence that it is increasing. However, there is evidence that very high rates of mobility at particular schools can have detrimental effects on levels of attainment. The Department is therefore supporting a project at 50 schools with very high rates of mobility to help them develop and implement action plans to tackle problems related to behaviour and attendance as well as attainment. This work will also lead to good practice guidelines to help other schools with high mobility.

 Following the introduction of the new performance management arrangements in 2000&#150;01 the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) looked at how they were being implemented in a sample of schools. They found that even at such an early stage performance management had been introduced in all the schools surveyed and that it had been adopted satisfactorily or better in four fifths of those schools. Ofsted also found that headteachers, other senior managers, teachers and governors were positive about the contribution that performance management could make to school improvement. However we recognise that more needs to be done before performance management can fulfil its potential in supporting school and teacher improvement. I am sending my hon. Friend a copy of a speech I gave on 27 January this year on this subject.

 Reports commissioned from JM Consulting by the Higher Education Funding Council for England into the capital requirements of higher education institutions in the UK concluded that there was a total shortfall of some &#163;8 billion of investment, consisting of a research infrastructure backlog of &#163;3.2 billion, and a teaching infrastructure backlog of &#163;4.6 billion, plus a need to double expenditure on maintenance. The Secretary of State announced in January 2003 that capital funding for higher education institutions in England will increase by 77 per cent. for research and by 185 per cent. for teaching and learning in cash terms between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06.

 Since entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, the United States has accepted the continuous monitoring of the destruction of its chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles, as well as regular OPCW inspections of its former CW production facilities. Inspections at US industrial facilities only began in May 2000, as a result of a delay in putting in place the necessary domestic enabling legislation. During that time the United Kingdom regularly urged the US to remedy this deficiency at the earliest opportunity.

<i>[holding answer 4 March 2003]:</i> The 1983 Mental Act liberalised the law to incorporate more tolerant public attitudes in relation to sexual preference so that this could no longer be viewed as a condition of mental disorder. Also excluded were people who are substance or alcohol misusers.
<P>

<a name="30313w18.html_para8">However, people with psychosis exacerbated or caused by substance misuse, including alcohol, can be treated under the 1983 Act. A misunderstanding of section 1(3) of the Act has resulted in many instances in substance abusers being denied the treatment they need.

<P>

<a name="30313w18.html_para10">The draft Mental Health Bill proposes a single broad definition of mental disorder, coupled with tightly drawn conditions that must be satisfied for compulsory powers to be used. It is the intention that the strict conditions will ensure that the powers are only used where the patient is suffering from a mental disorder which is serious enough to require treatment under the care of a mental health consultant; the risk to self or others warrants it and appropriate treatment is available for the individual patient. This approach would remove exclusions and the "treatability"

requirement so that there are no arbitrary obstacles to the treatment of anyone who satisfies the conditions for compulsion.
<P>

<a name="30313w18.html_para11">While the new legislation will lead to some change in the group of people treated, overall it is not the intention that more people will be subject to compulsion under the Bill. Investment under the NHS Plan and service improvements under the national service framework for mental health, such as assertive outreach, crisis resolution and early intervention, will help to provide more effective care and ensure that fewer people become so ill that they need compulsory treatment.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the relationship between the projected cuts in the number of firefighters under the Bain proposals and the proposals of the Pathfinder report.  [100120]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Independent Review of the Fire Service recommended a new and more flexible approach to fire cover. It suggested that resources should be deployed to ensure that the right resources such as 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 2003 : Column 421W</I><P>
firefighters, fire stations, and fire appliances are in the right place at the right time to save lives where they are at risk. This new approach is not about cutting fire stations or firefighters. It is about better targeting Fire Service resources at identified risks in a cost-effective manner.
<P>

<a name="30313w20.html_para0">The Task Group on the Fire Cover Review (whose report is widely referred to as the "Pathfinder report") developed a Fire Service Emergency Cover Methodology. This was used by the Task Group to predict resource and personnel requirements, and their related cost. This was done both for the 11 fire brigades which participated in the Pathfinder trials and, by extrapolation, nationally. However, while the Task Group endorsed the basic methodology, a number of teething problems led the group to reject the detailed calculations, which are now being repeated following further work. The Fire Cover Review has developed a model to inform decisions about the allocation of emergency response resources (fire stations, red engines, and crews). The model has been tested twice in computer simulations. The first test run suggested that you could spend twice the current Fire Service budget without achieving much reduction in risk. The second test run suggested that you could halve expenditure without much increase in current levels of loss of life and property.
<P>

<a name="30313w20.html_para1">These two simulations have set out two extreme cases. But taken together, and even allowing for some technical errors which have come to light in the early results, the findings suggest that substantial improvements in Fire Service efficiency and effectiveness are achievable. This judgement has been endorsed by the Bain report.
<P>

<a name="30313w20.html_para2">The report of the Fire Cover Review was published in draft on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister website on 23 December 2002 (www.odpm.gov.uk). Copies of the final report of the Independent Review of the Fire Service, and the draft Fire Cover Review report have been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Independent Review of the Fire Service recommended a new and more flexible approach to fire cover in which resources would be deployed in the right place at the right time to meet identified risks to life and property. This new approach is not about cutting the number of firefighters. Under these proposals, democratically accountable fire authorities, acting on the professional advice of Chief Fire Officers, would take decisions on the provision of fire cover. The review considered that the recommendations it made could be implemented without the need for compulsory redundancies.

<a name="30313w20.html_para4">No assessment has yet been made of the preventive effect of fines levied against environmental offenders. My Department takes the view that the level of fines being imposed for pollution offences is generally too low. We are now working with the Environment Agency and with others, especially the Magistrates Association, to ensure that magistrates are trained and have an increased awareness of the implications of polluting activity and consequently impose more realistic fines. To this end, the Association recently circulated relevant training material to all its 28,000 members.

No account of concessionary fares funding for London boroughs has been taken with regard to these figures.<P>

Decisions on the level of GLA transport grant are taken by Ministers during comprehensive spending reviews, based on an assessment of London's need and competing national priorities. Grant is determined annually, following consultation with the Mayor of London.<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much total Government grant was <i>(a)</i> paid and <i>(b)</i> proposed to be paid to Stratford on Avon District Council in (i) cash and (ii) constant prices in each year between 1997&#150;98 and 2003&#150;04; and what the percentage increase in such grant in each of these years was at constant pricing.  [102896]<P>

<a name="30313w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The following table shows total formula grant which consists of redistributed business rates, revenue support grant and SSA reduction grant (SSA review) (where appropriate).
<P>

<a name="30313w21.html_para2">Over the period requested there have been many changes in the functions and funding of services to local government. To enable a like-for-like comparison between years, we calculate adjusted grants. The percentage change figures have been calculated on the basis of these like-for-like comparisons.
<P>

<a name="30313w21.html_para3">Until the introduction of Central Support Protection Grant in 1999&#150;2000, there was no need to calculate grant on a like-for-like basis, and for this reason grant comparisons in the years 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are not available. There were no changes in funding and function between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 that needed reflecting in adjusted grants for 1998&#150;99 to allow a like-for-like comparison; the actual 1998&#150;99 values have therefore been used in this case.

<P>
<a name="30313w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Code of Best Practice on Mobile Network Development was published on 11 November 2002. This firmly encourages mast and site sharing where that is the optimum solution in the individual circumstances. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to amend further the planning arrangements for telecommunications development at the present time.

<a name="30313w21.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what representations he has <i>(a)</i> made to and <i>(b)</i> received from local planning authorities in respect of telecommunication operators' commitment to participate in obligatory pre-rollout and pre-allocation consultation.  [102094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government issued 'Planning Policy Guidance Note 8: Telecommunications' in August 2001 which strongly encourages telecommunications operators and local planning authorities to carry out annual discussions about rollout plans for each authority's area. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also issued the 'Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development' in November 2002, which includes more detailed recommendations for managing the relationship between mobile operators and local planning authorities and the process of public consultation. The Code also contained the Mobile Operators' Ten Commitments, which includes the commitments to participate in pre-rollout and pre-application consultation with local authorities and improved consultation with local communities.
<P>

<a name="30313w21.html_para5">The Government receive many representations on matters relating to the telecommunications industry but the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not aware of any particular representations from local planning authorities on this subject.

<a name="30313w21.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what financial support the Government's independent scientific research programme on mobile communications health issues has received from telecommunication operators.  [102096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The independent scientific research programme is costing &#163;7.36 million of which private companies in the telecommunications sector are paying 50 per cent. (&#163;3.68 million). More information about the research programme can be found at the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme website: www.mthr.org.uk.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w21.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what information his Department has gathered regarding the extent to which telecommunication operators have met their commitment to provide staff resources to respond to complaints and inquiries about radio base stations within 10 working days.  [102097]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30313w21.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to replace telecommunication operators' voluntary code of conduct with statutory regulation; and if he will make a statement.  [102098]

<a name="30313w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 There are no plans to replace the mobile phone Operators' Ten Commitments with statutory regulation. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will, however, continue to monitor the implementation of the Commitments and will keep the situation under review in light of experience and any new developments.
