The Veterans Agency Welfare Service also provides practical assistance to veterans in need of support, focussed on those with mental or physical illness or injury suffered as a result of military service for which a compensatory pension is in payment. Following recommendations on mental health services for veterans in 2005 by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service, officials from the MOD, the UK Health departments and Combat Stress have been working together to develop and implement a new community-based model for mental health services for veterans. It is hoped that, beginning in the spring of 2007, the model will be piloted at sites across the UK. The pilots are likely to last two years and, if successful, will be rolled out nationally.</p>

In the run-up to Germany taking over the presidency of the EU on 1 January, the FCO has been very active in engaging with other Government Departments on UK policy. Testament to the effective work we have done on this agenda were two important outcomes from informal European Council in October at Lahti: to link European policy on energy security and climate change more closely together so that the EU pursues an integrated policy; and a greater coherence among EU member states than there has been in the past on external energy security issues, e.g. our approach towards dealing with third country suppliers. This work has been particularly timely in relation to the European Commission&#146;s Strategic Energy Review, which will be published shortly and will help set further direction on energy and climate change policy during the German presidency. The FCO has been working with the Commission and EU member states to ensure that UK priorities are reflected in the Strategic Energy Review and other Commission papers such as the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>

Combined with our proposals to simplify the entitlement conditions and reduce the number of years needed to qualify for a full basic state pension (BSP) to 30, the credits will make it easier for parents to build a full BSP. The new credits also extend state second pension (S2P) rights to people with a child aged between six and 12&#151;this means from 2010 around 780,000 more women and 30,000 men will be accruing S2P.</p>

Following a review of progress by an international expert panel the Department, Cancer Research UK and the MRC have agreed to provide a further three years funding of &#163;3.9 million.</p>

Practice participation in the DES is voluntary and the Department does not collect information centrally on the numbers of practices who have done so. Any practice which is participating in the DES will however need to take part in the patient survey if it is to receive the full payment to which it may be entitled under the DES.

Pharmacovigilance systems do not rely solely on ADR reporting via the Yellow Card Scheme. The other data sources regularly used in the monitoring of drug safety in the UK include formal safety studies, the published medical literature, information from pharmaceutical companies and other regulatory authorities throughout the world together with information on the level of drug prescribing. There is also an international database of around 1.5 million ADR reports operated by the World Health Organization to which the MHRA has on line access. In addition, as laid down in European Community legislation, the regulatory authorities of the European member states exchange information and work closely together on drug safety matters.</p>

Once a hypothesis has been generated that a particular medicine is associated with an adverse effect other methods are used to confirm and quantify the risk before regulatory action is taken. The objective of regulatory action is to ensure that the benefits of the medicine continue to outweigh risks, by restricting indications for use, adding contraindications, warnings or precautions, or additional information about adverse effects. Only when risk minimisation measures are considered unlikely to be effective in maintaining a positive benefit risk balance is withdrawal from the market necessary.  <br>

In many respects the model Funding Agreement includes provisions equivalent to those in maintained school legislation: Academies are required to act in accordance with admissions law and the DfES codes of practice, to follow the majority of the provisions of section 52 of the Education Act 2002 relating to exclusions and appeals, and to have regard to the SEN code of practice and statutory guidance on inclusion. It is not however the Government&#146;s intention that maintained school legislation should simply read across; we need to be clear about its applicability to the particular set of circumstances within which Academies operate.</p>

There are now 449 School Sport Partnerships covering all maintained schools in England, Each partnership has its own PDM who is responsible for the strategic development of the partnership and liaison with other agencies to develop high quality physical education and school sport. A typical partnership consists of a PDM who manages up to eight school sport co-ordinators and 45 primary link teachers who are responsible for developing opportunities within their secondary and primary schools respectively. A typical partnership receives a ring-fenced grant of around &#163;270,000 per year, depending on the number of schools.

The draft code proposed that these schools should not give priority to siblings. This is not an absolute prohibition: it would remain open to such schools to determine to give priority to siblings. Responses to the consultation are currently being considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_627"><a name="61214w0035.htm_para6"><a name="06121563003426">Data on admission arrangements for 2006/07 was available for 23 of the 41 partially selective schools on their local authority and school websites. The data do not provide the level of detail requested by the hon. Member. However, nine of those schools admitted over 40 per cent. of their intake based on sibling criteria and a further seven admitted between 20 per cent. and 39 per cent. based on sibling criteria. With the proportion of pupils admitted to selective places up to 40-50 per cent. in some schools, this can mean that fewer than 20 per cent. of a school&#146;s places may be allocated to local families.</p>

However, section 84 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 as amended by section 40 of the Education and Inspections Act will require the adjudicator to &#145;act in accordance with the Code&#146;.

Their study covers 26 schools and will give us an average cost for installing sprinklers in new schools&#151;both as a percentage addition to construction costs and as a rate per square metre of floor area.

They may choose to install sprinklers when constructing new schools, but do not need to inform us or provide figures on costs. However, the study I refer to above is gathering information on maintenance costs as well as capital costs.</p>

Our public consultation on Building Bulletin 100, &#147;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&#148;, included questions on sprinklers. We take all of the views expressed very seriously and that is one of the reasons why we commissioned further studies on sprinklers. We saw the need to provide more information about sprinklers and their role in improving property protection, and will be expanding the guidance on their use in schools in the final version of Building Bulletin 100.</p>
