<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to extend the MoT test to include checks on <i>(a)</i> the safety and security of children's restraints and children's seats when fitted in motor vehicles and <i>(b)</i> the suitability of such devices for their purported purpose; and if he will make a statement.  [98514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It would not be practical to require such checks during MoT tests on items which are not permanent fittings in vehicles. There is a wide range of child restraints available which are suitable for children of different sizes and ages and which meet prescribed standards of design and performance. Parents can be confident about safety provided they use a restraint marked as complying with the relevant standards and also follow the manufacturer's fitting instructions. It is for parents to determine the suitability of child restraint systems for the size and age of their children.
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para0">The Department's leaflet "Seat Belts and Child Restraints" already advises on restraint systems and reminds that fitting instructions must always be followed. The content of the leaflet is kept under review and we are always willing to add to the advice where it is appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what area of land was developed on <i>(a)</i> greenfield sites and <i>(b)</i> brownfield sites, in the City of Worcester, in the years 1979 to 1998.  [99394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The information is not currently available. The Department's Land Use Change Statistics provide estimates of the proportion of development that took place on land that was previously developed, but at present results are available only for counties, not for local authority districts or cities. This source is currently under review, and will be developed to provide more detailed, timely information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what is the Government's definition of fuel poverty;  [99110]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will set a target year by which fuel poverty in the UK will be eliminated.  [99114]<P></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> As announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1999 : Column: 210W</I><P>
Energy on 11 November 1999, an inter-ministerial group is being set up, jointly chaired by her and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to examine the way ahead on fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para1">The commonly applied definition of a fuel poor household is one that needs to spend more than 10 per cent. of income to achieve a satisfactory heating regime. The inter-ministerial group will consider this definition in light of the comments received on the recent consultation, as set out in the answer given on 19 October 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>491-92</i>.
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para2">From our latest data, we estimate that in 1996 there were at least 4.3 million fuel poor households. Since that time we have introduced programmes to tackle low income and poor energy efficiency, which are the main causes of fuel poverty, as well as the liberalisation of the energy markets which has led to significant falls in the cost of keeping warm. The inter-ministerial group will consider the impact of these programmes to develop a more accurate picture of the extent of the problem and how quickly it can be addressed, so that a target date can be set for the elimination of fuel poverty in England.
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para3">Some of the policy initiatives in this area, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, are devolved functions. Therefore a target date for Scotland and Wales would be a matter for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what sources of public finance are available to assist in the scheme to re-open the Droitwich Junction and Droitwich Barge canals.  [99463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are a number of sources of public finance available to assist canal restoration projects. These include the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Environmental Action Fund, the Single Regeneration Budget, and the New Opportunities Fund as well as local authorities, regional development agencies and landfill tax rebate. To qualify for a grant from any of these sources the Droitwich canal project would of course have to meet with the requirements and aims of the grant provider.
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para4">Detailed information on the sources of funding for canal restoration projects is contained in the DETR-sponsored Technical Restoration Handbook, published by the Inland Waterways Association (IWA). Copies of the Handbook can be obtained from the IWA (Tel: 01923 711114).

<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_wqn4"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what funding he has made available for community-based projects <i>(a)</i> to tackle drug abuse and <i>(b)</i> to promote safer communities since May 1997.  [99529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Department operates two major community-based regeneration programmes, the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) and the New Deal for Communities (NDC).
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para5">The SRB's multiple objectives, designed to tackle poverty and social exclusion, include a specific objective 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1999 : Column: 211W</I><P>
of tackling crime and drug abuse and improving community safety. It is not possible to identify funding made available specifically for projects tackling drug abuse or promoting safer communities. However, since May 1997, 213 out of 284 successful bids under rounds 4 and 5 gave crime prevention or community safety as key objectives. Anti-drug proposals would be covered by these objectives. Details of the successful bids were placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para6">The first round of the NDC was launched in September 1998 and the second round on 10 November 1999. Anti-drug measures feature in all of the plans of the first round partnerships and are likely to feature in second round plans too. However, it is not possible to identify how much NDC funding will be used specifically for anti-drug and community safety activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will publish for <i>(a)</i> Merseyside, <i>(b)</i> South Yorkshire and <i>(c)</i> Cornwall, the amount of Objective 1 finance which he expects each area will get by way of commitment in the year 2000-01 from the European Union; how much of these committed project costs he expects to be spent during that year; how much will carry over to subsequent financial years; and how much match funding will be made available to each of these areas for the financial year 2000-01.

<P>

<a name="91126w01.html_para7">It is too early to say how much of these allocations will actually be committed and spent during these years. All depends on when the European Commission approve the single programming documents, how quickly projects get under way and when applicants submit their grant claims. The responsibility for identifying match funding from the many sources available in the public and private sectors is a matter for project applicants in these areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The changes in policy in respect of planning for the development of clusters of knowledge- based industry, foreshadowed in my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's pre-Budget Report, do not apply to supermarkets. The Government's policy in respect of planning for supermarkets is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 6, "Town Centres and Retail

<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Groundwater Regulations 1998 came into effect on 1 April this year. Guidance on the Regulations was available at that time from the Environment Agency, and further guidance has been drawn up in the light of experience during the first months of practical implementation. A draft of this further guidance, which explains the operation and application of the Regulations, is now being sent out for public consultation to a wide range of consultees. Comments are invited by 29 February 2000. Copies of the draft guidance have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 The expected proceeds from the proposed partial sale of National Air Traffic Services have been reflected in the Department's Comprehensive Spending Review Settlement, resulting in a 25 per cent. increase in underlying transport spending. This will allow a start to be made on integrated transport policies.

<P>
<a name="91126w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend does not propose to do so. These sectors have been asked to sign heads of agreement before the Budget in March 2000. They have been able to start preparations since the levy was announced in March 1999 and there has been a series of meetings with officials since then. The sectors may also take advantage of assistance from the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme in preparing their proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Negotiations with sectors are proceeding on the basis that sectors will be expected to commit to installing all cost-effective energy efficiency measures over the period of the agreements. Cost-effectiveness will be measured using industry's own criteria.

<P>

<a name="91126w02.html_para2">In their Report the Committee welcomed those objectives. The Committee concluded that the extent to which any eventual legislation would fulfil those objectives would largely depend on how far the Government were prepared to accept their findings.
<P>

<a name="91126w02.html_para3">Our response will demonstrate that we are committed to adopt an approach which will ensure that those objectives are fulfilled to the greatest possible extent. We will bring forward as early as possible in the passage of the Bill such amendments as are necessary to give full effect to our response.

 Since 1994 the Department for International Development (DFID) has been providing advice to the TB service in Tomsk oblast, comparing treatment methods recommended by the World Health Organisation with traditional Russian methods. As a result the Federal Ministry of Health has agreed to use Tomsk as a pilot site for TB treatment reform. We are discussing expanding this work to two further oblasts, Kemerovo and Samara, with the relevant regional authorities. In addition we are considering providing support for two further TB projects to be carried out under the auspices of the World bank and the World Health Organisation respectively.

The offices of the former Royal Fine Art Commission and of the Royal Commission on Historic Manuscripts are leased in the name of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and my Department has no interest in their freehold value. The land and property managed by Historic Royal Palaces and the Royal Parks Agency are held in right of the Crown. They are therefore inalienable, and a valuation of them has not been undertaken.

 The digital terrestrial transmission plan for the UK presently comprises 81 transmitter sites. Transmissions from the fourteen digital terrestrial transmitter sites located in Scotland, together with transmissions from Caldbeck in the north of England, will deliver digital terrestrial television services to about 90-95 per cent. of the Scottish population. Maps showing the predicted coverage from each of these transmitter sites have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses on CD-ROM.
<P>

<a name="91126w02.html_para5">The BBC and ITC, together with the transmission providers Crown Castle and NTL, are now considering the further development of digital television coverage, in consultation with the digital broadcasters and Government. The aim is to ensure that at least 99.4 per cent. of the UK population can receive digital television signals, through a variety of delivery mechanisms. Analogue switch-over will not take place until this and other tests are met, for which the Government has set a target timetable of 2006-10. The ITC and BBC's transmission plans are not yet sufficiently advanced to determine if there will be any areas in Scotland where the reception of digital television might remain difficult at 2006 or 2010.

<P>
<a name="91126w02.html_spnew10"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Responsibility for the transmission of Channel 5 services rests with Channel 5 under the terms of its licence, regulated by the Independent Television Commission and subject to constraints on the available spectrum. Channel 5 has enhanced its coverage across the UK by offering analogue services free-to-air on satellite and also on cable where it is available. Channel 5 services are also carried free-to-air on all digital platforms.
<P>

<a name="91126w02.html_para6">The provision of digital terrestrial television now has higher priority than the potential extension of analogue terrestrial Channel 5 coverage. The Government have no plans to require Channel 5 to extend analogue terrestrial services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland or other areas of the UK. However in due course digital television 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the value of the Government Art Collection, which has no current market valuation. The current monetary value of a work of art can be accurately assessed only at the time of its purchase or sale or by professional valuation. In the former case, the Collection is not actively traded; in the latter, it would not be a justifiable expenditure of public funds to have the whole Collection valued professionally.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> The BBC published for consultation on its proposals for new and enhanced public services, including a new digital television channel for children, on 15 September. Subject to the outcome of the review of the future funding of the BBC, I understand the Corporation will be seeking my approval to launch a new children's channel in due course. I am considering whether changes should be made to the current arrangements for considering proposed new BBC services in the light of the recommendations made by the Davies Panel. I expect to announce final decisions on this in January.

 The Department and the Arts Council have recognised for some time that the financial position of many of England's regional orchestras was precarious.

They are to be congratulated for identifying a pragmatic way ahead and I am sure that the orchestras will now seize this opportunity to secure their long-term future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will take steps to ensure that student loans taken up by mature students undertaking university degree courses are not considered as income for the purposes of determining their eligibility for social benefits, including housing benefits, for themselves and for any dependent children.  [99596]<P>

 Full time students are not eligible to claim income-related benefits--their primary source of financial support comes from the education system. However, certain students in vulnerable groups, for example: lone parents or disabled students, are eligible.
<P>

<a name="91126w03.html_para5">When deciding a claim for an income-related benefit most income is taken into account. Income is only disregarded if there are strong grounds for doing so. There are existing disregards from student loan income, such as amounts intended for travel or for books and equipment. To ignore the rest of the student loan income (which is intended for everyday living expenses) available to mature students would be unfair to other claimants of similar means and circumstances.

<a name="91126w04.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The law relating to the re-hearing of an appeal was reviewed recently and is set out in the Social Security Act 1998. The Act sets out three circumstances when a tribunal's decision can be set aside and referred to a new tribunal for a re-hearing.
<P>

<a name="91126w04.html_para1">We have carried forward provisions for the Independent Tribunal Service/The Appeals Service to set aside decisions on certain grounds. This is where a relevant document was not received by all parties on time or where a party to the proceedings was not present at the hearing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the number of people with non-child care responsibilities <i>(a)</i> who are entitled to and <i>(b)</i> who claim Home Responsibilities Protection.  [98511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The entitlement conditions for Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) for non-child carers are very similar to those for Invalid Care Allowance (ICA). The majority of people who fulfil those conditions will claim ICA which attracts automatic National Insurance credits and hence, they do not require HRP. No reliable information is available on the numbers of non-child carers without ICA who are either entitled to or claim HRP.

 The Child Support Agency does not have jurisdiction to enforce maintenance orders made against former partners now residing overseas. This is a matter for the Lord Chancellor's Department, who are currently pursuing Mrs. Basu's case.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reasons he has delayed the implementation of the new pay structure for the armed forces until April 2000; and what will be the consequent saving to his budget.  [99922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby) on 19 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 14W, in which I stated that the new pay structure for the Armed Forces was to be delayed by one year to April 2001 because the process of implementing this major project has proved more complex than had been originally anticipated. This delay will ensure that there is no risk to the pay of our Service men and women. There will be no consequent saving to the Defence budget.
<P>

<a name="91126w04.html_para4">The transition to the new pay structure is expected to involve additional costs. The pay rates for the new system will be recommended by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, and these will not be known until early 2001. Therefore I am withholding details of our planning assumptions under Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

I regret these values do not include some large, long-term contracts in existence before 1 April 1999. To determine these figures would take a great deal of time and effort. However, you may wish to be aware that figures for 1998/99 indicated that around 73% by value of DCTA clothing contracts were awarded to UK firms, leaving 27% to overseas firms.

I trust this answer furnishes the information which you require.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much his Department has spent on <i>(a)</i> legal fees, <i>(b)</i> special security measures and <i>(c)</i> other expenses in supporting former members of the Parachute Regiment in connection with the Saville Inquiry.  [98588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As at the end of September the Ministry of Defence has spent &#163;2,843,519 on legal fees in total in connection with the Bloody Sunday Inquiry. It is not possible to identify separately the legal costs incurred in supporting former members of the Parachute Regiment, since soldiers from many other regiments are involved.
<P>

<a name="91126w05.html_para0">Special security measures were not provided by the Department but by the Home Office; the costs are withheld for security reasons under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>

<a name="91126w05.html_para1">The only other expenses which can be identified as having been incurred in supporting former members of the Parachute Regiment are travel and subsistence costs which are reimbursed following meetings with their MOD-appointed lawyers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the effects of the NATO bombing of <i>(a)</i> the oil refinery and bridges at Novi Sad and <i>(b)</i> the chemical complex at Pancevo.  [100086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The refinery at Novi Sad and the chemical complex at Pancevo were damaged during NATO airstrikes, resulting in immediate cessation of production at Novi Sad and severe functional damage at Pancevo. Production has now resumed and repairs are continuing.
<P>

<a name="91126w05.html_para2">The effect of the destruction of the bridges at Novi Sad (and the other bridges crossing the Danube) was to dislocate lines of communication in Serbia. The capacity to reinforce and sustain Serbian Forces was reduced. Road and railway traffic was interrupted, and the remains of the bridges blocked the Danube at Novi Sad. The closure of the Danube to river traffic impacted on imports, but also affected the through traffic to and from neighbouring countries and Black Sea ports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many SIEL and open individual export licence applications have been made in 1999; and how many of them have been <i>(a)</i> accepted and <i>(b)</i> rejected.  [99298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Between 1 January and 12 November 1999, 10,109 applications for an individual licence to export goods controlled for strategic reasons were received; 9,775 applications for a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL); and 334 applications for an Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL).
<P>

<a name="91126w05.html_para4">Between 1 January and 12 November 1999, a decision was taken on 6,851 SIEL applications and 143 OIEL applications, some of which will have been received before 1 January 1999; 6,802 SIELs were issued between these dates and 49 applications for such a licence were refused; 143 OIELs were issued between these dates and no applications for such a licence were refused in full.
<P>

<a name="91126w05.html_para5">A comparison of the numbers of licences issued or refused in any two periods, even when they are of the same duration, is hardly a reliable indicator of the practical effect of a change in Government policy--or indeed a change in Government--between the periods concerned. In the first place, companies are unlikely to apply for licences that they can judge for themselves are likely to be refused when assessed against the published criteria. More generally, the number and nature of the applications received in total or in relation to particular destinations can vary widely from one period to the next, and there can be many reasons for such variation.

 The Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997 prohibit the supply of most fireworks to persons under the age of 18 years.

 <i>[holding answer 23 November 1999]:</i> At Seattle, I will be vigorously supporting EU efforts aimed at ensuring that a new comprehensive round of negotiations has a clear development agenda meeting the needs and priorities of developing countries and which maximises the WTO's contribution to the eradication of poverty. On market access in respect of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), I shall be arguing strongly that other industrialised countries should join the EU in undertaking to provide duty-free access for essentially all LDC exports no later than the end of the round. I fully support the development of labelling schemes which enable consumers to make choices consistent with the pursuit of sustainable development. The EU will be pressing for clarification of the relationship between WTO rules and eco-labelling schemes to be included in the round.

 There are no meaningful average times applicable to criminal injuries compensation claims.

 The average cost of completed proceedings in the Crown court is &#163;2,600 following a guilty plea and &#163;17,550 following a not guilty plea. In both cases, there is an additional cost of &#163;1,050 incurred at the magistrates courts, as a result of committal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="91126w09.html_para2">These costs relate to the calendar year 1997 and financial year 1997-98, the most recent period for which comprehensive information is available. They were taken from the Home Office Research Finding No. 103, "The Cost of Criminal Justice", which was published on the 15 November.

The initiative is now being taken forward as the What Works strategy, for which &#163;21 million has been provided from 1999-2002 part of the Crime Reduction Programme, to develop and deliver high-quality work with offenders in the prison and probation services, based on what is known to reduce re-offending.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many times over the last five years he has used statutory powers to take direct action to close schools.  [99272]<P>

<P>
<a name="91126w11.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 There has been only one occasion in the last five years where the Secretary of State has used legislative powers to take direct action to close a school, and that was under the previous Government. The then Secretary of State made an order under the 1993 Education Act to close Hackney Downs School with effect from 31 December 1995.
<P>

<a name="91126w11.html_para1">Where necessary, the Secretary of State will take direct action to improve the education of children in failing schools; he has the power under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to direct that a school in special measures be closed. No school will be allowed to linger in failure. Where schools cannot be improved enough to come off special measures within two years they should be closed or given a "Fresh Start".
<P>

<a name="91126w11.html_para2">Since May 1997, 82 schools in special measures have been closed, following approval of proposals made by local education authorities; of which eight have been replaced by new "Fresh Start" schools, and 379 schools have been removed from special measures having been restored to health.

<P>
<a name="91126w11.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government have made available a &#163;180 million package for music services. Of this, &#163;150 million is available through the Standards Fund over three years to protect and expand local education authorities' music services. Among other things, this money can be targeted to instrumental music tuition. As this is new funding, the Department has received a number of representations over the last 12 months relating to musical instrument teaching.
<P>

<a name="91126w11.html_para3">The remaining &#163;30 million will fund the Youth Music Trust. The work of the Trust will complement Standards Fund provision and will extend access to music making for young people both in schools and outside.
<P>

<a name="91126w11.html_para4">The Department has commissioned a research project to look at the effectiveness of the instrumental music services maintained by local education authorities in order to draw lessons for the future. The project is due for completion in June 2000.

 The change was made in response to concerns from many headteachers, including the General Secretary of the National Association of Headteachers who has welcomed it. Since the change the Department and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority have received a total of 116 representations opposed to the change of test dates. 18 schools and local education authorities wrote to support the change. Since many of the schools expressed their views in confidence, it would be wrong to name them.

 The principal EU programmes for which my Department has responsibility are the European Social Fund, the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci education and training action programmes and the Youth Programme. These programmes operate differently in a number of ways. With the major exception of the European Social Fund, most of their activities include transnational activity, i.e. where a UK project promoter receives co-funding from the EU to mount a project involving the UK and one or more participating country. Moreover, while project funding data may relate to an applicant organisation in a particular town, activity may take place elsewhere, or involve participants from other towns or areas. It is therefore not currently possible in many instances to disaggregate the data to be able to say exactly how much funding goes to education and training institutions in individual cities or areas, without contacting all the individual institutions concerned. We are working with the European Commission and other member states to simplify the bureaucracy necessary to run these programmes.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the principal activities of his Department and its agencies which provide business for <i>(a)</i> Crown post offices and <i>(b)</i> other post offices; if he will assess whether the level of business generated in each case is likely to increase or decrease over the next five years; and which new areas of business for post offices are likely to be developed by his Department and its agencies over the same period.  [99578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91126w12.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The agencies of the Chancellor which provide business for Crown and sub-post offices are National Savings, Inland Revenue and Royal Mint.
<P>

<a name="91126w12.html_para4">National Savings raises deposits from the retail sector through a range of savings and investment products for personal savers retailing 10 of its 11 personal savings products through the full network of post offices.
<P>

<a name="91126w12.html_para5">On current projections National Savings transaction levels through post offices are forecast to reduce by some 8 per cent. over the next five years. This trend is seen as an inevitable consequence of competition from other financial services providers and personal choice as 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1999 : Column: 254W</I><P>
customers opt to deal through other channels such as post, telephone or electronic commerce. Enhancements over the next five years are likely to be direct replacements for existing products and as such unlikely to stimulate an increase in overall traffic levels through post offices.
<P>

<a name="91126w12.html_para6">The Inland Revenue has, for some years, given certain taxpayers the option to pay their taxes at any Post Office and expects these volumes to grow over the next five years. The Inland Revenue's National Insurance Contributions Office generates the payment of Quarterly Bills for Class 2 and Class 3 National Insurance Contributions (via giro bank) through all post offices, although contributors are encouraged to pay by direct debit rather than giro payment.
<P>

<a name="91126w12.html_para7">The Inland Revenue is also responsible for administering Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Person's Tax Credit. Currently most successful applicants receive their tax credit payment by order book which can be cashed at post offices. From April 2000, however, it is expected that the vast majority of employee applicants will be paid through their employers and that there will be a consequent decline in payments at post offices over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="91126w12.html_para8">Royal Mint use all post offices to distribute commemorative UK circulation coinage. This business is expected to remain at the same level over the next five years. Collector coins are also offered through all post offices and Royal Mint are working to increase the volume of business in this regard. No new areas of Royal Mint business for Post Offices are currently considered likely to be developed in the next five years.

1. Figures have been independently rounded to &#163;5 million. Components may not therefore sum to the totals shown.<P>

2. The figures shown for revenue lost use Customs' assumption that between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. of all alcohol purchased abroad substitutes for similar purchases in the UK (100 per cent. assumed for tobacco products).<P>

3. The figures exclude any amounts for revenue lost on alcoholic drink and tobacco products smuggled in freight consignments. Customs have not published any estimates for the extent of these activities for alcohol but the assessment includes freight smuggling.<P>
