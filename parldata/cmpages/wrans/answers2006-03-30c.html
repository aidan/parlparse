<p>
<a name="60330w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_9">The addition of the implementation stage is a new development introduced by the Market and Coastal Towns Association during the last year. It provides additional support of between &#163;5,000 and &#163;10,000 per town. It is likely that towns coming into the initiative from the next financial year onwards will be awarded &#163;25,000 to complete their plan, as well as consultancy support of approximately &#163;10,000 to complete their implementation stage. This reduction in overall costs will be achieved through the better targeting of effort and resources as a result of the lessons learned from previous years.

The UK provided financial assistance worth &#163;21.25 million to support the new regime&#039;s commitment to tackle drugs production, but it was the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to administer the system of payments with farmers. The Government did not set up a bank account for this purpose. Compensated eradication was never seen as a long-term solution to drug control and does not form part of the present Afghan government&#039;s National Drug Control Strategy.

A high-level, and partial, estimate of the cost for head office, agencies and the executive non-departmental public bodies if the euro were to be introduced into the UK, made in November 2004, was &#163;5.4 million. It is difficult to arrive at a more accurate and current estimate as that would depend very much on the timing and approach taken.

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60330w26.html_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Some studies have shown that ruminants fed fresh grass and other forage produce meat and dairy products with slightly higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids. However, these fatty acids differ chemically from the longer chain omega 3 fatty acids present in oily fish and which have been shown to be beneficial for cardiovascular disease. The nutritional consequences of slightly higher levels of intake of the shorter chain omega 3 fatty acids are not known, and so there is no currently justification for such labelling.

As a result, the University did agree to re-evaluate their decision however, residents would still appear to be concerned about the increased level of parking in adjacent streets.</p>

<sup>(20)</sup> From December 1998 the system of criminal sanctions was extended to introduce administrative penalties and cautions as an alternative to prosecutions.<br>

Notes:<br>

On the fall in detected cases after 1999:<br>

1. In line with the fall in benefit fraud there has been a reduction in the stock of fraud, leading to fewer referrals and fewer cases for investigation.<br>

2. There has also been a more focused approach to investigation with a more selective referral management system. This has enabled us to concentrate on the more serious criminal investigations to maintain the level of sanctions imposed where fraud has been detected.<br>

3. The development of new initiatives such as data matching with other agencies has also played a significant part in this more targeted approach to fraud investigation.<br>

4. We are also introducing a new customer compliance approach as a more effective method of dealing with the lower level frauds that do not need to be investigated to the criminal standard.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what representations he has received on the impact on child poverty of the failure to collect maintenance payments through the Child Support Agency (CSA); and what immediate plans he has to improve CSA collection mechanisms.  [60920]</p>








<p><a name="st_300"><a name="60330w32.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 The failure of non-resident parents to face up to their responsibilities and pay maintenance causes real hardship for their children. The Child Support Agency (CSA) does have powers to enforce payment of maintenance but this is an area where the Agency has not been sufficiently effective. The issue of enforcement appears regularly in correspondence we receive from parents and their representatives. Enforcement will be considered by Sir David Henshaw as part of his work to redesign the child support system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60330w32.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_197">In the shorter term we have announced plans to improve collection of maintenance in the agency&#039;s operational improvement plan. The agency will be using deduction from earnings orders earlier and more frequently for those who either default on other payment arrangements or indicate that they are unlikely to pay. The agency will more actively manage higher risk cases to ensure payments are made and make more use of information held by HMRC and credit reference agencies to track down those who owe money for their children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60330w32.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_198">The CSA will employ external debt collection agencies to recover outstanding debt and use their best practice to improve its own collection activity. Over 600 more staff will be trained and effective within the next year and staffing dedicated to enforcement activity quadrupled over the period of the plan. For those parents who continue to avoid paying maintenance we will significantly increase the number brought before the courts, securing debt through liability orders and seizing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Mar 2006 : Column 1198W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of assets where appropriate. We will also work with the media and stakeholders to develop a campaign to make clear that failing to pay maintenance has real and lasting consequences for children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60330w32.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_199">The cumulative effect of all of these measures will lead to more maintenance being paid and more children lifted out of poverty.

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="60330w34.html_spnew2"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 Invalidity benefit was replaced by incapacity benefit in April 1995. There are a number of reasons why an award of incapacity benefit may be reduced. These include where a claimant has occupational pension income above &#163;85 per week, where a claimant starts work which is not within the permitted work limits where a claimant&#039;s spouse&#039;s earnings increase to a point which extinguishes entitlement to an adult dependency increase, where a claimant is in hospital and where Child Support Agency payments are deducted from benefit. In addition in areas where Jobcentre Plus is rolled-out and in Pathways to Work pilot areas incapacity benefit can also be reduced where a sanction is applied following non-compliance with the conditionality requirements of the benefit. The vast majority of cases have more than one reason for a deduction and it is not possible to disaggregate the information about all these reductions.

 We estimate that since 1997 around 125,000 people have lost some part of their pension due to the insolvency of the sponsoring employer or where the employer no longer exists. We are now collecting information from pension schemes applying to the financial assistance scheme (FAS), which will enable us to provide actual data on the number of affected members in eligible schemes. However, as this information can only be provided by the pension scheme when close to winding up, it is likely to be some time before we have sufficient data to provide robust figures for each constituency and region.

<a name="stpa_220">As explained in my previous answer, based on our most recent data collection for the FAS, we know of around 70,000 non-pensioner members (in 380 schemes) that are potentially eligible for assistance from the FAS as a result of their schemes being wound up in circumstances of insolvency or where the employer no longer exists. In addition to these members we anticipate that a few hundred more schemes, including around 50,000 non-pensioner members and a small number of pensioner members, could come forward and be eligible for assistance. Some of these members may have suffered limited losses and would therefore not be eligible for FAS.
