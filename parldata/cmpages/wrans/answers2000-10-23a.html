<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the value for money of Merseyside TEC's annual contribution to Mersey Partnerships.  [133813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Merseyside TEC is just one of a number of contributors to the Mersey Partnership. A membership forum, which includes Merseyside TEC, regularly meets to review the progress made by the Mersey Partnership on developing investment strategies and the promotion of and response to investment opportunities. We expect the TEC to judge the value of its contribution in the light of this evaluation of progress.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what accountability arrangements are in place to ensure the effective spending of the annual contribution of Merseyside TEC to Mersey Partnerships.  [133814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The Government Office regularly reviews the overall performance of the TEC across the range of standards required by the TEC licensing framework. At the level of individual projects, we expect each TEC to have appropriate evaluation arrangements in place. In addition, Mersey Partnership is accountable to its member organisations for the proper and efficient use of contributions in accordance with the terms of reference of the Partnership.

<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will issue guidance to school governors on how to take account of parental concerns over transport hired for school trips; and if he will make a statement in respect of the written risk assessment requirement of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.  [134147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The written risk assessment in question is contained in the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. Guidance to school governors and others on these matters is already available in "Health and Safety of Pupils on Educational Visits: A Good Practice Guide" (Department for Education and Employment, published in 1998). 58,000 copies have been despatched to schools and other bodies, including the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many students have switched from BEd degree courses to PGCE training courses following the introduction of training salaries; and if he will make a statement.  [134153]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 BEd degrees are undergraduate courses and PGCE training courses are postgraduate. It is therefore unlikely that students will be in a position to switch from one to the other. If students are encouraged to switch to a PGCE route into teaching, in general they would choose not to apply for a BEd course, but take a three-year BA or BSc instead, followed by a PGCE. There will not be evidence of this for another three years.
<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para0">The number of acceptances for BEd courses at UK higher education institutions starting in September 2000, at 10,397 was virtually the same as in September 1999, at 10,433. The number of acceptances for PGCE courses in England and Wales in September 2000 was 20,993, an increase of around 6 per cent. over last year's figure (19,768).
<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para1">The Government announced on 30 March that &#163;6,000 training salaries would be introduced for graduate trainees starting postgraduate initial teacher training courses from September 2000. New style "golden hello" incentives of &#163;4,000 were announced for postgraduate trainees in mathematics, science, modern foreign languages, information technology and design and technology, who successfully complete their induction and go on to take up a relevant teaching post.
<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para2">At the start of April 2000, applications to postgraduate teacher training courses in England and Wales were down by around 11 per cent. compared to the previous year (24,187 compared to 21,537). As a result of the announcement, they are up by around 5 per cent. overall (34,860 compared to 33,056), with particular increases in modern foreign languages (up 20 per cent--2,307 to 2,763) and technology (up 23 per cent.--1,619 to 1,996). The latest acceptance figures show these increases translating into higher acceptances into these shortage subjects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to raise the level of funding for Ofsted following its increased responsibilities in inspecting further education, introduced by the Learning and Skills Bill.  [134102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The overall settlement provided by the Spending Review 2000 for Ofsted is &#163;163 million in 2001-02, an increase of &#163;56 million. This takes account of Ofsted's additional responsibilities, namely inspecting further education, introduced by the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and the regulation of child care, introduced by the Care Standards Act 2000 Ofsted will decide how to allocate its overall settlement across all the areas for which it is responsible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what proportion of the Sure Start budget will derive from his Department.  [134101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Sure Start budget is an addition to the Department for Education and Employment's expenditure limit, and the Secretary of State speaks for Sure Start in Cabinet. The money for Sure Start is carried on a separate Vote, and the Head of the Sure Start Unit reports to a cross-departmental steering group in respect of this expenditure. I am chair of this group.

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, how many bishops there were in <i>(a)</i> 1970, <i>(b)</i> 1980, <i>(c)</i> 1990 and <i>(d)</i> 2000; what the average cost was of supporting a bishop in each of those years at 2000 prices; and what the ratio was of bishops to the average Sunday congregation in each year.  [129656]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The numbers of full-time Diocesan, Suffragan and Assistant Bishops paid by the Church Commissioners in those and other recent years are as follows:

<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para10">The Commissioners do not compile averages of expenditure on bishops because of a number of distorting factors, such as expenditure incurred on discharging national episcopal responsibilities, which would prevent like being compared with like. The total costs of the Church Commissioners' expenditure on bishops in the years in question, adjusted to 2000 prices by reference to the national average earnings index (earnings being the inflation index most appropriate for comparison) are set out.

<a name="01023w01.html_para11">The substantially lower figure in 1980 largely reflects the significant relative deterioration in all clergy stipends in the 1970s.

<a name="01023w01.html_para17">These figures should however be treated with caution. The system for measuring attendance has been and continues to be under periodic review. Consequently the figures quoted are not on a like-for-like basis. Nor do they include attendance in the Diocese in Europe.
<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para18">The methodology now under discussion also recognises that a true picture of church attendance needs to take account of midweek and occasional services as well as those on Sunday. For these reasons, calculating a ratio in the manner suggested could be misleading.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what his timetable is for the implementation of the proposed changes to the Child Support Agency; and what proposals he has to amend assessments made under the existing rules.  [133988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w01.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The child support reforms in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 will be introduced for new cases by April 2002. Parents who have an existing maintenance assessment will be transferred to the new scheme at a later date when the new system is shown to be working well.
<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para19">Maintenance calculations made under the new scheme will be based on a simple percentage of the non-resident parent's net income. This means that many parents with an existing child support assessment will see a change to their liability when they are transferred to the new scheme. The change to the new rate will be phased in over a period of up to five years to give families time to adjust.
<P>

<a name="01023w01.html_para20">The White Paper "A new contract for welfare: Children's Rights and Parents' Responsibilities" (CM 4349) sets out the scheme in more detail and contains tables showing what the basic liability will be at different levels of income.

<a name="01023w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Of the 1,680,000 applications made for budgeting loans in 1999-2000 only 255 were refused because of inability to repay.
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para0">Refusal on these grounds would arise where an applicant who would otherwise be eligible is already repaying a social fund loan at the maximum rate applicable in their circumstances.

<P>
<a name="01023w02.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 A table showing budgeting loan reasons for refusal by client group was not included in the 1999-2000 Annual Report because under the new budgeting loan scheme most of the reasons for refusal have either been changed or abolished. There were previously seven main reasons for refusal and there are now three. Thus, individual reasons for refusal in 1999-2000 do not directly compare with those from previous years. For this reason it was decided that it was more appropriate to include details on the main reasons for refusals in the narrative of the report, paragraphs 7.5 to 7.7.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many households will benefit from the winter heating allowance in Warrington, South in 2000.  [133752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 For winter 1999-2000, 17,061 customers in the Warrington, South constituency qualified for a Winter Fuel Payment of either &#163;100 or &#163;50, dependant on their circumstances. This figure includes those in receipt of one of the qualifying benefits as well as men from age 60 who qualified through receipt of either Income Support or income-based Jobseekers Allowance.
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para4">The Winter Fuel Payment scheme has now been extended so that men as well as women will be eligible for a payment from age 60, providing they satisfy the qualifying criteria. The changes apply from the beginning of the scheme in 1997-98 and payments will be made for past winters to customers who are entitled. The majority of the customers who are newly eligible will need to make a claim.
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para5">This means that the figure given above in respect of 1999-2000 could be higher for winter 2000. How much higher will depend on the number of people who decide to make a claim and how many are entitled.

<P>
<a name="01023w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Addressing the underlying causes of illegal logging in tropical rain forests is complicated and requires a range of actions, not only in the forest sector. For this reason, through the Department for International Development (DFID), we are working to encourage good government, reduce the burden of debt on developing countries and develop alternative livelihoods for the poor.
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para7">Our main efforts are directed at combating illegal logging at source and addressing the other underlying causes of poor forest management, since most illegally harvested timber is consumed domestically. We help countries develop their capacity to assess the nature and extent of illegal logging and to take counter-measures. We help them develop national forest programmes. Early next year, together with the US and World bank, we will sponsor a high-level meeting in South-East Asia to examine what can be done to strengthen enforcement of forestry laws in the region.

In response, the Government are committing departments to seek to buy timber and timber products from sustainable and legal sources, for example those identified under independent certification schemes such as that operated by the Forestry Stewardship Council. Government Departments will have to report annually on their progress, and this will be monitored by an inter-departmental group reporting to the committee of Green Ministers.

 Dr. Kudat's reports are not the property of the Government. Following my hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proposals he has to introduce measures to control fraudulent sales promotions from operators outside the UK; and if he will make a statement. [R] [134148]




<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2000 : Column: 8W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I am concerned about these promotions and am setting out the action the Government are taking to tackle them. The legislation which is currently in place to protect consumers includes:
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para15"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Unsolicited Goods and Services (Amendment) Act 1975, which prevents traders from demanding payment for goods or services which are unsolicited and sets rules on content of invoices and directory entries;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01023w02.html_para16"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988, which enable the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to stop the publication of a misleading advertisement;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01023w02.html_para17"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, which come into force on 31 October, protect consumers shopping on the internet, by mail order, on the telephone or by fax. If suppliers do not fulfil contracts or fail to return consumers' money, the DGFT and local authority Trading Standards Departments can seek injunctions. If fraudulent use is made of a consumer's credit or debit card he or she can cancel the payment;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01023w02.html_para18"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Lotteries and Amusement Act 1976, which sets the rules on competitions (which must entail a degree of skill) and lotteries (which generally cannot be run for private or commercial gain). It is unlawful to promote or advertise a foreign lottery in the UK.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01023w02.html_para19">In addition, when the European Community Directive No. 98/27/EC on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests is implemented in the UK next year, the DGFT and other qualifying bodies will be able to seek injunctions in the courts of other member states to stop operators there from directing false and misleading sales promotions at UK consumers.
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para20">I recognise the problems of taking enforcement action against sales promotion scams originating outside the UK--and particularly from beyond Europe. Apart from jurisdictional constraints on the DGFT and other UK authorities, it is often hard to trace the sales promotion operator. They may hide behind PO box addresses, which are used as solely collection or distribution points for mail. Operators move from country to country to avoid detection and frequently change the postal services they use.
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para21">The Government are working with industry and our regulatory authorities to address this situation. We are determined in particular to improve co-operation and information sharing between authorities in Europe and around the world. The following actions are being taken:
<P>

<a name="01023w02.html_para22"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) works closely with its overseas counterparts from the 30 or so OECD countries, through the International Marketing Supervision Network (IMSN). OFT's counterparts have had some success in stopping some of the worst cases targeting UK consumers;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01023w02.html_para23"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government are pursuing closer bi-lateral enforcement links with other major trading nations outside the EU. We are in discussion with the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about a possible memorandum of understanding on co-operation between the DGFT, UK trading standard departments and the FTC;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01023w02.html_para24"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Royal Mail can refuse to deliver material from abroad which contravenes the law, once it has been notified about it (it cannot intercept or open mail addressed to a PO box). The Advertising Standards Authority (the independent self-regulatory body for the industry), the police, trading standards officers and magistrates can notify Royal Mail about material which contravenes the law. Any UK PO box being used fraudulently will be withdrawn. We are ensuring that ways of bringing scams to the attention of the Post Office are effective and that the avenues by which scam promoters reach consumers are closed off;

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions he has had with

<P><I>23 Oct 2000 : Column: 10W</I><P>
ministerial colleagues on compensation for payment by public bodies after 30 days of invoices from small businesses.  [134113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 currently seeks to recompense the supplier for the time value of money. It does not currently provide for the cost of pursuing the debt.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para32">The Government are aware that legislation in other EU countries includes charges for the pursuit of the debt, and we have worked closely with our European partners on the forthcoming EC Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para33">We welcome the recent publication of the Council and Parliament approved text and we are keen to work with the business community and ministerial colleagues to ensure that the Directive is implemented as soon as possible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Efford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will ensure that small businesses automatically receive interest from public bodies on late payments made after 30 days of being invoiced.  [134111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government currently have no plans to make changes to the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para34">The Act came into force on 1 November 1998. From that date, small businesses have had an automatic right to claim interest from the public sector on debts incurred under contracts agreed after that date.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Efford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he has taken to ensure that public bodies settle invoices from small businesses within a 30 day period.  [134112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 All Government Departments and Agencies are required to pay all undisputed bills within 30 days of receipt of the goods or services or a valid invoice, whichever is later, or other agreed credit period. Since 1993 all Government Departments and Agencies have been required to monitor their payment performance. The figures are published annually in the form of a written PQ.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para35">Tough targets have been set to ensure that we continue to improve public sector payment performance. For 1997-98 all Departments were required to pay 95 per cent. of their invoices on time, 97.5 per cent. was introduced for 1998-99 and 100 per cent. for 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para36">For the financial year 1999-2000, the overall payment performance of Government was 97.89 per cent.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made an Order under the Fair Trading Act 1973 on 1 August to implement the recommendations in the Competition Commission report on the supply of new cars.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the selective elimination and reduction of import duties on products imported into the UK under EU preferences enables eligible third country producers to benefit from a combination of stronger export pricing power, larger export sales and increased competitiveness in EU markets relative to third country producers that are not eligible to participate in EU preferences.  [133709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Increased preferences will benefit those third country producers eligible to receive them. Those producers overall should experience larger export sales and/or higher returns on exports, as a result of their increased competitiveness in the EU market.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para37">A reduction in the normal level (i.e. MFN) of import duties lessens the value of preferential tariffs offered by the EC. In products where preferences are offered, their erosion tends to weaken and not strengthen the export pricing power of exporters receiving preferences compared with those who do not. Against this, however, the elimination or steady reduction of import duties in general improves the market access of those receiving preferences and offers scope for expansion of exports in other products.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if third country exporters and producers are expected to derive benefit from their participation in the import preferences granted their products under the EU's preferential trade-related agreements.  [133708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Third country exporters and producers granted trade preferences are expected to benefit from them through increased exports to the EU.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para38">A general reduction in import duties would reduce the value of trade preference. However, developing countries could benefit from the general reduction of tariffs in sectors where they have particular comparative cost advantage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he published each of the regulations on <i>(a)</i> part-time working, <i>(b)</i> job-sharing and <i>(c)</i> career breaks for police officers and Police Service civilians; how this information has been disseminated and at what cost; how many officers and civilians will have taken these options by the end of the first year of their introduction; and what his estimate is for each of the next five years.

 Part-time working and job-sharing arrangements for police officers were introduced by Force Order on 24 July 1997. There is currently no facility for career breaks although police officers can and do take periods of unpaid leave.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para45">Northern Ireland Civil Service Circulars introduced part-time working and job-sharing arrangements for civilian support staff on 14 August 1987. Career breaks followed on 28 March 1998.,
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para46">Costs associated with issuing information on these schemes are not readily available.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para47">Eight police officers availed of part-time working in the first year of operation (September 1997 to August 1998). To date, no police officers have opted for job-sharing. Figures relating to the first year of the civilian schemes are not available.
<P>

<a name="01023w03.html_para48">It is difficult to project the potential uptake of each scheme over the next five years, but given that 25 police officers have availed of part-time working since its introduction, it is reasonable to assume that up to 40 officers may avail of the scheme during the next five years. Similarly, up to 25 civilian support staff may be expected to take up part-time or job-sharing with the same number taking career breaks.

During the course of its work, the Sub-Committee has sought the views of officers through the participation of staff representatives on the committee; held roadshows throughout the Force; issued and analysed responses to a survey; examined problems with the existing uniform and sourced five years of research on this issue carried out by a committee within the Association of Chief Police Officers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 25 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 550W, (1) on the Chinook crash, whether the emergency power warning lights were switched on at the time of the impact at the Wilmington crash;  [133755]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The incident at Wilmington, USA in 1989 concerned a Chinook HC1 that sustained severe damage. One engine and the transmission/rotor system were over-stressed, while undergoing tests on the ground as part of development testing of a pre-production FADEC system. While the incident was caused by deficient test procedures, development standard FADEC was a factor.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para0">The aircraft did not leave the ground, and there was no crash or impact of any sort, consequently the Air Accidents Investigation Branch placed no part in the subsequent investigations. Rather, a MOD(PE) Unit Inquiry into the incident was held at Wilmington in 1989. The records of that Inquiry do not report whether or not any emergency power warning lights had been illuminated.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The examination of the FADEC system of Chinook ZD576 was carried out by a Senior Inspector of Air Accidents (Engineering) of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) as part of their independent technical investigation as advisers to the RAF Board of Inquiry into the accident. In conducting the examination the AAIB followed its normal procedures. The FADEC manufacturers took part in the FADEC investigation at the behest of the AAIB to enable it to conduct its investigation more effectively. This type of assistance is routine in such technical investigations and any testing carried out by a manufacturer is directed and supervised by a member of the AAIB to ensure impartial and unbiased advice is received. The level of contractor involvement was consistent with normal practice in military and civil aircraft accident investigations.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para1">FADEC failure was one of the possibilities considered by the Board of Inquiry. The AAIB examined the engine change units and FADEC in some detail. The Board of Inquiry report contains nothing to link the accident to the FADEC system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All medical investigations following military accidents, including the 1994 Chinook crash and the crash on 1 June 1995 of Harrier GR7 ZG475, are carried out to standards agreed by NATO, and these are comparable to those of the Air Accidents Investigation Board for similar investigations following civil aircraft accidents. Medical investigations into fatal accidents for RAF Boards of Inquiry include an evaluation of the aircrew's medical history and an examination of the remains in an autopsy. However the latter may be limited by the degree of destruction to the body, often encountered in high speed accidents.

 At the time of the RAF Board of Inquiry into the Mull of Kintyre accident, Sir William Wratten was not aware of this litigation and did not recall the Wilmington incident that led to this legal action being taken.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para2">Sir John Day was aware that there had been a problem with FADEC testing, but did not know of the extent of the Department's legal claim.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para3">Regardless of this, the investigation into the accident was very thorough. All possible causes, including FADEC, were examined, but no evidence was found of technical malfunction.

<a name="01023w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Both the report of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the statement given by Mr. R. Parkinson form part of the RAF Board of Inquiry report concerning this accident which is not in the public domain. I regret that it is our policy to provide such Board of Inquiry reports only to those directly involved, such as the next of kin of the deceased, although of course there is nothing to stop them copying the report further if they wish to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the function of the Institute of Flight Safety; and what role it performed in the Inquiry into the crash of RAF Chinook ZD576.  [133994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The principal aim of the Royal Air Force Inspectorate of Flight Safety (IFS) is to increase the operational effectiveness of the RAF through the promotion and development of flight safety. This is done by providing specialist flight safety advice, guidance and data to assist in eliminating unnecessary flying related risks that contribute to aircraft accidents. One of the core functions of IFS is to advise Boards of Inquiry on the procedural aspects of running such an Inquiry. This is undertaken by two trained Service accident investigation

advisers, who also act as the first point of contact for all external agencies during the initial stages of an Inquiry. These tasks were carried out in the case of the Mull of Kintyre accident but IFS took no part in the actual Inquiry.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer my right hon. Friend Lord Robertson, the then Secretary of State for Defence, gave on 6 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 52, to my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth, (Mr. Healey). Canada has acquired the four ex-Royal Navy Upholder class submarines. The acquisition takes the form of an eight year lease with an option of outright purchase.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para7">The first of the submarines was handed over to Canada on 6 October 2000 and the three remaining submarines will follow over the next 18 months.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para8">The arrangement, which includes the submarines, training and initial spares, is worth some 610 million Canadian dollars.
<P>

<a name="01023w05.html_para9">No other submarine sales or transfers to Canada have taken place over the last three years or are planned over the next three years.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Formation Communication System is now known as project 'FALCON'. The Procurement Strategy was revised in 2000 to take account of Smart Procurement principles and is to purchase the FALCON equipment in successive increments, enabling the best value for money and the most up-to-date technology to be acquired for the armed forces. Invitations To Tender for a competitive Concept Phase to study the most appropriate technology and procurement options for the early FALCON trances were issued to six UK-based companies on 3 July 2000. Five responses were received. These have been assessed and it is intended to place four contracts later this year in order to study a range of different approaches to meeting the requirement.</FONT></UL>

 Modernising Defence is not a single initiative; the term covers a number of areas of work where we are improving the management of defence.
<P>

<a name="01023w06.html_para1">This work builds on the modernisation and reshaping of our armed forces set out in the Strategic Defence Review. We are introducing a new Performance Management system, implementing Resource Accounting and Budgeting and conducting a review of our defence training needs.
<P>

<a name="01023w06.html_para2">Modernising Defence also includes the work of five project groups that were formed in the Ministry of Defence to seek ideas for ways to improve our policy formulation, to address the needs of our people, to explore ways for the Ministry of Defence to work more closely with other Government Departments, and other public sector bodies, to look at our information needs, and more generally to examine what people need to help them do their jobs. These groups have now made their recommendations, and these have been agreed by the Defence Management Board who have set in hand an action plan for implementation. The plan includes the formation of an External Relations Unit to act as a Gateway between Ministry of Defence and other Government Departments and regional bodies and the appointment of a new Director General for Information to draw together an Information Strategy for the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
<a name="01023w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The OCCAR Convention was signed by the Defence Ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom in September 1998. Following the passage of the relevant legislation through Parliament earlier this year, the United Kingdom ratified the Convention on 3 May and deposited its instrument of ratification on 11 May. France and Germany have also completed the ratification process, and Italy has presented 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2000 : Column: 35W</I><P>
the Convention to its Parliament. We expect Italy to complete the ratification process by the end of this year, after which OCCAR will have its own legal identity.
<P>

<a name="01023w07.html_para1">OCCAR is already responsible for the management of seven European collaborative defence equipment programmes under existing administrative arrangements. Two of these involve the UK: the Counter Battery Radar (COBRA) programme; and the Multi Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV) programme. Other programmes will be integrated into OCCAR in due course, as appropriate.

We have no current plans to recruit another Battalion of Gurkhas.
<P>

<a name="01023w07.html_para2">There are 3,357 Gurkhas currently serving with the British Army, of whom approximately 2,100 serve in an infantry role. This represents 7.7 per cent. of the whole Army infantry strength.

The cost of this contract is commercially confidential and I am therefore withholding it in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which relates to Third Party's commercial confidences.

<a name="01023w07.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The AGM-65G2 Maverick Medium Range missile is a proven "off the shelf" missile. No development costs were incurred by the RAF. However, some &#163;1.5 million was spent on aircraft integration and proof of concept work. The whole life cost of the Maverick programme is approximately &#163;55 million, inclusive of VAT. This includes the cost of procurement, integration, training, and a Contractor Logistic Support package. The programme will last some five years, with the first missiles being deployed by the end of the year.

In addition, articles will be provided for Services' in-house news publications, appropriate families' and dependants' journals and single Service websites. A reference to section 7 of the RPA 2000 will be included, explaining to those with a Service qualification that they will have the option of either still registering annually to vote by means of a Service declaration, or registering in the same way as other voters if the appropriate residence criteria are met. The articles will complement the laying before Parliament of the regulations for electoral registration.

<a name="01023w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence would have no objection in principle to any such development and indeed could see some operational advantages to the construction of such a container port. However, any such development would have to take careful account of the special requirements that would be associated with the construction of a civilian facility adjacent to a strategic military asset. In particular, we would need to review carefully the impact of security at the port, together with associated access and safety issues. If any such development were to be taken forward, the MOD would need to be involved at the earliest opportunity to ensure that the capability of this important military facility was not compromised. Necessarily, this would demand that the MOD's requirements were addressed fully within the planning process.

 Officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) may apply to transfer to forces in England and Wales. Officers recruited through inter-force transfers to police forces in England and Wales, and the London area are generally excluded from calculating recruitment for the purposes of determining Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) grant entitlement. It has been agreed to make an exception to this in the case of RUC officers.
<P>

<a name="01023w11.html_para4">Members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve Force (RUCR) are not members of the RUC and are therefore not eligible to transfer to any police force in England and Wales. They may apply to join forces in England and Wales subject to meeting the normal entry requirements of the force to which they apply.
<P>

<a name="01023w11.html_para5">Retraining is a matter for individual forces. They must assess what training is required for any transferees joining their force, paying particular attention to local (force) procedures.

 The UK is a member of the European Union. Our proposal would remove a layer of bureaucracy and make it easier for anyone who wants to fly the European Union flag to do so from any location where there is a flagstaff. Any national flags may already be flown without planning consent. The flying of the European Union flag would not be subject to planning restrictions therefore there would be no right of appeal. I have received four representations about this proposal, three from hon. Members and one from a member of the public.

 The Government give general grant funding to local authorities to enable them to meet their responsibilities, including environmental health. In the current Spending Review period from 2001-02 to 2003-04, standard spending assessments and Government grant to councils will increase in real terms by an average of over 3 per cent. a year. The Environment Protective and Cultural Services block settlement, which covers councils' responsibilities in this area, is the best for many years, with 1.8 per cent. real terms increases each year and 2.7 per cent. more in 2001-02 than previously planned.
<P>

<a name="01023w11.html_para9">At a local level, the extent of the funding for environmental health officers is, however, a matter for individual councils bearing in mind their statutory responsibilities, their priorities and the wishes of their electorate.

 The size and capacity of waste management facilities must be considered on a site by site basis, taking account of the location, quantity and nature of material to be dealt with, transport issues and other considerations.

 It is a fact that ship-tracking systems do work and serve their primary purpose of establishing the location of ships at sea using satellite technology. I understand that their widespread use can be taken as a good indicator of their reliability. Although my Department is not directly involved in assessing the effectiveness of such systems we have consulted the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) who have actively promoted use of the tracking system called 'Shiploc' as an effective counter piracy measure, particularly in cases where the objective is to steal the ship. This allows shipping companies to monitor their vessels' progress, to know quickly if the ship has a particular difficulty and to track it after an incident. IMB have advised my Department that, in their opinion, the system has deterrent value, although it is difficult to separate the direct benefits of this from those of the other measures which are being implemented to counter the piracy problem. Other ship tracking systems are also available on the market (e.g. Fleet Remote Monitoring System (FROM)). It is not

has to require local authorities to publish written policies on housing people suffering <i>(a)</i> racial harassment and <i>(b)</i> domestic violence.  [133820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department has made it clear in this year's Housing Investment Programme (HIP) guidance to local authorities that we will wish to see evidence that 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2000 : Column: 59W</I><P>
authorities have robust measures in place to tackle racial harassment. My Department is also working closely with the Home Office, the lead Department on anti-social behaviour, to take forward the recommendations made by the Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team (PAT) 8 on anti-social behaviour. One of those recommendations is that all social landlords should adopt a non-harassment clause in their tenancy agreements, and make clear the action that will be taken if the clause is breached.
<P>

<a name="01023w13.html_para1">This year's HIP guidance also makes it clear that my Department expects local housing authorities to set out in their housing strategy statements a comprehensive approach to addressing the housing and support needs of all vulnerable groups in the community--and this includes victims of domestic violence. Several recent Government publications, among them "Multi-agency guidance for addressing domestic violence" (March 2000) set out key issues which all agencies need to bear in mind, when developing their strategies with regard to domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="01023w13.html_para2">The Supporting people programme, which comes into effect in 2003, will require local authorities to audit the housing care and support needs of all vulnerable groups in their communities, and publish their strategies to meet these needs. The DETR/DoH/Women's unit has commissioned research on the availability of accommodation and support services for women accepted as homeless as a result of domestic violence. This research will collect information for the first time ever on the accommodation and support services provided by women's refuge groups and other providers, and measure households' satisfaction with the different accommodation and support needs available . The research project will produce guidance for local authorities on the option for meeting the needs of these households. This research and guidance will inform local authorities' strategies for Supporting People.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We propose to commission researchers to work alongside the pilot authorities to monitor and evaluate the schemes and produce good practice guidance for social landlords drawing from the lessons learnt from the pilot schemes. We will be publishing the research findings and good practice guidance after the pilots are complete. We also plan to keep people informed about the progress of the pilot schemes during the implementation and evaluation process and will be issuing regular newsletters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Local housing authorities provide quarterly statistical returns to the DETR about statutory homelessness which include details of all applicants accepted as having a priority need for accommodation because they are vulnerable. These returns are monitored on a continual basis. The Department has also commissioned research into local authority policy and

practice on housing allocation, transfers and homelessness. The research is due to be published later this year and includes some analysis of the consistency of local housing authorities assessment of the vulnerability of homeless applicants under Part VII of the Housing act 1996.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement in respect of safety protection required in the event of a frontal impact to <i>(a)</i> children and adults travelling on coaches and <i>(b)</i> children and adults travelling on a double or single decker bus if <i>(a)</i> sitting and <i>(b)</i> standing.  [134186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Other than the provisions for seat belts there are no specific safety requirements directed at frontal impact accidents in buses or coaches.
<P>

<a name="01023w13.html_para3">Seat belts must be available in coaches when groups of children are taken on organised trips. In coaches first used after 1 October 1988, whether adults or children are being carried, seat belts are required in the front passenger seats and in any rear seat which is not immediately behind a forward facing seat. Where a lap type seat belt is fitted to a seat the area in front must be soft or of other energy absorbing construction. Other than in these conditions the fitment and use of seat belts is optional. However, we recently consulted on the proposals to require seat belts to be provided in all new buses and coaches apart from those specifically designed to carry standing passengers. We plan that these requirements will take effect next year.

 The selection of sites of special scientific interest is a devolved matter. In England statutory consultations on the notification or re-notification of 29 sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) are taking place in relation to possible special areas of conservation. These matters are being taken forward by English Nature to incorporate changes and additions in England to the UK list of candidate special areas of conservation transmitted, in accordance with the EC Habitats Directive, to the European Commission in July 1999.

 The AAIB provides assistance to military Boards of Inquiry convened to investigate the circumstances of aircraft accidents under the provisions of a Memorandum of Understanding that deals with mutual assistance between the AAIB and the Royal Air Force. The formal position of the AAIB Inspector is that of an adviser to the President of the Board of Inquiry. The role usually extends to providing assistance with the detailed examination of wreckage and the replay and analysis of any flight recorders fitted to the aircraft.

<a name="01023w14.html_para0">The Royal Air Force provides guidance to Presidents of Board of Inquiry about the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to seek the AAIB's assistance. These circumstances include accidents involving structural failure, fire in the air and any other circumstances where the immediate causes of the accident are unclear.

 As far as I am aware, there are no clear precedents, other than those mentioned, since 1970 (though there are earlier precedents). I am afraid the House's records are not held in a form which enables me to give a more definitive response.

[134048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The cost of ascertaining how many telephones make use of touch tone steering systems has been estimated as &#163;700 in respect of The Court Service and &#163;985 in respect of the Land Registry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 No staff savings have been made as a result of the use of the touch tone steering system installed in the Public Record Office on its Family Records Centre inquiry line. The steering system was installed to enable the Family Records Centre to cope with a significant increase in the number of telephone calls without increasing the size of its staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew8"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The work generated from calls to the touch tone steering system can be scheduled around less busy periods, and so the Public Trust Office estimates that there has been a notional saving in the hours worked equivalent to one member of staff.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what consultation his Department has had with the Trustees of <i>(a)</i> the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund and <i>(b)</i> the House of Commons Pension Fund about their losing the services of the Public Trust Office.  [134032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew11"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The report of the Quinquennial Review of the Public Trust Office was circulated as a consultation document to a wide group of stakeholders and organisations with a potential interest. Copies of this report were placed in the Libraries of both Houses. On 14 November 1999 I sent copies to the hon. Member for Bournemouth West (Mr. Butterfill) and to the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor), the Chairmen of these funds, offering to meet them to discuss the changes. I wrote again to both MPs on this subject on 7 May. Throughout, Public Trust Office officials have been in communication with officials of these pension funds.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what continuing safeguards are to be in place to protect clients with less than &#163;10,000 and their funds after those funds have been transferred elsewhere from the Public Trust Office.  [134033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew12"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In cases where the Public Trustee is discharged as Receiver by the Court of Protection the Court must be satisfied that the client continues to be protected. In those cases where there is an external receiver (for example, a relative or solicitor), receivers are required to continue to keep a full record of transactions concluded on behalf of the client; the Court of Protection can call for an account at any time; and it is intended to call for an account in a percentage of these cases as a matter of administrative routine.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department where the replacement body for the Public Trust Office will be located.  [134036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew13"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The replacement body for the Public Trust Office will be located in Greater London.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what measures he is taking to ensure that the cost to Public Trust Office clients does not increase if solicitors are appointed as last resort receivers and are permitted to charge on a timed basis.  [134037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew14"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 It is intended that the affairs of Public Trustee Receivership clients be transferred to a number of new service providers, not just solicitors. Where appropriate, the new receiver will be a family member (who will not charge a fee) or a local authority.
<P>

<a name="01023w15.html_para1">The appointment of a new receiver in Public Trustee Receivership cases is at the discretion of the Court of Protection and the Master of the Court will consider whether the appointment is in the best interests of the client. The expected costs of the new receiver will be considered by the Court as part of this process.




<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2000 : Column: 68W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01023w15.html_para2">There is, however, a strong argument that clients should pay the market rate for work undertaken on their behalf if they can afford to do so. Where solicitors take on receivership work, charges are either on a fixed costs or on a timed basis. If the charge is on a timed basis, bills will be verified by the Supreme Court Costs Office to ensure that the number of hours billed is reasonable, and that the hourly rate is within the guidelines set.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) what guarantees will be given to clients that losses to clients arising from fraud or mismanagement will continue to be made good when clients' investments currently managed by the Public Fund Office Receivership Division, Trust Division and Court Funds Office are managed by an external custodian;  [134038]
<P>
<UL>(2) who will be responsible for the compensation given to Public Trust Office clients for losses on investments and fraud where such investments are made by an external custodian.  [134039]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew15"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Some of the Public Trust Office's existing clients already have assets held externally and, depending upon the arrangements, they may have recourse to statutory compensation schemes, and where appropriate, will be protected by the custodian's insurance policy. The regulatory authorities require companies undertaking custodian work to ensure that proper segregation of assets is maintained.
<P>

<a name="01023w15.html_para3">The Public Trust Office will ensure, in setting up any contract with external custodians, and on an ongoing basis, that rigorous auditing arrangements are in place to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and that companies have suitable insurance cover.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what level of staffing is proposed for the body replacing the Public Trust Office.  [134035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w15.html_spnew16"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Work is still proceeding to determine the exact size of the organisation that will replace the Public Trust Office so it is too early to give exact figures for the level of staffing that will be required. I shall, however, by the year end, be able to offer a specific estimate of the number of staff likely to be required for the new organisation as at April 2001. That number will be expected to reduce over time as the Public Trustee receivership work is transferred to other service providers and business efficiencies are implemented.

 Together with my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office I attended the Informal European Council in Biarritz on 13-14 October.
<P>

<a name="01023w16.html_para4">This informal European Council was asked to take stock of progress of the Inter-Governmental Conference on Treaty change. It was inevitably overshadowed by the violence in the Middle East. The European Council issued an appeal to both sides to end the violence and return to the Conference table. The Foreign Secretary, who had been in the Middle East, reported to his colleagues on his discussions in the region. Collectively, and individually, I and the Foreign Secretary and other European leaders were actively engaged behind the scenes at the European Council in trying to create the conditions in which the Sharm-el-Sheikh Summit could take place. The European Council asked Mr. Solana to return to the region and he represented the European Union at Sharm-el-Sheikh.

<a name="01023w16.html_para5">Members of the European Council also held a meeting with President Kostunica of Serbia. The European Union played a prominent role in pressurising the Milosevic regime. Its defeat represents a significant victory for democracy, not only in Serbia but throughout the Balkans and for Europe as a whole. The purpose of Saturday's meeting between EU Heads of Government and President Kostunica was to reaffirm our support for Serbian democracy. The European Council decided to make available 200 million euros of emergency aid for Serbia on top of the measures which were announced at the General Affairs Council on 9 October.
<P>

<a name="01023w16.html_para6">As far as the Inter-Governmental Conference was concerned, this was not a Summit at which decisions were to be taken. Political progress was, however, made towards the agreement which we want to see reached at the Nice Summit in December. That Summit will pave the way to the enlargement which has long been the objective of successive British Governments.
<P>

<a name="01023w16.html_para7">On the detail of these negotiations, I made clear our support for the extension of majority voting in the areas where this will benefit Britain, for example by enhancing the efficiency of the Single Market as well as the economic reform which we have, with others, consistently sought, while making clear that these areas did not include tax or social security.
<P>

<a name="01023w16.html_para8">The European Council agreed that there was a role for enhanced co-operation in an enlarged European Union. In other words, there is scope for some member states moving ahead on certain policies faster than others but these so-called enhanced co-operations must be genuinely open to all and must not undermine the existing policies of the Union, especially the Single Market. If these conditions are satisfied, the Government believe that enhanced co-operation can be useful in advancing the British agenda, for example in co-operation in common foreign and security policy within the framework of agreed policies and in co-operation in the fight against international crime and terrorism.
<P>

<a name="01023w16.html_para9">In this negotiation, Britain has a significant interest in seeing a reweighting of votes so that the position of the larger member states, which has deteriorated in relative terms with successive enlargements, is improved. That is also a necessary outcome of the negotiation if we are to agree to a reduction in the size of the Commission. This issue is sometimes seen as one in which the larger member states and the small member states have opposing interests. We believe it should be possible to reach an agreement which meets the interests of all.

<a name="01023w16.html_para10">The Charter of Rights so ably negotiated by my noble and learned Friend, Lord Goldsmith, was discussed by the Heads of Government who agreed that it should be adopted at the Nice European Council as a purely political declaration. It creates no legal obligations. It also sets out in a clear way a range of rights, freedoms and principles recognised within the EU which the EU institutions--the primary addressees--should respect when going about their daily business. It only applies to member states to the limited extent that they are implementing Union-wide laws. It has no application where national governments are acting purely within their own areas of national competence.

<a name="01023w17.html_para2">Insolvency proceedings are taken only as a last resort by the Inland Revenue, after all other attempts to secure settlement or negotiate acceptable proposals for payment have failed.

A system to provide concessionary parking for these workers on emergency calls is currently in operation. It is called the Health Emergency Badge. The general attitude of the London Boroughs to routine visits is that these workers must plan time to park legally and pay the relevant fees (for which they may then receive reimbursement from their employer). Whether or not some routine work should be excused from normal parking rules is down to individual London Boroughs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what information his Department has obtained concerning the use of bovine material in the manufacture of vaccines.  [134324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w19.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 European guidelines issued in 1999 made clear that the manufacturing process for medicinal products should not use bovine materials from countries in which there are known cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. The first guidance on this subject was issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines in 1989. From 1989 onwards, the Medicines Control Agency 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2000 : Column: 79W</I><P>
sought and received assurances from drug companies that they were implementing this guidance and subsequent guidance produced at a European level on a phased basis.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para0">On the advice of the MCA, my noble Friend the Under-Secretary, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, informed the House on 4 May 2000 that the 1989 guidelines obliged all pharmaceutical companies to source bovine material from outside the United Kingdom. My noble Friend is now advised by the MCA that these 1989 guidelines did not have the full force of law and that they applied to injectable medicines and medicines applied to the eyes or open wounds. However, the 1999 guidelines do apply to bovine materials and pharmaceuticals generally. From March 2001, these guidelines, which at present are not legally binding, will have the full force of the law.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para1">My noble Friend also informed the House on 4 May 2000 that vaccines that use bovine material in the manufacturing process manufactured since March 1989 had used bovine material from non-UK sources and that the MCA had established that the latest date that vaccines manufactured before the guidelines came into force could have been used was November 1993. On 28 March 2000, I informed Parliament on the advice of the MCA that from April 1989 no bovine materials sourced in the United Kingdom were introduced as an element of the manufacturing process for vaccines produced at that time. In particular I told the House on the advice of the MCA that all vaccines manufactured by Wellcome after 1989 used bovine material from New Zealand. I also informed the House on 19 October 1999 on the advice of the MCA that since 1993 all vaccines in use were manufactured without UK-sourced bovine material. I have now been advised that the advice from the MCA that formed the basis of these statements was incorrect. The MCA was provided with information by manufacturers.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para2">The MCA advised Ministers last week that in the case of the Wellcome oral polio vaccine, the assurances given by the company have proved inaccurate. This oral polio vaccine was originally produced by Wellcome. Part of Wellcome's vaccine business was transferred over to Medeva in 1991. Part of the oral polio vaccine was manufactured in 1985 using growth medium containing fetal calf serum of UK bovine origin, and this element continued to be used in the production process after 1989.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para3">This oral polio vaccine continued to be use up until 2000, in specific breach of the 1999 guidance. The Department of Health has therefore recalled this oral polio vaccine manufactured by Medeva (supplied by Medeva under the brand name Evans).
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para4">The MCA have carried out a risk assessment and people who have received this oral polio vaccine in the past can be advised that the breach is of guidance which has been formulated on a precautionary basis; under the European guidelines, fetal calf serum is in category IV (no detectable infectivity); the processes used in manufacturing are designed to remove all but a remote trace of unwanted proteins such as fetal calf serum. The MCA, taking all these points together, have advised that any risk associated with this Medeva oral polio vaccine is incalculably small.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para5">I asked the CSM in March to produce a comprehensive assessment of BSE-related issues in vaccines. The Government are committed to publishing the assessment.

 The national recruitment, retention and vacancy survey published September 2000 gave us the latest authoritative data on staff vacancies from 100 per cent. of National Health Service trusts. It shows that 2.6 per cent. of other scientific, technical and therapeutic posts have been vacant for 3 months or more (in England). We are ensuring that effective recruitment and retention policies are in place to make the best use of trained staff, including biomedical scientists and other pathology staff, and that training levels are sufficient to get a better match between supply and demand.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para6">In October, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State published the performance management framework for human resources for the whole of the NHS. The way employers treat their staff will in future be part of the core performance measures and linked to the financial resources they receive. Included in the framework is the improving working lives standard which summarises the commitment expected from employers to create well- managed, flexible working environments that support staff, promote their welfare and development, tackle violence and racism, and respect their need to manage a health and productive work/life balance.
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para7">In July 2000, a new careers recruitment leaflet was produced for scientists and technicians and the NHS careers information service was extended to include scientists and technicians (0845 6060655 or www.nhs.uk/careers)
<P>

<a name="01023w19.html_para8">For 1999-2000, to help improve recruitment and retention, newly qualified biomedical scientists received pay increases of 7.1 per cent; trainee biomedical scientists up to 26 per cent; newly qualified cytology screeners up to 11.4 per cent; and trainee cytology screeners up to 6.6 per cent. For 2000-01, all NHS pathology staff received increases of 3.25 per cent. or &#163;300, whichever is the higher, and a formula for 2001-02 is agreed.

<a name="01023w20.html_para9">Larval therapy is part of the wound care appraisal currently being undertaken by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. The appraisal will determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of debriding agents in treating difficult to heal surgical wounds. It will also evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of treating patients with difficult to heal surgical wounds by means of specialist wound care (eg at specialised wound care clinics) as compared to conventional care. NICE will review the available research evidence but will not itself commission further clinical research. NICE are expected to report on this appraisal in spring 2001.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Prescription Cost Analysis data are based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Total prescriptions include not only prescriptions originating from general practices in England but also from hospital doctors and dentists provided they were dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in 



England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions. Health authority data cover prescriptions dispensed in that health authority.<P>

2. The net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug and does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.<P>

3. Drugs used in the treatment of dementia are those defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) section 4.11, "Drugs for dementia".<P>

4. North West Anglia Health Authority ceased to exist from 1 April 1999. The existing practices and contractors were reallocated to Cambridge and Norfolk Health Authorities.<P>

5. Health authorities where the number of prescription items dispensed was less than 50 have been removed due to confidentiality issues <P>

 The information available is derived from the United Kingdom Renal Registry and from provisional data collected in the renal survey commissioned by the Department of Health. It is estimated that 21,150 new adult patients were accepted for kidney dialysis between 1995 and 1999, although a small percentage of these patients will not have started dialysis. The age distribution of these patients at the time they were accepted for kidney dialysis is shown in the table:

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the benefits of using <i>(a)</i> adult stem cells and <i>(b)</i> stem cells from embryos created by therapeutic cloning in treating damage to the brain, internal organs, bone and other tissues and organs.  [134257]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01023w22.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Chief Medical Officer's Expert Group in its report "Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility" concluded that research involving the extraction and use of stem cells raised the prospect of a range of exciting new therapeutic possibilities for the repair of diseased or damaged tissues including repairing nerve cells lost in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, replacing lost heart muscle cells in cases of congestive heart failure, bone cells in osteoporosis, liver cells in cases of hepatitis or cirrhosis and so on.
<P>

<a name="01023w22.html_para0">The Expert Group concluded that embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into a far greater range of tissues than adult derived stem cells. The Group went on to say that while the long term promise of stem cells derived from adult tissue may equal or even surpass that of embryonic stem cells it was probable that scientific advances from embryonic stem cell research would be necessary to understand how to make greater use of stem cells derived from adult tissue.

 Linked to the recent introduction of a statutory maximum price scheme for generic medicines, the government abolished Category D of Part VIII of the Drug Tariff with effect from September prescriptions and replaced it with more tightly controlled arrangements for reimbursing pharmacists fairly when due to shortage they have no alternative but to purchase a more expensive product.
<P>

 Reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO) contain valuable information, which can helpfully inform government policy but, unless they are incorporated into United Kingdom law, their status is advisory rather than mandatory. Technical guidance on methods of measurement of fluoride, and their interpretation, and on fluoridation of mild, is included in recent WHO publications such as Technical Report 846 "Fluorides and oral health" (1994) and "Monitoring of renal fluoride excretion in community preventive programmes on oral health" (1999).

 The Ministry was notified by the police on 7 August 1999 that mink had been released from the fur farm. The Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, an Executive agency of the Ministry, immediately visited the site to investigate the incident. They found that the perimeter fence had been breached in two places by being cut. It was estimated that between 50 and 100 mink escaped outside the farm and were unaccounted for.

The requirements of the Data Protection Act 1988 further precludes release of lists of names and addresses.

<a name="01023w24.html_para2">My Department is funding the Sea Mammal Research Unit to undertake a three year project following on from earlier EU-funded work, including research at sea on the use of pingers to deter porpoises from nets. The new project which began in July will consider in detail why harbour porpoises become entangled in gill nets and seek to identify modifications to fishing gear which will reduce bycatches. If this work is successful I will encourage the UK industry to make the necessary adaptations and will also seek action at the EU level. In this regard, I welcomed the statement by Franz Fischler, the European Fisheries Commissioner, at the June Fisheries Council on the need to address the problem of cetacean bycatch.

<P>
<a name="01023w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are committed to managing cod stocks on the basis of the precautionary approach in order to keep them away from levels at which there is a serious risk of collapse and to help rebuild them for the future. Cod stocks generally are in poor shape, with unusually low recruitment of young fish, which may be due in part to climatic factors. This is reflected in the reduced TACs agreed for 2000 and lower landings by fishermen this year compared with 1999.
<P>

<a name="01023w24.html_para4">We have already demonstrated our willingness to support strong short term measures when needed. The UK took the lead in securing the Irish Sea cod recovery programme developed in close consultation with the industry and adopted in the EU earlier this year. This should help rebuild the depleted cod stock in the Irish Sea. It includes closing spawning areas in the Irish Sea from mid-February to the end of April to protect spawning cod as well as new technical conservation measures to improve protection for young cod.

 The figures given in the Spending Review 2000 for the Forestry Commission cover its net expenditure for GB core functions and activities in England. Although the Commission's activities in Wales were not covered by the Review, a &#163;5.5 million baseline for Wales is also included for each year because responsibility for the Commission's expenditure in Wales has not yet transferred to the National Assembly. Responsibility for the Commission's expenditure in Scotland has already been transferred to the Scottish Parliament. The Commission has no remit in Northern Ireland; forestry matters there are administered by the Forest Service of the Northern Ireland Assembly's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
