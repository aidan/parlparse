Last year we published Taking Action&#151;the UK&#039;s strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world&quot;, and committed at least &#163;1.5 billion to tackling HIV and AIDS over the next three years. Of this, at least &#163;150 million will go into supporting orphans and children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS. The UK was one of the first countries to endorse UNICEF&#039;s Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support of Orphans and Children Made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS&quot;.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">DFID is working directly with national governments to support the development and implementation of national programmes for the support and care of children affected. In Mozambique we have given funding to help the Government properly track its programmes for orphans and vulnerable children to ensure that aid reaches the children that need it most. In Kenya we are directly supporting community based organisations to help them deliver home based care services, including to children affected by AIDS.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">We are investigating the best ways to build systems that provide support to vulnerable children and their families, possibly in the form of monthly child or family allowances. This will simplify the tracking of funds from government budgets to the poorest families. The cash received through these transfers enables families and communities to make their own decisions about the best way to improve their livelihoods and care for their children. Another important area in which we are investing is the health of children living with HIV. For example we have supported trials of a cheap and widely available drug (co-trimoxazole) which have shown that it can halve the death rate for HIV infected children in Africa. We are also supporting a new research programme to assess how to provide antiretroviral treatment for children in resource-constrained settings</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51103w05.html_spnew0"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Home Office currently assesses violence against children aged under 16 through the Offending, Crime and Justice Survey part of which measures victimisation of children aged 10 to 15, including assaults with and without injury. The results on victimisation from the 2003 survey have been published (see findings 246) and data will also be available from further sweeps of the survey in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

<a name="stpa_24">The British Crime Survey (BCS) measures levels of violence against adults (ages 16 and over) living in private households, and as part of its core measures includes domestic violence. Risks of domestic violence are published annually by age group for men and women, including ages 45&#150;64, 65&#150;74 and 75 and over. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1251W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="51103w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_25">However, it is recognised that the core BCS measure of domestic violence is likely to be an underestimate as some victims may be unwilling to report experience of domestic violence to an interviewer. The special self-completion module on interpersonal violence (which measures domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking) is not asked of respondents aged 60 and over. The issue of elder abuse&quot; in common with child abuse is better explored using dedicated surveys.

 Assigning police officers to foot/car/beat patrol and the duties they undertake is ultimately a matter for chief constables. My Department does work with the police service to reduce the bureaucratic burden and we are making good progress by, for example, cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring forces have the best scientific and technological support&#151;like video identity parades, electronic fingerprinting and the online Violent and Sex Offender&#039;s Register&#151;so that our police spend more time actually in communities, tackling crime and antisocial behaviour and reassuring the public. The Frontline Policing Measure shows that in 2004&#150;05 Thames Valley police officers spent an average of 69.3 per cent. of their time on frontline duties compared with the national average of 64.1 per cent.

 The H5N1 virus is one of the A series of influenza viruses (the other series are B and C). The H5N1 avian influenza virus is categorised as a notifiable avian influenza virus (as are all Al viruses which are H5 or H7). The epidemiological characteristics of any H5 virus depend on to what degree they have become adapted to cause overt disease in the animal which they infect.

The majority of the other provisions in Part II of the Act are aimed at better delivery of existing goals for the rights of way network under current legislation and place few new burdens on farmers.

<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51103w16.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID recognises that social transfers could have an important role to play in reducing chronic poverty in very poor countries. DFID has recently published a paper entitled: Social transfers and chronic poverty: emerging evidence and the challenge ahead.&quot; The paper describes how social transfers have helped tackle poverty in many better off developing countries and suggests that they may have a similar impact in very poor countries. It recognises that there are significant challenges to implementing social transfer programmes in countries with weak institutional capacity but suggests that these are not insurmountable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51103w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">DFID is working with a number of governments in very poor countries to develop a better understanding of the potential role that social transfers could play in tackling chronic poverty. A number of specific social transfer programmes are already under design or are being implemented. DFID has committed &#163;70 million over three years to support a safety net programme for five million chronically poor people in Ethiopia that provides both work programmes and social transfers. We are also supporting social transfer pilot programmes in Zambia and Kenya and our Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction programme in Bangladesh provides social transfers to very poor women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51103w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">DFID is committed to continuing to collect evidence on the effectiveness of social transfers. For example, the department will provide further funding of up to &#163;7.5 million over five years to the Chronic Poverty Research Centre (CPRC), a research consortium with members in the UK, Africa and South Asia. A key element of CPRC&#039;s work will be to examine further how social protection, including social transfers, can help tackle chronic poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51103w16.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">Chronic poverty, of course, needs to be tackled by a range of policy responses, not just social transfers. For example, DFID is working to strengthen health and education services for the chronically poor, as well as increasing their opportunities to participate in economic growth and be more included within national political processes.

<a name="stpa_183">These changes represent a significant expansion of dental student intake targets from 576 to 837, and have enabled actual undergraduate dental numbers to increase by 170. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and Department of Health are currently in the process of assessing bids to make permanent arrangements for the temporary allocations, and will make recommendations to the HEFCE Board in January. HEFCE and the Department for Health intend to inform institutions of the Board&#039;s decision early in the new year, and will be assessing the need for further expansion in dental places in the lead up to the next Comprehensive Spending Review.

 The Department for Education and Skills is working with the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Trade and Industry and Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury to develop a package of measures that are known collectively as new deal for skills. As announced in Budget 2004, new deal for skills is a package of measures to help people move from welfare into sustainable, productive work and help adults in employment progress from low to higher-skilled work. For those moving from welfare into work, new deal for skills comprises three main strands: Skills coaching, skills passports and the adult learning option and is jointly project managed by DfES and DWP. DfES has made available &#163;4 million in 2005&#150;06 for the development and trials of skills coaching and skills passports which are being delivered by the Learning and Skills Council to support DWP priority customers.

 The factors that influence the rate of teenage pregnancy are complex and it is difficult to be precise about the impact that a single factor&#151;such as the quality of sex and relationships education (SRE)&#151;has on individuals&#039; choices or rates of teenage pregnancy in particular locations.

<a name="stpa_196">DfES further recommends that schools should teach about sex and relationships within the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), and in 2000 issued non-statutory guidance on SRE to help schools achieve this objective.

<i>[holding answer 31 October 2005]:</i> The Food Standards Agency (FSA) lobbied and argued strongly for a threshold of 30 months, as currently applies in the United Kingdom.

This report was passed to the European Commission as evidence that it would be disproportionate to require removal at 24 months and to other member states as part of the lobbying process.

<a name="stpa_220">The new system will differ from the current fee per item system, where dentists&#039; remuneration is based on each individual treatment&#151;a filling, a crown, etc. The evidence of PDS pilots, where remuneration is not based on fee per item, is that dentists provide fewer and simpler interventions within each course of treatment. This allows dentists to spend more time with patients, adopt a more preventive approach to patient care and better manage their work load.

 The Cabinet Office competence based recruitment system is designed to identify candidates with the most suitable skills and competences for the job. Candidates are asked, on their application form and at interview to give evidence of their ability to communicate effectively. Candidates are assessed on their ability to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing, and where necessary asked to provide evidence of their numeracy levels. There is also scope, within the selection system, for further testing of candidate&#039;s communication and numerical skills through verbal and numerical reasoning tests. Specifically, the Department has used the SHL VCC3 verbal evaluation test and the SHL NCC4 numerical evaluation test.

 The social fund plays an important part in helping people on the lowest incomes avoid the need to resort to high cost lenders. Significant improvements to the social fund budgeting loan scheme are being introduced in April 2006. These changes, which are being supported by an additional &#163;210 million (net) over the three years to 2008&#150;09, are intended to make loans more accessible and more affordable. The improvements include changes to the way in which existing budgeting loan debt affects an applicant&#039;s ability to take out a further loan, lower repayment rates, longer repayment periods and a major simplification of the way that the maximum loan amounts that can be offered to eligible applicants are calculated. The minimum amount an applicant can borrow as a budgeting loan will increase from &#163;30 to &#163;100 and the maximum debt available as a combination of crisis and budgeting loans will increase from &#163;1,000 to &#163;1,500.

 At the time of the waste licensing tribunal in July 1984, Antrim borough council was the waste licensing authority for the Crosshill Quarry, Crumlin site. The tribunal recommended that the council should approve the waste licence and apply a number of conditions for the burial of the railway carriages under Article 12 of the Pollution Control and Local Government (NI) Order 1978. The Department is not aware of the extent to which the conditions were met.

 The Department of the Environment is not aware of the exact dates for the beginning and completion of the railway carriages&#039; relocation within Crosshill Quarry. The contractors intended to complete this work during November and December 2003. However, it is the Department&#039;s understanding that, once work had commenced, the weight of the waterlogged carriages necessitated cutting them into three sections to allow their movement and relocation. As a result, the work took longer than originally anticipated. Documentary and photographic evidence obtained by departmental staff during two site visits in February 2004 recorded the completion of the relocation work.
