<P>
11. <a name="30306w01.html_wqn0"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she proposes to take to encourage <i>(a)</i> operation and <i>(b)</i> development of combined heat and power plants.  [101122]<P>

<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A number of new support measures for CHP were announced in the Energy White Paper, recognising the important role that CHP has to play in helping the UK tackle climate change and the difficult market conditions the industry faces. Together with the measures set out in the draft "Government's Strategy for CHP to 2010", I believe that these will set the sector on course to achieve our target of 10GWe in 2010.

<P>
12. <a name="30306w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Leigh: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on recent progress made by <i>(a)</i> her Department and <i>(b)</i> the Environment Agency in implementing the recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts in its report on inland flood defence.  [101123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In their report, the Committee recognised that improvements had been made but rightly focused on areas where, in their opinion, we could do more. Many of their recommendations fall directly to the Environment Agency as the country's main provider of flood defences and because of its supervisory and flood warning responsibilities. We continue to work with them to address the Committee's recommendations.

<P>
13. <a name="30306w01.html_wqn2"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her Department's policy on claiming money from the European Commission to tackle animal disease.  [101124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department's policy is to make an application on a UK basis in support of selected programmes for each year. The Commission Deadline for the submission of claims is 1 June, both for the submission of programmes for the following calendar year and for detailed claims for the past calendar year.

<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2003 : Column 1136W</I><P>
she has had with the Environment Agency about improving disabled access to beaches where flood defence work has taken place.  [101128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have had no such discussions. However, I can say that the Environment Agency's Southern Region has commissioned safety consultants to undertake an R&D pilot study for the provision of disability access to EA coastal and fluvial defences.
<P>

<a name="30306w01.html_para0">The report, only recently completed, proposes a common methodology for surveys on future provision of disability access. This work will contribute to a better understanding and awareness of the needs of disabled people and will further work required for developing policy.
<P>

<a name="30306w01.html_para1">The Agency has also appointed recreation officers in all its regions and one of their roles is to champion access in the consideration of flood defence schemes.

 In the next few weeks I expect to issue for comment a draft of the legislation implementing the Government's decision that all equids must have passports, as required by EU legislation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether every country in the EU is implementing the Directive regarding horse passports; what recent discussions she has had with the European Commission on further derogation to exempt the UK from compulsory horse passports; what further consultation there will be with the UK horse industry on the implementation of the horse passport scheme; and if she will make a statement.  [101253]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Commission Decision 2000/68/EC, must be implemented by all member states and there have been no discussions with the European Commission about exempting the UK from its requirements.
<P>

<a name="30306w01.html_para2">A draft of the legislation for England implementing the requirements that all horses must have passports will be issued in the next few weeks for consultation. The draft will take account of the views expressed during the discussions with the horse industry that have already taken place.

<P>
18. <a name="30306w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ann Winterton: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of the forthcoming expansion of the European Union on the economic viability of the United Kingdom's fishing fleet.  [101130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We do not expect the forthcoming accession of new member states to affect the economic viability of the UK fishing fleet.

<a name="30306w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Flood Protection (Rural Areas)</H3>


<P>
20. <a name="30306w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the money made available to fund flood protection in rural areas in 2002&#150;03.  [101133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra provides grant aid on capital flood and coastal defence projects that meet specified criteria and an appropriate priority score. Decisions regarding which projects to promote and their timing rests with operating authorities. It is therefore not possible to say how much of the funding has been directed to rural areas until after the financial year has ended. The figures will depend on the definition of "rural areas", as many schemes classified as "urban" are to protect communities within what would normally be considered as rural areas. ODPM allocate funding to support local authorities' expenditure on flood defence on the basis of their past expenditure.

<a name="30306w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Flooding</H3>


<P>
21. <a name="30306w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Goodman: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she last met the Environment Agency to discuss flooding.  [101134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, meets with the Environment Agency regularly to discuss a range of issues. The last time she met Sir John Harman and Baroness Young to discuss flooding was on 15 January 2003. I also hold meetings with the Environment Agency and flooding is discussed regularly. Our last meeting was held on 9 December 2002 and I am due to meet with them again later today.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Palmer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will commission further research on the impact of intensive rearing of broiler chickens on <i>(a)</i> human and <i>(b)</i> animal health.  [101118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are committed to funding research to both protect the public and welfare of farmed animals. Defra currently spends &#163;3.5 million per annum on research into food-borne zoonoses and &#163;1.2 million per annum on poultry welfare and disease research. The Government are committed to the continuing development of a comprehensive Animal Health and Welfare Strategy which will help to inform future research priorities.

<P>
<a name="30306w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The HAZMOD Extranet (previously referred to as HAZMOD intranet) was a small pilot project, managed by a research group within the Home Office and subsequently the Cabinet Office, which investigated the access to maps by emergency planners and others using internet technology. The project lasted two and a half years and cost &#163;175,000.
<P>

<a name="30306w02.html_para1">Recent analysis undertaken by the Cabinet Office showed that better and faster approaches to securing the same information are now available elsewhere and are already in use by a range of organisations. The Government therefore consider that it can best support local authority emergency planners through the provision of advice on the development of geographical information systems. Emergency planners at the local level will also continue to draw data from Police Commanders, who have direct access to information from central Government.
<P>

<a name="30306w02.html_para2">A letter explaining the position was sent on 24 February 2003 by the Cabinet Office to all the emergency planners involved in the project. The letter was also published on the UK Resilience website www.ukresilience.info.

<a name="30306w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proposals she has for investigating the extent of competition among the big-four accountancy firms.  [100758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w02.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 As a result of a recommendation in the Interim Report of the Coordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues (CGAA), the Office of Fair Trading has looked at the competition implications of the high concentration in the market for audit and accountancy services following the demise of Andersens. They concluded that there was no case for an immediate Competition Commission referral or market referral, but that the market should be kept under review.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent assessment she has made of the existence of market dominance on the part of purchasers of perishable raw agricultural produce in the <i>(a)</i> dairy, <i>(b)</i> livestock meat, <i>(c)</i> arable, <i>(d)</i> poultry meat, <i>(e)</i> horticultural and <i>(f)</i> other sectors.  [96954]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w02.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Issues of market dominance are for the competition authorities to analyse in the first instance. Dominance, and more particularly abuse of dominance by single firms is for the Office of Fair Trading to consider under the Competition Act 1998. Problems arising from collective dominance are more likely to be dealt with by reference to the Competition Commission (CC). Over the past four years, the CC has reported on three such references. On 10 October 2000, it reported on the supply of groceries from multiple stores. On its recommendation, the Government published a Code of Practice governing relations between the large supermarkets and their suppliers.
<P>

<a name="30306w02.html_para3">On 22 December 2000, the CC published a report on the supply of fresh processed milk to middle ground retailers in Scotland and on 6 July 1999, the CC published a report on the supply of raw cow's milk in Great Britain.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w02.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The UK system of auditor regulation is based on principles rather than rules. The key principles are that auditors should not perform management functions or make management decisions; that auditors should not audit their own work; and that auditors should not act as advocates for their clients. There is no list of banned services in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30306w02.html_para4">The recently published Final Report of the Coordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues deals with the issue of the provision of non-audit services by auditors to their clients, in particular in Chapter 1 (auditor independence) and Chapter 2 (corporate governance and the role of audit committee).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2003]:</i> There is a large number of factors influencing the cost of abatement of carbon dioxide and local air quality emissions. For example, the CO2 life-cycle benefits of biofuels can be heavily influenced by the feedstocks, farming practices and processing methods used to manufacture the fuel. In addition, it should be noted that LPG is promoted primarily as a means of improving air quality rather than as a carbon-saving measure.
<P>

<a name="30306w03.html_para4">However, illustrative figures have been set out for carbon and the main air quality pollutants, PM10 and NOx based on current fuel duty levels for LPG and the main biofuels, where reliable emissions data exists. These figures do not take account of the other benefits of fuel diversification, such as fuel security issues, agricultural diversification and quieter engines.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement about the relationship between <i>(a)</i> the Warsaw Convention and <i>(b)</i> EC Regulation 2027/97 (Air carrier liability in the event of accidents) in (i) its present form and (ii) as it will be amended by EC Regulation 889/2002. [R]  [101149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97 was adopted to provide a greater level of consumer protection than that found in the Warsaw Convention. Although the regulation applies in a different way to the Convention, legal advice presented by the European Commission at the time of adoption of the regulation indicated that the proposed Community legislation was compatible with the Warsaw Convention. Council and Parliament Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002 was adopted to align the provisions of Regulation 2027/97 with those of the Montreal Convention, except that the intention of Regulation 889/2002 is that it will apply to Community air carriers in respect of all carriage undertaken. Again, legal advice presented at the time of adoption of the amending regulation was that the proposed Community measure is compatible with both the Warsaw and Montreal Conventions.

[R]  [101150]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In the UK compliance with the information provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No: 2027/97 is secured by the Air Carrier Liability Order 1998. When the date of coming-into-force of Regulation 889/2002 (which is linked to the coming-into-force of the Montreal Convention) is known, the Air Carrier Liability Order will be amended to reflect the amended Community legislation. The sanction of a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale was thought to be more appropriate than withdrawal of the right to fly or an administrative fine.

 The power supply upgrade is necessary to allow new trains to be introduced which will replace Mark 1 rolling stock, as required by the Railway Safety Regulations 1999. The Strategic Rail Authority is working with Network Rail on an approach to funding the upgrade that does not require the investment of public funds. The belated appreciation of the need for the upgrade reflected a failure of communication within the industry. The first phase of the power supply upgrade began in 2002 and is forecast to continue through to 2005. The upgrade is not in itself expected to affect the volume of passenger traffic on the network.

 Since they were launched in 1988 Career Development Loans (CDLs) have helped over 180,000 people fund vocational learning to improve their career prospects. CDLs are publicised via the CDL website on the Department's website, by learning providers, and participating banks. Information is also available via learndirect, Learning and Skills Councils, Information Advice and Guidance partnerships and various publications such as the leaflet "money to learn", the BBC's Career Essentials booklet and CDL advertising posters sent to learning providers and Jobcentres. The most recent national press publicity campaign was carried out in 1998. As CDLs are being considered as part of the review of funding of adult learning, there are no plans to further publicise the programme at present.

The national underlying net default rate for CDLs since the programme began is 10.13 per cent. This compares to the 15 per cent. maximum operating default limit agreed with the banks to cover the higher level of risk they take in making these particular loans.<P>

 Career Development Loans (CDLs) are commercial bank loans and the rates of repayment are decided by the participating banks.

 The Government are committed to remodelling the school workforce in support of high quality teaching and learning. As part of this process, we are providing sufficient funding to enable schools to recruit at least 50,000 new full-time equivalent support staff over the course of this Parliament. The overall increase in revenue funding for schools, after specific identified pressures have been taken into account, will be &#163;1.1 billion in 2003&#150;04, &#163;2 billion in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;3 billion in 2005&#150;06&#151;schools will be able to use some of this additional funding for workforce reform, including recruiting additional teaching assistants and other support staff members, if they choose to. These increases in funding are in addition to existing school budgets which many schools are already using to remodel the school workforce and recruit new support staff. Decisions about how many support staff to recruit, and the roles they fulfil, will continue to be taken by individual schools.
<P>

<a name="30306w05.html_para0">For 2003&#150;04 we are making available to authorities a total of &#163;268 million (at 50 per cent. grant rate) to specifically cover the costs of recruiting school support staff (including teaching assistants) and extra administrative help, particularly for small schools. Of this &#163;4,254,627 will go to Lincolnshire, &#163;4,343,284 to Nottinghamshire and &#163;3,155,825 to Leicestershire. The grant must be fully devolved to schools but it will be for LEAs to decide how to devolve this funding to schools.

 There are presently some 3,400 British personnel deployed on peacekeeping operations throughout the world; some 500 are deployed to six UN operations, around 2,600 are deployed in support of NATO operations in the Balkans, and approximately 300 are deployed to Kabul as part of the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF).

 In Bosnia and Kosovo we intend to reduce by the spring to the levels my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced in September last year. In keeping with the reductions in SFOR (Bosnia) and KFOR (Kosovo) planned as part of NATO's review of peacekeeping operations, the United Kingdom is reducing its forces from some 4,350 troops in September last year to some 2,500 by the spring of this&#151;some 1,500 in Bosnia and 900 in Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the &#163;200 million to be received from the first stage of the PPP involving QinetiQ is net of the estimated &#163;80 million restructuring costs; how much more he estimates the MOD will receive from the sale of QinetiQ <i>(a)</i> as a gross figure and <i>(b)</i> net of costs; 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2003 : Column 1161W</I><P>
whether the &#163;80 million costs incurred is an increase on his Department's initial estimate for the PPP; and if he will make a statement.  [99598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The &#163;200 million to be received from the sale of a stake in QinetiQ to The Carlyle Group is a gross figure. Of the approximately &#163;80 million costs of the PPP process, around &#163;58 million were incurred by either the DERA Trading Fund or by QinetiQ plc. The impact of these costs is shown in QinetiQ's accounts and would have been taken into consideration by the purchaser when valuing the company. The &#163;200 million receipt from the initial transaction therefore already includes any adjustment resulting from these costs. The remaining &#163;19 million costs incurred directly by the Ministry of Defence (in addition to some &#163;3 million borne by the Dstl trading fund) should be deducted from the &#163;200 million receipt in order to determine MOD's net proceeds from the transaction so far. It would however be misleading to view these costs solely in the context of the initial receipt as a significant proportion of them relate to the formation of QinetiQ as a separate commercial entity and consequently they need to be assessed against the total receipts from all stages of the PPP process.
<P>

<a name="30306w07.html_para4">Any attempt to produce a precise estimate of likely proceeds or costs arising from the future sale of our remaining stake in QinetiQ would be purely speculative at this stage. The size of receipt is likely to be hundreds of millions of pounds, but will depend on the commercial success of the company as well as market conditions at the time of transaction. Although we anticipate that the sale will take place by means of a flotation in around three to five years, the final choice of timing and transaction will depend on value for money considerations. This choice will have an influence on the costs which are incurred.
<P>

<a name="30306w07.html_para5">The total cost of &#163;80 million is in line with the estimate given to the HCDC in May 2001. This estimate included an approximate expected cost of some &#163;6.5 million for consultancy advice to MOD on the whole DERA PPP, but we now expect the final total for this element of the costs to be around &#163;17 million. A significant proportion of this increase results from additional work necessary to respond to difficult market conditions. This included the need to keep open both the options of a flotation as well as a strategic partnership. Extra work was also carried out to analyse and apportion liabilities following loss of capacity in the insurance markets after the events of 11 September 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 15 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 687W, on QinetiQ, when he expects his Department to receive payment of the &#163;100 million outstanding.  [99599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 When QinetiQ was created as a plc it purchased assets from the Ministry of Defence with a combination of shares and an obligation in the form of an interest bearing loan note to pay a further &#163;150 million to the MOD. QinetiQ paid &#163;50 million principal plus accrued interest in February 2002.
<P>

<a name="30306w07.html_para6">As part of the transaction with The Carlyle Group, a further &#163;50 million of the loan notes will be repaid before the end of this financial year (2002&#150;03). The 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2003 : Column 1162W</I><P>
remaining &#163;50 million is secured against property at Chertsey and will be repaid to the MOD as payments are received from the sale. The detailed timings of these payments are still the subject of commercial negotiations with potential purchasers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the estimated market value of QinetiQ is; and what the value of the company was on 1July 2001.  [99602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Carlyle placed an overall enterprise value on the company of &#163;500 million following a competitive sale process. The &#163;500 million was based on the futurecash-flows of the business and did not take into account liabilities, other obligations or outstanding debt. The liabilities, other obligations and outstanding debt were &#163;375 million leaving an equity value for the business of &#163;125 million.
<P>

<a name="30306w07.html_para7">When QinetiQ was vested as a plc in July 2001 it was required to purchase its assets from the Ministry of Defence. At this point there was no means to establish the market value of the business, and the price paid for the assets was based on the net book value of &#163;495 million shown in QinetiQ's accounts. It is important to note that this figure does not reflect the value of QinetiQ as an ongoing business nor, given the very specialised nature of many of QinetiQ's assets, does it reflect their potential sale value on the open market.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish the most recent pro forma accounts for QinetiQ.  [99603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w07.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 QinetiQ was formed as a public limited company on 1 July 2001. In accordance with the Companies Act 1985 publication of accounts is the responsibility of the plc's management. The next full year accounting period end for QinetiQ is 31 March 2003 and QinetiQ's management will be required to publish these results within the timescales laid down in the Companies Act 1985. The Ministry of Defence cannot independently publish pro forma accounts for the plc.

The implementation of the Access to Justice Act has brought a measure of control to civil public funding and enabled the private sector to support money claims, thereby leaving public funding to help tackle social exclusion and support families. The increase in criminal public funding contributes towards the Government's agenda for tackling crime and improving confidence in the criminal justice system.<P>

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on the success of warrant enforcement by the magistrates courts committees since 1 April 2001.  [99873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w09.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 There are wide variations in the performance of the magistrates courts committees (MCCs). Some are very successful while the performance of others is completely unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30306w09.html_para1">The MCCs are independent bodies, however, the new Performance Contracts, which are being set for next year, will enable each MCC to receive extra resources conditional on their improved performance and that their future plans are credible and achievable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w09.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 On 1 April 2001, MCCs took on formal responsibility from police forces for executing all fines and breach warrants. MCCs employ a variety of approaches to enforce fines and other payments. They may employ their own civilian enforcement officers, contract work out to approved enforcement agencies, contract work back to the local police force or use a combination of these methods. Some MCCs also use private bailiffs, as meets their local needs.

 The Government have encouraged Lottery distributors to work with each other and with local organisations and agencies to increase the capacity within coalfield areas to produce successful Lottery applications. In addition, a number of coalfield areas are benefiting from the Fair Share Initiative launched in June 2001. Prior to the Lottery reforms in August 1998, the amount awarded per capita to coalfield areas was approximately 45 per cent. of the amount awarded to Great Britain on a per capita basis since the Lottery's inception.

 The recent preliminary crop assessments by the Food and Agriculture Organisation have indicated that there will be another very poor harvest in the lowveld. Over the last year we have already provided &#163;250,000 to the World Food Programme for their humanitarian operations in Swaziland. We are finalising support to both UNICEF (&#163;200,000) to improve the water and sanitation facilities at 80 schools, and to Save the Children (&#163;70,000) to provide a livelihoods economist to help plan recovery programmes in the most vulnerable areas.

<a name="30306w10.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 It has been evident for some months that food production in Zimbabwe would be affected for the third year in succession by the combination of disruption to farming; economic policies that are a disincentive to production; lack of agricultural credit and inputs, and patchy rains. Current DFID and WFP feeding programmes extend until June 2003. DFID is already working with the international community to assess needs for the year ahead, and to identify the extent to which the international community needs to assist in meeting the gap.

This incorporated several changes to the initial proposals, in response to concerns expressed during the consultation period. We welcome this demonstration of the SAR Government's willingness to take account of views expressed. The legislation has now been submitted to the Legislative Council (LegCo). It is anticipated that there will be lengthy discussions in LegCo, including public hearings, before the legislation is agreed.

<P>

<a name="30306w11.html_para8">The SAR Government have given repeated assurances that the final legislation will be compatible with the basic rights and freedoms laid down in the Joint Declaration and guaranteed by the basic law. These include the requirement that the legislation will be compatible with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It is vital for the future prosperity of Hong Kong that its people and the international community perceive this to be the case when legislation is finally passed. We shall continue to watch this crucial issue very carefully.

 We deplore the destruction of a World Food Programme storage facility in Gaza on 2 December 2002 by the Israel Defence Forces. Food aid, including EU-funded contributions, was destroyed. The EU has raised its concerns with the Israeli Government about the destruction of infrastructure and goods funded by the EU and wider international community in the Occupied Territories, and has discussed the issue of compensation to the World Food Programme for the destruction of the Gaza warehouse. The European Commission is responsible for monitoring and costing damage to EU-funded aid projects, and the EU reserves the right to seek compensation.

 We are committed to a successful and productive first Biennial Meeting on the implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA) of the 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its respects. The formal meeting in July is limited to looking at work that has been undertaken in the last two years in implementation of the PoA. It is not a negotiating meeting. The UK has an excellent track record in initiatives to curb the proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW), and we will be preparing a report that details its active work, including its use of the &#163;20 million we have committed (2001&#150;04) to this work.

 All offers of hospitality are made in accordance with published departmental guidance on financial procedures and propriety, based on the principles set out in Government Accounting. The giving and receiving of hospitality is conducted fully in accordance with the guidance set out in the Ministerial Code, and Guidance on Contacts with Outside Interest Groups including Lobbyists. The detailed information requested is not held centrally, and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what his estimate is of the change in statutory maternity pay in real terms from 1995&#150;96 to 2003&#150;04 (planned); what his estimate is of the amount of this benefit received by each decile of the UK income distribution; and if he will make a statement.

 Employers pay Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) to employees who meet the qualifying conditions. Currently it is paid for a total of 18 weeks; the first six weeks at a weekly rate equal to 90 per cent. of the woman's average weekly earnings and the remaining 12 weeks at &#163;75.00. For women expecting babies on or after 6 April 2003, the payment period will be extended to 26 weeks. In addition from 6 April 2003, the weekly rate for all women (payable after the first six weeks) will be increased to &#163;100, unless this is more than 90 per cent. of her average weekly earnings, in which case payment continues at the 90 per cent. rate.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates are from the Pensioners' Incomes Series 2000&#150;01, which uses data from the Family Resources Survey 2000&#150;01, and is the latest year for which results are available. The survey covers Great Britain and does not include people living in residential care or nursing homes.<P>

2. Incomes are in &#163; per week and are at 2000&#150;01 prices.<P>

3. Estimates have been rounded to the nearest 1.<P>

4. Single pensioners are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women). Pensioner couples are defined as couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.<P>

5. Pensioner units are allocated to an age category according to the age of the head. The head of a couple is defined as the man.<P>

6. The distribution of income is based on unequivalised net income (unequivalised income refers to the actual cash amount directly received by pensioner units), and has been calculated separately under the before and after housing costs measures of income. The distribution of income has also been calculated separately for singles and couples, e.g. estimates for pensioner couples show income for each quintile of the pensioner couples' income distribution.<P>

7. As with data from any survey, these estimates should not be treated as exact as they are subject to sampling error. In particular, great care should be taken when comparing groups with similar incomes since random sampling fluctuations mean that estimates should be regarded as a broad indication of trends only. <P>

 The combined pension forecasting service, an initiative jointly pursued by the Department for Work and Pensions and the pensions industry with the support of the Association of British Insurers and National Association of Pension Funds, was introduced following a series of pilot exercises with representatives from the private sector.
<P>

<a name="30306w15.html_para0">During the pilot phase, almost 33,500 combined statements were issued. Individual detailed results demonstrating the impact of the combined statement and their potential to encourage people to save more for their retirement are commercially sensitive. We do not have the permission of all the participating companies to release all the data. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to publish this information. However, in total some 98 per cent. of those who received a forecast found it useful and 31 per cent. sought further information about increasing their pension provision.
<P>

<a name="30306w15.html_para1">The Government are committed to ensuring that people of working age have the information they need to help them take personal responsibility and plan for their financial future.
<P>

<a name="30306w15.html_para2">Currently the combined pensions forecast service is a voluntary one. Our proposals in the Green Paper "Simplicity, Security and Choice: working and saving for retirement", Cm 5677, would place a statutory requirement on employers and pension providers to issue combined pension forecasts which would ensure that the total potential audience enjoys the benefits of the service. We are consulting on this.

[99631]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Current guidance recommends that a minimum of seven firefighters attend any incident requiring breathing apparatus to be worn in order to meet the requirements of breathing apparatus procedures. Guidance on incident command is set out in the Fire Service Manual, Volume 2 (Fire Service Operations: Incident Command), published by Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate. Safe working systems are determined on an individual basis by a dynamic risk assessment carried out by the incident commander, and command and control procedures vary according to the size and complexity of each incident. As incidents are assessed on an individual basis under the dynamic risk assessment process, no records are held on the number of firefighters attending different incidents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I assume that my hon. Friend is referring to the Fire Service Emergency Cover Methodology, which was developed by the Task Group on the Fire Cover Review.
<P>

<a name="30306w15.html_para3">That methodology was used by the Task Group to predict resources and personnel requirements for the brigades in the Pathfinder trials and, by extrapolation, nationally. Two alternative ways of allocating firefighting resources to cover risk were modelled; one by the Task Group and one later by the Fire Research Division of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Both sets of findings were reported on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister at the end of last year <sup>1</sup> .
<P>

<a name="30306w15.html_para4">However, the early research encountered a number of teething problems. These led the Task Group to reject the detailed calculations from the model it had used which is also regarded as being more indicative than precise. Further research is currently under way to resolve these issues.

<P>
<a name="30306w16.html_wqn0"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the six per cent. real terms increase in the local government grant settlement equates to in cash terms; how much has been distributed to local authorities in cash terms under the settlement; and if he will make a statement on the purposes for which the difference between the two sums will be used.  [101020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The local government finance settlement for 2003&#150;04 distributed &#163;43,894 million of formula grant, made up of revenue support grant, redistributed business rates, and police grant. That is &#163;2,449 million or 5.9 per cent. more in cash terms than was distributed in 2002&#150;03. It is for local authorities to decide how they spend this increased grant. On top of that, there will be increases in specific and special grant, bringing the overall increase over 2002&#150;03 to &#163;3,819 million or eight per cent. in cash terms. Some of these grants are ring-fenced to particular purposes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w17.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA), which has responsibility for food safety matters, advises me that a public health risk assessment has not been made in respect of illegal import of bush meat into the United Kingdom. The FSA has advised local authorities, which are responsible for enforcement of imported food and food safety legislation, that all illegally imported food products, including bush meat, should be removed from the human food chain. As illegal imports, these products have evaded official controls, either in the country of origin, or at the port of entry, designed to verify compliance with food safety standards, and as such, cannot be legally valid in the UK. The FSA is also working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise to assist in the targeting of enforcement work to detect illegal imports.

 The United Kingdom public health bodies involved in the investigation of outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease have not traced any outbreaks of human disease in the UK to the illegal importation of bush meat. Studies of the routes of transmission of a range of food-borne bacteria have not shown bush meat consumption to be a vehicle of infection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There are two types of ambulance procured by ambulance trusts: patient transport service ambulances and accident and emergency ambulances.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para4">Both types of vehicles can be procured either by outright purchase or by leasing, depending on the individual trust's preference.




<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2003 : Column 1204W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para5">For the outright purchase of patient transport service ambulances, the National Health Service Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) has a national contract in place which is due to expire on 30 June 2003. A new contract will be put in place later this year. In the meantime, PASA will help trusts by giving advice and putting in place a procurement guide. This will offer guidance on how to tender effectively for ambulances.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para6">For the outright purchase of accident and emergency ambulances, PASA already offers assistance to trusts in the form of a procurement guide. PASA is at tender stage with a new national accident and emergency contract and hopes to have it in place by the summer.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para7">Trusts tender on their own behalf for the lease of both patient transport service and accident and emergency ambulances. However, for trusts who do not have knowledge of European Union tendering, PASA offers advice and assistance on putting together all tender documentation and associated paperwork.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para8">Once the new patient transport service and accident and emergency ambulance contracts are in place, PASA will introduce a new national leasing contract for both types of ambulance.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para9">The servicing of ambulances is normally carried out by trusts themselves or by a nominated dealer. Leased vehicles can have the servicing incorporated into the lease agreement, which can be carried out by the trust or a nominated dealer. There are presently no national contracts in place for the servicing of ambulance vehicles.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para10">The lifespan of patient transport service and accident and emergency vehicles is determined by individual trusts and is dependant on a number of factors, including operational demands and annual mileage.
<P>

<a name="30306w19.html_para11">On average, the majority of patient transport service ambulances have a lifespan of seven years. Accident and emergency ambulances have an average lifespan of five years.

 The Government's procurement policy is that all public procurement of goods, works and services is to be based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity.

<P>
<a name="30306w20.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Within the Government's procurement policy and the EC procurement rules, it is possible to take account of environmental, social and ethical factors where they are relevant to the subject of the contract and do not undermine value for money for the taxpayer. Relevant factors can be reflected in appropriate, non-discriminatory specifications and can feature, where appropriate, in whole life cost and quality award criteria.

 The Government reviewed the role of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme following consultation with stakeholders last summer. In addition, the Public Accounts Committee, the Environment, Transport and Regions Select Committee, and the National Audit Office have all published reports on the scheme. These have all concluded that evaluation of the scheme is difficult or impossible given the way in which it has been set up with no central collection of information on its outcomes. The select committee reports have criticised the effectiveness of the scheme and these comments were taken into account in the Government's decision to reform the scheme.

<P>
<a name="30306w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 To help ensure maximum impact and sustainability of CCTV, a &#163;1.5 million Home Office funded national evaluation programme is being carried out by the Scarman Centre, University of Leicester, on 17 approved CCTV Initiative schemes, including a mobile scheme in rural Kent.
<P>

<a name="30306w22.html_para3">The final evaluation report will not be published until 2004 but interim reports will be available before then. The first&#151;providing guidance for practitioners on implementation of CCTV schemes&#151;is due for publication shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Opportunities for funding for CCTV currently exist through the funds available to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, on which the police and local authorities are partners. Funding of &#163;94 million is being provided for local crime and drugs spend, including capacity building, for 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 12 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770W, on child protection, how many forces and authorities failed to submit their three year plans to him; and what action he will take against those forces and authorities who fail to comply with the 31 March submission date.

<P>

 As the submission date of 31 March has not yet been reached, it is not possible to say how many forces and authorities have failed to submit their three-year plans. They are under a statutory duty to do so by virtue of section 92 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Any failure to submit a plan would be in breach of that statutory duty.

 This information is not collected centrally, or by the Metropolitan and Sussex police forces.

<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para1">In 2002, Sussex Police received 3,783 referrals of possible child abuse. In the overwhelming majority of cases of this kind, Sussex Police carry out joint visits to the child's home with the relevant social worker.

<P>
<a name="30306w23.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Increasing confidence in the Criminal Justice System is the subject of a Public Service Agreement target (PSA 10). The creation of the National Probation Service and the establishment of the Youth Justice Board have provided clearer structures, substantial changes in practice based on evidence of effectiveness in reducing crime and new community-based sentences. A task force, based within the Home Office, has recently been established to further inter-departmental work towards the PSA target.
<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para2">To increase the use, effectiveness, range of disposals and suitability of community based penalties, the National Probation Service and the Youth Justice Board are working with the courts to ensure sentences are targeted appropriately. This includes ensuring that accredited programmes and recently introduced disposals, like drug treatment and testing orders and the intensive supervision and surveillance programme (ISSP), are used appropriately and their potential to reduce reoffending and protect the public fully exploited.
<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para3">Ways are also being developed to increase sentencers' awareness of new assessment techniques that act as a guide to the suitability of community sentences and accurately reflect risk factors that sentencers must take into account. The implementation of new disposals, or changes to existing sentences such as the "enhancement" of community punishment (formerly community service), will include effective communications.
<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para4">As it becomes available both the National Probation Service and Youth Justice Board regularly publish relevant information on reconviction data, practice and policy developments and performance. The National Probation Service is currently reviewing the communications capacity of the 42 local probation areas and increasing national resources for communications, including work with the media. This, and future work, will be evaluated against and informed by surveys of public and sentencer perception.

<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para5">Three laptop computers have been provided over the last 26 months to Ministers and special advisers and none have been reported either lost or stolen.
<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para6">A further 4,721 laptop computers have been issued to officials including those within the Executive Agencies.
<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para7">In both 1995 and 1996 no laptop computers were reported lost. In 1997 one was reported lost. In 1998 four were reported lost. In 1999 two were reported lost, although one was subsequently recovered and since then no laptop computers have been reported lost.
<P>

<a name="30306w23.html_para8">In terms of thefts we have reported to the House before seven laptop computers were reported stolen in 1995 with a combined value of &#163;3,924. Nine were reported stolen in 1996 with a value of &#163;20,300. In 1997 a further nine laptop computers were reported stolen with a value of &#163;25,000. In 1998 a single laptop was stolen but no reliable data has been recorded regarding its value. In 1999 a number of laptops were stolen from a storeroom and were valued at &#163;20,421. During 2000 a further 18 thefts of laptop computers were reported. The total value for these losses was &#163;53,429 but the figure is distorted by at least one machine having no formal value recorded against it and in another case a PowerPoint Projector being included in the financial loss. From 2000 through to 13 February 2003 a further 39 further thefts were reported, with one subsequent recovery but a financial value is not available. In part this is because 897 laptop computers are now provided as a managed service from a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) partners. Where loss occurs the financial risk has been passed to the partner organisation.

Likewise, the closest BCS data to 1996&#150;97 is from the 1998 BCS (crime in 1997). The latest available (provisional) data on trends in the numbers of incidents of crime were published in January 2003 in Home Office Statistical Bulletin 02/03, reporting on the results of BCS interviews that took place in the year ending September 2002.

Police-recorded crime statistics are available for the financial years 1978&#150;79, 1996&#150;97 and the latest data are for the year ending September 2002. The offence coverage of the British Crime Survey and recorded crime differs. For example, the BCS excludes victimless crimes, crimes against those under the age of 16 and against those living in institutions, to name a selection. Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/02 provides further details on the coverage and comparability of the two measures, and the need for the use of a comparable subset of offences for any comparison of the two.

The percentage changes since 1996&#150;97 have been adjusted for the effects of the revisions in April 1998 to the way recorded crimes are counted and classified. This has had a large impact on the changes in violent crime and total recorded crime, but a negligible impact on those for burglary and vehicle crime. Recorded crime figures have also been affected by the National Crime Recording Standard. The Standard, which was introduced formally in all forces in April 2002 and informally in other forces prior to this date, has had the effect of increasing recorded crime statistics by at least 10 per cent. in the year ending September 2002. This means that, but for the Standard, there would have been a fall in total recorded crime between 1996&#150;97 and the 12 months to September 2002.<P>

<P>
<a name="30306w24.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the desert model in appendix 8, paragraph 3 of Making Punishments Work, in the sentencing framework of the Criminal Justice Bill.  [100137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w24.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Criminal Justice Bill adopts the approach to sentencing advocated by John Halliday in his report "Making Punishments Work", which is based on a modified version of the "just desserts" theory of sentencing. The set of principles which guide sentencers in determining the seriousness of the offence (in chapter 1, part 1 2) incorporate the principle that the punishment should always be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, on which the "dessert" is 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2003 : Column 1222W</I><P>
based. They have been modified in one respect, again as advocated by John Halliday, so that recent and relevant previous convictions act as aggravating factors in determining sentence seriousness. The Government believes that persistent offenders must know that there will be a steady progress to custody, increasing in length, if they continually offend and fail to respond to previous sentences.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w24.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether Clause 126 of the Criminal Justice Bill complies with Principle A2 of the Council of Europe's recommendation on consistency of sentencing 1992.  [100138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w24.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Clause 126 makes explicit the purposes of sentencing on the face of the Bill. We want to encourage sentencers to address more directly than at present the purposes of crime reduction (through reform and rehabilitation, and deterrence) and reparation, alongside the continuing key and prominent aims of public protection and punishment. These purposes are not in conflict and it will be up to sentencers to determine what weight to accord to each in a particular case. This may vary in different cases; for example a purely punitive intervention may be required, in others rehabilitation will feature more heavily.
<P>

<a name="30306w24.html_para3">We do not, therefore, consider Clause 126 to be in conflict with Principle A2 of the Council of Europe recommendation. Our goal is to achieve consistency of approach in sentencing, through the consistent application of explicit principles and standards, recognising that these may result in justifiably disparate outcomes. Clause 126 which sets out the general purposes of sentencing, and those that follow which establish a set of principles to guide the sentence in determining the seriousness of an offence, will help achieve this, as will the establishment of the new Sentencing Guidelines Council which I will produce a set of consolidated guidelines for all criminal courts.

<P>
<a name="30306w24.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Criminal Policy Group shared the purpose of the Home Office in building a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced and the protection and security of the public are maintained. The Group had responsibility to deliver two of the principal Home Office Aims, Aim 3 (To ensure the effective delivery of justice) and Aim 4 (To deliver effective custodial and community sentences to reduce reoffending and protect the public). Following changes in senior management arrangements in the Department on 5 February, the Group was renamed the Criminal Justice Group and its correction functions (including its responsibility for Aim 4) moved to report to the Commissioner for the Correctional Services and Permanent Secretary for Human Resources.

 The detention of people arrested for criminal offences in England and Wales is governed by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the PACE Codes of Practice. Merseyside Police record the detention of all persons in custody in accordance with this Act and Codes of Practice.
<P>

<a name="30306w24.html_para6">Section 37(4) and Section 39(1)<i>(b)</i> of the Act provides that custody records must be kept on all detained persons.

<P>

<a name="30306w24.html_para7">Police must retain custody records for 12 months after the detainee has been released from police custody (PACE Code of Practice C paragraph 2.4).

When a person leaves police detention, he himself, his legal representative or an appropriate adult may request a copy of the original custody record for up to 12 months after release provided reasonable notice is given. The information contained in the custody record is not otherwise publicly available. The police must respond to requests for details of the custody record as soon as practicable (paragraph 2.4).

 There are no health and safety organisations with a specific interest in custody suites of which I am aware.

 The Bail and Legal Aid Office at Holloway will reopen as soon as a member of staff is in place. A candidate has been selected and is due to start work at Holloway on 7 April 2003.

 The Youth Justice Board (YJB), as purchaser and commissioner of juvenile secure accommodation, are currently negotiating with the Prison Service the content of the Service Level Agreement for the coming financial year. They expect to include funding for a limited number of juvenile girls to be held in Holloway this year, including those who require facilities for continuing medical treatment.
<P>

<a name="30306w25.html_para7">The decision had previously been delayed because of changes last year in overall population levels and the need to review the timetable for meeting the commitment to remove 15 and 16 year old girls from Prison Service custody. The Board have announced that this will be met later this year, but Holloway will continue to hold 17 year old girls and some 15 and 16 year olds in the meantime.

 Holloway will have its telephone system upgraded in July 2003 and the Governor will then introduce changes to the existing arrangements. Proposals include the separation of professional and social telephone booking line arrangements whereby prison staff will continue to organise and run professional visits but a separate line for social visits will be staffed by a telephone operator. The system will be

based in the prison and will have a line which would enable people who are finishing their visits to book the next visit before they leave the prison.
<P>

<a name="30306w25.html_para8">Discussions with the Prisoners Advice and Care Trust are not yet concluded but the Governor of Holloway expects to finalise arrangements in the next month ahead of the new system being put in place later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30306w25.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Specific information about the number of prisoners detained longer than necessary because home detention orders paperwork has not been completed correctly is not available without disproportionate cost. However, an area-wide review of home detention order paperwork was conducted by the Female Estate Operational Office in August 2002, and the arrangements at Holloway were found to be of a high quality.

 There is a small in-patient healthcare facility at Garth prison to which Wymott prison has access as appropriate. There are no plans to expand this unit as a new health care facility is currently scheduled to open at neighbouring Preston prison at the end of 2004. This is to be an area-wide facility, which can be utilised by both Garth and Wymott as necessary.

<P>
<a name="30306w25.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 March 2003]:</i> Midnight Basketball has received funding locally in recent years from the Communities Against Drugs fund, the Children's Fund, from the Youth Justice Board and from Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. Local partnerships are currently at the point of developing their funding plans for next year and it is open to them to provide funding for Midnight Basketball from Home Office funding streams, for example for the purposes of reducing youth crime, anti-social behaviour or substance misuse. Midnight Basketball is, therefore, unlikely to receive central Home Office funding.
<P>

<a name="30306w25.html_para10">In addition, from May this year, there will be a new single programme of positive activities for young people to provide year round out of school activities for eight to 19-year-olds. This will deliver activities to more young people than in previous years, providing support for those most at risk. It will be open to schemes such as Midnight Basketball to bid to provide diversionary, activities for young people as part of this programme.

 Following a competitive tender, the Prison Service entered into a contract with BT in 1998 to develop a new telephone system for prisoners. The new system provides improved security for prisoners by removing the need for telephone cards, which had become a source of bullying and "taxing" within prisons. It also improves security for victims and witnesses because it allows individual telephone numbers to be barred to individual prisoners. The system is now installed in more than half the prisons in England and Wales, and is expected to be installed in all prisons by next summer.
<P>

<a name="30306w27.html_para0">The contract was reviewed in the course of last year, and among the changes was a technical adaptation to enable foreign prisoners to make overseas calls at reduced cost. These arrangements are now being piloted in four prisons, and in the light of the conclusion of the pilots, it is hoped to extend the arrangements to all prison establishments later in the year.

 The projected annual average for the prison population in England and Wales in 2005 is 87,200. The projected useable operational capacity of the estate for 2005 is 77,000. These projected figures are used for the purposes of planning the Prison Service estate. As part of the Review of Correctional Services, the Government is looking to develop a long-term strategy to manage population pressures.

 The information requested is shown in the following table. The terms "maximum capacity" and "uncrowded capacity" are understood as being the useable operational capacity and in-use certified normal accommodation (CNA) respectively. The projections given from 2003 onwards are used for planning purposes. As part of the Review of Correctional Services, the Government is looking to develop a long-term strategy to manage population pressures.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

1. Population figures exclude the numbers of prisoners held in police cells during that year. The figures are based on data for the last day of each month.<P>

2. In-use CNA: the uncrowded capacity of the estate after adjusting for accommodation out of use.<P>

3. The projected population figures are taken from the Home Office statistical bulletin published on 9 December 2002. A copy of the bulletin has been placed in the Library.<P>

4. Usable operational capacity: the measure used for long-term estate planning purposes. The maximum number of prisoners that the estate could normally hold is up to 2, 000 less than the total certified operational capacity.<P>

 Last July, we announced proposals for new eviction powers for police to deal with unauthorised encampments. These new powers will allow police to take firm action against unauthorised encampments, without the pre-conditions found in the current legislation, where local authorities have made adequate site provision which may be temporary. We will bring forward legislation when parliamentary time allows. Where local authorities have not made adequate site provision, current eviction powers will still be available.
