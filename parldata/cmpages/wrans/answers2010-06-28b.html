 The Government are committed to increasing the amount of renewable heat in the UK; this is a crucial part of ensuring we meet our renewables targets, cutting carbon and ensuring energy security. We are currently looking at the renewable heat incentive (RHI) proposals. Clearly there are benefits to the scheme, but we must also consider the impact of the costs, particularly given the financial constraints we must work within and the potential impact that funding options could have on vulnerable people.</p>

 Any public body which in 2008 had at least one half-hourly electricity meter settled on the half hourly market is required to register for the scheme. Of those that register, those that meet the 6,000MWh qualification threshold will be required to participate in the scheme. In addition all UK Government Departments, the Scottish Administration, the Welsh Assembly Government and Northern Ireland Departments must all participate in the CRC scheme regardless of electricity usage. The precise number of public bodies which meet these criteria will not be known until the close of the registration period on 30 September. The Environment Agency estimates that 1,100 public bodies will be participants in the scheme. Other registered public sector bodies must make a simple information disclosure at registration at the start of each phase of the scheme</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="100628w0001.htm_para3"><a name="1006286000046">Participants meeting the qualification threshold must pay a one-off registration fee of £950 and an annual subsistence fee of £1,290.

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="100628w0001.htm_para4"><a name="1006286000047">The annual cost to a participant from allowance purchases will depend on their total emissions, as well as their position in the league table. Their emissions will depend among other things on the organisation's size and measures introduced to improve their energy efficiency. All of the revenues raised from the Government sale of allowances will be returned to participants, so that those whose energy efficiency scores are highest will receive a bonus. Because of these uncertainties, Government have not estimated the cost to the public sector.</p>

 The newest strand of Environmental Stewardship is Uplands Entry Level Stewardship. This was launched in February and welcomed by a number of farming groups. Some representations have recently been made about the requirement for tenant farmers with lets of less than five years to have their application countersigned by their landlord. However, this requirement is necessary to meet European Union rules governing land management under agri-environment, and to ensure sufficient time for the accrual of environmental benefits and make the scheme effective. DEFRA has worked closely with industry and environmental groups throughout the scheme development, and guidance has been published jointly with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to support tenants and landlords considering joining Uplands ELS.</p>

 Lottery distributors' administration costs can be found in their annual reports and accounts but, for the convenience of the right hon. Member's researchers, are reproduced as follows. However, they are not recorded on a consistent basis making direct comparison between distributors difficult. Reducing these costs and ensuring more money gets to the good causes is a priority for the Government. The first step will be working with the lottery distributors over the coming months to develop a uniform and transparent measure of administrative costs.</p>

 The site referred to contains 11.2 hectares of land which could be readily used for agriculture.

In this case I understand that Blackpool council consulted with DEFRA, and though the council was urged to have regard to such a loss, there was no objection to the application.

 In 2011, in the event that the basic state pension is increased by more than earnings under the terms of the 'triple lock', the Government's intention is that as a minimum all single pension credit recipients will benefit from the full cash value of this increase. For 2012-13 and in subsequent years decisions about rates of benefit and pensions will be decided in light of actual earnings and price growth as part of the normal budget process.

 Overall assessments of the impact of the points-based system, including tier 4 (students), on universities, businesses and other users were published by the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) in 2008 when the new system was introduced. A further impact assessment was published in April 2010, following the changes made earlier this year, in which UKBA stated that there would be no "impact on the ability of institutions to recruit and earn revenue from genuine [international] students."</p>

 There are no specific plans to increase the provision of higher education facilities in the Hartlepool constituency. It is for the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to make decisions on the future allocation of student numbers in line with their established criteria. A range of higher education courses are available in Hartlepool. Cleveland College of Art and Design has a site in Hartlepool dedicated to higher education provision which is validated by Teesside University. In addition, Hartlepool Sixth Form College and Hartlepool College of FE have seen significant growth in higher education numbers over the last few years. Hartlepool Sixth Form College delivers provision franchised from the University of Sunderland, while Hartlepool College of FE works with both the University of Sunderland and the Teesside University. Hartlepool College of FE is also in the process of building a new state-of-the-art college on the existing town centre site. I look forward to the completion of this new college and welcome the contribution made by all three colleges in Hartlepool.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 June 2010]:</i> Local Government, like the rest of the public sector is being asked to make a contribution to the £6.2 billion of cross Government savings in 2010-11. This will enable the Government to take immediate action to tackle the UK's unprecedented deficit inherited from the previous. Where revenue grants have been reduced, no local authority will face a reduction of more than 2%. Sheffield will see a reduction of 1%in their overall funding from Central Government in 2010-11. The Government have also announced further removal from ring fencing of central government revenue and capital grants. This gives councils extra flexibility to make decisions about where savings are found. It is for local authorities to manage the reduction across all their funding sources to protect frontline services. This flexibility means that reductions in spending could be managed without a reduction in jobs or frontline services.</p>

 The Secretary of State's letter to the right hon. Member on 7 June, which is now in the Libraries, confirms that we are committed to ensuring that the Department does not make unaffordable promises for the future, and that spending is focused on priorities that best support the coalition Government's two primary educational objectives-raising standards for all and narrowing the gap between rich and poor. Having examined the options in depth, The Secretary of State has decided that we will not be able to proceed with the free school meal pilots that were due to start in September this year, nor the extension of free school meals to some primary school children this year. We will continue the existing pilots in Durham, Newham and Wolverhampton so as to assess better the case for increasing eligibility in the future.</p>

 Proprietors of academies and independent schools are subject to a vetting process at the initial application stage which examines whether they are a fit and proper person to run a school.

Where there are serious concerns about the quality of leadership and management provided by a governing body in maintained schools, local authorities currently have statutory powers to intervene in certain circumstances. These powers can include appointing additional governors to a school or applying to the Secretary of State for permission to replace the governing body with an Interim Executive Board to lead the changes required in the school.</p>

For example, while child benefit was frozen for three years, the child element of the child tax credit will be increased by £150 in 2011-12, and a further £60 in 2012-13. These increases will happen above indexation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="100628w0022.htm_para14"><a name="10062824001261">Budget announced that the basic state pension will be uprated by a triple guarantee of earnings, prices (CPI) or 2.5%, whichever is highest, from April 2011. However, the Government will increase the basic state pension in April 2011 by at least the equivalent of RPI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="100628w0022.htm_para15"><a name="10062824001262">To ensure that pensioners on the lowest incomes benefit from the triple guarantee, the standard minimum income guarantee in pension credit will increase in April 2011 by the cash rise in a full basic state pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="100628w0022.htm_para16"><a name="10062824001263">At Budget, we also announced a £1,000 cash terms increase in the income tax personal allowance for those aged under 65, taking it from £6,475 in 2010-11 to £7,475 in 2011-12. It is estimated that this will remove 880,000 of the lowest income taxpayers from tax altogether and will benefit around 23 million basic rate taxpayers by up to £170 per year compared to the previous Government's plans.</p>
