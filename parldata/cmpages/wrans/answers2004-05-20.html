<a name="40520w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Avian Flu</h3>





<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the safety of imported chickens from South East Asia since the recent outbreaks of avian influenza; and if she will make a statement.  [173681]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Under EU rules, imports of live poultry are not permitted from any of the countries in Asia where highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed. This was the case even before the disease outbreaks, as none of these countries had been approved by the European Commission to export live poultry to the EU. Similarly, with the exception of Thailand, imports of meat from the affected countries are not authorised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para0">
The risk of the avian influenza virus spreading to other birds through meat is low. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, the European Commission took action on 23&nbsp;January to ban imports from Thailand of fresh and frozen poultry meat unless accompanied by certification confirming that it was from birds slaughtered before 1&nbsp;January 2004. In addition, cooked poultry meat that had not been heat treated to at least 70&#176;C, was also banned. The UK took immediate action to implement these measures in domestic law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para1">
The Food Standards Agency advice is that eating chicken is not considered a risk to consumers. This is because the risk to people from Avian Influenza arises from close contact with live chickens that have the disease, and not through eating chicken.

<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Beef exports are currently limited by the requirements of the Date Based Export Scheme. In the light of last week&#039;s positive opinions from the European Food Safety Authority, and taking account of any decision to replace the UK&#039;s over-30 months rule by testing, we will continue to work with the EU Commission to ensure that controls on UK beef exports are eased as far as possible.

<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn7"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research has been conducted by or for her Department on bioremediation using genetically modified organisms.  [173118]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1103W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department has recently published&nbsp;research that specifically examines the potential use of genetically modified organisms in bioremediation (final report available at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-1&#150;5-142.htm). The report concludes that genetic modification offers some possible benefits in this area, but that, as with all GMOs, a thorough evaluation of the potential risks is required. This evaluation needs to be carried out in the context of the contaminated environment in which bioremediation is applied and the possible alternative approaches to bioremediation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para2">
We have also commissioned research on bioremediation in general, some of which has considered the use of genetically modified organisms (for a full list see http://www.defra.gov.uk/research/Project&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data/projects.asp?M=KWS&V=bioremediation &SCOPE=0).

<a name="40520w01.html_sbhd8"><h3 align=center>Bovine TB</h3>





<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn8"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of repeated intradermal skin tests on the ability of the test to detect bovine TB infection in individual cattle.  [172530]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There is often a trade-off between test sensitivity and specificity. The skin test used in GB has been fine tuned to optimise specificity (i.e. keep false positives to a minimum) while retaining a good sensitivity (i.e. probability of identifying infected herds). However, because of the dynamics of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis&#151;</i>the causative organism for bovine tuberculosis) transmission and the time it takes to mount a detectable immune response to the intradermal injection of tuberculin, the skin test cannot be relied upon to detect every animal infected with <i>M. bovis</i> at the time of the disclosing test. This phenomenon is not unique to the tuberculin test and, in fact, this is quite normal for any immunological test.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para3">
For these reasons, it is well accepted that the tuberculin tests are more suited to the detection of infected herds rather than the detection of infected individual cattle, i.e. a small proportion of infected animals in reactor herds may escape detection when the herd is first tested (false negatives). In order to increase the sensitivity of the skin test and detect any animals in the early stages of infection, reactor herds are re-tested at 60 day intervals until no further reactor animals are found and restrictions can be lifted. Reactor herds are then re-tested 6 and 18 months after the lifting of restrictions. Additionally, if infection has been confirmed in the herd by post mortem examination or culture, a more severe interpretation of test readings is applied. This further enhances the ability of the test to detect any residual infection after the initial screening. In other words, the imperfect sensitivity of the skin test is compensated for by the application of short-interval testing and severe interpretation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para4">
Defra has also sponsored experimental work at the Institute of Animal Health (Compton), to look into the effects of repeat skin testing. The main finding of this experiment was that repeat testing at 56-day intervals before experimental infection of calves with <i>M. bovis</i> had no effect on the animals&#039; ability to respond to an 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1104W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
intradermal test carried out seven weeks post-infection. Therefore, no matter how often an animal is skin tested before it contracts TB, the sensitivity of the skin test after infection will not be compromised.


</p>







<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn9"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research she has evaluated on the specificity and sensitivity of the Bovigam gamma interferon test; and what conclusions she has drawn.  [172550]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) has reviewed 13 papers reporting gamma-interferon (g-IFN) field trials in Australia, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Brazil, Italy, Spain and USA. Eight papers gave 20 estimates of sensitivity (80&nbsp;per cent. were in the range 71&#150;94&nbsp;per cent.) and 8 papers gave 22 estimates of specificity (80&nbsp;per cent. were in the range 89&#150;99&nbsp;per cent.). These estimates for sensitivity are similar to those for the skin test as practiced in the UK, but the estimates for specificity are lower. If the g-IFN test were used at the same time or shortly after the skin test and animals positive to either test were removed, the combined tests would have a greater sensitivity than the skin test alone. If used with the defined, more specific, antigens developed by VLA, the gamma interferon test can in certain circumstances identify uninfected animals that are positive to the skin test.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para5">
The g-IFN assay is widely considered to be at least as sensitive as the skin tests and, in addition, will detect a proportion of infected cattle that fail to react to the skin tests. This is thought to be because the g-IFN test detects infection at an earlier stage than the skin test does, although there is also evidence that the two tests detect slightly different populations of tuberculous cattle. However, the g-IFN test is hardly ever used for mass TB screening on its own. This is because the test is relatively expensive, it does not detect all skin test-positive infected animals, it tends to be less specific than the SICCT (the single intradermal comparative cervical test, which is the version of the skin test used in the UK and Ireland) and, like the SICCT, it is unlikely to detect infected animals that are negative to the tuberculin test due to a depressed immune response to tuberculin (this can occur in cattle with advanced TB). The need to process samples within 24&#150;30 hours of collection also poses some logistical problems for mass screening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para6">
In contrast, it has been postulated that the use of the g-IFN test in tandem with the skin test could allow the removal of more (but not necessarily all) infected cattle from particular breakdown herds than the skin test alone. If this is correct, use of the two tests in quick succession should speed up the elimination of infection from infected herds. Under this premise, the European Commission approved the g-IFN test in 2002 for use as an ancillary test in animals that fail to respond to the skin test and it now complements the skin tests in cattle herds with intractable, confirmed infection in many EU member states. It is worth noting that most of these member states use a version of the skin test different to that used in the UK and Ireland.


</p>







<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn10"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what level of specificity and sensitivity she has concluded might be applied to control bovine TB in cattle herds which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1105W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;are subject to repeated and persistent bovine TB breakdowns, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;are subject to a first TB breakdown and which are also in a TB hotspot, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;are subject to a first TB breakdown and which are not in a TB hotspot, <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;have not been subject to TB breakdowns and which are in a TB hotspot and <i>(e)</i>&nbsp;have not been subject to TB breakdowns and which are not in a TB hotspot.  [172551]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Sensitivity and specificity of tests for bovine TB in cattle have relative rather than absolute meanings as it is not possible to conclusively demonstrate that an animal with no sign of TB is not in the early stages of infection. In addition, it is possible to increase the sensitivity and decrease the specificity by lowering the reading above which the test is declared positive (as occurs with standard and severe interpretations of the skin test).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para7">
The Divisional Veterinary Managers (DVMs) have the discretion to remove cattle from herds that are not skin test positive&#151;they are generally termed Dangerous Contacts. The DVMs use their epidemiological judgment to vary the criteria used to remove animals in cases <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;to <i>(e)</i>&nbsp;in the question.

<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn11"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of the predictive models used in other countries to assess the feasibility of controlling bovine TB using the Bovigam gamma interferon test.  [172552]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Other countries with a bovine TB problem comparable to Great Britain&#039;s&#151;New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland&#151;have used the gamma interferon test, but there are no published predictive models for its use.


</p>







<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn12"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the maximum <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;specificity and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;sensitivity achieved by the Bovigam gammas interferon test in experiments conducted in the UK is; and under what conditions these results were achieved.  [172553]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Specificity and sensitivity must be quoted together as they are inversely related, and they suffer from the lack of an absolute measure of whether an animal is infected. In the UK, the gamma interferon (g-IFN) test has been used without the skin test only in laboratory studies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para8">
No large-scale validation of the g-IFN test has been carried out in GB. The ongoing field trial sponsored by Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government in Wales and the Midlands aims to measure the cost effectiveness of using the g-IFN in infected herds in conjunction with the single intradermal comparative cervical test (SICCT) and provide some data on the g-IFN test sensitivity under GB conditions. There are also plans in train to assess the specificity of the g-IFN test in areas of GB with little or no incidence of TB.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;maximum and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;minimum (i) sensitivity and (ii)&nbsp;specificity is of the comparative intradermal tuberculin test in the UK.  [172554]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1106W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There is often a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test and no test is 100&nbsp;per cent. sensitive and 100&nbsp;per cent. specific. When used as a routine screening test in GB, the single intradermal comparative cervical test (SICCT) is designed to maximise specificity while retaining a good sensitivity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para9">
Statistical analysis of TB testing data suggests that the maximum sensitivity of disclosing tests is 90&nbsp;per cent. and the maximum sensitivity of subsequent (short-interval) tests is 70&nbsp;per cent. The average specificity of the disclosing test in low-incidence districts of Great Britain is between 99.98&nbsp;per cent. and 99.99&nbsp;per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para10">
When used in herds with confirmed TB, the cut off point of the test is shifted to increase sensitivity at the expense of specificity.

<p><a name="40520w01.html_wqn14"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many studies the Government have funded in the last 15 years into the specificity and sensitivity of the Bovigam gamma interferon test; which research establishments conducted each study; what the conclusions of each study were, with reference to specificity and sensitivity; when the results of each study were drawn to the attention of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the chief veterinary officers and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Ministers; and where and when the results were published.  [172556]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew14"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Bovigam test became commercially available around 1991. Since then, field research in a number of countries, including Britain, has confirmed the test to be a valuable ancillary test to the skin test. We have not conducted studies designed to look particularly at the specificity and sensitivity of the Bovigam test in the UK. However, there are nine current research projects which are looking at the development of more <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> specific gamma interferon antigens or on the validation of the ones already trialled.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of combinations of specificity and sensitivity applied in countries which have a bovine TB problem, in their use of the Bovigam gamma interferon test.  [172565]</p>








<p><a name="40520w01.html_spnew15"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The performance of the gamma interferon (g-IFN) test (Bovigam) has been assessed by many authors in trials carried out in several countries with bovine tuberculosis (TB) problems. This research has been carefully evaluated by Defra and scientists from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w01.html_para13">
In these trials, the sensitivity of the test has ranged between 55.4 and 100&nbsp;per cent. and the specificity between 70.0 and 99.6&nbsp;per cent. However, these results are influenced by the characteristics of the cattle populations in which the studies were carried out, the prevalence of cross-reacting organisms, the cut-off point 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1107W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
used to interpret the g-IFN test and the criteria used to establish the <i>M. bovis</i> infection status of the trial animals (often known as the &quot;gold standard&quot;). It is not, therefore, straight forward to extrapolate specificity and sensitivity estimates directly from one country to another. Ideally, the performance of a diagnostic test for TB should be evaluated under the conditions and in the geographical area in which the test will be used.

 No large-scale validation of the gamma interferon (g-IFN) test has been carried out in GB. Although the g-IFN test is now used in several countries, experimental data is lacking on the cost-effectiveness of using g-IFN in infected herds in conjunction with the single intradermal comparative cervical test . Desk studies have estimated that significant savings will need to accrue from the use of the g-IFN before it becomes cost-effective in GB. The on-going field trial sponsored by Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government in Wales and the Midlands aims to resolve this question.

<p><a name="40520w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 A key objective of the Government&#039;s public sector food procurement initiative is to increase the amount of locally produced food purchased by public sector bodies. This cannot be done by restricting business to UK suppliers because the European Treaty prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality. However, the legal and policy framework for procurement does allow public bodies to create a competitive environment that will encourage more UK producers to bid for public sector business.

<p>
<a name="40520w02.html_para0">
Public bodies are being advised to structure contract requirements so that small and local suppliers have the capacity and opportunity to compete and a realistic chance of being successful. One example is to specify

The scope for applying these measures will vary depending on the size and particular requirements of each public sector contract.

 The total number of UK companies exporting goods, services and investing capital in The Gambia since 1997 is difficult to determine because of the poor records held and maintained by the Gambian authorities, including the Registrar General of Companies, the Department for Trade, Customs and Excise and the Gambian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Nevertheless, from enquiries made by and records held at the British High Commission in Banjul, the number of known such companies is 29. However, UK companies are not required to notify the High Commission or UK Trade and Investment that they are doing business in or with The Gambia, and consequently the list cannot be considered to be exhaustive or complete. The majority on the list are small companies operating in the service industry but also include multinationals such as British American Tobacco and Shell. Furthermore, many UK individuals, as opposed to companies, have businesses in The Gambia such as bars and restaurants.

VAT stocks do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8&nbsp;million out of 3.8&nbsp;million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment has been made of the effect on bird life of additional wind turbines under construction and planned.  [174405]</p>








<p><a name="40520w05.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Over the years, there have been a large number of studies carried out in the UK of the impact of wind farms on wildlife and in particular birds. Those studies suggest that there is a small risk of bird strikes from the operation of wind turbines, as long as they are properly sited.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w05.html_para4">
Work related to the study of birds is continuing, with DTI funded studies being carried out by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) and JNCC (Joint Nature Conservation Committee) to look at the distribution and main flight paths of seabirds including migratory, feeding/roosting patterns and their behavioural response to wind farms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w05.html_para5">
In addition, no wind farm development can be undertaken without securing the necessary permissions and consents under the normal planning regime or Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. This process places a requirement on developers to consider all environmental aspects of a project, including any effects a particular development may have on the bird life in that location, and produce an Environmental Impact Assessment. These assessments are available to the public.

The Government&#039;s total aid budget has doubled since 1997&#150;98&#151;from &#163;2 billion to &#163;4 billion. As the table shows, assistance to Africa has more than doubled. In the current (2004&#150;05) financial year my Department&#039;s bilateral programme in Africa stands at &#163;864&nbsp;million and in 2005&#150;06 we plan to spend &#163;1.1 billion. These figures demonstrate our real and growing commitment to Africa. But it is not only the quantity of assistance that matters; quality too is vital. In order to improve the quality of aid and hence its impact we are working increasingly closely with other donors to reduce the number of individual and uncoordinated initiatives, and to ensure we use our aid to strengthen&#151;not undermine&#151;national planning and implementation capacity.

<p><a name="40520w06.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The number of low risk projects judged as likely to be successful was reported as 75&nbsp;per cent. in DFID&#039;s Departmental Report, against a baseline of 81&nbsp;per cent. This increased to 78&nbsp;per cent. in the first quarter figures for 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w06.html_para1">
The figure gives a forecast of success for projects of &#163;1&nbsp;million or more that have been in operation for at least two years. It fluctuates on a quarterly basis because it is recording work in progress and is a 12-month snapshot view on a particular date reflecting those projects that meet the above criteria. The decline was caused by a small number of successful projects ending and therefore graduating from the scoring system.

In total 74 workplace policies have been introduced into companies by DAT business trainers. The way the DAT business trainers have advertised their service varies from DAT to DAT and region to region. As a first approach, DAT business trainers are encouraged to use their network and approach safety critical companies in their area. Other ways of targeting include direct marketing and organising business breakfasts, lunches and seminars to highlight to employers the importance of a drug and alcohol workplace policy. To date there has not been a budget allocated to DATs to promote the workplace policy service however, for those DATs that need additional funding there are a number of funding programmes that Government Office Drugs Teams facilitate. The Home Office as part of Phase 3 (March-December 2004) of the National Workplace Initiative plans to evaluate each of the 74 companies workplace policies. This evaluation will in principle be qualitative and focused on improving services and understanding the usefulness of the policy in the workplace. After this, evaluations at a local level will be down to each DAT.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2000 and 2003 the figures include funds from the Home Office, Sport England, the Communities Against Drugs fund and the Recovered Assets Fund. From 2003&#150;04 onwards the Home Office funded the total cost of project grants.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 to 2003&#151;these figures have been approximated to financial years as Sport England originally allocated funding in variable &#039;project years&#039;.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2003&#150;04 onwards there was:<br>

An extension of the programme to include 17 to 19-year-olds, with a focus on links to education, training and employment.<br>

Additional funding to projects in the top 30 high crime Basic Command Unit areas (BCU).<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2004&#150;05 onwards there was a reduction in the core grant to established projects from 100&nbsp;per cent. to 60&nbsp;per cent. while support was given to identifying and negotiating gap funding. The programme has secured support from a range of local and national organisations, including &#163;1&nbsp;million per annum from the Football Foundation for new projects. Local projects have individually secured additional partnership funding ranging from &#163;10,000 to &#163;150,000.<br>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the project grant costs shown in the table, the programme also incurs some central costs associated principally with monitoring and evaluation, communications and the training and development of project staff. Estimates of these costs are not available for all the years shown in the table. However, for 2004&#150;05 the total central costs are expected to be approximately &#163;0.5&nbsp;million.<br>

 My right hon.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister considers that a simple majority of those voting being in favour is sufficient to indicate tenant support for a transfer.

<p><a name="40520w13.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 For young apprenticeships, the strategy is to set high quality standards, offer attractive learning opportunities alongside the statutory curriculum and ensure that recruits have good means of support for the duration of the programme. First, we have set demanding entry criteria for both the candidates and the partnerships that want to participate in the programme. Second, recruits will have every incentive to complete the programme as they will gain worthwhile skills, experience and qualifications as well as more training opportunities. Third, the programme will provide generous funding as well as comprehensive advice and support from partners such as the Sector Skills Councils. Finally, we believe the programme will meet an unmet need and will therefore prove itself popular among the recruits.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial data are taken from Havering LEA&#039;s section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES. Section 52 is collected on a financial year basis and not an academic year basis. 2002&#150;03 data are subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained primary schools sector.<br>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector and includes those secondary schools with sixth forms. Separate figures cannot be calculated for costs of sixth forms.<br>

[172424]</p>








<p><a name="40520w15.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Ministers took the decision to cancel the re-tendering exercise on the basis that it was no longer the most appropriate method of delivering provision. This decision was based on a number of key changes in the offender learning and skills environment:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The creation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and the introduction of new sentencing arrangements which offer an important opportunity to refocus work in this field and to improve coherence of offender learning across the custodial system and into the community;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Central Government initiatives to free resources for front line delivery and to reallocate operational responsibilities between government and partners; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The need to reap the skills and workforce benefits of closer partnerships between key agencies such as Jobcentre Plus and the Learning and Skills Council, and the desire to bring offender learning and skills into the mainstream of post-16 provision.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w15.html_para0">
The Offenders&#039; Learning and Skills Unit is now working with these partners towards a phased introduction of a new integrated service by developing prototypes in up to three regions or areas. These prototypes will inform the development of comprehensive proposals for a national delivery framework for offender learning and skills, so that from the summer of 2005 we can move towards a new delivery partnership led by the LSC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w15.html_para1">
In the meantime, officials are negotiating extensions to existing contracts from September 2004 as we develop the new service, with minimal changes to avoid disruption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w15.html_para2">
The total cost to my Department of the re-tendering and re-contracting project up until the change in policy was &#163;346,000. The majority of this would have been spent anyway in conducting policy development and administration, but it also includes professional, legal and technical advice specific to the project. Money spent on the latter has not been wasted as there will still be improvements to the delivery of prisons education, just not via a tendering exercise. Indeed, the main output of this project was a detailed specification for the new future service delivery; this was a valuable investment, as with some tailoring, this will form the key input to our new approach.

Figures up to and including1997&#150;98 figures are for Lancashire LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&#150;99 onwards parts of Lancashire LEA became Blackpool and Blackburn LEAs. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

The Adapted CFE Treaty (ACFE) cannot come into force until it has been ratified by all States Party. To date only three States have done so: Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for 2002&#150;03, the latest date for which data are available.<br>

2. Estimates are for Great Britain. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10,000, and proportions to the nearest per cent. Decile 1 is the lowest income decile.<br>

3. Estimates relate to the status of individuals at the time they were interviewed for the FRS.<br>

4. FRS-based estimates for both the number of people aged between 50 and state pension age, and the number of workless in this group exceed estimates sourced from the Labour Force Survey, the main source for employment statistics. The estimate of percentages should therefore be considered more robust than the estimate of numbers in this group.<br>

5. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response. Estimates are subject both to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<br>

6. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<br>

7. The Households Below Average Income series presents analysis of income of two bases: Before Housing Costs (BHC) and After Housing Costs (AHC). This is principally to take into account variations in housing costs that themselves do not correspond to comparable variations in the quality of housing.<br>

8. The Households Below Average Income series assumes that both partners in a couple receive the same income. Therefore any differences in the above between genders can be driven only by differences from single adults, which will themselves be diluted by the figures for couples.<br>

9. Deciles nine and 10 of the tables relating to non-working single people have been combined as individually, these deciles contained too few households to provide robust estimates.<br>

<p><a name="40520w21.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The methodology for a national bowel cancer screening programme is not clear cut. Following the publication of the results of a pilot using faecal occult blood (FOB) testing in May 2003, and early signs of the potential of flexible sigmoidoscopy, the Government re-affirmed their commitment to introducing bowel screening and to improving symptomatic services. The Department is addressing these difficult issues with the assistance of key stakeholders from the voluntary sector, patient and professional groups, and the national health service through the NHS bowel cancer programme and the bowel cancer advisory group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w21.html_para2">
The first phase of the pilot study of FOB testing showed that the performance of the original research can be replicated in a routine NHS setting. We have commissioned a second phase of the pilot at a cost of &#163;1&nbsp;million per annum to enable us to monitor the acceptability and effectiveness of repeat screening and to try and investigate service improvements, including 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1179W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
encouraging hard to reach social groups to accept their screening invitations. We are also considering a potential pilot of screening using flexible sigmoidoscopy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w21.html_para3">
NHS cancer screening programmes have commissioned a formal options appraisal of bowel cancer screening from the School of Health and Related Research in Sheffield. The options appraisal is due to report in the autumn, and will consider all the issues associated with bowel cancer screening, including the age range at which men and women will be invited for screening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w21.html_para4">
In addition, as part of the NHS bowel cancer programme, we are investing in the expansion, training and modernisation of the bowel cancer workforce, streamlining services for patients with bowel cancer symptoms, and considering communications issues for the general public and health professionals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w21.html_para5">
In order to gather evidence on screening methodology and to ensure symptomatic services are expanded and modernised to take on the extra work required, it is unlikely that a national screening programme will start before 2006&#150;07. It is currently estimated that a national bowel cancer screening programme will cost around &#163;80&nbsp;million a year to run.

 Information is not collected centrally on how much is spent on the treatment of diabetes. However, it has been estimated that around five per cent. of total national health service resources are used for the care of people with diabetes.

In his 2002 Budget, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced an historic five-year settlement for the national health service, which provides a sustained high level of growth in funding across the whole period. These plans mean that, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 May 2004 : Column 1181W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
for the period 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08, expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.3&nbsp;per cent. a year over and above inflation, a total increase over the period of 42&nbsp;per cent. in real terms. However, in keeping with the philosophy of &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, primary care trusts are free to decide the allocation of resources locally.

<p><a name="40520w25.html_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The cost of exempting the first &#163;10,000 of income from income tax for all pensioners would be &#163;2.2 billion in 2004&#150;05. This measure would affect approximately 3.0&nbsp;million pensioner households. This estimate is based on the 2001&#150;02 Family Resources Survey, and excludes any behavioural response to the change. Well over half the cost is accounted for by the top 20&nbsp;per cent. of pensioner households.

<p><a name="40520w25.html_spnew4"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 HM Customs and Excise are responsible for detecting and preventing the illegal import of drugs controlled under section 3(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971. There are no import prohibitions on prescription-only medicines unless they contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, such as Valium. A Home Office drugs licence must accompany such drugs if they are to be imported legally. When Customs detect such drugs illegally imported, either in the post or at ports or airports, they&nbsp;seize them and prosecute the importers where appropriate.

<p><a name="40520w25.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply. There was never any intention to grant mandatory rate relief to all sports and leisure facilities. The relief is targeted at community based sporting activities. Many premises defined on the rating list as &quot;sports clubs&quot; and &quot;leisure facilities&quot; are commercial profit-making companies. There would be no reason to offer relief to commercial companies to be funded by the general taxpayer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1) what discretion is available to principals and governors in applying the guidance on class sizes in practical subjects in post-primary schools contained in Circular 2004/05;  [173202]

</p>



<p>(2) whether <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;choir and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;orchestra are considered practical subjects for the purposes of restricting class sizes in post-primary schools as outlined in Circular 2004/5;  [173208]

</p>



<p>(4) for what reason the decision was taken by the Department of Education, outlined in Point 15 of Circular 2004/5, to supersede the exception previously granted to class sizes in music by Circular 2001/14 and the Department&#039;s letter dated 19&nbsp;December 2001.  [173211]</p>









<p><a name="40520w26.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 The Department considers that in general health and safety hazards are such that adequate and safe supervision of pupils is not possible if more than 20 pupils are present in a class and involved in practical activities. This applies to music classes but not choirs or orchestras which are not classified as classes for the purposes of the Department&#039;s Circular on Class Sizes in Practical Subjects. This Circular supersedes an&nbsp;earlier Circular which temporarily removed the 20 pupils class size limit. This occurred because of representations which were made at the time that schools required more notice before implementing the policy in relation to class sizes in music.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40520w26.html_para3">
In meeting the Circular&#039;s requirements schools should consider the effective use of timetable strategies to reduce class sizes. Should any other issues arise for specific schools with regard to meeting the maximum class size requirement of 20 pupils for music, schools can seek advice from the Department on an appropriate way forward.
