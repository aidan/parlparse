<i> [holding answer 19 November 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Government launched the Women&#146;s Offending Reduction Programme (WORP) in March 2004 to tackle women&#146;s offending and to reduce the number of women in prison. This multi-agency strategic programme of work aims to provide a more appropriate response in the community to the particular factors that lead to women offending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80125w0010.htm_para9"><a name="08012540002984">In March 2005, the Government allocated &#163;9.15 million to help support a more local response to women&#146;s offending and to establish new initiatives to tackle women&#146;s offending in the community&#151;the Together Women Programme. This is the first time that the Government have dedicated funds specifically to tackling women&#146;s offending and to exploring how alternatives approaches to custody could work effectively for women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80125w0010.htm_para10"><a name="08012540002985">The Together Women Programme is being delivered over four years through demonstration projects in two regional offender manager regions&#151;Yorkshire and Humberside and the North West. Centres are located in Doncaster, Leeds and Bradford (YH) and Liverpool and Salford (NW). The centres provide a one-stop shop where women from the local community can access appropriate services and interventions such as mental, physical and sexual health, drug misuse, physical and sexual abuse, housing advice and debt and benefits service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80125w0010.htm_para11"><a name="08012540002986">On 6 December 2007, the Government published its response to Baroness Corston&#146;s Review of Women with Particular Vulnerabilities in the Criminal Justice System. This sets out our commitment to build on the work already under way to meet the needs of women offenders and those at risk of offending in the community in order to divert women from custody.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts, and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Maternity Coverage and data quality</i><br>
The maternity tail data coverage is not as complete as the rest of HES data. There are a number of reasons for the coverage and data quality issues such as:<br>
Trusts submitting a significantly higher number of delivery episodes compared to birth episodes<br>
Trusts failing to submit data on the number of birth episodes where they record a high number of delivery episodes<br>
Trusts failing to submit delivery&#151;the reason for this is that approximately 20 trusts have a stand alone maternity system which is not linked to the Patient Administration System<br>
Trusts identifying a high number of maternity beds available, but not recording any information about deliveries or births<br>
Trusts identifying that they have no maternity beds available, but recording a high number of birth and delivery episodes<br>
Some trusts have space in their maternity system to record 9 birth tails, whereas other systems have space for 18. As deliveries, miscarriages and abortions are all recorded in the birth tail, there are cases where 9 tails is not enough to record all of the relevant data<br>
<i> All Diagnoses count of episodes</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all FCE&#146;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
See table 3 for Diagnosis codes used.<br>
<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Episode Type:</i><br>
2 - Deliver/ Event<br>
5 - Other Delivery Event<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 Where traffic regulation orders are subject to civil enforcement by local authorities, a motorist wishing to dispute a penalty charge notice may make formal representations to the relevant local authority. If these are rejected, the motorist may appeal to the independent parking adjudicator.

 The national collision statistical reporting form (commonly known as STATS19) is used to collect standard information, when a personal injury road accident is reported to the police. The information is collected by the police at the scene of the accident or, in a minority of cases, it is reported by a member of the public at a police station. Some 50 data items are collected for each accident, including the time, location and circumstances of the accident, the vehicles involved and some information on each casualty. After processing this information is forwarded by each police force (via local processing authorities in the case of some forces) to the Department electronically and entered into a database.

That is why, at the end of 2007, we published a new Planning Policy Statement (PPS): Planning and Climate Change, which makes cutting carbon emissions a key Government priority for the planning system in England. The PPS sets out how planning can help secure enduring progress against the UK's emissions targets, by direct influence on energy use and emissions, and in bringing together and encouraging action by others. As part of this contribution, planning authorities are expected to prepare and manage the delivery of spatial strategies that help secure the fullest possible use of sustainable transport and make the most of existing and planned opportunities for decentralised and renewable or low-carbon energy. This document should be read alongside our forthcoming consultation on revisions to PPS6.</p>
