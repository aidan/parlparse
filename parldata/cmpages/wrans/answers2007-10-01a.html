Under the 1999 Montreal Convention which came into force for the UK in June 2004 the carrier is prima facie liable for luggage that has been delayed, damaged or lost (unless the carrier can establish a defence under the Convention). The liability for delay, loss or damage to baggage is limited to 1,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - approximately &#163;820. These are maximum limits. Claims are assessed individually.</p>

The standard was informed by a review, carried out for the Agency, on the effect of fluoride on a range of aquatic life. This review drew on available research from recognised scientific laboratories and indicated that fluoride affects aquatic life at concentrations at 9.0-350.Omg/l depending on the hardness of the water and the sensitivity of the species tested.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 September 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Government have a duty to explain its policies, decisions and actions; to inform the public about their rights and liabilities; and to provide the public with advice and warnings. DEFRA publishes regularly reports and consultations in accordance with these principles, but to establish the combinations of such publications could be collated only at disproportionate cost. Print procurement policy is to produce the lowest quantity of publications to meet the specific needs of each case, thereby minimising waste. In the case of consultations most are handled on-line and stakeholders may download a copy for local printing. Copies will be supplied to order&#151;printed digitally&#151;on a limited basis, if requested, as will large print and Braille versions.</p>

The costs for retaining DNA samples fall to individual police forces and are dependent on the contractual agreement between the force and the forensic supplier. This information is commercially confidential. The costs of retaining DNA profiles on the National DNA Database are essentially the costs of running and operating the database.

The Annual Report for 2002-03 was the first annual report produced; and no information is available for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02.

Since the 2006/07 JOT target was set, more recent historical performance information has become available, suggesting that the target involves a higher degree of challenge than was intended. Given this, the department recognises that the JOT points target was set 8.4% too high. A target level of around 12.4 million points would have been more representative of the degree of challenge intended, rather than the original 13.5 million-point target. However, it was agreed that Jobcentre Plus would continue to report against the original profile for 2006/07. Detailed JOT performance data is published on the Jobcentre Plus website and updated regularly.</p>

1. Data is based on all leavers from all new deal programmes.<br>
2. Data on &#145;other benefits&#146; refers to income support and incapacity benefit only as these are the only benefits linked to an individual being out of work. The data shows the number of leavers from new deal making new claims to either of those benefits in the periods concerned.<br>
3. Latest complete year data is for 2005. The number and percentage of people moving to other benefits more than 12 months from the date of leaving new deal is based on benefit data to November 2006 (latest available). It would be expected that these numbers, particularly for later years, would rise as more up-to-date benefit data becomes available.<br>
4. If a person has two separate periods on benefit, one between six and 12 months after leaving new deal, and one more than 12 months after leaving new deal, only the benefit period between six and 12 months is included in the table.<br>

<i> [holding answer 26 July 2007]:</i> The in-work credit was introduced in 22 pilot areas in four staggered phases from April 2004. It is designed to help participants cope with the financial aspects of the transition from welfare to work. Participants are paid &#163;40 per week over and above their total income when they start work for 16 hours or more a week. This is paid for a maximum of 52 weeks. From 1 July 2007 the payment in London was increased to &#163;60 a week to address the higher costs of living in the capital.</p>

 2. Up to the end of April 2007, 44,080 people had claimed the in-work credit and 28,030 people had finished their claim for the in-work credit.<br>

Pensioner households are defined here as single people aged over women's SPA and couples where at least one partner is over women's SPA.  2. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million, and proportions to the nearest 1 per cent.  3. Proportions entitled are based on Pensim2, a dynamic micro-simulation model produced by the Department for Work and Pensions. This model is designed to estimate long-term trends; estimates for individual years are subject to random variation and should be treated with caution. The time series have been smoothed using a three-year moving average.  4. Numbers entitled have been estimated by applying the estimated proportion entitled to the projected household population above women's SPA, which is derived from Government Actuary's Department's 2004-based projections of individuals and trends in private households modelled in Pensim2.  5. Projections are calibrated to National Statistics estimates of eligibility to pension credit in 2005-06, which adjust Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. The National Statistics are published as a range; the projections have been calibrated to the mid-point of that range.  6. Projections take account of policies introduced in the Pensions Act 2007, including changes in state pension age. They do not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit.<br>

<i> [holding answer</i><i> s</i><i>  10 September 2007]:</i> During the recent postal disruption, the Department used a company with whom it has an existing contract for providing courier services. In the absence of assurance from Royal Mail that deliveries to our customers could be maintained, we used our contingency arrangements to ensure customers (many among the most vulnerable in society) received their payments. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis was conducted when the cheque contingency plan was developed.

A quantifiable saving of &#163;250,000 was made by using our contingency arrangements, in not having to incur postal delivery charges.

1. The Family Resources Survey is a nationally representative sample of approximately 26,000 households in 2005-06 and 23,000 households in 1997-98.<br>
2. Data is shown for Great Britain only for both 1997-98 and 2005-06. (Northern Ireland joined the survey in 2002-03, so UK data is not available for 1997-98.)<br>
3. Data for 2005-06 was collected between April 2005 and March 2006; 1997-98 was collected between April 1997 and March 1998.<br>
4. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which align the FRS to Government office region populations by age and sex. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-response error.<br>
5. Tax credit and income-related benefits receipt is under-reported on the FRS. This will mean that the FRS estimates are likely to be under-estimates. However, there is no other reliable source for this information at a household level.<br>
6. Figures for the number of households and persons have been rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>
7. Individuals and households in receipt of either tax credit, working tax credit or child tax credit have been counted.<br>
8. There are more households than persons because different individuals within the household might receive the benefits and tax credits.<br>
9. &#145;Income-related benefits&#146; includes income support, income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, council tax benefit, housing benefit, and for 2005-06 only, pension credit.<br>

They are intended to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. They may be used to prescribe the nature of the development, or to secure a contribution from a developer to compensate for loss or damage created by a development or to mitigate a developments impact.

Before September 2005, inspectors were usually informed about how classes were organised by means of pre-inspection documentation, discussion with headteachers or teachers' schemes of work or lesson plans. Under the inspection arrangements at that time, all full-time teachers were observed by inspectors. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the headteacher or teacher by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may therefore not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>

 Prior to October 2006, teacher training providers were required to ensure that all candidates entering primary teacher training had achieved a standard equivalent to a grade C in the GCSE examination in a science subject. This was because primary trainees were normally required to teach the whole curriculum, including maths, English and science and would be better prepared to train to teach these subjects if they have demonstrated the GCSE equivalent in them. However, an exemption had been applied for those born before 1 September 1979 as this coincided with the date at which science became compulsory at key stage 4 of the National Curriculum for people born after that date.</p>

Offers made prior to this date for places on courses beginning after it could stand as they were made prior to the legislation being introduced but any candidates offered places after 1 October 2007 would need to demonstrate the GCSE science standard.</p>

Some teacher training providers offer equivalency tests; others use subject knowledge audits to test this standard. Some providers have worked with further education colleges to offer extra GCSE science courses and the TDA has worked with both providers and their associations to ensure that effective practice in meeting the needs of applicants is shared.</p>

It makes it clear that age-related practices, such as age-related fee concessions, may be objectively justified where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. That judgment can only be made by the individual provider in the light of local circumstances, the courses they offer and their own legal advice.</p>
