To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what reports he has received of the deployment of Zimbabwean forces in protecting mining interests in the Congo; and who owns those interests.  [120868]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We have seen reports that the Zimbabwean Defence Forces are deployed in areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which contain the main diamond fields and reserves of copper and cobalt. We understand that exploitation of diamonds is principally carried out by the Societe Miniere de Bakwanga (MIBA), and production of copper and cobalt by GECAMINES. Both of these companies are substantially DRC state-owned, but there are reports that they have entered into joint venture with various partners. There are also reports that the Zimbabwean Defence Force has set up a company called OSLEG Private Limited, which includes capital provided by private investors, to exploit DRC's mineral reserves.

<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what communication he has had with the Iranian Foreign Minister regarding the timing of his visit to Iran; and if he raised the issue of legal proceedings concerning members of the Jewish community in Shiraz in the course of that communication.  [121213]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Iranian authorities are well aware of our concerns about the trial of 13 members of the Jewish community on espionage charges in Shiraz. The Foreign Secretary made these clear to Dr. Kharrazi personally when he visited London in January. We and our EU partners have raised our concerns on many occasions, most recently in the form of a demarche by the EU Presidency in Tehran on 29 April. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Foreign Secretary's visit to Tehran has 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 258W</I><P>
been postponed from 8/9 May to 4/5 July. The Foreign Secretary spoke briefly to Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi on 29 April in order to postpone this visit.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 17 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 396-97W, what assessment he has made of recent developments in the legal proceedings concerning members of the Jewish community in Shiraz, Iran, with particular reference to the case of Hamid Tefilin; what representations have been made to the Government of Iran about the decision to hold the trial in camera and about the proceedings in general; what steps have been taken by the Government to monitor the trial; and if he will make a statement.  [121141]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We and our EU partners have raised our concerns about the detention and trial of a number of Iranians including 13 members of the Iranian Jewish community in Shiraz on espionage charges with the Iranian authorities on a number of occasions, most recently in the form of a demarche by the EU Presidency in Tehran on 29 April.
<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para0">Our Embassy in Tehran is working closely with our EU partners and other like-minded embassies to ensure that events in Shiraz are monitored closely. We are aware of reports emanating from Hamid Tefilin's defence counsel that Mr. Tefilin has confessed to being trained to spy for Israel, but that he has not carried out any espionage activity. We shall continue to monitor events closely.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Corbett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the Iranian authorities over the banning of newspapers and magazines.  [121136]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We and our EU partners have been following closely events in Iran. We note that the editors of the newspapers and magazines that have been banned are avoiding public comment and urging their supporters to follow suit in an effort to maintain calm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make representations at the UN to allow sanctions against <i>(a)</i> Serbia and <i>(b)</i> Iraq to be lifted on goods relating to bona fide scientific and technological work essential to food testing and civil manufacturing industry.  [121079]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 UN Security Council resolution 1160 (1998) imposed an embargo on the supply of arms and related material to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a ban on arming and training for terrorist activities there. There are no other UN sanctions measures in force in relation to Serbia.
<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para1">Under the current terms of the "Oil-for-Food" programme, established by Security Council resolution 986, Iraq can sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy a wide range of humanitarian goods, including the kind of equipment mentioned in the question. Iraq is expected to raise $10 billion this year from oil sales. Each contract is checked to ensure that the goods will be used for their stated purpose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to "IGC: Reform for Enlargement, Cm 4595", what study has been made by <i>(a)</i> Her Majesty's Government and <i>(b)</i> the European Union of the political consequences of admission to the European Union of parts of former Yugoslavia; by whom it was made; and if its conclusions have been published. [121061]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Government's (and European Union's) overall objective is the fullest possible integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the political and economic mainstream of Europe. No formal study has been made of the political consequences of admission to the European Union of parts of the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to "IGC: Reform for Enlargement, Cm 4595", in relation to the adoption of the Acquis of the Community, what permanent or temporary derogations are planned to be made to any applicant state in respect of <i>(a)</i> the Common Fisheries Policy, <i>(b)</i> the Common Agricultural Policy and <i>(c)</i> participation in the Cohesion Fund.  [121077]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 It is too early in the accession negotiations to predict the extent of any derogations.
<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para2">Negotiations on Fisheries have started with six applicant countries (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia). The EU Common Positions agreed for these negotiations make clear that all new member states will be expected to apply the Common Fisheries Policy in full.
<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para3">Negotiations have also started on Regional Policy with these countries. But their participation in the Cohesion Funds will not be determined until later in the negotiations.
<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para4">We expect negotiations on Agriculture with these countries to begin in June this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 2 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 67W, on Iraqi oil, if he has asked the <i>(a)</i> Council of Ministers and <i>(b)</i> European Commission to put pressure on Turkey to bring the trade in Iraqi oil across its borders into the UN humanitarian programme; what was the volume of oil in metric tonnes sold through the UN programme in (i) 1999 and (ii) 2000 to date; and what was the estimated value in (1) 1999 and (2) 2000 to date of Iraqi oil sold (x) through the UN programme and (y) in breach of sanctions.  [121054]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We have discussed measures to cut down on oil smuggling including through Turkey with the other members of the Security Council which includes two fellow members of the European Union.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 260W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para5">The estimated value of illegal oil exports in 1999 was $250 million and in 2000 to date $170 million. As I pointed out in my answer of 2 May, the UK is making every effort to reduce this illegal trade,.
<P>

<a name="00508w01.html_para6">UN statistics for the volume of oil sold under the "oil for food" arrangements are provided for each six month phase and in barrels. For phase V (26 November 1998 to 25 May 1999) the volume of oil sold was 360.8 million barrels worth $3.95 billion. For phase VI (25 May 1999 to 11 December 1999) the volume of oil sold was 389.6 million barrels worth $7.4 billion. Under the present phase (phase VII) the volume of oil sold up to 28 April was 244.7 million barrels worth $5.79 billion. Phase VII ends on 7 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Portillo: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what will be the net financial impact, in the first financial year of its operation, of the climate change levy on <i>(a)</i> the automotive industry, <i>(b)</i> the farming industry, <i>(c)</i> the shipbuilding industry and <i>(d)</i> manufacturing industry in the West Midlands.  [120992]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 May 2000]:</i> The Climate Change Levy package as a whole is expected to be revenue neutral for the private sector. Its introduction will entail no net financial gain for the public finances. The levy package as a whole is also expected to be broadly neutral between the manufacturing and the service sectors.
<P>

<a name="00508w02.html_para0">The Government have sought to design the climate change levy in a way that maximises its environmental effectiveness while protecting the competitiveness of UK firms. It is not possible to say with precision what the effects of the climate change levy on individual sectors or firms will be, since this will depend, among other things, on each sector's future energy use, employment trends, and take up of the various incentives to improve energy efficiency.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent assessment he has made of the efficiency of the administration relating to bonds by National Savings; and if he will make a statement. [120218]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w02.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2000]:</i> National Savings (NS) takes great care to ensure the systems it uses to deliver its products are efficient and effective. This is essential if NS are to continue to operate successfully in the increasingly competitive retail savings sector. Ministers set annual targets for NS to measure, report on and improve the efficiency of its product administration systems. To achieve these targets NS uses a framework of performance measures, standards and reporting procedures constantly to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of its product administration systems, including those relating to bonds. This ensures they are subject to continuous improvement and that they remain competitive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on delays in the payment of bills due under the Army Criminal Legal Aid Authority.  [120136]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2000]:</i> The Army Criminal Legal Aid Authority (ACLAA) was set up in 1996 to administer the provision of legal aid for individuals facing court-martial or other defined legal processes. The role of ACLAA is to receive applications 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 263W</I><P>
for legal aid, define the individual contribution required, make an offer of legal aid on that basis, negotiate acceptance with the employing unit and individual, instruct legal representatives, and finally to review and settle bills for work done.
<P>

<a name="00508w02.html_para9">In December last year the Officer in Charge became ill which led to some reordering of work while his situation clarified. Sadly it has become clear that it will not be possible for him to return to ACLAA. In addition another experienced member of staff also became ill in January, and has not been able to return either.
<P>

<a name="00508w02.html_para10">While new staff were being recruited it was necessary to give priority to the allocation of legal aid to individuals to ensure that the legal process was not disrupted or delayed. Regrettably this meant that ACLAA was not able to assess and clear bills until the arrival of additional staff. Over the last month ACLAA staff have been working hard to deal with the backlog of bills that were awaiting payment and many have now been settled.
<P>

<a name="00508w02.html_para11">Any delay in payment is regrettable. However, ACLAA is currently being expanded and strengthened which should ensure that similar delays, caused by unforeseen circumstances, do not recur.

 The supply of food for the armed forces has been contracted out to "3663" and we require them to seek the best price in the open market, consistent with meeting our quality standard. I am as keen, however, on seeing our servicemen and women eating British products as I am for our contractor to secure best value for money. In the case of British beef, since autumn of 1998 we have been supplying 100 per cent. British beef to our armed forces personnel based in the United Kingdom. Supplies for armed forces personnel based overseas are currently sourced from a number of countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the average number of businesses dealt with by band 3 inspectors in the Health and Safety Executive in the last 12 months for which figures are available.  [120390]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2000]:</i> Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Band 3 inspectors are used in the majority of sectors for which HSE has enforcement responsibility. Inspector contacts with businesses can vary considerably, depending on the sector and circumstances. Inspectors may contact the same business more than once during the course of the year, or may contact several operating sites owned by the same business. Also, a contact could involve an in depth audit, taking several days, or a short visit or meeting.
<P>

<a name="00508w03.html_para1">In total, HSE staff made 183,000 regulatory contacts with dutyholders and businesses in 1998-99, the last year for which figures are available. Of these, about 8,000 were made by administrative staff in HSE's Field Operations Directorate (FOD), and 33,000 by FOD inspectors other than Band 3 inspectors. A proportion of the rest may have involved inspectors other than Band 3 inspectors, but these could be disaggregated from the date only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00508w03.html_para2">In total, approximately 500 Band 3 inspector staff years spent by HSE Operating Directorates and Divisions in 1998-99 on inspection, investigation and enforcement activity which would have generated the vast majority of regulatory contacts.

 Since the formation of the Trades Unions Sustainable Development Advisory Committee in July 1998 there have been six meetings.

In addition, they are bound by the adjustments to the Protocol adopted in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995) and Montreal (1997). The means by which the Community gives effect internally to all these obligation is EC Regulation 3093/94.

<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Health and Safety Executive has issued no specific safety guidance on the storage or use of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in and near NHS premises.
<P>

<a name="00508w05.html_para0">The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 requires all employers to assess the risks to people's health and safety from the undertaking, which would include the storage or use of substances such as VOCs, and to take steps to minimise the risk.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> NHS Estates gives to health service bodies tendering for refrigeration equipment.  [120418]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The model framework for greening Government operations--which Government departments have been encouraged to adopt or adapt to meet their special circumstances--promotes environmentally preferable refrigerants having a zero or low potential for ozone depletion or global warming. I cannot answer for NHS Estates as responsibility here rests with the Secretary of State for Health. However, it is DETR's policy not to buy refrigerants containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and to avoid hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances where there are suitable alternatives. Our policy is also to favour technologies and refrigerants with little or no potential to contribute to global warming where they are safe, cost effective and practicable. Advice on environmentally preferable refrigerants is given in DETR's "Green Guide for Buyers" 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 274W</I><P>
and other guidance which can be found on DETR's website. There are however circumstances--especially with retrofits--where currently available environmentally preferable technologies and refrigerants are not safe or are excessively costly. We are continuing to put pressure on our suppliers to develop more cost effective, safer and greener products.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with fire safety experts about the implications of installing <i>(a)</i> hydrocarbon and <i>(b)</i> ammonia-based refrigeration as part of air conditioning systems in public places; and if he will make a statement.  [120420]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of any person or company installing hydrocarbon or ammonia-based air conditioning equipment in a public place to ensure that all fire and safety issues are properly addressed. Such installations should follow the guidance set out in British Standard (BS 4434): "Specification for safety and environmental aspects in the design, construction and installation of refrigerating appliances and systems (1995)". The Health and Safety Executive were on the technical committee that drafted BS 443.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his policy on the storage and use of <i>(a)</i> hydrocarbons, <i>(b)</i> HFCs and <i>(c)</i> ammonia in (i) refrigeration and (ii) air conditioning systems used by health service bodies.  [120423]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Management of Heath and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 require all employers, including health service bodies, to carry out an assessment of risks to people's health and safety form the undertaking, including the effects of hazardous substances. This would include an assessment of the risks from hydrocarbons, HFCs and ammonia used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his estimate of the quantity of <i>(a)</i> HFC, <i>(b)</i> HCFC, <i>(c)</i> ammonia, <i>(d)</i> hydrocarbons and <i>(e)</i> CFCs in use in the UK in (i) refrigeration, (ii) air conditioning, (iii) aerosols, (iv) metered dose inhalers and (v) other applications.

 The most recent estimates available are given in the table. Data on the use of ammonia and hydrocarbons in the air conditioning and refrigeration sectors are not available; however, their use is relatively minor. In addition, the majority of aerosols manufactured in the UK are filled with hydrocarbons, but data on the amounts used are not available.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 10,000 benefit units, although they are not necessarily accurate to that degree.<P>

2. Pensioner benefit units are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over State pension age (men 65 and over, women 60 and over) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over State pension age.<P>

3. Income-related benefits include Income Support, Family Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Social Fund Grants.<P>

4. National Insurance-related benefits include State Retirement Pension, Widows' Benefits and Incapacity Benefit.<P>

5. Estimates of benefit income are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income, and are therefore subject to misreporting. For example, some respondents may not be able to differentiate between State Retirement Pension and Income Support since both benefits are received in a single payment.<P>

6. Estimates of the number of pensioner benefit units in receipt of occupational pension are based on survey respondents' own assessment and may be subject to under-reporting.<P>

 Details of the value of UK exports and of the number of weapons including small arms was taken from information collected by HM Customs and Excise for trade statistics purposes.

<P>

 There was an orientation debate on the review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. During the debate all member states supported the general approach of the Commission on regulation of access to infrastructures in order to promote competition. A number, including the UK, welcomed the Commission's proposal that regulation should be on a co-regulatory basis with business where possible. Regarding the new institutional structure, member states welcomed the Commission's intention to build on the existing structure, but define the roles of any new bodies. On the scope of universal service, most member states, including the UK, supported the Commission's proposal to retain the existing scope of universal service, but to keep this under review.

 There are no plans at present to establish an Environmental Protection Agency for Northern Ireland. The Environment and Heritage Service, a Next Steps Executive Agency within the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, was set up on 1 April 1996 to assume operational responsibility for environmental issues. At devolution, the Northern Ireland Assembly decided to place environment and heritage responsibilities in the new Department of the Environment. I would expect any re-examination of the way in which such matters are handled to be considered by the devolved administration.

<BR>
In Northern Ireland, a comprehensive monitoring programme which is operated by EHS's Industrial Pollution and Radiochemical Inspectorate, has been in place since the early 1970s. The programme is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that any changes in discharges from the Sellafield Plant are carefully assessed.
<BR>
Discharges into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield Plant are authorised by the Environment Agency. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture (CEFAS), formerly the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has been sampling and analysing seawater, fish, shellfish, seaweed and sediments in the Irish Sea since the early 1950s. In Northern Ireland, our Inspectorate arranges for samples of seaweed, sediments, fish, nephrops, mussels and winkles to be collected quarterly and forwarded to the CEFAS Research laboratory at Lowestoft. The seaweeds are collected in the Ards Peninsula area and at Portrush and the marine life samples are obtained as far as possible from commercial landings, at Kilkeel and Portavogie. Sediments samples are collected from Northern Ireland's 5 marine loughs.
<BR>
The Northern Ireland results are published annually in a report entitled "Radioactivity in Food and the Environment" issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and also in the Northern Ireland Abstract of Statistics. The levels of radioactivity measured indicate that they are of negligible radiological significance.
<BR>
In addition to this programme, the Inspectorate monitors with gamma dose rate in air over intertidal sediments in each district council area which has a coastline. The results indicate minimal radioactivity deposition and are consistent with normal background levels.
<BR>
We have also undertaken a number of collaborative studies with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and University College Dublin since 1990. A copy of the joint report on Carlingford Lough is available in the Library of the House of Commons.
<BR>
I can report that on average, people in Northern Ireland receive 2500 microsieverts of radiation a year from all natural and artificial sources; 50 per cent. is due to exposure to radon in the home. 12 per cent. from medical exposure and nuclear discharges accounts for less than 0.1 per cent.
<BR>
In view of the comprehensive information already available from the monitoring programme there are no plans to establish a separate study at this time. I can assure you, however, that the Department will continue with the monitoring programme in view of local concerns.

Lady will be aware that Ministers have confirmed that there is no general relief from VAT on repair costs for churches and the Government's current agreement with their European partners means that new zero rates cannot be introduced. While there is no provision for a reduced rate of VAT under Annex H to the Sixth Directive, it applies only to social housing and not churches.

 In 1999 the Commissioners contributed &#163;156.1 million in support for the Church's ministry, including an element targeted specifically towards parish ministry in those dioceses most in need of financial help.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has responsibility for the development, administration and marking of the National Curriculum tests, on behalf of the Secretary of State, and takes considerable care in the development and marking arrangements for all the tests. This was reflected in the findings of the Rose Review, an independent cross-party panel set up last year to consider the test development and assessment arrangements at Key Stage 2. As part of the quality control of marking, each external marking agency evaluates the training programme for each year and makes recommendations for change or improvement. In addition the QCA seeks the views of a sample of markers on all aspects of the process, including training. Such feedback is put into the continuous programme of improvement conducted year-on-year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment whether he expects teachers to check the marking of end of Key Stage 2 test papers on their return from the external marking agency.  [121090]

<P>
<a name="00508w10.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Teachers are not expected to check the marking of test papers on their return from the external marking agency. However, teachers may wish to use the tests as a means of providing feedback to pupils on their performance and, in order to do this, they would have to review the pupils' marks against the markscheme. It is for schools to decide whether and how to use the tests in reviewing pupils performance. Teachers may also have doubts about the final level awarded to any pupil. If they decide to request a formal review of the marking in the test, they would need to refer to the markscheme in order to identify errors and provide a reason for a review.

 Responsibility for the subject of the question has been delegated to the Employment Service agency under its Chief Executive. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.
<P>

<a name="00508w11.html_para0"><i>Letter from Mark Neale to Mr. Lembit Opik, dated 8 May 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="00508w11.html_para1">

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked Leigh Lewis to reply to your question about the procedure that is followed where a jobseeker and an employment officer cannot reach agreement on the details of a Jobseeker's Agreement. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr. Lewis as Chief Executive of the Employment Service. I am replying in his absence.
<BR>
Jobseeker's Allowance regulations set out the conditions for the receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). These include a requirement that a jobseeker must have a Jobseeker's Agreement which both the jobseeker and the employment officer have signed. The contents of the Agreement are negotiated between the Jobseeker and the employment officer at the initial interview when a claim for JSA is made.
<BR>
If the adviser and Jobseeker cannot agree the Jobseeker's Agreement, the case is referred to an independent Sector Decision Maker for consideration.
<BR>
The Sector Decision Maker can determine the contents of a Jobseeker's Agreement and issue a direction that the jobseeker should comply with. The direction will state what the contents of the Jobseeker's Agreement should be and enable the jobseeker to satisfy the availability and actively seeking employment conditions. If the Jobseeker's Agreement is not signed by the jobseeker following the Decision Maker's determination, the Jobseeker's Agreement will not be valid and Jobseeker's Allowance will not be paid.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<a name="00508w12.html_para10">Although there have been a few years when small rises were recorded, including 1998, there has been a steady decrease in the number of procedures performed since 1970. This reflects advances in science that have allowed the replacement of animals in scientific procedures, the reduction of the numbers of animals used per procedure and the refinement of those procedures. This Government's decisions to end some categories of animal use, such as cosmetic testing, have also made a contribution. More recently, there has also been a downward trend in the use of conventional animals, offset by an increase in the use of genetically modified animals. These trends also reflect recent scientific advances.

 When the Criminal Records Bureau comes into operation, it will be expected to recover its costs through charges for the certificates that it will issue, on application, to individuals. Until the Bureau's operating costs have been determined, it will not be possible to fix the charges, but the cost has previously been estimated at between &#163;5 to &#163;10, depending on the type of certificate requested. There are no plans to have a separate scale of charges for volunteers working with children.

<P>
<a name="00508w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The majority of Prison Service sales contracts are with the Ministry of Defence and other Government Departments and are formulated on a framework basis. As such, the value of the contract may not have a direct relationship to actual sales. The figures given in the table are for actual sales and, therefore, provide a more accurate representation of commercial work undertaken. The figures include sales from agribusiness as well as industries.

 I am determined that as many prisoners as possible should make a contribution to their keep. Officials will be reporting shortly on the outcome of work they have been doing on the extent to which the Prisoners' Earnings Act 1996 can contribute to this objective and I will then consider the options.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the number of resource employment places in prisons in England and Wales in each of the last 10 years for which figures are available, broken down by type of activity.  [120693]

<a name="00508w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prior to 1994 accounts were submitted centrally covering industries' and farms' output but following devolution of funding to establishment level this has not been a requirement. Therefore, from 1995-96 the figures have been extracted from data supplied as part of the Prison Service accounts. The available information is given in the table.

 Section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 allows for release from prison on compassionate grounds in exceptional circumstances. Remission of sentence was abolished with the introduction of the 1991 Act.
<P>

<a name="00508w14.html_para8">Decisions to release prisoners under section 36 of the 1991 Act are rare. Release is granted only where strict criteria are met and where it is considered that release will not place the safety of the public at risk.
<P>

<a name="00508w14.html_para9">Where a prisoner's exceptional circumstances warrant release on compassionate grounds, he or she must comply with the conditions contained in their release licence. If he or she fails to comply with those conditions, or if his or her behaviour after release indicates that there is reason to revise the original risk assessment, the licence can be revoked and the individual returned to custody. Current policy is that improvement in an individual's medical circumstances are not, on their own, sufficient reason to revoke a licence. There are no plans to change this policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), of 2 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 75W, on the home detention curfew scheme, what offences were committed by the prisoners released before the requisite period; and what was the <i>(a)</i> sentence received, <i>(b)</i> requisite period and <i>(c)</i> sentence served in each case.

 My reply to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), of 2 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 74-75W, indicated that 12 prisoners had been released on the Home Detention Curfew scheme before the end of the requisite period. Further inquiries have revealed that in one case the prisoner was in fact released on the correct date. The available information, therefore, shows that since the Home Detention Curfew scheme commenced in January 1999, a total of 11 prisoners have been released early.
<P>

<a name="00508w14.html_para11">The original offences committed by the prisoners released on Home Detention Curfew before the requisite period, the sentence received, the requisite period and the sentence served in 10 of the 11 cases, are shown in the table. The table also shows additional days awarded (ADAs) as a result of a prisoner breaching the prison

disciplinary code. As explained in my reply of 2 May, in a number of cases the early releases were due to the prison's failure to take into account the additional days awarded.
<P>

<a name="00508w14.html_para12">A further prisoner, sentenced to two years and six months in respect of an offence of wounding (inflicting grievous bodily harm), was released on Home Detention Curfew before the end of the requisite period of 398 days due to an error in the original sentence calculation. The prisoner was returned to custody after 15 days. He was subsequently released at his automatic conditional release date, his second Home Detention Curfew application having been refused. He served a total of 442 days.

The Wembley Task Force has discussed a range of transport and other infrastructure issues relating to the wider Wembley regeneration area but this has not included negotiation of section 106 agreements which are a matter for the London Borough of Brent and relevant developers.

 The National Lottery funds numerous projects which bring widespread benefits to seaside towns. Research jointly commissioned by my Department and the Lottery distributors into Lottery funding in the coalfields and other areas does however suggest that resort and retirement towns have made relatively fewer applications and have received less per capita than the national average. A second phase of the research, to be published shortly, will seek to identify the reasons for the low level of Lottery funding in certain areas and recommend ways of redressing the balance. I have directed distributors to ensure that there is the widest possible access in all parts of the country to Lottery funding and that funding contributes to reducing social and economic deprivation.

 The National Curriculum requires schools to offer the opportunity to participate in games, athletics, dance, gymnastics, outdoor and adventure activity and swimming. Within these broad areas it is for schools to determine which sports to pursue. The Government would encourage schools to offer as broad a range of sporting activity as possible, but recognise that this can sometimes be difficult. That is why we are working with Sport England and the Youth Sports Trust on a scheme to establish up to 600 schools sport co-ordinators, who will work in families of schools to encourage better links and sharing of facilities. This will mean that pupils will benefit from a wider range of activities than if their school were operating in isolation.

 Education is central to eradicating the brutal practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). We fund a range of educational projects in Britain. This year we have awarded the London Black Women's Health Action Project a section 64 project grant of &#163;25,000 for 1999-2000 for their training and resource project.

 The Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 makes it an offence to carry out the procedures known as female circumcision. It also makes it an offence for anyone to aid, abet, counsel or procure the carrying out of these procedures by any other person on her own body.
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para2">There have been no prosecutions under the Act since it came into force. The lack of prosecutions for this offence is only because of the small number of complaints made to the police and the difficulty of obtaining evidence where a complaint is made. Encouraging the education of professionals and practising communities is a more effective tool for eradicating female genital mutilation.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00508w17.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 makes the procedure of female genital mutilation (FGM) illegal. As well as this Act, legal protection for girls is also provided by the Children Act 1989. If a local authority has reason to believe that a child is likely to suffer significant harm, it is obliged to make such inquiries as it considers necessary to enable it to decide whether it should take any action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare. Under the Act, a Prohibited Steps Order can be made to prevent parents carrying out 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 321W</I><P>
a particular act without the consent of the Court (eg removing the child from the United Kingdom so that mutilation can be carried out abroad).
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para3">Further protection is offered under the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998. This Act makes it an offence for a person to conspire to commit an offence outside the United Kingdom, provided the substantive offence constitutes an offence both under the law in the UK and under the law in the country in which the act is committed. Therefore if parents take their daughters abroad to have them mutilated this would be an offence if FGM is also an offence in the country to which they are travelling.

<P>
<a name="00508w17.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has an excellent record of tuberculosis (TB) control and we are determined this should remain the case.
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para4">The incidence of TB is monitored by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). Official notifications of TB gradually fell to an all time low of 5,086 in England and Wales in 1987 from about 50,000 cases a year in the 1950s and 9,000 cases at the beginning of the 1980s. Since the early 1990s, there have been overall small year on year increases in total notified cases which are continuing. Provisional notifications for 1998 were just over 6,000. While some of this increase may be due to better ascertainment of cases, it has occurred against the backdrop of a worldwide resurgence of this disease that will, inevitably, continue to have some impact on TB in the UK through travel and immigration.
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para5">The results of the latest in a series of five-yearly detailed surveys of TB in England and Wales undertaken by the PHLS on behalf of the Department are reported in the Communicable Disease Report Vol. 9, No. 51 (17 December 1999), copies of which are available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many cases of <i>(a)</i> human tuberculosis (<i>mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>), and <i>(b)</i> bovine tuberculosis (<i>mycobacterium bovis</i>), were confirmed in humans in (i) 1997, (ii) 1998 and (iii) 1999; and if he will make a statement.  [120771]

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 2000]:</i> A total of 5,859 cases of tuberculosis were notified in England and Wales in 1997, 6,087 in 1998 and 6,144 in 1999. 3,232 cases were confirmed by culture in 1997 and 3,506 in 1998. Final totals for culture confirmed cases for 1999 are not yet available.

<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para7">There is no evidence at present that the increase in bovine tuberculosis in cattle has led to an increase in bovine tuberculosis in the local human population.

<a name="00508w17.html_para8">The number of isolates of <i>M. bovis</i> from human cases of bovine tuberculosis in England and Wales has varied from 22 to 37 per year between 1993 and 1998 with no trend to increase or decrease. The numbers of human cases of <i>M. bovis</i> arising in those regions of England and Wales with the greatest increase in bovine tuberculosis in cattle (South West, Wales and West Midlands) have remained low and have also varied from year to year with no increasing or decreasing trend.
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para9">In response to the Krebs Committee report on tuberculosis in cattle and badgers, the Department undertook to continue to monitor the public health impact of <i>M. bovis</i> infection carefully. Measures have been taken to enhance surveillance, particularly in those areas most affected by infection in cattle, and to look at geographical and occupational variations in incidence. Department of Health and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials hold regular meetings to keep matters under review with special regard to the potential for <i>M. bovis</i> to infect humans through the United Kingdom food chain and other zoonotic routes.

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2000]:</i> Information gathered by the National Health Service Executive's Regional Offices during 1999 reported a total of 105 payments to degree level students (less than 1 per cent. of the student population) from the NHS Hardship Fund. This year's review of student support arrangements will include examination of the provision made for those unfortunate enough to suffer hardship during their training and will encompass both degree and diploma students.
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para12">We are aware of the support among student nurses regarding the proposal to award them employee status. Indeed, this issue was discussed at a recent meeting with the Head of UNISON Health Group. However, the move away from students' status as employees accompanied improvements in nurse education, which moved training from the health service to higher education, and gave students supernumerary status thereby strengthening their educational experience. These changes were, and still are, supported by the Royal College of Nursing.
<P>

<a name="00508w17.html_para13">We want to ensure that as many nurses as possible complete their training and go on to work in the NHS, and we recognise the need, therefore, to provide student nurses with the support they need throughout their course. That is why the NHS Bursary Scheme continues to provide more generous support than that available to other students in higher education, and why bursary rates are being increased again by the rate of inflation from September--the third successive annual increase.

 <i>[holding answer 5 May 2000]:</i> The Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) make recommendations on pay for community midwives employed on national terms and conditions.

 The majority of deaths recorded in association with antidepressants are as a result of suicide. We take the issue of suicide very seriously. The development of strategies to reduce suicide and improve the mental well-being of the general population are a major part of our programme outlined in the White Paper--"Saving Lives: our Healthier Nation"--and in the National Service Framework for mental health.
<P>

<a name="00508w18.html_para13">Advice is given to health professionals in British National Formulary which advises that patients treated for depression should be assessed frequently for suicidal tendencies and that limited quantities of antidepressant drugs should be prescribed at any one time to reduce the risk of overdosage. The Summaries of Product Characteristics for antidepressants warn that patients at risk of suicide should be monitored closely. As with all medicines, the safety of antidepressants is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines.

<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 327W</I><P>
which cost &#163;4.2 million and was launched on 28 February, and included television advertising. The campaign will run for three years. The current campaign follows on from the success of last year's recruitment campaign. Over 45,000 people have inquired about a career in the National Health Service, or returning to the NHS, as a result of it.
<P>

<a name="00508w18.html_para14">Recruitment campaigns including local campaigns, are not a one-off exercise and we expect them to become a regular feature of what the NHS does. We will continue to review the success of television advertising and other ongoing activity to recruit and retain staff.
<P>

<a name="00508w18.html_para15">The original television advertisement stated "The average full-time qualified nurse earns over &#163;20,000 per annum". This figure was drawn from the Department of Health annual earnings surveys, which show that from April 1999 gross average annual earnings for qualified nurses working full-time in the NHS were around &#163;20,700.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2000 : Column: 328W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00508w18.html_para16">This figure includes allowances paid for working unsocial hours, but excludes earnings from overtime, earnings for the more senior clinical H and I grades, and nurses in management posts. The average basic salary for all full-time qualified nursing staff, after implementation of the April 2000 pay award is &#163;19,500. Unsocial hours payments bring average earnings for full-time qualified nurses to over &#163;20,000.
<P>

<a name="00508w18.html_para17">Fewer than 20 people have made representations about the advertising campaign. We also received representations from the ITC about the television advertisement. Departmental officials met with the ITC. The ITC accepted our statement was factually correct. To reflect the increase in nurses' pay arising from the 2000-01 pay settlement the wording was changed. This wording was agreed with the ITC. The agreed working was: "From April (2000) average annual earnings for full-time qualified nurses are over &#163;21,000, including allowances".
