<P>
<a name="00627w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We have discussed, and continue to discuss, a range of aspects of possible proposals for a US National Missile Defence system with the United States. The US has not asked for UK assistance in the deployment of the proposed system, nor would we expect them to do so until after a US decision on whether to proceed with its deployment. In discussions with the US Administration we have made it clear that the UK would consider any such request carefully, taking into account a wide range of factors, including the implications for UK defence.

 We are not aware of any research carried out or being undertaken by NATO into ballistic missile defences. The Ministry of Defence has, however, contributed to NATO studies on the subject, including preparations for studies into the feasibility of theatre ballistic missile defence. We expect these studies to start next year.

<a name="00627w01.html_para1"><i>Letter from John Chisholm to Mr. Matthew Taylor, dated 27 June 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your parliamentary question about nerve agents and their toxicity to humans since the laboratories at Porton Down are part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>GB (sarin) and GF (cyclosarin) are organophosphorus nerve agents developed during World War II in Germany. Both agents are highly toxic chemicals. GB is a highly volatile liquid and is a particular hazard following inhalation, GF is some 30-35 times less volatile and presents a particular hazard from absorption through skin. In hot climates, however, GF may also present a significant hazard from inhalation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Both GB and GF are potent inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is responsible for the control of the important chemical messenger acetylcholine within the nervous system. When humans are poisoned, the signs and symptoms of acute poisoning progress from a general feeling of malaise, pinpoint pupils (miosis), excessive sweating, salivation, runny nose and breathing difficulties, through nausea, vomiting and muscle tremor, to loss of consciousness, convulsions and death from respiratory failure. The severity of these signs and their rate of progress depends upon the dose and route of exposure to the nerve agents. In general, those agents absorbed through the skin, such as GF, will exhibit a delayed onset of poisoning and those which are inhaled, such as GB, will exhibit a very rapid onset (within 1-2 min) of signs and symptoms of poisoning.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A knowledge of the toxicity of these nerve agents has been built up over the years since the Second World War. Assessments have been prompted by intelligence reports of the chemical arsenals of potential aggressors, for example Iraq. They have been based upon studies in animals and to a limited extent in humans conducted within the UK and the Allied Nations. A number of these studies were carried out at Porton Down between 1948 and 1989. The last trial looked at the effects on the eye of low levels of GB. The trial was conducted to assess the effects from "the maximum dosage of nerve agent vapour to the eyes acceptable for aircrew" under NATO prescribed conditions. Scientists at Porton Down have also undertaken three paper exercises to examine the possible long-term effects of nerve agent exposure using the service medical records of volunteers previously exposed to GB. None of the three studies showed any significant difference between the patterns of days lost through illness, the number of specialist appointments or the number of hospital admissions between the control and exposed groups.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Medical countermeasures to both GB and GF have been developed at CBD Porton Down and the combination of pre-treatment with Nerve Agent Pre-Treatment Set (NAPS) tablets and use of the ComboPen injector, which contains atropine, an oxime (P2S) and an anticonvulsant (Avizafone), provide effective antidotes against poisoning by these agents.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your parliamentary question enquiring about the type of information available on individuals who have participated in the Porton Down service volunteer programme since 1970. I am replying since the laboratories at Porton Down are part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Records of volunteers who took part in studies between 1970 to the present day are held in a series of notebooks. These books contain, as a minimum, a volunteer's name, service number, date of attendance and the brief title of the study in which they participated. The general trend is that the more recent the study, the more comprehensive and detailed the information available. In the past, unless the studies involved exposure to chemical warfare agents such as mustard or nerve agents, in which case, additional information regarding the nature of this exposure might be recorded in specific laboratory notebooks, often the only surviving information on a volunteer's attendance is a simple entry in a summary book. In recent years, our records have become much more comprehensive and include written pre and post study medical examination notes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The records of the service volunteers are part of the corporate record.

<P>
<a name="00627w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Subject to local planning decisions, it is for health authorities to determine, on a case-by- case basis, whether a surgery meets the reasonable expectations of its users and carers. Travelling distances are an important consideration, but we would expect travelling times, the availability and proximity of public transport and other services (such as National Health Service dispensing) to be taken into account.

 The National Health Service Executive has been working with the East Midlands Ambulance Service Trust since March 1999 on the process to approve the business case for the procurement of improved control technology. In order that the approval process can move forward as quickly as possible, the trust is currently working to address the concerns which have been highlighted in their latest business case submission. Approval will be granted only if these concerns are met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 "Good practice in continence services" was issued on 19 April 2000. This guidance suggests targets for primary and community teams, health authorities and National Health Service trusts. It includes appropriate references to the NHS Performance Assessment Framework, which is used to plan and monitor the delivery of services. A National Service Framework for Older People is currently being developed. This will supplement the guidance on continence services by placing it in the wider context of improving NHS services for older people.
<P>

<a name="00627w03.html_para0">The guidance suggests that action to promote continence awareness should be undertaken locally and where appropriate, in consultation with relevant national organisations.

 There are legal controls on the sale of medicines direct to consumers in order to protect public health and these apply whether the medicine is sold face to face or through the internet. The Medicines Control Agency has a special Internet Unit which investigates all alleged breaches of medicines legislation and has successfully taken action against a number of websites where the law has been broken.

 National Health Service expenditure on community nursing for people aged 65 and over was &#163;836 million in 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available. Local council expenditure on nursing home care amounted to &#163;669 million in 1998-99. Extending free nursing care to everyone in nursing homes assessed as needing it would cost an additional sum. The amount would depend on defining the nursing element of nursing home care.

 We have already made good progress towards improving access to dental services. Initiatives include Investing in Dentistry, in which &#163;10 million in grants have been approved in return for promises of nearly 900,000 new National Health Service registrations. Personal dental services explore new ways of providing dentistry for people who cannot easily or conveniently use existing services. A third wave of 14 pilots will be operational by the end of the year, bringing the total number of pilots to more than 50. Dental access centres are one form of PDS pilot. Access centres provide a full range of dental services, at convenient times and in convenient places, to people who cannot at present easily access NHS dentistry. There will be 33 pilots operating from more than 50 access centres by April 2001.

<a name="00627w03.html_para4">We have accepted the recommendations of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body for a commitment scheme to reward loyalty to the NHS. The scheme will cost &#163;17 million per annum in England, and is currently being negotiated with the profession.

 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> UK policy on sanctions against Iraq is governed by the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), not by our assessment of the threat. Richard Butler, the former Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) has submitted no evidence to the UK Government on the subject of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. During his time with UNSCOM, he reported to the United Nations Security Council that numerous serious gaps remained in Iraq's declarations on its chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missile programmes. We share his concern over this, hence the importance we attach to re-establishing weapons inspection regime in Iraq under UNSCR 1284.

 None of the FCO's telephone lines used by the general public is responded to by interactive voice systems. Where it is sensible and efficient to use them there is an increasing use of telephone lines which are answered by voice processing systems, but these respond to touch-tone telephones rather than the human voice. These systems are deployed overseas only where the in-country telephone infrastructure is good and where it is common practice for such systems to be deployed.

 <i>[holding answer 21 June 2000]:</i> Compulsory purchase of property must normally be authorised by compulsory purchase order.
<P>

<a name="00627w05.html_para4">A compulsory purchase order made by a non- ministerial acquiring authority, such as a local authority, must be submitted for decision to the relevant "confirming authority". This is normally the Secretary of State or Minister responsible to Parliament for the legislation and policies which apply in the particular circumstances. An order is made and confirmed under procedures set out in, and regulations prescribed for the purposes of, the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. There are also rules for public local inquiries held for the purposes of that Act.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2000 : Column: 449W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00627w05.html_para5">An acquiring authority may have resolved to make a compulsory purchase order but, before submitting it formally, they may decide that they do not wish to proceed. In these circumstances, no formal compulsory purchase procedures will have been initiated and the confirming authority will have no function to discharge. Once the acquiring authority have formally submitted the order, they have no formal power to withdraw or rescind it but, in practice, it is possible to overcome this potential difficulty. If an authority have submitted a compulsory purchase formally and then decide that they do not wish to proceed with it, for example because they will no longer need to rely on compulsory powers, the normal practice in my Department is to give a short formal decision declining to confirm the order. This serves both to formally discharge the Secretary of State's statutory function and to remove the imminent "threat" of compulsory purchase of property.
<P>

<a name="00627w05.html_para6">If an order is confirmed, the acquiring authority must make the order operative by serving and publishing notice of the confirmation before they may exercise the compulsory powers authorised by the confirmed order. Once the order is operative, unless there is a successful challenge in the High Court, the acquiring authority have three years in which to exercise the compulsory powers by serving a notice to treat, which period may be extended by agreement, or by completing an alternative procedure vesting title to the property in themselves. Hence, one way of rescinding an order at this stage would be to allow the period to lapse, so that the authority would no longer be authorised to exercise compulsory powers. This may happen where, for example, an order was confirmed subject to an undertaking given by the acquiring authority that they would not implement the order if the owner carried out certain repairs by a certain date. Compensation is payable where a notice to treat lapses.
<P>

<a name="00627w05.html_para7">An acquiring authority may withdraw a notice to treat within six weeks of receiving a detailed notice of an owner's claim for compensation given in response to a notice to treat. If a dispute over compensation is referred to the Lands Tribunal, the acquiring authority may still withdraw their notice to treat within six weeks of the Tribunal's final determination. This may happen where, for example, the amount awarded by the Tribunal is higher than the authority are prepared to pay. In either case, the claimant must be reimbursed certain losses and expenses.

[127575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Using the latest data from the English House Condition Survey, it is estimated that about 8 per cent. of dwellings had an energy efficiency rating under the Standard Assessment Procedure of below 20. The size of the total English housing stock was some 19.6 million dwellings.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para0">The energy efficiency of pensioner and single-parent households are being improved through a range of programmes as described.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para1">The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) has been radically overhauled as of 1 June 2000. The scheme now provides grants for packages of heating and insulation improvement measures, including the provision of high efficiency central heating systems for low income households aged 60 years or more. The grant maximum has been increased from &#163;315 to between &#163;700 and &#163;2,000 depending on the composition of each household and the condition of the dwelling. The scheme is focused on the private sector where nearly 70 per cent. of the fuel poor in England are found. In the case of pensioners and single parents, eligibility is linked to the receipt of an income-related benefit or one of the main disability benefits. Of the 460,000 households that are expected to be helped during the first two years of HEES, some 280,000 are likely to be aged 60 years or more.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para2">Government-funded programmes operated by the Energy Saving Trust also improve the energy efficiency both fuel poor households and others.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para3">The Government have also substantially increased the resources available to local authorities over the lifetime of this Parliament, reversing the reductions planned by the previous Government. The extra resources in the first three years, 1997-98 to 1999-2000, were allocated through the Capital Receipts Initiative (CRI). Information collected to monitor the impact of the CRI found that around a quarter to a third of the work on local authorities' own stock financed from this initiative lead either directly or indirectly to improvements in energy efficiency. If this were replicated across all local authority housing capital expenditure on its own stock this would equate to around &#163;400-500 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para4">The energy efficiency of low-income households is also likely to be improved through some of the regeneration schemes funded by DETR. These cover a wide range of activities depending on local need, and it is not possible to quantify the precise expenditure on energy efficiency improvements.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para5">To support the installation of energy efficiency measures, the Government also reduced the level of VAT from 1 July 1998 on work carried out on low-income households through eligible schemes such as HEES. The revenue cost of the reduction was &#163;8.5 million a year. 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2000 : Column: 451W</I><P>
This year's Budget extended the reduced rate at a total cost of &#163;35 million a year. By 2002, the total cost is estimated at &#163;85 million.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para6">The Government are also introducing provisions to enable lessors to claim capital allowances on their investment in boilers, radiators and controls installed in residential properties under the Affordable Warmth Programme. The Programme will operate from 2000 to 2007, with the aim of helping up to one million low-income households benefit from improved energy efficiency. Estimate that Government assistance from this measure up to April 2002 will be approximately &#163;10 million.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para7">In addition to Government energy efficiency programmes, since 1994 public electricity suppliers have, under the Energy Efficiency Standards of Performance, been required to encourage and assist customers with energy efficiency measures. The new Director General of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets has, from this year extended these to also include public gas suppliers and the overall size of the programme has been doubled to &#163;50 million a year. Around two thirds of this help has gone to pensioner and low-income families.

<P>

 The Scientific Steering Committee for the Farm-scale Evaluations has advised that 20 to 25 fields should be sought for the autumn sowing of the farm-scale evaluations of herbicide tolerant oil seed rape this year.
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para10">The original design for the evaluations was that for each GM crop 20 to 25 fields would be sought each year for three years. When it became apparent last February that there may be a shortfall in the number of farms for the spring sowings this year, the Steering Committee advised:
<P>

<a name="00627w06.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that (the industry body) SCIMAC would need to provide sufficient farms for the research consortium to select a minimum of around 12-15 farms, representing a range of intensities and geographical locations. This would also include some redundancy for operational problems. This would allow the number of farms to be increased slightly in subsequent years, and also allow any minor imbalances in the range of farms selected for year one to be addressed.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00627w06.html_para12">I expect that, as a result, the number of farms for the sowings next spring and in 2002 will be increased to ensure that the original aims and objectives of the evaluations are met.

<P>
<a name="00627w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 I take the question to refer to take-off and landing slots, and not to traffic rights, which are negotiated separately. Slot allocation at congested airports is governed by European Regulation EC95/93.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 None. The allocation of landing rights, or slots, at airports, is governed by EC Regulation 95/93 which does not explicitly authorise the buying and selling of slots. The Government do not therefore have information on which to base an estimate of the possible value of slots. The income raised would also depend on a number of variables including the number of slots auctioned, their location and how desirable they were to a particular airline.

In future, representations received after due dates will normally be disregarded. We shall be carefully monitoring the impact of the changes and will review their effectiveness after about a year to help us decide whether any further action is needed.

 The Government have no locus in the contracts entered into by the Public Electricity Suppliers (PES) to secure the generating capacity from renewable sources of electricity required by the non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO) Orders. These contracts are location specific and any amendment to their location needs to be agreed between the contracting parties. In addition the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) needs to be satisfied that the amendment does not cause the contract to cease to be a qualifying arrangement. If the contract ceased to be a qualifying arrangement the PES would not be eligible to receive fossil fuel levy for the electricity generated. I have asked the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency Ltd. and Ofgem to re-examine the scope for amendments which would allow projects that have been frustrated by circumstances outside the control of the generator to go forward to construction and generation. Their re-examination has not yet reached a conclusion.

 The term "new gas trading arrangements" covers a number of exercises, led by the Director General of Gas Supply and his office Ofgem, aimed at securing effective competition in gas supply and the economic and efficient operation of Transco's pipeline system. These include auction arrangements for entry capacity into the national transmission system and an on-the-day commodity market for balancing purposes, both introduced with effect from October 1999. Work is in hand on further refinements to the capacity and energy balancing regimes, including reviews of the exit capacity regime and of the possibility of introducing a linepack regime. Further background is available on the Ofgem website www.ofgem.gov.uk.

 The current exclusions from patentability for biological materials as set out in Article 27.3(b) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement allow all WTO members sufficient flexibility to implement patent and other intellectual property regimes appropriate to their individual circumstances, within internationally agreed limits. Patents are afforded only to new technical inventions. Valid rights cannot be obtained for naturally occurring plants or animals or information concerning their genetic composition. Similarly, traditional or indigenous knowledge concerning the existence, use or properties of plants and animals is already not patentable. Given this flexibility and these limitations, we do not consider the requirements of Section 27.3(b) to be incompatible with WTO member states needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w09.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Patents are available only for inventions for new technical solutions. Under the Patents Act 1977 and EC Directive (98/44/EC) on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, plant and animal varieties, or the breeding of plants and animals by traditional methods, cannot be the subject of patent rights. However, inventions concerning plants and animals may be patentable if the technical feasibility of the invention is not confined to a particular plant or animal variety. To be patentable, such an invention would have to satisfy the general criteria for patentability that the invention is new and would not be obvious to someone in the technical field.

 The increased level of imports of textiles and clothing has presented a significant challenge for domestic producers, which has been met in a variety of ways.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his policy towards current EU discussions on <i>(a)</i> rights to family reunification and <i>(b)</i> temporary protection of displaced people.  [127195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Government have decided not to opt into the European Commission's proposal for a Directive on the right to family reunification. Our decision was based on concern that opting into the proposal would remove the United Kingdom's ability to formulate and adjust policies in relation to family reunification as a matter of domestic law.
<P>

<a name="00627w10.html_para14">However, in remaining outside this proposal, it is not the Government's intention that the United Kingdom should be seriously out of line with our European partners in this important area of immigration policy. For that reason we shall continue to participate fully in discussion of the text.
<P>

<a name="00627w10.html_para15">As to the Commission's recent proposals on temporary protection for displaced persons, negotiations over this text have not yet begun. The Government will participate actively in those discussions.

 The Government's policy on European Community draft instruments is developed on the merits of each proposal.
<P>

<a name="00627w10.html_para16">If the question is referring to the recent agreement of the European Community Directive on racial discrimination--which includes a provision requiring the respondent, once a prima facie case of discrimination has been made by the complainant and accepted by the court, to demonstrate that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment--the Government welcome the agreement of this Directive.
<P>

<a name="00627w10.html_para17">This applies only to civil cases and does not represent a major change in terms of United Kingdom legal practice. Under current United Kingdom law, United Kingdom tribunals can and do, if faced with facts which raise a presumption of discrimination, and where no reasonable explanation is offered, draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.

There are four executive agencies in my Department. The UK Passport Agency uses an IVR system for inquiries from the public. About 40 per cent. of calls are effectively dealt with by playing recorded information.

 We think it right to recognise the substantial and growing overlap in the work that both services perform as we pursue our drive to reduce re- offending through proven and well-targeted programmes and re-settlement planning as set out in the correctional policy framework which we published last year.

<a name="00627w11.html_para0">We have established a new strategy board for correctional services, chaired by myself as the Minister with responsibility for prisons and probation, to advise the Home Secretary on giving strategic direction for the prison and probation services.

<P>
<a name="00627w12.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There are strong links between careers education (which is a statutory requirement for pupils aged 14-16) and the revised Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) framework, which we expect schools to implement from autumn this year and includes reference to career planning and management. In April we published a booklet "Careers Education in the New Curriculum"--a copy of which has been placed in the House of Commons Library--which sets out the relationship between these areas, as well as the new Citizenship programme of study. We encourage schools to take advantage of the introduction of PSHE and Citizenship to enhance the provision of careers education. Many schools already teach these areas in an integrated manner.

 The Government have launched a wide-ranging programme to tackle the unacceptably high level of teenage pregnancies in Great Britain. The Department for Education and Employment will shortly publish new sex and relationship education guidance which is an important part of this broader strategy, and will assist schools in educating young people so that

<P><I>27 Jun 2000 : Column: 474W</I><P>
teenage pregnancies are reduced. The guidance will be firmly rooted in the PSHE framework and National Curriculum published in autumn 1999.
<P>

<a name="00627w12.html_para0">This programme includes funding a number of local education authorities through the Standards Fund to reintegrate school age mothers back into the education system and support age-appropriate educational projects aimed at reducing the rate of teenage conception by raising pupils' self esteem, exploring issues of choice and responsibility and peer pressure. We aim to ensure that these initiatives are integrated with individuals schools' Personal, Social and Health Education frameworks and other approaches such as Sure Start and child care pilots for 16 and 17 year olds.

<P>

<a name="00627w13.html_para0">A total of &#163;1.9 billion is being spent in the current financial year on repairs and maintenance, three times the amount spent in 1996-97. This includes the New Deal for Schools, public-private partnerships, and other capital grants to schools and LEA borrowing.

 How the Learning and Skills Council will allocate its funds is subject to a current consultation. The Government have invited partners' views on a system of national rates for the majority of learning programmes, which means that the same programme would attract the same funding wherever it was delivered. The Government recognise the current differences in funding levels, and favours upwards convergence, but we recognise that this can only happen over time, and subject to resources being available. Changes in levels of funding will, of course, be subject to the real-terms funding guarantee we have given to school sixth forms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 I welcome the report by the Engineering Employers' Federation/Commission for Racial Equality. The recommendations stemming from the project provide a realistic opportunity for engineering companies to engage the ethnic minority communities in a more constructive way.
<P>

<a name="00627w13.html_para1">This will require greater commitment and positive action to build more effective links with schools and ethnic minority community centres. I believe a vital factor in encouraging young people from the ethnic minority community to be engineers is to provide role models from their own communities. The case studies which have been published should actively encourage entry into the industry.
<P>

<a name="00627w13.html_para2">My Department strongly supports the outcomes and follow-up initiatives from the project and will continue to work closely with all appropriate parties to ensure that

<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Customs and Excise do not have reliable current estimates of the cost of substantial increases in the VAT registration threshold. A description of the difficulties involved in predicting the effect of large changes in the threshold is contained in "The VAT Shortfall: Report of the Working Group on VAT Receipts and Forecasts", Treasury Occasional Paper No. 9, September 1997. Table A.13 of the Budget 2000 Financial Statement and Budget Report contains an estimate of the Exchequer cost of indexing the VAT registration and deregistration thresholds in line with inflation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Scotland has two road fuel testing units. In 1997 they were operational for a combined total of 446 days and for 432 days in 1998. In the same period they made 277 detections leading to penalties and duty recovered totalling &#163;423,214. In 1997 and 1998 two cases were taken to prosecution.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the net yearly costs in the first year of implementation of the climate change levy to <i>(a)</i> the dairy industry and <i>(b)</i> the agriculture industry in Scotland.  [127697]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00627w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 It is not possible to say what the precise effect of the levy will be on any one particular industry. The impact of the levy package will depend on a number of factors, including: the future energy consumption by firms; the level of employment in those firms; the number of firms that are eligible to receive a discount on the main rates of the levy by signing up to an energy efficiency agreement; what use they make of electricity generated from 'new' renewable sources of energy and in 'good quality' combined head and power plants; and the extent to which they take advantage of the proposed introduction of a system of enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments. However, the agriculture sector stands to benefit from a number of features of the levy package including the proposed special package of support for the horticulture subsector announced in the March 2000 Budget.

<P>
<a name="00627w13.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 On 16 February 2000, the Chancellor announced that individuals who file their self-assessment tax returns over the internet in 2000-01 and pay any tax due electronically will receive a discount of &#163;10. Small businesses that do the same for their PAYE and VAT returns in 2001-02 will receive a discount of &#163;50 for each. And in his Budget speech on 21 March 2000 he said that small businesses that qualify for the PAYE discount and which pay tax credits to employees would receive a further discount of &#163;50. These discounts are being offered to encourage businesses and individuals to embrace internet technology. Legislation has been included in this year's Finance Bill to provide for the payment of these incentives. The detailed conditions will be set out in regulations to be published later this year.

 The new all-employee share plan is a tax and NICs relieving measure designed to encourage more employees to hold shares in the companies for which they work and to reward their long-term commitment. The new plan will eventually cost the Exchequer around &#163;400 million a year.

 Since December 1998, when the consultation process on employee share ownership began, the Inland Revenue has received in the region of 1,000 representations. While these have mostly been from employers and their advisers, many individual employees have also made representations.
<P>

<a name="00627w14.html_para0">The responses have covered all aspects of the existing Inland Revenue approved share schemes and the proposals for the new all-employee share plan and Enterprise Management Incentives.

 My right hon. Friend has no plans to raise this issue in the Joint Ministerial Committee.

 The Government recently announced a twelve-point plan to support the British textile industry, which has, until now, lacked an overall strategy and adequate support. The strategy will help the competitiveness of the industry by addressing issues such as the supply chain, design and research, public procurement and exports. I was delighted that the excellent work of Heriot Watt University's Galashiels Campus has been recognised by its designation as a Centre of Manufacturing Excellence in Textiles
<P>

<a name="00627w16.html_para2">All the measures for the UK textile industry will equally apply in Scotland. I am delighted, however, that the Scottish Executive considers that the importance of the textile industry to the Scottish economy merits further action and is introducing a comprehensive package of additional measures to support the textile industry in Scotland.

In Bangladesh, we have given UNHCR &#163;250,000 for its programme to repatriate Burmese refugees. We understand that over 90 per cent. of these refugees have now returned to Burma, leaving some 22,500 in Bangladesh. In India and China, we understand that the number of registered Burmese refugees is very small (around 1,000 in total), and we have not targeted any assistance on these groups.

 The Public Trust Office failed its Unit Cost and Charter Standard key performance indicators for 1999-2000 (these results are still subject to National Audit Office approval). The Unit Cost target for the 1999-2000 financial year was to generate an efficiency saving of 3 per cent. This target was failed because the Public Trust Office's cost base was increased during the year to take account of a revaluation of its building. This unexpectedly added &#163;500,000 to annual costs. Although the Public Trust Office missed its target of achieving 98 per cent. of Charter Standards, actual performance was 96.6 per cent., a creditable result against a very demanding target.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the performance of the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors.  [126369]<P>

<a name="00627w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 We have a number of concerns about the ability of the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors to meet the casework targets that the Lord Chancellor expects them to achieve, in particular in relation to the quality of adjudication and the turnaround times. However, we acknowledge that some progress has been made in reducing the backlog of outstanding cases since August 1999. We will continue closely to monitor their performance against the targets and timetable agreed by the Lord Chancellor.

 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2000]:</i> In the relevant period, 345 parliamentary questions were tabled to the Lord Chancellor's Department for written answer. Of these, 11 parliamentary questions did not receive a substantive answer for reasons of disproportionate cost and a further six questions received a partial answer where a full answer could have been provided only at disproportionate costs.
