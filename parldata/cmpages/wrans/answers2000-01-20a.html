<P>
<a name="00120w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ashdown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many post offices there were in <i>(a)</i> Somerset and <i>(b)</i> the Yeovil constituency in each year from 1980 to 1999; and if he will make a statement.  [104748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I understand from the Post Office that they do not hold historic information on the numbers of post offices in each parliamentary constituency or local administrative area and that such information cannot readily be compiled.
<P>

<a name="00120w01.html_para0">The Post Office advise that in October 1999 the number of post offices in Somerset was 234 and in the Yeovil constituency was 42.

<a name="00120w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are making a substantial contribution to the costs of automating the entire post office counters network to strengthen the viability of the network as a whole. Automation will enable Post Office Counters Ltd. to offer substantial enhancements to the services it is able to offer to clients and customers which in turn will increase the attractiveness of post offices compared with other service delivery channels. In addition, the Performance and Innovation Unit in the Cabinet Office is carrying out an urgent study on the post office network.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will prevent recent proposed changes in the ownership of newspapers circulating in Wales.  [105423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I understand that the question refers to the proposal by Trinity Mirror plc ("Trinity Mirror") to acquire the newspapers and related assets of News Communications & Media plc. Under section 58 of the Fair Trading Act 1973, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's prior written consent is required before such an acquisition is made. I announced on 21 December that I was referring Trinity Mirror's application for consent to the Competition Commission. The reference, which was mandatory under the terms of the Act, does not prejudge the issues involved. The Competition Commission will investigate and report their findings to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by 13 March 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 This Department has responsibility only for the lead crystal, container, scientific/technical and automotive glassware sectors. No such assessment of the medium-term demand for manufactured glass in Britain has been undertaken. However, independent reports suggest that the UK glassware market is being increasingly influenced by fashion and design as part of the general trend towards casual dining which has increased the demand for glassware products.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the economic impact of the moratorium on gas-fired power stations, including the direct and indirect impact on employment.  [105160]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I am monitoring carefully the economic impact of the Government's policy of stricter consents for gas-fired power stations. In particular, I have received representations about the impact of the policy on proposals for industrial regeneration in local economies and the impact on employment in the oil and gas, power generation equipment and other sectors. However, the policy is necessary, as a temporary measure, to protect security and diversity of supply while the electricity market is reformed. It will be relaxed as soon as the reform programme has been undertaken and the distortions in the market have been removed.

 There have not been any discussions between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions specifically about a reduction in business rates in the North-West. However, my Department has been involved in discussions about the arrangements for transitional relief and is also involved in the Government review of the system of revaluation of non-domestic rates in England.

<P>

 DTI Ministers have no plans to investigate this particular market sector. In so far as there are any possible competition issues, it would be for the Director General of Fair Trading to investigate.
<P>

<a name="00120w02.html_para0">The Director General last looked at the petrol market in 1998. He found that independent petrol retailers had suffered as a result of strong competition between the oil companies and the supermarkets, but overall the market was competitive and consumers were benefiting.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government have taken steps to put back on track the Horizon project to automate the post office network thereby establishing a platform for provision of on-line agency banking services at all post offices. However the extension of the provision of agency banking services at post offices is primarily a matter for commercial negotiation between the clearing banks and Post Office Counters Ltd.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Figures for 1999 as a whole are not yet available, but in the first three quarters of 1999 it is estimated that of the 24 million tonnes of coal delivered from collieries and opencast sites in Great Britain to UK power stations, about 15 million tonnes came from England, four million tonnes came from Scotland and less than one million tonnes from Wales with a further four million tonnes from small producers that cannot be readily allocated geographically.

<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to publish the revised guidance to support Part B (Fire Safety) of the Building Regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [106529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I have today published the 2000 edition of the Approved Document to Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 1991. The Building Regulations (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999, which amended Part B, were laid before Parliament on 21 December 1999. The 2000 edition of the Approved Document offers ways of meeting these revised 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 531W</I><P>
requirements of the Building Regulations. The amendment Regulations and the 2000 edition of the Approved Document will both come into force on 1 July 2000.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para3">There are a number of changes in this guidance, which was last published in 1992. Many of them have been to address areas where the guidance has become outdated, or where the guidance has needed clarification. In addition the guidance now contains information specifically relating to schools and gives guidance on sandwich panel construction.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para4">Some new issues have also been introduced in the 2000 edition of the Approved Document. The revised Approved Document includes guidance on fire alarm and fire detection systems within all relevant buildings and not just dwellings, as was the case in the 1992 edition of the Approved Document. The revised Approved Document now suggests that within a dwelling all habitable rooms within storeys not more than 4.5 metres above ground level should be provided with an emergency egress window. Guidance has also been added to deal with means of escape from storeys within buildings other than dwellings which are also used for the consumption of food and/or drink by customers. This follows two fatal fires in department stores where it has been shown that people in a cafe are not so quick to respond to a fire alarm compared to the other general shoppers.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para5">As announced on 14 December 1999 by my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, the revised Approved Document now includes a provision for compartmentation or sprinkler protection in single storey retail buildings with a floor area exceeding 2000m <sup>2</sup> .
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para6">In some areas where it has become evident in the light of experience that the guidance in the 1992 edition of the Approved Document was too onerous, the guidance has been relaxed. An example of this is the provision for firefighting shafts (a protected stair core incorporating a stair, lobby, dry riser and in the case of taller buildings a lift for use by the fire brigade). The guidance on these, which was introduced in the 1992 edition of the Approved Document, was found to be unreasonably onerous in certain low rise (between 7.5 metres and 18 metres higher) buildings which have a floor area of 600m <sup>2</sup>  or more. The 2000 edition of the Approved Document relaxes the provision for certain buildings of this type and gives advice that recommends their use only in the shop and commercial, industrial and storage purpose groups.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the recommendations in the report of the external audit of the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme have been implemented.  [106501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence response to the recommendations in the report of the audit of the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) has now been completed. A very small number of issues remain outstanding but the response explains why this is so and what action is being taken.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 532W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para7">The staff of the GVMAP have welcomed this opportunity to review their working practices and take action where necessary. The implementation of the audit recommendations will provide an improved service for Gulf veterans.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para8">I am placing a copy of the response to the audit report in the Library of the House and it is also being published on the Ministry of Defence Gulf Veterans' Illnesses website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement regarding the implementation of the immunisation programme against biological warfare agents for United Kingdom forces during the Gulf conflict 1990-91.  [106493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government's "New Beginning" policy statement set out the way forward for addressing the health concerns of Gulf veterans and included a commitment to establish a Fact Finding Team to look into the implementation of the anti-biological warfare immunisation programme during the Gulf conflict. Their work has now been completed and I am today publishing a paper entitled "Implementation of the immunisation programme against biological warfare agents for UK forces during the Gulf conflict 1990-91". Copies of the report have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para9">The publication of this paper reaffirms the Government's commitment to ensuring that Gulf veterans should have access to whatever information the Ministry of Defence possesses which might be relevant to their illnesses.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para10">The deficiencies in the implementation of the 1990-91 anti-biological warfare immunisation programme have been, and continue to be, addressed in improvements to our current arrangements. When we again deployed to the Gulf in 1998 our immunisation programme was unclassified, all troops were fully briefed using standard material, the nature of the threat and the vaccine were described in detail and all records were updated, showing that the lessons of 1990-91 have been learned.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para11">The report found that the voluntary nature of the immunisation programme operated as intended in the majority of units and locations. It confirms that no unusual or previously undisclosed immunisations were given during the Gulf conflict and also explains the codewords which were sometimes used for the vaccines.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para12">Uptake of the anti-biological warfare immunisations in the early stages of the programme was high. Over 75 per cent. of all personnel deployed to the Gulf region are likely to have had anthrax and pertussis immunisations, and in many units this approached 100 per cent. Uptake of the second anthrax and pertussis immunisations and the first plague was less and varied between and within formations. Uptake of the third anthrax and the second plague immunisation was rare.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the suggested exposure of United Kingdom troops to chemical warfare agents in Al Jubayl on 19 January 1991.  [106495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The 1997 "A New Beginning" policy statement set out a number of commitments to help address the health concerns of Gulf Veterans. One of these commitments was to review specific incidents of 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 533W</I><P>
suggested biological or chemical warfare exposures. As part of this commitment I am today publishing a paper entitled "A Review of the Suggested Exposure of UK Forces to Chemical Warfare Agents in Al Jubayl on 19 January 1991". A copy will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para13">As a result of our review of the available information we assess that UK troops were not subject to attack or exposed to chemical warfare agents at Al Jubayl on 19 January 1991. Although it is not possible to give a single comprehensive explanation for all the events that took place on the morning of 19 January we conclude from the available information that the indications of the presence of Chemical Warfare agents were false alarms.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. John Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the relationship between organophosphate pesticides and the illnesses suffered by some veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict following recent reports from the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment and the Institute of Occupational Medicine.  [106496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The COT report, published in November, concluded that neuropsychological abnormalities can occur as a long term complication following acute organophosphate (OP) poisoning, particularly if the poisoning is severe. Persistent peripheral neuropathy (disorders of the peripheral nerves) may occur, but not generally at a level which would give rise to symptoms. The body of evidence gives little support to the hypothesis that low-level exposure to OPs can cause chronic disease of the nervous system. However, the report notes that there remains a question over whether a small proportion of subjects may be at increased risk of clinically significant disease following low level exposure and recommends further research in this area.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para14">The Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) report on the relationship between OP sheep dips and illness in exposed sheep farmers and dippers found the critical exposure factor to be contact with concentrate dip: much higher rates of symptoms, predominantly of a sensory nature, were reported among those who had been principal concentrate handlers. There is a very limited evidence that long term low-level exposure to organophosphates leads to long term neurotoxic effects.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para15">The conclusions from these reports are in line with the findings of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council's (DSAC) Working Party report, the publication of which I announced on 20 October 1999 and which reviewed existing literature on the long term neurotoxicity of anticholinesterases. It concluded that high doses of organophosphates may have long term effects on the peripheral nervous system, but that there is limited evidence about long term toxic effects following low doses.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para16">During the Gulf conflict very few UK service personnel would have handled concentrated OPs. Those that did would have been Environmental Health Officers or technicians, or individual regimental hygiene duties personnel who were appropriately trained in procedures and the use of equipment. There was no evidence of acute organophosphate poisoning or of subsequent unusual ill health arising in this small group.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 534W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para17">Neither the IOM nor the COT report provides evidence which would cause us to reassess our view of the possible role of OPs in relation to Gulf Veterans' illnesses. The case for ill-health effects resulting from long term low level exposure to OPs remains unproven and there is currently no reason to believe that Gulf veterans who might have been in casual contact with dilute pesticide (e.g. from the treatment of tents and equipment) or with the malathion dust used to de-louse Iraqi prisoners of war, are at increased risk of long term ill-health.
<P>

<a name="00120w04.html_para18">Although it remains the case that there is limited evidence of a link between low level exposure to OPs and adverse health effects, MOD will continue to monitor the debate about the safety of OPs. We will continue to review scientific evidence in the light of potential exposures which may have occurred in the Gulf and follow future research, including that recommended by the COT report, very closely.

The success of the New Deal so far will be built on by extending further help with basic skills and personal presentation to young people who will benefit, particularly the most disadvantaged. The 60 per cent. cut in long-term youth unemployment since May 1997 is good news for our young people and for the prosperity of the country.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what measures she is taking to counter the increase in numbers of people registered as drug misusers in Gloucestershire.  [105551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The Government's strategy for tackling drug misuse was set out in the White Paper "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain" in 1998. The Government backed this ten-year strategy by allocating an extra &#163;217 million for anti-drugs work as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review. This includes an additional &#163;70.5 million for health and local authorities over the next three years for drug treatment services and &#163;18 million to support drug prevention activities, particularly among young people. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has also announced a further &#163;20 million for the expansion of Arrest Referral Schemes to help drug-misusing offenders obtain treatment. The Gloucestershire Drug Action Team is responsible for co-ordinating local implementation of the strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w07.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Law Officers' Departments have different policies on smoking in offices, reflecting the different buildings and the results of locally based decisions. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has a general no smoking policy. Staff may not smoke in their own rooms. The provision of a separate smoking room is a matter for managers to decide locally, taking into account the interest of staff. CPS HQ is in two buildings. In the London office, the number of smoking rooms has been reduced to one and in the York office, there is no separate smoking room. Information about the provision of separate smoking rooms in the CPS's 42 Areas is not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="00120w07.html_para1">The Counselling and Support Service of the CPS advertises the now annual National No Smoking Day (in their in-house publication "Inform") and offer literature to assist anyone wishing to give up smoking.
<P>

<a name="00120w07.html_para2">The Treasury Solicitor's Department has a policy of restricting and confining smoking to clearly defined areas. 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 544W</I><P>
The Department's Health and Safety Advisory Committee is currently reviewing the policy and will in due course be making recommendations.
<P>

<a name="00120w07.html_para3">The Serious Fraud Office accommodation is non-smoking although a small smoking room is provided. Free health screening checks have recently been made available to all staff and these will make staff more aware of the dangers of smoking.
<P>

<a name="00120w07.html_para4">In the Law Officers' Legal Secretariat smoking is not permitted in any of the meeting rooms or the shared offices. Smoking is restricted to a smoking room. Staff are encouraged and supported in giving up smoking.

<P>
<a name="00120w08.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Solicitors acting for a number of individuals applied for Law Officer consent to prosecute Senator Pinochet for offences of torture and hostage taking. The papers included reference to William Beausire. On 11 February 1999, the then Attorney- General considered the application and took advice from Treasury Counsel. The solicitors were advised that consent to prosecute was declined. The basis of that decision is that the relevant legislation is not retrospective and the material supplied by the solicitors in support of the application provided insufficient admissible evidence to justify a prosecution.

<a name="00120w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There is strong evidence that fathers play a critical role in bringing up children. Boys who have no contact with their fathers are more likely to underachieve at school. Supporting fathers is an important part of the Government's family policy. We have also provided fathers with the right to parental leave, and those in receipt of Working Families Tax Credit and some other benefits will receive income support while taking the leave to make it a viable prospect for all parents. Under the Family Support Grants programme, a number of voluntary organisations have been funded to develop work specifically with fathers.

 Since 1997, smoking has not been allowed in the main central London Home Office buildings, except in designated smoking rooms. National "No Smoking" campaigns are regularly promoted by poster displays, leaflets and other publicity material. "Stop Smoking" courses and displays (organised in conjunction with QUIT) have been held to help staff who wish to give up smoking. A similar programme of events will be run this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many crimes were committed <i>(a)</i> in the last 12 months and <i>(b)</i> in the last three years in the UK that were drug-related.  [105321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Statistical data are collected on drug offences only, not on offences which may have been committed due to drug taking. A report published in 1998 on research carried out on behalf of the Home Office by the University of Cambridge sheds light on the links between drugs and crime. Further data are currently being analysed as part of the NEW-ADAM programme for interviewing and drug testing arrestees. It is hoped to publish the next set of full results in the first half of this year.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para0">The research undertaken so far on drug testing of arrestees, based in five locations, indicates that over 60 per cent. of arrestees had recently taken at least one illegal drug prior to arrest. Cannabis was found most often (46 per cent. of cases); heroin/opiates (18 per cent.) and 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 552W</I><P>
cocaine/crack (10 per cent.) featured quite prominently. These findings confirm the supposition that offenders tend to be heavy consumers of drugs.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para1">Nearly half the arrestees who reported taking drugs within the last year said that their drug misuse was connected with their offending. Among various factors, they emphasised the need for the money to buy drugs. The illegal income of arrestees who said that they had taken heroin and/or crack during the last three days was particularly high--within a range of &#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000 annually. This compared with &#163;4,000 for other arrestees. Illegal income mainly resulted from acquisitive crimes against property. An estimated 32 per cent. of all illegal income was spent on purchasing heroin and/or crack cocaine.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para2">While this study considerably advances knowledge of drugs-crime links, it will always be difficult to calculate a single percentage figure reflecting precisely what proportion of all crimes is drug-related.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para3">Figures on drug offences in 1997 were published in April 1999 in Home Office Statistical Bulletin No. 8/99 "Drug seizure and offender statistics, United Kingdom, 1997". Figures for 1998 will be published in February 2000, copies of which will be placed in the Library.

 In 1997, the last year for which published figures are available, the number and average weights of selected drugs seized by police and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise were as given in the table. It is not meaningful to calculate the average weight of all drug seizures. Further figures on drug seizures in 1997 were published in April 1999 in Home Office Statistical Bulletin No 8-99 "Drug seizure and offender statistics, United Kingdom, 1997". Figures for 1998 will be published in February 2000, copies of which will be placed in the Library.

These prices are based on average purity levels and do not reflect the fluctuations in price which may occur within an area as the result of law enforcement action, other interruption of supply, or even over-supply. The ranges quoted for the above areas are indicative of the most typical prices paid for a one gram wrap of the drug(s). It is not possible to give wholly accurate ranges as a large number of factors come in to play. However, the prices quoted represent a reasonable average price in the areas. Drugs are frequently sold for prices outside these ranges, and prices can be inflated by cutting drugs, and by selling under measures. Prices increase when small amounts such as &#163;10 or &#163;20 deals are sold.<P>

 The Government have announced a target to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years and set up a Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team to develop a strategy for achieving it. The Action Team published a report in September 1999 which set out a comprehensive strategy for achieving the target.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para4">The main measure the Government have taken to date to tackle vehicle crime is to make available &#163;150 million over three years for Closed Circuit Television. Improving car park security (where the 1998 British crime Survey suggests 22 per cent. of vehicle crime takes place) was a priority in Round 1.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner for Police for the Metropolis informs me that at 3.50 pm on 18 October, complaints were received from passengers in Terminal 1 Departures about irritation to their eyes, nose and throat. Emergency services attended and found a CS spray canister in a rubbish bin. It appears that fumes from the canister entered the air conditioning system. Nineteen people were affected by the fumes, 14 of whom were taken to Hillingdon Hospital for treatment but discharged within two hours.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para5">The Commissioner tells me that the canister was manufactured in the United States of America, of a type commonly used there for personal safety, and that it was probably discarded by a passenger prior to being scanned before departure. The canister was taken by the police, for disposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The costs quoted in the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill assumed an average additional cost of &#163;600 per anti-social behaviour order. This took account of offsetting savings.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2000]:</i> The Government provided specific powers to the police and local authorities to tackle anti-social behaviour in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Since 1999, agencies and partnerships have been able to bid for funding to help them tackle crime and disorder including anti-social behaviour under the Government's three year Crime Reduction Programme. An example of one which has done so is the Humberside police which has received &#163;406,000 for a targeted policing project to reduce anti-social behaviour and low level criminal behaviour on five beats in Kingston upon Hull. The South Wales police have also received funding of almost &#163;1 million for several targeted policing projects which aim to reduce crime and disorder by young people and public disorder.
<P>

<a name="00120w09.html_para8">The Social Exclusion Unit has chaired a Policy Action Team on Anti-Social Behaviour (PAT 8) to inform the preparation of a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal. The PAT 8 report is expected to be published in March. The Home Office, in consultation with the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, will be expected to issue guidance on tackling anti-social behaviour in accordance with the report's recommendations.

 The Euro 2000 organisers are satisfied that their ticketing arrangements and controls will provide spectators with a safe and secure environment in the stadia and limit the potential for a significant black market in tickets. Experience suggests that the sale of tickets to individuals is easier to control, and poses less risk than a flourishing black market. Arrangements are in place for ensuring that tickets are not sold to people who are banned from attending football matches in their home country. This includes English hooligans who are subject to a Domestic or International Football Banning Order (or Exclusion or Restriction Order prior to enactment of the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999).

[105744]<P>

<P>
<a name="00120w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Decisions have not yet been taken on the amount and timing of each country's debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The policy announced by the Government on 21 December is to provide complete relief on the remaining debt owed to the UK, after HIPC debt relief has been granted. The specific amount of extra relief that each country will receive in any one year cannot be known until decisions have been taken on their HIPC debt relief. The Government are working with the World bank and the IMF to ensure that countries come forward for HIPC relief as soon as possible; our target is that three quarters of countries receive relief before the end of 2000.

 Countries that could be eligible for bilateral debt relief, if their governments are committed to poverty reduction, are Angola, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Vietnam, Yemen and Zambia.

 My right hon. Friend has made no representations to the Treasury on debt relief. She and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer share the strong conviction that the purpose of debt relief is to allow countries to invest in poverty reduction programmes and achieve the international development targets. They work closely on the Government's debt relief policy, and this partnership enabled us to deliver our ambitious debt relief objectives last year. In particular, they jointly and 



<P>

successfully pressed for the substantial improvement in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative agreed at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in September 1999. The revised HIPC framework not only provides faster, wider and deeper debt relief, it also increases the impact which this relief has on poverty, through the development and implementation of national poverty reduction strategies. A number of joint DFID and HM Treasury papers on debt, produced for the HIPC Review, have already been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We have consistently stressed that debt relief should only be given to countries who would use it to benefit the poor. We therefore welcome the decision at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in September 1999 to tie the debt relief provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to the development of national poverty reduction strategies. In this way, HIPC debt relief provides an opportunity to renew and refocus all development efforts, including resources, on making the greatest possible impact on poverty.
<P>

<a name="00120w11.html_para4">To allow these strategies to be developed, and for their implementation to be monitored, it is essential that greater international efforts are made to improve the availability of good quality information in HIPC countries. In November 1999, the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century was launched. Its aims are to provide statistical assistance to HIPC countries in producing and monitoring their poverty reduction strategies and to develop sustainable statistical capacity in the longer term, to inform and support pro-poor policy making and programme design. Our Department is devoting additional resources to achieve these aims, both bilaterally and multilaterally, working particularly with the World Bank, the UN and the IMF.
<P>

<a name="00120w11.html_para5">Our Department is also looking at what assistance we can provide to civil society to enable them to participate effectively in the discussions on poverty reduction strategies, and monitor their impact, for example to better understand government budgets.

<a name="00120w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Our Department is monitoring the humanitarian situation in the Maluka Islands in Indonesia, and in particular the plight of those who have been internally displaced by the conflict (estimated at 280,000 by the Government of Indonesia). We have not yet been formally approached for assistance, but will consider any appeals put to us following the UN and Government of Indonesia's forthcoming joint humanitarian needs assessment mission to Maluka.

<P>
<a name="00120w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We published a strategy paper for our collaboration with the European Union in December 1998 with 18 specific objectives for improving the effectiveness of the European Community's development programmes. Several of these objectives have been achieved and we continue to review the strategy regularly. We welcome the commitment of the new European Commission to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of European Community assistance but will continue to press them to establish a coherent overall development policy, to increase the proportion of European Community development assistance directed at low income and least developed countries, and to improve the management of European Community programmes.

<P>
<a name="00120w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We welcome the commitments made by the new European Commission to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the European Community's development programmes. Many of these commitments reflect positions in the strategy paper on working with the European Union published by our Department in December 1998. In particular, the Development Commissioner, Poul Nielson, and the External Relations Commissioner, Chris Patten, both called for a clearer poverty focus and for a considerable improvement in the Commission's management of its programmes. In addition, negotiations on a successor to the Lome Convention governing the EU's relation with 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries due to conclude next month should adopt significant improvements in the development focus of the European Development Fund.
<P>

<a name="00120w12.html_para0">However, as evaluations in recent years have shown, the impact of EC programmes has been poor and major changes are needed to improve this. We are therefore continuing to press the Commission to follow through on their commitments, and notably to adopt an overall

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We welcome the Chancellor's announcement of 11 January of a unilateral UK ban on export credits in respect of "unproductive expenditure" to 63 of the world's poorest countries. This extends the UK's unilateral 2-year ban on export credits for unproductive expenditure to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) announced in September 1997. This is now being extended indefinitely and widened to cover all countries which are eligible to borrow from the World Bank only on highly concessional terms.
<P>

<a name="00120w12.html_para4">Many of these countries are currently not on cover to receive export credits from the UK. We believe that export credit should only be granted to the poorest countries only where they are used for productive purposes which enable countries to benefit from faster economic growth and increased spending on social services. There is, therefore, a positive role for export credits in these countries. ECGD support for projects in these countries will be cleared by our Department to ensure they are not "unproductive".

Emergency funding is only repayable once the position of all members of the pension scheme concerned has been secured and other scheme liabilities met. To date &#163;223,660 has been repaid. We would expect further substantial repayments of emergency funding to be made in the course of the current calendar year.

1. Mid-1998 population estimates of the number of people of pensionable age in Somerset and South Somerset are the latest available.<P>

2. Mid-year population estimates are not compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for parliamentary constituencies. The lowest level at which population estimates are available is the local authority level. 1991 Census information has therefore been used to answer part <i>(c)</i>.<P>

3. The number of people of pensionable age is not necessarily the same as the number of pensioners.<P>

4. 'Pensionable age' represents males aged 65 and over and females aged 60 and over.<P>

5. Population estimates are rounded to the nearest hundred persons throughout. Age groups have been rounded independently and may not sum to the totals shown. <P>

<a name="00120w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics publish a Pensioner Price Index which reflects the spending patterns of pensioners in the lowest three income deciles. The Index shows that over the last 20 years the rate of price inflation for this group of pensioners is significantly below that of other groups and, if used as a basis for uprating, basic Retirement Pension would be &#163;12.30 lower than it is now. Therefore we have no plans to adopt the Pensioner Price Index as part of the annual review of benefit levels.

 We have decided to change the way people are paid benefit, from the current paper based methods to automated credit transfer (ACT). This reflects the fact that customers increasingly choose to be paid this way. The move is expected to generate &#163;640 million savings per year from 2005.

<P>
<a name="00120w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Delivering efficient and modern public services is a key part of the Government's agenda for improving productivity. Greater efficiency is being sought therefore within the public sector to ensure that the most effective results are obtained from available resources. The Ministry's Public Service Agreement (PSA) includes a range of measures for taking this forward, both within the Ministry itself and in other public sector bodies.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 572W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para5">Those measures which will help raise the Ministry's own productivity are as follows:
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para6">(a) <i>Better Quality Services</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para7">The Ministry will regularly and systematically review services and activities over a five year period in line with Government policy as set out in the handbook "Better Quality Services". A review programme has been developed, setting out those services that will be reviewed each year with the intention to review at least 60 per cent. of services by March 2003.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para8">(b) <i>Fraud</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para9">The Ministry will continue to apply controls to detect and prevent fraud and other irregularities under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) farm-based schemes. The Ministry has designated a fraud contact officer to promulgate ministry policy and to give specific advice to managers.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para10">(c) <i>Sickness Absence</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para11">In line with the central initiative to improve attendance, an internal audit of the sickness absence recording and monitoring systems has been completed and targets set for reducing absence.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para12">(d) <i>Electronic Government</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para13">The Ministry will exploit opportunities for electronic communications and will increase the proportion of business undertaken electronically to contribute to the Government's commitment to a target of at least 25 per cent. for electronic dealings with the public by 2002.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para14">(e) <i>Procurement</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para15">The Ministry will combine central responsibility for the management of procurement with devolution of operational procurement where appropriate; develop strategies for delivering best whole life cost solution, optimising operational savings and minimising the administrative costs of procurement; improve information and procedures, and education and training; and undertake benchmarking using maturity profile analysis techniques.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para16">(f) <i>Asset Sales</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para17">The Ministry will dispose of most of its surplus land and buildings by April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para18">(g) <i>CAP Administration</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para19">The Ministry aims to increase the productivity of CAP administration by developing, testing and implementing an integrated IT system for administering CAP schemes by March 2002.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para20">(h) <i>Efficiency</i>
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para21">The Ministry will also pursue efficiency gains, and will continue to develop better measures of efficiency and extend these to cover a wide range of departmental activities and also the activities of its executive agencies.
<P>

<a name="00120w14.html_para22">The Ministry's running costs provision for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 is set out in its PSA. The productivity measures listed above will enable the Ministry to increase the quantity and quality of its outputs delivered by its running costs expenditure over this period.

We expect the present trade arrangements to be extended during a transition period from 2000 to 2008. After that date, new trade arrangements will enter into force. The Sugar Protocol will roll forward unchanged but will be reviewed before the end of the transition period. We would assess the need for support measures at the time of, and within the context of, the Review of the Sugar Protocol. We recognise the importance of the sugar trade to the economies of many ACP States, and our Department has commissioned research work to consider the consequences of possible reforms of the Sugar Protocol. The work is at an early stage, but it clearly indicates that some countries will face adjustment problems. In the time up to the Review it remains vitally important that the ACP continue their own efforts to improve their competitiveness.

<a name="00120w15.html_para5">As envisaged in the Commission's White Paper on fair payment for infrastructure use, a committee of Government experts on charging for the use of transport infrastructure was set up to advise the Commission. The committee has been supported by a group of independent experts. The experts have produced two reports, one on estimating transport costs, and one on options for charging users directly for transport infrastructure operating costs. These reports cover, among other things, methods of calculating and charging for transport infrastructure costs, congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs and environmental costs. The committee has also acted as a forum for the exchange between member states of research and other information on infrastructure charging issues.

We take every opportunity to do so: for example, we support the EU Common Position on Burma (a package of measures against the regime) and have co-sponsored UN resolutions--most recently at the UN General Assembly in November--critical of the regime.

 The results of the first part of the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study were published in <i>The Lancet</i> in December. This is the largest UK study on childhood cancer to date. It started in 1992 and has examined a number of factors which might be implicated in childhood cancer. The present study provides no evidence that exposure to magnetic fields associated with the electricity supply in the UK increases risks for childhood leukaemia, cancers of the central nervous system, or any other childhood cancer. Also published in December were two studies in the International Journal of Radiation Biology. In these studies, scientists from Bristol University report observations of increased deposition of natural radionuclides near power lines. From these measurements it is inferred that other pollutants in the environment, such as car exhaust fumes, will behave similarly and this may be a cause of childhood leukaemia.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his policy on fluoridation of drinking water.  [102351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w17.html_spnew10"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 In our White Paper, "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation", which was published on 6 July we announced that we have commissioned an up-to-date expert scientific review of fluoride and health. If the review confirms that there are benefits to dental health from fluoridation and that there are no significant risks, we intend to introduce an obligation on water companies to fluoridate where there is strong local support for doing so.

<P>
<a name="00120w18.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 NHS Direct received in total 194,521 calls between 27 December and 12 January. Indications are that between 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. of calls during this period related to influenza symptoms. During this period the overall proportion of callers who were advised to attend their accident and emergency department was 6 per cent. and 2 per cent. of callers were diverted to the 999 service.

 Influenza activity in England is monitored through the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel surveillance scheme. This records the number of first visits to a general practitioner with influenza-like illness. Other respiratory illnesses prevalent at this time of year are recorded separately.
<P>

<a name="00120w18.html_para0">This system cannot measure the real incidence of influenza since it is restricted to those people who visit their general practitioner. Patients of the type referred to are therefore not included. This year a major campaign was run to encourage people to choose their own remedy, to consult a pharmacist and to use NHS Direct, as alternative sources of advice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w18.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 NHS Direct accounts nationally for 600 (whole-time equivalent) nurses, a small number against the overall size of the nursing workforce, which is 332,000 (whole-time equivalent) in England (as of 30 September 1998). Specific information, such as the previous employment of NHS Direct nurses is not collected centrally. NHS Direct has deliberately recruited nurses from a wide range of different backgrounds: hospitals, primary care, outside the NHS. Some will be from a hospital background but others will be from primary care or will have been working outside the NHS. NHS Direct has also provided opportunities for the disabled and those who had to stop working in the ward\hospital because of other injuries. Many staff who work for NHS Direct do so on a part time basis allowing them to combine working for NHS Direct with other clinical duties.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2000]:</i> Influenza immunisation aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to flu by immunising those people most likely to have a severe or complicated illness due to flu. Immunisation is, therefore recommended for all those in whom the disease is more likely to be a serious illness, that is people:

<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2000 : Column: 585W</I><P>
Research has shown that the single most important factor affecting whether an individual is immunised or not is whether the doctor or nurse recommended it.
<P>

<a name="00120w18.html_para7">The Chief Medical Officer launched Flu Awareness Week at a press conference in October 1999. This annual event results in widespread media coverage and gives a useful opportunity to get key messages across to the general public. Flu Awareness Week is organised by the Association for Influenza Monitoring and Surveillance (aims) who organise media based awareness work each autumn. Other organisations, such as Help the Aged, support this activity as well as producing their own leaflets for the public.
<P>

<a name="00120w18.html_para8">Those in the risk groups were encouraged to come forward for immunisation through placed articles in the general and women's press and through relevant representative groups. This year's "Keep Warm, Keep Well" campaign encourages older people to keep healthy this winter and included information on influenza and immunisation. Help The Aged's "Senior Line" was briefed on the importance of influenza immunisation. As part of the work on Flu Awareness Week, (aims) worked with various representative groups such as the British Lung Foundation, the British Heart Foundation, to promote awareness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00120w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the current problems experienced in accessing dental services, which we inherited from the previous Government. Access problems for adults are most acute in the south and west of the country, including the Yeovil constituency. We have taken positive steps to address these problems. The Investing in Dentistry initiative saw a &#163;10 million investment in dentistry, including eight approved bids in Somerset, one of which was in Yeovil, while the personal dental services pilots have allowed for local flexibility in service provision. &#163;203,000 has been awarded in grants in Somerset which will allow for 18,750 additional registrations.
<P>

<a name="00120w19.html_para0">We are also piloting dental access centres, providing fast and convenient access to dentistry in areas with acute access problems. Two dental access centres opened last year, and a further six will come on line this winter. On 5 January my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, the Under-Secretary of State, announced 34 successful expressions of interest for a third wave of dental access centre pilots. A proposal from Somerset has been successful at this stage. These potential centres must now submit a full business case, and if successful, will be operational by the end of the year.

 The number of National Health Service trusts charging for visitor car parking is not collected centrally. The amount raised from car park charges is not separately identified within trust financial returns. Advice issued to trusts in 1996 on car parking charges suggested that special consideration needed to be given to the needs of some categories of visitors and staff.
