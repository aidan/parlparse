 There are no proposals to give residents eligible for concessionary travel the monetary value of a concessionary bus pass as an alternative to taking it up. The Concessionary Bus Travel Act  2007 preserves the flexibility of Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs) to enhance their schemes locally at their own expense. At its discretion a TCA can choose to offer its residents travel vouchers or tokens for local use in taxis. The offer of any such enhancement and the monetary value of it is entirely a matter for the TCA as vouchers or tokens are not part of the statutory entitlement to concessionary travel.</p>

By moving all the clerical work undertaken by the Agency to this one site from September 2006, the Agency was able to release people to focus on other improvement work outlined in the Operational Improvement Plan, including reducing the number of uncleared applications and strengthening enforcement. This has contributed to the Agency meeting or exceeding all of its 2007/08 Secretary of State targets and collecting over &#163;1 billion in child maintenance for over 750,000 children.</p>

The Agency took steps to ensure that our service to clients improved by renegotiating the contract with Vertex to allow them to focus on keeping maintenance flowing to children. The Agency also increased its resource dedicated to progressing clerical cases by retaining responsibility for new clerical cases until first payment stage.</p>

<i> [h</i><i> olding answer</i><i>  20 June 2008]: </i>The main sources of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in the UK in 2006 were energy supply (40 per cent. of total UK CO2 emissions in 2006), transport (24 per cent.), business (17 per cent.) and residential (15 per cent.). The main sources of methane emissions (CH4) in the UK in 2006 were waste management (41 per cent. of total UK CH4 emissions in 2006) and agriculture (38 per cent.). The main sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the UK in 2006 were agriculture (68 per cent. of total UK N2O emissions in 2006) and transport (15 per cent.). The primary source of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the UK is release of refrigerants. The primary sources of Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are from aluminium smelting and electronics manufacture. The primary sources of Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) in the UK are from magnesium smelting and from the release of SF6 used in electrical insulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80623w0004.htm_para5"><a name="08062330000035">In 2006, emissions of UK carbon dioxide were 554.4 million tonnes. This figure includes emissions from the Crown Dependencies and those Overseas Territories that have joined the UK's ratification of the Kyoto protocol. This figure includes emissions and removals from land-use, land-use change and forestry, as accounted for under the Kyoto protocol. Our Kyoto target is to ensure emissions of the six greenhouse gases controlled under the protocol throughout the period 2008-12 are no higher than 3.412 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This equates to average emissions of no higher than 682.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. UK emissions in 2006 were 652.34 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent. This figure does not take into account additional emissions savings delivered through UK participation in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) which was estimated to be 34 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2006.</p>

 There are some unique health benefits to swimming, particularly so for the over 60s. Swimming is also the most popular physical recreation for adults, and a key means of increasing the amount of exercise people take. But we know that cost can be a barrier to participation for some, and that this can be exacerbated in areas of high deprivation.</p>

 The evaluation of the Licensing Act 2003 was published on 4 March this year. Our main conclusion was that businesses and consumers have been using the freedoms provided but that more could be done to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour. There are, however, limits to the impact licensing law can have on the personal behaviour in terms of consumption. We have therefore announced, in the Youth Alcohol Action Plan, measures which are designed to tackle binge drinking among young people. The Government also expect to consider further action when the ongoing Alcohol Price, Promotion and Harm review reports this summer.</p>

colleagues, whether we need to do more to support local communities in controlling these establishments. As a first step, I have recently written to chief executives of local authorities to clarify the powers available under the Licensing Act and to seek their views on whether these, and other controls, are sufficient to respond to the concerns of local people. I am arranging for a copy of my letter to be deposited in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="80623w0011.htm_brev2"><a name="08062339000839"><ul><p class="tabletext">I have taken your question to arise from the incident in Kajaki, Afghanistan in September 2006 during which Corporal (Cpl) Mark Wright GC was killed. This incident was the subject of an internal Board of Inquiry (BOI), the results of which were given to the next of kin of those involved. The BOI found: that a number of British soldiers entered an unmarked minefield; that multiple mine detonations over a short period of time followed; and, that the injured were eventually extracted by a US helicopter. The BOI also found that the arrival of this helicopter was delayed by mechanical problems, and although a British Chinook helicopter arrived at the scene earlier it did not attempt to extract the soldiers, in part, because it was not fitted with a winch&#151;all such items having been withdrawn from the Chinook force some months earlier.</p>
</ul><a name="80623w0011.htm_brev3"><a name="08062339000840"><ul><p class="tabletext">The BOI concluded that no winches were available for the Chinook but the more recent Supply Chain investigation found that not all winches were affected by the maintenance issue that resulted in those fitted to Chinooks in Afghanistan being withdrawn back to the UK. In fact, a small number were available to the Chinook force at around the time of the Kajaki incident.</p>
</ul><a name="80623w0011.htm_brev4"><a name="08062339000841"><ul><p class="tabletext">On first inspection it seems odd that winches could have been available to the Chinook force but not deployed forward immediately to replace the winches which were recalled. This seems particularly odd in the light of the media reporting that had the Chinook which was called to assist in the incident had a winch, it would have been able to rescue those trapped in the minefield.</p>
</ul><a name="80623w0011.htm_brev5"><a name="08062339000842"><ul><p class="tabletext">The reason that the replacement winches were not deployed forward immediately can be explained by the fact that, in September 2006, there was no formal requirement for UK Chinooks in Afghanistan to be fitted with winches. Chinooks have &#147;role equipment&#148; which can be taken off or put on the airframe as and when it is considered necessary by the military chain of command. The aircraft that went to Afghanistan did have winches already fitted when they deployed but without a formal requirement for them, once the winches had been removed there was no immediate pressure to replace them, and there were no requests from the military chain of command in Theatre for the winches to be replaced.</p>
</ul><a name="80623w0011.htm_brev6"><a name="08062339000843"><ul><p class="tabletext">This can be further explained by the fact that using helicopters to extract personnel from minefields is widely recognised as being an extremely hazardous undertaking, only to be used in exceptional circumstances; our preferred approach to minefield extraction is either through the use of Explosive Ordnance Disposal assets or through self-extraction using techniques in which all deployed personnel are trained. Given this, it is understandable that no Standard Operating Procedures existed in theatre at the time governing the use of Chinook helicopters in extracting injured personnel from minefields, and that Chinook crews are not routinely trained in winch operations in such circumstances. Indeed, the Chinook crew involved in the incident has confirmed that, even if a winch had been fitted to their Chinook they did not consider it safe, either for those on the ground or in the aircraft, to attempt a winch extraction.</p>
</ul><a name="80623w0011.htm_brev7"><a name="08062339000844"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is worth pointing out however that even though the UK Chinook fleet at the time did not have a formal requirement for winches there was a winch capability available to UK forces in Theatre. Coalition helicopter assets were pooled and winch capability was available from US assets&#151;through both a US Combat Search and Rescue capability with a HH-60G helicopter, and a US Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Team, also with a HH-60G. And it was the US Combat Search and Rescue capability which successfully extracted Cpl Wright. That it did so successfully was testament to the ability and courage of the crew who the Board of Inquiry found &#147;acted with complete disregard for their own safety.&#148; In fact, this was such an exceptionally brave manoeuvre that their actions were recognised by Her Majesty with a Queen's Commendation for Bravery in the Air.</p>
</ul><a name="80623w0011.htm_brev8"><a name="08062339000845"><ul><p class="tabletext">Thus there was an available winch capability in theatre but not through a formal requirement placed upon UK helicopter assets, and replacement winches were not requested. Moreover, the introduction of other temporary alternatives would not have been a practicable proposition as they would have required detailed testing to be carried out and appropriate clearances to be obtained; a process which typically takes approximately six months to secure.</p>

 The Orchid system was procured by the MOD police in 2000. The decision to procure the Orchid patrol vehicle tracking system was made in financial year 1999-2000. The system was identified as a safety solution, enabling tracking of MOD police vehicles (cars and boats) that were used by the area policing teams (APT) which had a roaming police role. APTs were restructured in 2004 and re-tasked without need to continue the Orchid contract.</p>

 We have not commissioned or evaluated any research on grandparental access to grandchildren in the last 10 years, and we have no immediate plans to commission research on the role of parents in governing grandparent/grandchild relations. We believe that parents are usually best placed to make decisions about their children's relationships with grandparents and other relatives. However, with leave of the court, it is possible for grandparents to apply for a contact order under section 8 of the Children Act 1989, to enable them to maintain a relationship with their grandchildren.</p>

 With regard to schools, legislation prohibits the interviewing of children or parents to determine admission to a maintained school (except where an interview is used solely to assess the suitability of an applicant for a boarding place). This includes admission to the school at year 12.

 The Department has commissioned a six-year longitudinal study of teachers' experiences of initial teacher training and early professional development. The project, &#147;Becoming a Teacher&#148;, started in 2003 with a sample of trainees in their final year of initial teacher training and is ongoing as it follows them through their early career. 91 per cent. of survey respondents who were currently teaching or planning to be in teaching in the following term indicated that they expected to still be in teaching in four years' time. At the time of the survey there were 106 participants who had worked as a teacher since completing their training but were not now working as a teacher and were not looking for a teaching post. Reasons cited included being unable to find a job, behaviour of pupils/pupil discipline, deciding to move into another career, family reasons/commitments and workload.

As part of this, two sets of peer reviews have been completed, the results of which show that forces are making good progress towards the target of implementation across all business areas by 2010.

The system has now been deployed to 67 organisations across the United Kingdom and currently holds over 61 million records. Over the 12 months from April 2007, use of the INI tripled, with around 36,000 searches being conducted in March 2008. Since its deployment, around half-a-million searches have been conducted in total, an estimated 11 per cent. of which have led to requests to other agencies for access to information they hold.</p>

From the 14 consortia that formally responded, the Programme selected three to participate in detailed negotiations.

 HM Treasury has made no estimate of the effect of fuel subsidies in developing countries on global oil prices.

As highlighted in the June 2008 Treasury paper &#145;Global Commodities: a long-term vision for stable, secure and sustainable global markets&#146;, subsidies inhibit the automatic stabilisation that should occur through changes in consumption as a result of price movements, while resulting in deterioration of Government fiscal positions.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 June 2008]:</i> The European Commission's proposed target of 15 per cent. renewable energy in the UK by 2020 does not specify where in the UK renewables should be located.

 A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is a requirement for all offshore commercial projects that form part of a plan or programme e.g. offshore wind farms. However, in order to design a suitable SEA for commercial marine renewable, adequate knowledge of pre-commercial marine renewables needs to be acquired. There are insufficient data available at present to test different scenarios under an SEA. Therefore, an SEA would be unlikely to provide much helpful information at this stage as it would be very difficult to predict impacts of marine renewable technologies prior to their deployment for demonstration. This position is set out in our &#147;Guidance on Consenting Arrangements in England and Wales for a Pre-Commercial Demonstration Phase for Wave and Tidal Stream Energy Devices (Marine Renewables)&#148; http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/filel5470.pdf . Once sufficient data becomes available from demonstration projects we will review the need to publish an SEA of sites for tidal stream generation. Completion of an SEA will be a pre-condition for the start of any plan or programme for a commercial phase and will be subject to full public consultation.</p>
