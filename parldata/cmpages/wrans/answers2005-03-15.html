The consultation paper explained that the proposed regional transport funding allocations would initially bring together capital funding projected for major schemes (generally costing over &#163;5 million each) under the Local Transport Plan (LTP) system and for major Highways Agency schemes, except for those on routes of strategic national significance where decisions will continue to be taken nationally.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the unemployment rate in the highlands and islands since 1997.  [221062]</p>




<p><a name="50315w02.html_spnew12"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 The claimant count unemployment rate for the Highlands and Islands fell from 6.2 per cent. in 1997 to 2.9 per cent. in 2004, below the Scottish average of 3.5 per cent., and there are around 6,400 fewer people in the area claiming unemployment-related benefits compared to 1997. This demonstrates the success of the Government&#039;s strategy of making work pay in every region through initiatives such as new deal, the national minimum wage and working tax credits.

On simplification, I suggested that it would be appropriate to reduce the number of measures and adopt a more flexible approach to cross cutting projects. And I supported the Commission&#039;s work on biodiversity and Natura 2000 while suggesting that there could be a focus on water and climate change issues.

The Commission rejected a Spanish proposal that the sugar trade concession offered to certain developing countries under the Everything But Arms commitment should be amended. The Commission also undertook to examine a Spanish request as to whether a regionalised approach to decoupling of tobacco aid could be permitted under the CAP reforms agreed last April. Olive oil producing countries pressed for the EU to resume its contributions to international promotional campaigns. Italy requested a change in the method for calculating part of the aid granted to nut producers.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of failed asylum seekers were removed in 2004.  [219129]</p>




<p><a name="50315w11.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 It is not possible to know what exactly proportion of applications made in 2004 will prove to be unfounded, or will eventually result in removal. Some applications made in 2004 are still awaiting the outcome of initial decisions or of appeals. Other cases are in the process of removal, can, in certain cases, create a number of barriers, for example the length of time it takes to obtain documentation to allow individuals to be accepted back by their countries of origin. Many failed applicants may either leave the UK voluntarily without advising the Home Office, or seek to evade the Home Office in order to try to avoid removal, or come from countries where removal is very difficult due to the situation in the country (e.g. Iraq).

<p>
<a name="50315w11.html_para1">
The level of asylum applications has continued to fall. There were 33,930 applications for asylum, excluding dependants, in the UK in 2004, a third fewer than in 2003.

 The total number of penalty notices issued for these offences for the period January to November 2004 is 61.

Penalty notice disposal provides the police with a quick and effective way of dealing with this type of minor offence without the need to prosecute.

 In recent months there have been a few signs suggesting an improvement in the political relationship between China and Taiwan.

Moreover, cross-Strait trade increased by a third last year.

We welcome these developments and believe that such practical measures build confidence and promote dialogue. We believe that through such pragmatism, real progress can be made.
