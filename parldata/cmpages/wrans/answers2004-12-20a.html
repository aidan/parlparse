<a name="stpa_3">In spite of fears that deterioration in the security situation would disrupt the Presidential elections, there were very few serious security incidents or reports of violence in the run-up to election or on the day itself.

Organisations are doing an excellent job in working around these areas to continue providing assistance wherever possible.

 DFID has not seen a full text of the interview concerned.

Proper consideration of women&#039;s rights taking into account the cultural values of the Arab world, along with strong national media awareness, are key to stemming the reported rapid increase of HIV/AIDS in the region.

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41220w03.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 On 13 December, DFID Uganda received a letter from Uganda&#039;s Minister of State for the Environment presenting his concerns about the implications of the completion of DFID&#039;s support for Uganda&#039;s forestry sector. DFID Uganda is in discussion with the Minister about his concerns. The final phase of DFID&#039;s Uganda Forest Sector Policy and Strategy Project began in 2001, and was scheduled to end in June 2003. Since then, DFID has granted the project two extensions to accommodate the slow pace of reform in the forestry sector. At the time of the last extension in June 2004, we agreed with the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment that our support would formally end on 31 December 2004. The sector is well supported by other development partners.

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="41220w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 December 2004]:</i> There are no central records of the numbers of schools containing asbestos in England. However, as part of asset management plans, local education authorities record the presence of asbestos in the schools which they maintain. Other schools are required to keep their own records. Of approximately 20,400 primary schools and 3,400 secondary schools in the UK, some 13,000 were built between 1945 and 1974, when the use of asbestos-containing materials in building was at its peak. Many other school premises would have been refurbished during that period, providing the potential for the introduction of asbestos-containing materials. Schools constructed after 1999 will not contain asbestos building materials.

<a name="41220w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_72">The new regulation 4 of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations; the duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises, came into force in May 2004.

 Scottish law does not allow for compensation of general damages (solatium) to be paid to the widow of the estate if the miner died before 16 July 1992. However, during the negotiations of the Scottish Claims Handling Agreement with the solicitors representing the claimants, the Department agreed that solatium could survive the miner and pass to the widow. In cases where the widow herself dies, it was not originally intended that the payments went to her estate. Nevertheless, the Department subsequently agreed that it would make ex-gratia payments to the surviving family where widows died between 1 May 1999 and 31 July 2002, as we acknowledged that there had been a backlog in setting up the process to handle claims.

 The question of how best continually to improve enforcement against those, such as gangmasters, that mistreat workers and act illegally has been and continues to be much discussed. During inter-departmental discussions on this issue in 2003 a number of different approaches from various departments were considered, rejected, modified and adopted. Such debate is a normal part of the process of government and is how departments reach a consensus on the best way forward. In this case the consensus settled on taking a range of actions, including Government support for a private Member&#039;s Bill, now the Gangmasters Act 2004.

 Pre-nuptial agreements are not legally enforceable at present, but the courts may consider the terms of such agreements when exercising their discretion in relation to the division of property on divorce.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the cases where pre-nuptial agreements are an issue are rare.

The Government believe that there would be difficulties in tying people into agreements made years before a divorce.

 Any decision to lift the EU Arms Embargo on China would have to be taken by unanimous agreement of all EU member states, including the UK. EU control of defence equipment exports to China would continue to be governed by the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. It is possible, irrespective of the existence of an EU arms embargo on a country, for a member state to impose a national embargo on that country (as is the case with the UK&#039;s embargo on Iran) although arms embargoes are very much more effective when applied multilaterally.

 In 1998, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) asked the Institute of Environmental Health to carry out a study into the relative risks of chrysotile asbestos and commonly used substitutes including cellulose. Later in the same year HSE also asked the Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) to advise on the relative carcinogenic risks of three chrysotile asbestos substitutes including cellulose taking into account the report produced by the Institute. The COC advice was that the carcinogenic risk posed by cellulose fibres is likely to be less than that posed by chrysotile.

2. During this period, the file holding and number of files considered for destruction increased because the number of files created during the preceding five to 10 years also rose.<br>

3. The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and part of the Department for Education and Employment including the Employment Service. Since that date, the number of files held by the Department expanded and the numbers of files created and eligible to be considered for destruction similarly increased.<br>

 Political parties are already covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in their capacity as employers or providers of goods, facilities or services to the public or a section of the public. However, they are not currently covered in relation to the provision of goods, facilities or services to their members where members do not constitute the public or a section of the public (in other words, where membership is determined by a genuine process of selection on the basis of personal criteria). The Disability Discrimination Bill remedies this by extending coverage of the 1995 Act to associations of 25 or more members which apply such membership selection procedures.

 Since 1997 our policies have helped increase the employment rate for people aged 50 to state pension age in Scotland from over 59 per cent. to over 68 per cent., with 118,000 more people aged 50 and above in work. This increase has been faster than the increase in the overall employment rate.

 The Department for Work and Pensions are committed to reviewing their pay policies to ensure that they are compliant with the current equal pay legislation and do not either directly or indirectly discriminate against any group of employees. Equal Pay Audits are carried out regularly to review existing policies and to inform the development of the departmental reward strategy. The most recent audit, which commenced earlier in 2004, is nearing final approval. On completion, a summary of the final report will be placed in the House of Commons Library. This report will then by used to develop an up to date equal pay action plan.

<a name="41220w31.html_para7">
The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) suggests that, as a general guide, any gender differences of 5 per cent. or more, or patterns of differences of 3 per cent. or more will require exploration and explanation. Early indications are that that there has been progress in closing the gap between male and female average salaries within DWP; in May 2002 (when the last equal pay audit was finalised) the overall gap was 5.7 per cent. whereas in December 2003 it had reduced to 4.8 per cent. This figure is calculated using the salaries of all staff within DWP excluding the Senior Civil Service whose remuneration is handled by Cabinet Office. The differences between male and female mean salaries change by grade. In our administrative grades, which are staffed by a greater proportion of female staff, the mean salary is higher for women than men in these grades. In our executive grades, male mean salaries are higher.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w31.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_224">There are a number of possible reasons for the gender mix at the administrative and executive grades, for example, historical progression rates for each gender. We have recently begun to address these by consciously shortening pay scales and the Department is currently considering the recommendations in the latest draft report to identify any further action required.

1. The estimates of the numbers contracted out and the average annual payment are for Great Britain only and are consistent with the rebate estimates for the 2004 Pre-Budget Report.<br>

2. The numbers contracted out are based on those shown in the Departmental publication &quot;Second-Tier Pension Provision&quot; and other information on contracting-out trends that has emerged in recent months.<br>





3. The large increase in the average annual payment from 2002&#150;03 is due to the increase in the level of the rebate which applied from the beginning of that tax-year.<br>

1. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was created in June 2001. Due to the migration of businesses into and out of the newly forming Department, and differences in calculation methods, figures for the Department as a whole are only available from April 2002.<br>

2. The information in the table covers the years April 1999 to March 2002 relating to the former Department of Social Security (DSS), the main predecessor Department in place prior to the formation of DWP, and for DWP for April 2002 to March 2004.<br>

3. Figures have been provided for DSS and DWP for each full operational year since 1999. Sickness absence information for the current year, April 2004 to March 2005, will be available in spring 2005.<br>

4. As at 30 September 2004, the Department had lost 790,668.1 days to sickness absence which equated to a sickness rate of 4.8 per cent. or 12.1 average number of working days lost.<br>

 DCMS has a Public Service Agreement (PSA) aimed at increasing the take up of cultural and sporting opportunities from priority groups (including ethnic minorities), which reflects the importance placed by this department on meeting the needs of this group. Prominent examples of work to meet the needs of ethnic minorities among the bodies we sponsor are the Museums&#039; Association&#039;s Diversify project, which helps to persuade people from ethnic minority backgrounds to take up a career in museums and galleries, and the active encouragement of increased numbers of visitors from ethnic minorities by museums. Within the broadcasting sector we have encouraged the development of the Cultural Diversity Network, which aims to increase the entry of ethnic minority groups into the media.

 National health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs) are subject to national standards set by the Secretary of State, performance ratings, and systems of inspection, like all other NHS trusts. However, accountability for NHSFTs is to local people and staff, NHS commissioners, Monitor, the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of NHSFTs, and Parliament, rather than to the Department and Ministers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w41.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_285">The role of the Healthcare Commission is to conduct annual reviews and where necessary investigations into the provision of NHS healthcare, and publish performance ratings for NHSFTs, taking into account their performance against national standards and targets in the same manner it does for all NHS bodies. The Healthcare Commission may therefore review any data relating to the provision of NHS healthcare by NHSFTs. The role of Monitor is to oversee compliance by NHSFTs 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Dec 2004 : Column 1474W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
within boundaries detailed in the terms of authorisation, and also the legislation. The terms of authorisation sets out the conditions under which NHSFTs must operate and requires them to take into account national standards. Monitor has recently issued its compliance regime for NHSFTs for consultation&#151;available at www.nhsft-regulator.gov.uk&#151;which details the level of information on compliance with the terms of authorisation that NHSFTs are required to provide to Monitor in-year. Both Monitor and the Healthcare Commission are subject to a statutory duty to cooperate with one another in the exercise of their respective functions. In collaboration with the Healthcare Commission, Monitor is reviewing NHSFTs&#039; current external reporting with a view to reducing the information burden substantially.

 NHS Plus was established in November 2001 to encourage the provision of occupational health services by national health service occupational health departments to external employers under the income generation arrangements. Over one hundred occupational health departments, representing approximately 50 per cent. of all NHS units, joined the scheme and research during the first two full years of operation indicated an income growth of around 16 per cent. per annum.

Routine monitoring of web traffic shows between 5,000 and 8,000 individual visitors per month in the first half of 2004. Thirdly, an evidence based guideline project is under way, with partners in Europe, the voluntary sector in the United Kingdom and the NHS, to develop appropriate quality guidance for all occupational health services. Five guidelines are currently being constructed with the first expected to be published in the second half of 2005.

<p><a name="st_451"><a name="41220w49.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 According to our records the Identity Cards Programme has not had any formal meetings with Aurora Computer Services Ltd. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Home Office officials have encountered this company when they have attended, or spoken at, conferences or other such meetings. The Identity Cards Programme has met with a range of companies, including those involved in providing biometric technology, as part of its market sounding activities and anticipates meeting with many more before a formal procurement is announced. Market sounding is the process of assessing the reaction of the market to a proposed requirement and procurement approach, and is recognised as best practice in Government procurement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w49.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_335">Market sounding focuses on suppliers as a whole, rather than the merits of individual suppliers. It includes no element of supplier selection (choosing suitable suppliers) or bid evaluation (looking at proposals, technical solutions or prices). There is no commitment of any kind involved&#151;on either side nor any advantage to be gained by a supplier by getting involved. Further it is stressed that there is no formal procurement under way at the moment as the Identity Cards Bill is still before Parliament. Priority for market sounding to date has been given to the smartcard and biometric sectors where the technology is developing quickly, standards are evolving and there is uncertainty about future trends.

<p><a name="st_452"><a name="41220w49.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 A Regulatory Impact Assessment was published at the time of the introduction of the Identity Cards Bill. This set out in detail the potential benefits of the identity cards scheme including the National Identity Register, in combating crime and illegal immigration. This analysis was the result of discussions with key user groups, stakeholders and the consultations that we have undertaken on the principle of identity cards as well as the draft Identity Cards Bill over the past two and a half years.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Dec 2004 : Column 1500W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w49.html_para3">
The identity cards scheme will contribute in the following ways to combating crime: helping to disrupt the support networks of organised criminal operations which rely extensively on the use of multiple identities; encouraging verifiable proof of identity when conducting major financial transactions; providing the capability for law enforcement agencies to be provided with information from the National Identity Register, subject to appropriate authorisation procedures and independent oversight; enabling more efficient use of police resources when dealing with routine identification of individuals with their consent; and checking of fingerprint biometric information at scenes of crime in unsolved cases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w49.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_336">The identity cards scheme will also reduce the illegal immigration &quot;pull factor&quot; by providing a straightforward means to record and verify the immigration status of all residents aged 16 and over. This will allow service providers and employers to make checks more easily without specialised knowledge of immigration rules.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to combat the production of counterfeit identity cards in the event of the introduction of identity cards.  [201813]</p>








<p><a name="st_453"><a name="41220w49.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 7 December 2004]:</i> The Identity Cards Bill published on 29 November, includes at Clause 27 new offences relating to making or possessing false identity documents such as UK, and foreign, identity cards, passports and driving licences. These offences include not only &quot;false&quot; documents as defined in the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 but also to documents that belong to another person or that have been improperly obtained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w49.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_337">Where it is proved that a person has intent to use these documents, a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment would apply. Where there is no intent, but the accused has no reasonable excuse for having such documentation in his possession, a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment will apply. The introduction of these penalties will ensure that the police are able to take action against those who attempt to produce false identity cards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w49.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_338">In addition, the introduction of a sophisticated identity checking process, coupled with the recording of biometric information which is unique to an individual will counter attempts by a person to obtain more than one identity card under different names.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w49.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_339">In its response to the Home Affairs Committee report on Identity Cards (Cm6359), the Government said that it would examine the feasibility of whether the verification service should operate predominantly in an on-line mode. Even if a good quality forged identity card was produced, it would be detected by on-line verification as there would be no associated record held on the National Identity Register against which its validity could be confirmed.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent representations he has received on altering sentencing guidelines for murder.  [205653]</p>








<p><a name="st_475"><a name="41220w52.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Sentencing guidelines are a matter for the independent Sentencing Guidelines Council. Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 sets out robust principles to which judges must have regard when setting the minimum custodial term to be served by the offender within the mandatory life sentence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41220w52.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_356">The revised guideline published on 16 December 2004 makes a separate provision for murder which rules out any reduction in the most heinous (whole life tariff) cases, halves the maximum reduction available in other cases and emphasises that the tariff as a whole must accurately reflect the seriousness of the offence.
