<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what guidance his Department has issued to ensure that legal advisers working on a conditional fee basis make disclosures of that fact to any other party to litigation or to a transaction; and if the guidance provides that such disclosures be made.  [110034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 At present there is no need for special guidance as the opponent's liability for costs is unaffected if a claimant chooses to finance litigation through a conditional fee agreement. However, the success fee in a conditional fee agreement and the premium for any insurance policy against costs will become recoverable from the losing party from 1 April, when the relevant provisions of the Access to Justice Act 1999 come into force. On 1 February, the Government published a report entitled "The Government's Conclusions Following Consultation on Conditional Fees: Sharing the Costs of Litigation". In view of the opponent's potential liability for increased costs if there is a success fee or insurance premium, the report includes recommendations to the Civil Procedure Rule Committee as to how rules of court might deal with issues of disclosure. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to announce the appointment of the Chairman of the Gambling Review Body and the body's terms of reference.  [110759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Further to the reply I gave my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) on 8 December 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 534W, I have today appointed Sir Alan Budd as Chairman of the Gambling Review Body.




<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 2000 : Column: 538W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para0">Sir Alan Budd is Provost of Queen's College, Oxford, and a former Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury. The position is unpaid.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para1">We will make a further announcement on the membership of the Review Body in the next few weeks. We hope it will start work shortly after Easter to report by the Summer 2001.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para2">The terms of Reference for the gambling review are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Consider the current state of the gambling industry and the ways in which it might change over the next 10 years in the light of economic pressures, the growth of e-commerce, technological developments and wider leisure industry and international trends.
<P>
<BR>
Consider the social impact of gambling and the costs and benefits.
<P>
<BR>
Consider, and make recommendations for, the kind and extent of regulation appropriate for gambling activities in Great Britain, having regard to:
<P>
<BR>
their wider social impact;
<P>
<BR>
the need to protect the young and vulnerable from exploitation and to protect all gamblers from unfair practices;
<P>
<BR>
the importance of preventing gambling from being carried out in a way which allows crime disorder or public nuisance;
<P>
<BR>
the need to keep the industry free from infiltration by organised and other serious crime, and from money laundering risks;
<P>
<BR>
the desirability of creating an environment in which the commercial opportunities for gambling, including its international competitiveness, maximise the United Kingdom's economic welfare; and
<P>
<BR>
the implications for the current system of taxation, and the scope for its further development.
<P>
<BR>
Consider the need for, and, if necessary, recommend new machinery appropriate for carrying out that regulation which achieves a more consistent and streamlined approach than is now possible and which is financed by the gambling industry itself.
<P>
<BR>
Consider the availability and effectiveness of treatment programmes for problem gamblers and make recommendations for their future provision, potential costings and funding.
<P>
<BR>
In conducting this review, the body should not consider changes to the National Lottery, but it will need to look at the impact on the Lottery of any proposed changes, including an assessment of the potential effect on the income to good causes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many prisoners are undergoing treatment on a sex offender therapy programme; how many prisoners have been recommended for treatment on such a course in the past year; and by how much demand for places outstrips supply;  [110082]
<P>
<UL>(2) what is the average time between recommendation for treatment on a sex offender therapy programme and placement on such a course.  [110083]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Records are kept centrally of the number of sex offender treatment programmes running at any one time, but not of the number of offenders participating in them. However, given that there is an average of eight inmates attending each of the 48 programmes currently in progress, about 384 prisoners will be receiving treatment at the moment.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para3">No records are kept centrally of the number of prisoners who have been recommended for a place on the programme and this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The programme is open to all adult male prisoners who have been convicted of a sexual offence, to those whose index offence appears to have had 



<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 2000 : Column: 539W</I><P>
a sexual motive and to those who have been convicted of a sexual offence in the past and are assessed as needing to participate in the programme. Candidates must be assessed as suitable for participation in the programme and they must be willing to participate in it.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para4">There are considerable variations between the dates on which individual prisoners are assessed for participation in the programme and the commencement of treatment. It would not be feasible to make places available on demand for all prisoners who need to undergo it, and the Prison Service, therefore, operates a waiting list system. For determinate sentenced prisoners, the order of priority is determined by an assessment of risk of re-offending balanced against time left to serve; for life sentenced prisoners by their tariff date, or by proximity of the next parole review if the tariff has expired or none was set. In addition to that, programme treatment managers need to ensure that each group has a balance of different types of offender. This means that a prisoner at the top of a waiting list may not necessarily be selected for the next programme. For these reasons, average waiting times between assessment and participation have little significance and are not recorded centrally.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he has taken in response to the report by HM Inspector of Prisons into Wymott Prison; and what plans he has to increase the provision of sex offender therapy programme places there.  [110084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In accordance with the protocol for handling inspection reports, the Prison Service produced an action plan within 30 working days of publication of the report. All but three of the 104 recommendations have been accepted, and an updated action plan showing the progress made will be produced in April 2000, nine months after publication of the report.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para5">Additional resources have been made available under the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review and the number of sex offender treatment programmes is set to increase as follows: 48 places in 1999-2000, 56 places in 2000-01, and 72 places in 2001-02.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has held with the Scottish Executive concerning a bilateral concordat in relation to the implementation of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; and if he will make a statement.  [109225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Implementation of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 in Scotland is being pursued in accordance with the administrative arrangements set out in the general concordat between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive. In particular, the National Asylum Support Service is maintaining close contact with the Scottish Executive to ensure the effective implementation of the new asylum support arrangements in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Information on the new fixed penalty offences introduced on 1 August 1999 is not yet available.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para6">Each police force has been asked to monitor the fixed penalty provisions which came into force on 1 August 1999, and the figures will be published later in the year.
<P>

<a name="00216w01.html_para7">Monthly figures, however, are not being collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in relation to the National Fire College at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, when he will commence implementing the recommendations of the Options Review and over what timescale the implementation will be completed; what discussions he has had with the unions about the recommendations; and what discussions he has had with the private sector about the recommendation to form a private public sector partnership.  [110228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I refer to the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) on 20 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 370-71W. This makes it clear that we have invited the views of all interested parties, including the trade unions, by 18 February 2000. We shall also be seeking the advice of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council. We will take further decisions on implementation in the light of these consultations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what plans he has to increase the accessibility of polling booths to the aged who are disabled;  [109988]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate the increase in the number of people aged 65 or over who would vote in a national election if all polling booths were accessible to those with disabilities  [109987]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Representation of the People Bill includes measures specifically aimed at increasing the accessibility of polling places to disabled voters. In addition, guidance on national minimum access standards for polling places was issued in June 1999; new guidance on disabled access to electoral services is being developed, and grants are available to local authorities for temporary ramps and polling screens. No statistics are collected on the age or disability of voters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Association agreements do not provide an automatic right of establishment. Information regarding the right of establishment is not provided routinely, but is available to asylum seekers and others on request.
<P>

<a name="00216w02.html_para1">Decisions on whether detention is appropriate are made on a case-by-case basis. Detention is used only as a last resort, and only those who are inadmissible passengers, illegal entrants or subject to deportation action may be detained. The existence of an association agreement between an asylum seeker's country of origin and the European Union is not taken into account.

 Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, local authorities must plan how youth justice service systems will be delivered locally. If they choose, they may seek to involve the Prison Service in the delivery of those services, including work with schools and the secondment of prison staff to youth offending teams. Funding for this work will, however, in general have to be found from youth offending team resources, since the Prison Service is funded to work with offenders in custody.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2000]:</i> Only 1 per cent. of defendants appeal against conviction and sentence following a trial in the magistrates courts and the model which has been used to estimate costs assumes that the effect will be de minimis. Even if as many as 10 per cent. of previously electing defendants chose to appeal following conviction after a contested trial, there would be fewer than 200 additional appeals, at a cost of less than &#163;250,000.

It is, however, established practice with school trips for the schools to make arrangements for travel and subsistence themselves. NMEC provides all schools with details of travel companies who are offering packages specifically aimed at schools. Additionally, many schools are also well placed to negotiate favourable deals through their established relationships with local travel operators.

<a name="00216w05.html_para1">The revised Code of Guidance will recommend that authorities develop strategies for co-ordinated working between agencies, including the value of exploring joint assessments at an early stage for those with multiple needs. The Guidance will also explicitly refer to the need for this approach when assessing homelessness applications from vulnerable people and when dealing with the needs of young people between the ages of 16-18. The forthcoming Housing Green Paper is likely to include proposals for reform of the homelessness legislation to provide further protection for unintentionally homeless people in priority need.

 The public inquiry concluded on 7 January 1999 and the Government Office for the South West (on behalf of the Secretary of State) received the Inspector's report on 2 August 1999. The decision in this case has been delayed in large part to the complexity of the issues and the changing status of the development plan.

 The Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) fired from HMS Splendid made a highly effective contribution to the NATO air campaign in Kosovo. They provided a major step forward in UK capability, enabling precision attacks at long range against selected targets. Tomahawks were particularly valuable during periods of poor weather when fewer manned aircraft were able to operate.

We fund a number of agencies (including Oxfam, Save the Children Fund, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Children's Fund) who have well-established programmes providing relief and rehabilitation for those displaced by the conflict.

 Information for England is given in the table for 2000-01. Education Standard Spending assessments do not cover Wales. The differences between the figures for England and those for Wakefield are a result of the authority's standard spending assessment which reflects social deprivation, area costs and demographic changes.

<i>Notes:<P>

</i>1. Grant for the Education of Traveller and Displaced Persons was in existence prior to May 1997 but became a standard Fund grant in 1999-2000.<P>

2. Ethnic Minority Pupil Achievement replaced the schools' education element of the Home Office Section 11 grant.<P>

3. Both grants for the reduction of class sizes will be paid through the Standards Fund mechanism from 1999-2000 but are covered by their own Regulations and are therefore listed outside the Standards Fund.<P>

4. The Books for Schools grant includes provision for grant maintained schools paid via the Funding Agency for Schools.<P>

5. In 1998-99 a large proportion of nursery education funding was channelled through the Revenue Support Grant.<P>

6. Nearly &#163;1.5 million of credit approval has been allocated for the removal of outside toilets, in addition to the &#163;16.5 million of grant allocated through the Standards Fund.<P>

7. Under the New Deal for Schools, grant that has not been paid through the Standards Fund has been paid direct to voluntary aided schools and to former grant-maintained schools (either direct or through the Funding Agency for Schools).<P>

8. Formula capital grant is paid to schools either through the Standards Fund or direct to Voluntary Aided schools.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the funding per pupil in <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools for each local education authority in descending order in the last year for which figures are available; and what plans he has to tackle the disparity in funding between local education authorities.

<a name="00216w10.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 2000]: </i>Set out in the table, in descending order, is the funding for LEA maintained primary (including pre-primary) and secondary schools, on a per pupil basis, for the financial year 1997-98, the latest year for which final figures are available.
<P>

<a name="00216w10.html_para0">The Government announced in November 1998 a three-year review in partnership with local government to look for a way of distributing revenue support grant which is simpler, more stable, more robust and fairer than the present arrangements for SSAs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what account he took of the speech by the right hon. Member for the Cities of London and Westminster of 3 February 2000, <i>Official Report, </i>columns 1299-1300, in writing to the Leader of Westminster City Council on 7 February.  [110409]

<a name="00216w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend is aware of views expressed in the speech by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) of 3 February 2000. He will not take account of the level of an authority's spend in comparison with its standard spending assessment in taking decisions on whether to release its share of the &#163;50 million grant. It is vitally important that the increased funding we have made available for education reaches education budgets. We will therefore continue to urge local authorities to passport the increase in education spending assessments to education budgets. My right hon. Friend will take decisions on the release of the &#163;50 million grant to support school budgets in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his letter of 7 February to the Leader of Westminster City Council, if he will take account of the authority's cash increase in central support grant when deciding whether to release the council's share of the extra &#163;50 million special grant available for education.  [110411]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w10.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 It is for an authority to decide how it uses any increase in central support protection grant in setting its budget. My right hon. Friend will want to see prior confirmation that an authority has increased its education budget by the increase for 2000-01 in its education standard spending assessment before making a decision on the release of its share of the &#163;50 million special grant.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what conditions will be attached to the additional special grant of &#163;50 million for education next year; and what the reasons are for attaching these conditions.  [110408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w10.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend will want to see prior confirmation that the whole of an authority's increase in its education standard spending assessment has been passed on to its education budget before he takes decisions on the release of that authority's share of the &#163;50 million special grant. Local education authorities will be required to include their share of the &#163;50 million special grant in their schools' delegated budgets. It is vital that the &#163;1.1 billion increase in education standard spending for 2000-01 is not diverted to other services, but reaches local education authority budgets, and that the &#163;50 million in extra grant is used to support school budgets.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will take into account the fact that an authority is already spending above its education standard spending assessment when distributing his Department's additional special grant of &#163;50 million for education.  [110412]<P>

on whether to release its share of the &#163;50 million special grant. What is important is whether an authority increases its education budget by the increase in its education SSA.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w10.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Brooke: </B>

 Education Standard Spending for 2000-01 takes into account the estimated recurrent costs-- &#163;35 million--of successfully implementing the forthcoming reforms to post-16 qualifications in LEA maintained schools in that year. There is no meaningful way in which the Department can put a precise figure on how much additional funding for implementing the reforms is included in the Northumberland Education Standard Spending Assessment. Nor would it be appropriate for the Department to offer guidance on the resources which should be made available to individual schools in order to implement the reforms. These decisions are, rightly, made locally, in the light of local needs and circumstances.

 The process of identifying suitable companies involved the DfEE issuing a prospectus, to which interested suppliers responded. Their proposals contained financial and historical information on their business, the specifications of computers being offered and a detailed plan of the ways in which the company would support prospective customers. Detailed checks were made on these responses, including checks on the financial strength and stability of the companies concerned. Final selection was made on the basis of advice provided by BECTa to the Tender Board assembled for the purpose. Their decisions and recommendations to the DfEE were arrived at in the light of the proposals received and the results of the checks carried out.

 We have reiterated during the Lords Committee Stage of the Learning and Skills Bill that we would certainly expect national and local LSCs to include members who understand the needs of local communities through current local authority experience. But we also said it would be wrong to go further than that and specify a particular proportion of places for local authority representatives. It would be difficult then to ensure representation for all the other national partners and stakeholder organisations with an interest in post-16 learning.

<a name="00216w11.html_para1">We also made it clear that Local authorities will be central partners in the new post-16 arrangements--not just in providing and securing learning opportunities in schools and through adult and community learning but also as organisations which are uniquely placed to provide vision and leadership for communities. The new arrangements will mean that local authorities have a greater influence over the whole range of post-16 provision since local LSCs will be required to consult local authorities on their plans and set out in them the post-16 learning provision which LEAs will secure.

 The key to tackling poor behaviour is early intervention. My right hon. Friend issued guidance on pupil attendance, behaviour, exclusion and re-integration to Local Education Authorities and schools in July of last year. The School Inclusion: Pupil Support Standards Fund grant will provide &#163;140 million to schools and Local Education Authorities in 2000-01 to help them tackle behaviour problems before they escalate. Nearly &#163;100 million must be devolved to secondary schools. Additional resources are going to secondary schools in some city areas as part of the 'Excellence in Cities' initiative, which will include support for Learning Mentors and Learning Support Units to help combat disruption in the classroom. These measures will help meet the targets to reduce truancy and exclusions by one third by 2002.

 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> The implementation of the National Grid for Learning will support investment of &#163;657 million in information and communications technology in maintained schools in England in the period up to 2002. Primary schools were the focus for expenditure in the first phase of this programme (1998-99). This has led to unprecedented improvements in connectivity. Last year there was a four fold improvement in internet connections in primary schools to 62 per cent. We are making increased levels of funding available in the period 2000-02 to enable the remaining primary schools to become connected to the internet and the Grid. At the same time this will enable more primary schools to invest in networked ICT.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 2000]:</i> The EU Commission has written to member states informing them of their proposal to add these varieties to the Common Catalogue, and inviting comments on that proposal. Inclusion on the Common Catalogue is governed by the requirements of EU Directive 70/457 as amended recently by Directive 98/95. It is for the Commission to determine whether all of the requirements of the Directives have been met. We do not have information about field trials in other member states, but CHARDON LL is on the Dutch National List, ELGINA is on the Portuguese National List, COMPA CB is on the Portuguese and Spanish National Lists and JORDI is on the Spanish National List.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Minister is currently considering the report of the review of CAP Scheme Administration which he commissioned from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) last autumn. The report recommends that the CAP scheme processing functions currently carried out in MAFF and the Intervention Board should be merged to create a new paying agency, and that the IT systems should be redeveloped to enable claim forms to be submitted and processed electronically. Farmers without access to the Internet would be able to submit their forms via third parties. On this basis PWC consider that it will be possible to deliver a significantly better service to claimants and to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of administering the CAP schemes.
<P>

<a name="00216w14.html_para2">The Department is also drawing up plans to align other aspects of its regional activities with the Government Office network, so as to ensure that it can participate effectively in the formulation of policy at regional level.

<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 2000 : Column: 592W</I><P>
applications for the entry of plant varieties to the UK National List. Such applications are considered against the requirements of these regulations: namely that a variety is distinct, uniform and stable (DUS) and has a value for cultivation and use (VCU) over those varieties already on the National List. Where the statutory criteria are met, a variety may be proposed for addition to the National List, and where they are not, it is proposed for refusal for addition to the National List. People affected by the proposed decision may make representations and be heard before the decision is taken.
<P>

<a name="00216w15.html_para0">In addition, before a GM plant variety may be proposed for addition to the National List, a marketing consent must have been promulgated under Directive 90/220/EEC, and where appropriate, clearance obtained under the Novel Foods Regulation No.258/97/EEC. Where all of these criteria have been met, a proposal may be made for addition of a plant variety to the National List.A GM forage maize variety (CHARDON LL) has completed National List tests and trials. The trait involved has a marketing clearance under Directive 90/220/EEC, including use for animal feed. It also has clearance under the Novel Foods Regulation. The application for the addition of this variety to the National List is being considered and a decision is likely to be taken shortly about whether to propose the variety for addition to the National List.

<a name="00216w15.html_para1">The UK's farm scale evaluation programme is additional to the environmental and health assessments of GM crops referred to above. The recent agreement between Government and SCIMAC precludes the general commercialisation of GM maize until 2003 at the earliest--subject to the results of the farm-scale evaluation programme.

<a name="00216w15.html_para5">In 1998 fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions on the census. It appears that this change may have led to the recording of additional labour that was not previously included on the returns. The change on questions has also led to a redistribution of labour between the various categories. Caution is therefore advised when comparing the 1998 results with previous years.

<a name="00216w16.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> Although pig market prices are 12 per cent. higher this year than last, they remain below the cost of production. As a result, pig producers are experiencing severe difficulties and the British pig breeding herd is contracting. Market prospects continue to be depressed, but there should be some further recovery in prices. Our policy is to continue to draw attention to the quality standards and high animal welfare standards in British pig production methods and to encourage retailers and caterers to take this into account when sourcing pigmeat products. The work of MAFF's verification officer is important in these respects. Frequent discussions are held with representatives of the industry.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what studies he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> received on the effect on wildlife of spraying sulphuric acid on crops; and if he will publish the results of such studies.  [103394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00216w16.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Sulphuric acid is approved as "commodity chemical"--a substance which has pesticidal uses but for which the major uses are non-pesticidal and which no company wishes to market as a pesticide. Commodity chemicals are assessed on the basis of information in the public domain and MAFF has not commissioned studies concerning effects on wildlife. However, under the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme, MAFF encourages the reporting of incidents suspected of being caused by pesticides and investigates all reports received. No incidents involving sulphuric acid have been reported in the past decade.
<P>

<a name="00216w16.html_para0">The most recent evaluation of sulphuric acid has been published and the underlying information is available for inspection at the Pesticides Safety Directorate in York.

However, it is not practicable to require that all paper and timber products purchased by the Cabinet Office are independently certified by the FSC because this might discriminate against any equally valid schemes and therefore be against public procurement. Specifying just the FSC label might also result in us failing to meet all our requirements as currently only a small percentage of timber products are currently FSC certified.

<P>

<a name="00216w18.html_para2">However it is not practicable to require that all paper and timber products purchased by the Department are independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council because this might discriminate against any equally valid schemes and therefore be against public procurement rules.
<P>

<a name="00216w18.html_para3">Specifying just the FSC label might also result in us failing to meet all our requirements as only a tiny percentage of timber products are currently FSC certified. This is why the Department's policy statement for greening its operations contains a requirement to ensure that suppliers of paper and paper products have in place an acceptable Environmental Policy and requires satisfactory evidence of compliance with published trade or other acceptable environmental standards and guidelines. It also provides for documented proof or, if available, adequate validation under an internationally recognised certification or ecolabelling scheme to ensure that timber, wood or plywood acquired by the Department, or its contractors come from sustainable resources.

As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary questions on average household incomes and the percentage of household incomes derived from social security benefit.
<BR>
The attached table shows information from the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) for the period 1992 to 1998-99. Data for earlier years are not readily available and are for two-year periods.
<BR>
Like all estimates from sample surveys, these figures are subject to sampling variability, so while general trends can be seen, care should be taken in interpreting short-term changes in the data. In 1998-99, for example, in most regions the true average is unlikely to differ from the estimate by more than 7 per cent either way, but in Northern Ireland it may be 15 per cent either way and in the North West 13 per cent, both areas having small samples. In the Rest of the South East, however, the range is only 5 per cent either way. Standard Statistical Regions (SSRs) are used for England because data are not available for Government Office Regions for the earlier years.
<BR>
The FES shows the proportions of household income derived from social security benefit for 1996-1999 as follows.

These figures are also subject to sampling variability. Data for 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 have therefore been combined to reduce this variability. In most regions the true figure for each percentage is unlikely to differ from the estimate by more than 1&#189; percentage points either way. In Northern Ireland the range is 3&#189; percentage points each way but in the Rest of the South East less than 1. SSRs are used for England because data are not available for Government Office Regions for the earlier years requested in the average household income question.<P>

As Director of the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your question on average savings per person expressed as a percentage of take home pay.
<BR>
The precise information requested is not available. However, the households' saving ratio is considered to provide the best available indicator of trends in changes in saving rates. This is derived as the ratio of savings to the total of resources available (more commonly known as disposable income) of the combined households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) sector.
<BR>
The households' saving ratio is published quarterly in the ONS First Release, "Quarterly National Accounts". The series is held on the ONS database. All sources are available in the House of Commons library.
