has been developed on the basis of published literature, a number of projects commissioned by WRAP and current local authority experience of providing food waste collection services. The general advice is that if local authorities are considering collecting food waste they should consider collecting it separately and on a weekly basis. Where food waste is collected separately, WRAP advises that local authorities provide appropriate containers to householders (typically a kitchen caddy and a rigid external container) to make the separation of food waste easier for residents and to encourage them to take part in the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="71018w0003.htm_para12"><a name="07101833000425">The types of food waste suitable for collection will depend on the treatment facilities available to a local authority. All food waste collected separately must be treated at enclosed facilities (for example, in-vessel composting or anaerobic digestion plants) that meet the requirements of the Animal By-Products Regulations and are approved by the State Veterinary Service. Typically this will include cooked and uncooked food, dairy products, meat, fish and fruit/vegetables.</p>

 Foot and mouth disease was first confirmed on a premises in Surrey on 3 August. As soon as the circulating virus strain was identified as the same strain as the one held at the Pirbright site on  4 August, DEFRA and Merial agreed that, because of the large quantities involved, the use of live virus would be voluntarily suspended by Merial. The case for a similar suspension at the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) was also considered on 4 August and has been kept under active review since then. Drawing on advice from the Health and Safety Executive, some modification has been made to the agreed areas where IAH can work with live virus. However, our judgment to date has been that, because of the small volumes of live virus handled by IAH and the additional measures the Institute has put in place, complete suspension is not justified.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> Under the Animal Health Act 1981, compensation  is paid for animals that are compulsorily slaughtered to prevent the spread of disease. For foot and mouth disease (FMD), the Act requires that compensation  is paid at the full market value before the animal became infected. This is determined by an approved valuer at the time of slaughter. Compensation is also paid for other items, such as farm equipment and feed, where these are seized because they are considered to be contaminated; this includes such things as milk. However, it is a long established principle that the Government do not meet the costs of consequential losses, which must be borne by the industry. Government seek to minimise the risk of market impacts, particularly by encouraging public understanding of the issues.</p>

This is the best way to facilitate the return to normal working for the industry. We are working in partnership with the industry, but eradication of foot and mouth disease remains our priority.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> The landfill tax escalator gives greater financial incentives to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. This was increased in the 2007 Budget so that the standard rate of tax will increase by &#163;8 per year from 2008 until at least 2010-11. If private waste collectors that collect commercial waste fail to offer alternatives to landfill (such as recycling) they will find that the waste treatment services they offer will no longer be cost effective. This is an incentive for waste contractors to consider developing waste management partnerships with local authorities to provide services to local businesses.</p>

 On 12 October 2006, the Government, in association with the devolved Administrations, published a consultation paper on the European Commission's proposal to revise the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). The Commission's proposal included a provision to enable the adoption by comitology of EU-wide minimum standards for waste management operations. A summary and analysis of the responses to this consultation is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

However, I am advised that DEFRA has no record of the CBI subsequently submitting proposals for UK and EU-wide standards on waste management. It follows that no discussions on such proposals have taken place with the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

This is in response to recommendation 4 of the Biomass Task Force Report to the Government, published in October 2005. DEFRA&#146;s general conclusion is that it is more cost effective to treat contaminated waste wood as a waste and to dispose of it in a Waste Incineration Directive (WID)-compliant facility than to attempt to decontaminate and burn it in commercial wood-burning furnaces or power plants as a non-waste. Such WID-compliant facilities can recover energy as electricity, or electricity and heat in the form of combined heat and power for industrial purposes.</p>

Hazardous and inert wastes for landfill have to meet the waste acceptance criteria destined for landfill. The criteria are limits of contaminants permitted in waste, together with testing standards and procedures that must be used. Hazardous wastes are also required to be pre-treated before landfill.

People with mental illness who disclose their condition can find themselves shunned by neighbours and colleagues while some do not disclose their illness to family and friends.

A key part of this programme aims to improve the way cases proceed in the magistrates courts. Following successful tests (with evidence of more offenders pleading guilty at an early stage, fewer hearings and the majority of trials for contested cases being set within 6-10 weeks), national implementation is firmly under way throughout England and Wales. CJSSS is now running in at least one site in each of the 36 local criminal justice areas and fully implemented in all magistrates courts in 11 of those areas. Implementation is expected to be completed in all but a handful of magistrates courts by December 2007. Once fully implemented these changes should deliver a step change in the public&#146;s experience of the justice system, improving the speed and effectiveness of magistrates courts.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Results are based on proceedings in one sample week in March and September. The Time Intervals Survey (TIS) is a sample survey that produces estimates of the average time taken between stages of proceedings for defendants in completed criminal cases in magistrates courts. More information on TIS is available on the Ministry of Justice website.<br>
2. The margin of error is a measure of the precision of a result based on a sample survey. Timeliness in magistrates courts is measured using data from a sample of the total number of defendants. The sample provides one estimate of the average time taken and different samples would produce different average times. The true value is likely to fall within the range of the sample result +/- the margin of error.<br>
3. &#147;First listing&#148; refers to the first listed hearing of the case in the magistrates court.<br>
4. It is not totally clear which &#147;assault&#148; cases are being referred to in the question. Information on broad offence group is collected in TIS although not at a level that would make it possible to provide estimates for defendants proceeded against for assault crimes separately. The offence classifications are as follows: burglary, criminal damage, drunken driving, drug offences, driving without due care, fraud and forgery, failing to stop, indictable motoring offences, other summary motoring offences, robbery, sexual offences, summary non-motoring offences, theft and handling stolen goods, violence against the person, other indictable offences (excluding motoring offences). Information is not available in TIS at individual offence level. Assault offences are classified in several different offence groups.<br>
In addition to timeliness of all criminal cases, timeliness figures have been provided for one of the offence groups (&#145;summary non-motoring offences&#146;) as it was thought this might be helpful. The &#145;summary non-motoring offences&#146; group includes the offences common assault, and assault on a constable, which were thought to be the most relevant offences to answer this question. Please note that in addition to the assault offences, the summary non-motoring offence group also includes a wide variety of other offences such as offences against Public Order and Education Act offences.

 Work on developing a Defence related price index commenced in 2004-05 and has continued since. Unfortunately, despite commitment by both the Office for National Statistics and Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA), work has as yet failed to produce a defence specific inflation index.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="71018w0010.htm_para11"><a name="07101833001090">Matching the companies, to which MOD has made payments, with Office for National Statistics data has been difficult due to changes in names, ownership, recording of information and ONS data on prices being from a sample survey. Less than 20 per cent. of companies paid more than &#163;1 million by MOD in 2002-03 could be matched to price data, which accounted for less than 30 per cent. of MOD spend. Confining analysis to the subset of Defence problems further decreases this already poor coverage causing any estimates of defence inflation to be unreliable and biased.</p>

Price changes collected by ONS represent off the shelf products whereas the large value goods that MOD buys tend to be bespoke systems. Quality adjustment of price indices is appropriate for determining change in value, but not for the replacement costs that MOD faces. It is difficult to incorporate overseas expenditure. Indices used in placing contracts frequently do not reflect the expenditure patterns of the MOD.</p>

 All cases, in both the magistrates court and appeals to the Crown court, are dealt with on their merits and are heard as quickly as possible. The Government's Criminal Justice Simple, Speedy, Summary (CJSSS) programme is under way to improve court processes in the magistrates courts to ensure that cases are dealt with as fairly and as quickly as possible. Early indications are that the programme will have a significant impact on eliminating unnecessary hearings and reducing the time from charge to disposal for adult charged cases.

In Ethiopia, DFID is providing &#163;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) annual humanitarian appeal, some of which is being used for flood response.

 It is quite legitimate for a customer to have more than one DWP record file. At any given time an individual may be in receipt of injury benefit, income support, disability living allowance, social fund payment(s). It should be noted that each social fund claim generates a new file. It is also feasible that CSA, debt management and fraud hold files on the individual as well as dormant records for jobseekers allowance and the labour market unit. Other benefits for which individual records are kept include retirement pension, attendance allowance and industrial injuries disablement benefit.</p>

 Budget 2007 reforms to personal taxation included increases to higher personal allowances for those aged 65 and over by &#163;1,180 above indexation in April 2008, removing around 600,000 pensioners from paying tax, and ensuring that around 95 per cent. of pensioner households either gain or are unaffected by the reforms overall. Pensioner households are on average &#163;1,450 a year better off in real terms since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="71018w0019.htm_para2"><a name="07101846000403">We estimate that marginal deduction rates will fall for around 2.8 million pensioner heads of household in 2009-10 as a result of the reforms, and that they may rise for around 600,000 pensioner heads of household, in most cases reflecting changes in marginal rates of income tax. Not all of those with higher marginal deduction rates will be worse off as allowances have risen.</p>

<p><a name="71018w0021.htm_spnew7"><a name="07101846001767"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 There has been substantial progress in implementing the recommendations of the Pomeroy Review of Christmas savings schemes since its publication in March 2007.</p>
<a name="07101846001574">
<p>Firstly, the Government have taken steps to provide better protection and information for consumers. They have worked with the other hamper companies to put in place effective protection for customers' prepayments, and are pleased to note the initiative of the companies in improving security for consumers&#146; money, which is now held in trust accounts under the control of independent trustees. The arrangements within the individual companies will be monitored by a new trade body, the Christmas Prepayments Association, with a new code of practice to ensure that customer protection measures are established and operated effectively.</p>
<a name="07101846001575">
<p>In response to the recommendation on mounting an awareness campaign, the Government have given the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT) funding for a consumer education campaign so that consumers are better aware of their options for Christmas savings and empowered to make decisions that are right for their own circumstances. The OFT education programme is delivering face-to-face sessions for consumers across the UK. The sessions, run by community groups, explain the options for people and help them to   <br>

choose the best way to save for them as individuals, pointing out the features of the alternatives. This work is being well received and will continue to be delivered into 2008.</p>
<a name="07101846001576">
<p>The OFT were also asked to consider whether there were any competition issues in the hamper scheme market. The OFT examined the merger of Park Group and Home Farm Hampers and found that alternative sources of saving operated as a constraint on the merging parties. This is because the majority of customers are prepared to consider switching between a wide range of savings products. No competition concerns were raised either by competitors or customers.</p>
<a name="07101846001577">
<p>As detailed in the review, a number of credit unions across the country have historically also offered Christmas saving accounts, and this number increased significantly after the collapse of Farepak. There are now more than 100 such accounts. The OFT's &#147;Save Xmas&#148; campaign has provided consumers with information on all Christmas saving options, including credit union Christmas and regular saving accounts. This will ensure consumers have the necessary information to choose the right product for their needs. The Financial Inclusion Taskforce has reported that Post Office Limited's plans to launch a Christmas saving product is progressing.</p>
<a name="07101846001578">
<p>The Government's work on financial inclusion and capability has responded to the recommendation that informal saving schemes be given greater emphasis. In addition to the OFT &#147;Save Xmas&#148; campaign, the Department for Work and Pension's &#147;now let's talk money&#148; campaign, which provides people with information and support in accessing financial services, is providing guidance on the different ways in which people can save. The Thoresen review on generic financial advice, which will shortly be publishing an interim report, with a final report to follow early next year, is considering the provision of guidance on informal savings. And the FSA's &#147;money made clear&#148; website also has information on Christmas saving schemes.</p>
<a name="07101846001579">
<p>Finally, on the recommendation relating to Government awareness of all methods of savings, the new wealth and assets survey is collecting information on informal saving. Interim findings from the first wave of data collection will be published by the end of the year.</p>

 The matter raised is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which is accountable to Parliament rather than Ministers. Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive of Ofcom to reply directly to the hon. Member. Copies of the chief executive&#146;s letter will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families if he will revise the criteria for granting Building Schools for the Future capital funding to local education authorities to ensure adequate funding for schools which have an intake of students from deprived areas but which are relatively prosperous local authority areas, with particular reference to Stockport.

 As I set out in my written statement of 10 October 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 33-38WS, on capital investment in schools, 2008-11, the Government aim to provide a balance of capital programmes that meets national and local needs. The balance of devolved, strategic and targeted programmes ensures that, while we press ahead as fast as possible with our strategic programmes (the Primary Capital Programme and Building Schools for the Future), there is also significant funding available for other areas.</p>

 The Government collect data on children who became the subject of a child protection plan. In the past this meant they had also had their names placed on a local authority child protection register. Arrangements to maintain a separate register are being phased out by 1 April 2008. Figures on the number and percentage of children who became the subject of a child protection plan as a result of sexual abuse are shown in the table for the years ending  31 March 1990 to 2007.</p>

 The Department receives representations from stakeholders, in particular pupils and parents, about the numbers of tests and examinations which pupils are required to take. There are statutory assessments of each pupil's progress and attainment at the end of key stages 1, 2 and 3, In key stage 1, pupils are set at least one task in each of reading, writing and mathematics. Tasks can be taken at any time and enable teachers to be secure in their judgment of which level the child has reached. Assessment at key stages 2 and 3 involves tests in English, mathematics and science, and teacher assessments. Although there are no statutory requirements for assessment at the end of key stage 4, approximately 96 per cent. of 15-year-olds are entered for one or more full GCSE courses each year. The tests and examinations taken at the end of each key stage do not amount to an excessive burden on pupils or schools. For example, the key stage 2 tests amount to less than six hours, accounting for around 0.15 per cent. of available teaching time in the key stage, and the key stage 3 tests amount to less than eight hours, accounting for less than 0.2 per cent. of available teaching time in the key stage.</p>

Working with the Hansard Society and the parliamentary education unit, we have supported the development of the MPs in Schools pack, which prepares pupils for a visit from their local MP. The Hansard Society, with DCSF backing, has also developed the &#147;Headsup&#148; website, an online forum that assists teachers in delivering political literacy, and also MPs who can use it to consult with their younger constituents; the &#147;Big Ben&#148; and &#147;All That! teaching resource, which gives teachers and pupils an inside view of Westminster through interviews with MPs and Peers as well as archived footage from Parliament; and &#147;Y Vote Mock Elections&#148;, which aim to actively engage students with the electoral process. DCSF has also funded a programme of MP mentoring, where MPs work directly with trainee citizenship teachers to help them with their knowledge of Parliament so that they can teach the political literacy element of citizenship with confidence. In addition, DCSF set up and funded the Association for Citizenship Teaching (ACT) to work with teachers and local authorities to provide training and help to spread good practice.</p>
