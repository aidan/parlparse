 It is for primary care trusts to assess local health needs and commission services to meet them. The Department supports primary care trusts by funding them on the basis of their assessment of their population&#146;s health needs. Waiting lists are at a record low and falling. Guidance produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is promoting much more consistent access to cost-effective drugs and other specific interventions.</p>

There has been growth in many of these groups. There is also variation from trust to trust in which exact roles are classed as public health. In addition, the definition of the public health specialty has been more closely defined in recent years resulting in the exclusion of groups of staff such as health visitors and school nurses who some trusts and PCTs previously included as public health staff.</p>

 Local housing authorities must allocate housing accommodation in accordance with part 6 of the Housing Act 1996. Among other things, this requires authorities to publish a scheme for determining their priorities, and defining the procedures to be followed, in allocating housing. The scheme must be framed so that reasonable preference for an allocation is given to certain groups of applicant, but it is for individual authorities to decide on the priorities to be given to people within these groups. The reasonable preference groups are based on housing need and include people who need to move on medical or welfare grounds (including grounds relating to a disability) and people owed a homelessness duty. The scheme may also be framed so that additional preference is given to people within the reasonable preference categories who have urgent housing need. The Department has issued statutory guidance to local housing authorities on how they should discharge their functions under part 6. This gives examples of people with urgent housing needs to whom housing authorities should consider giving additional preference including those owed a homelessness duty as a result of domestic violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="70626w0006.htm_para2"><a name="07062888000436">Under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the 1996 Act), local housing authorities must secure that suitable accommodation is available for housing applicants who are eligible for assistance, homeless through no fault of their own and who fall within a priority need group. Accommodation must be secured until a settled home becomes available. The priority need groups include people whose household includes a dependant child or a pregnant woman and, in 2002, the Government extended the priority need groups to include, among others, people who are vulnerable as a result of leaving their home because of violence or threats of violence likely to be carried out. Jointly with the Secretaries of State for Education and Skills and for Health, the Secretary of State has issued statutory guidance to local authorities which they must have regard to when exercising their homelessness functions. The guidance reminds authorities that, under the legislation, a person is homeless if it is not reasonable for them to continue to live in their home and itwould not be reasonable for someone to continue to live in their home if that was likely to lead to violence against them or against a member of their family. The guidance also encourages authorities to offer people who have experienced domestic violence a range of accommodation and support options, includingthe option of remaining in their home withadditional security measures provided under a sanctuary scheme.</p>

 Capital funding for local authority housing is provided through the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy system in the form of supported capital expenditure (SCE) and the major repairs allowance (MRA). SCE is the level of borrowing for capital purposes that is supported by the Government through the HRA subsidy. This value is based on the Regional Housing Boards' allocations. MRA represents the estimated long-term average amount of capital spending required to maintain a local authorities housing stock in current condition. The capital funding includes an element for regeneration but that is combined with the decent homes programme in the private sector.

<i> [holding answer 25 June 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Government offer housing assistance to key workers under the Key Worker Living (KWL) scheme in areas experiencing severe recruitment and retention difficulties. Key Worker Living funding is divided between Open Market HomeBuy (equity loans to purchase properties on the open market) and new build products such as New Build HomeBuy (shared ownership of newly built homes) and intermediate rent (newly built homes where the rent is set at a level between that charged by social and private landlords).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="70626w0008.htm_para5"><a name="07062888000854">Since April 2006 we no longer fund specific key worker only new build schemes. Instead key workers access our New Build HomeBuy and intermediate rent programmes as a priority group alongside other priorities such as social tenants. Any key worker specific schemes yet to complete will have been funded under old shared ownership programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="70626w0008.htm_para6"><a name="07062888000855">Since the launch of Key Worker Living the Housing Corporation has been collecting data on when the construction of a scheme has been completed and when the final unit has been occupied. The purpose of this data is to actively manage the portfolio of new build properties and take action to prevent long term empty units&#151;and as such allows us to give a breakdown of the current position on empty properties only. As at the end of May 2007 there are no empty Key Worker Living properties designated for key workers only in the Wycombe constituency.</p>

Any such order must be approved by both Houses of Parliament, following consultation with the Electoral Commission and other appropriate persons.

Scale fees for counsel also increased in April 2006, the first increase in a number of years, and this also contributed to overall increase in 06/07.&#148;</p>

 The Big Lottery Fund (BLF) is the main distributor of lottery funding to the Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS). The BLF has committed to distributing 60-70 per cent. of its money to the voluntary sector and that commitment is based on the money the sector would have received without the Olympic transfer, not 60-70 per cent. of what is left. The commitment remains unchanged, and the NCVO has welcomed this.

Home working helps staff maintain a work life balance. DEFRA is committed to helping its staff maintain a work life balance and recognises that home working can help to reduce the need to travel to work thereby removing journey time and potentially reducing overall transport congestion and pollution as well as individual stress levels. Therefore, DEFRA believes that home working contributes not just to staff welfare but ultimately to delivery of a high quality service to our customers. DEFRA supports home working and is taking steps to ensure that the necessary tools and technologies are in place to facilitate this as part of its overall policy on flexible working. Home working can include the occasional day or days taken to complete a specific task or address a particular situation and is available to all staff subject to business needs. Alternatively, it can be a permanent arrangement with regular home working days appropriate to the individual&#146;s situation.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 June 2007]:</i> The Government have a duty to explain their policies, decisions and actions; to inform the public about their rights and liabilities; and to provide the public with advice and warnings. DEFRA publishes regular reports and consultations in accordance with these principles. The number of copies printed of such publications is not held centrally and could be collated only at disproportionate cost. Print procurement policy is to produce the lowest quantity of publications to meet the specific needs of each case, thereby minimising waste. Most reports are less than 1,000 copies. In the case of consultations, most are handled online and stakeholders may download a copy for local printing. Copies will be supplied to order&#151;printed digitally&#151;on a limited basis, if requested, as will large print and Braille versions.</p>

1. Figures prior to 2000 cover main holdings only. Figures from 2000 onwards include main and minor holdings. A minor holding has to meet all the following conditions:<br>
(a) have a total area of less than 6 hectares<br>
(b) a total labour requirement of less than 100 standard person days<br>
(c) no regular full-time farmer or worker<br>
(d) a glasshouse area of less than a 100 square metres<br>
(e) the occupier does not farm another holding<br>
2. Estimates have been made for holdings not selected or not responding.<br>
3. Office for National Statistics total labour force figures include all workforce categories (employed, self-employed, HM forces and Government supported trainees)<br>
4. Agricultural labour force includes:<br>
(a) principal farmers, spouses and business partners<br>
(b) salaried managers, regular and casual/gang workers<br>
5. Due to the introduction of new questions in 1998 figures prior to this year are not directly comparable with earlier years&#146; results.<br>
5. Due to a register improvement exercise in 2001 labour figures prior to this are not directly comparable with later results.<br>

 The Government&#146;s preferred measure of &#147;low income&#148; is income that is less than 60 per cent. of the median equivalised income for all UK households after tax. The Farm Business Survey is not able to provide figures for income net of tax and the figures below are therefore based upon a modified low income threshold of &#163;13,800 calculated before tax.  <br>

1. The increase in administration costs over 3 years from April '06 is as a result of the extra &#163;120 million costs associated with the Operational Improvement Plan.<br>
2. We are unable to provide figures for 1993-94, as audited accounts were not published for that year and as such the information is not available.<br>
3. Information from 1994-95 to 2005-06 is sourced from the Child Support Agency&#146;s published Annual Report and Accounts, and differ slightly from the published QSS which uses monthly figures, not subjected to yea-end adjustment.<br>
4. In 2005-06, following national Audit Office advice, the Agency&#146;s accounting boundaries were changed to include Child Support Reform Programme costs in the Agency&#146;s annual accounts. The 2005-06 accounts and the 2004-05 comparatives were changed accordingly. In line with this policy the table below includes Child Support Reform costs from 1999-00.<br>
5. The 2006-07 net administration costs and maintenance collections may be subject to change and will be confirmed when the audited accounts are published in July 2007.<br>
6. The 2007-08 estimate for maintenance collections is consistent with the published Agency target to collect or arrange &#163;970 million of maintenance outcomes. The residual &#163;310 million in maintenance will be delivered via private arrangements outside of the Agency&#146;s collection service.<br>
7. Total maintenance collected and arranged from 1994 to 2003 does not include maintenance direct.<br>
8. Maintenance Direct figures are sourced from Table 19.5 of the Quarterly Statistical Supplement. Maintenance Direct information is only available from April 2003 onwards.<br>
9. The amount of maintenance received is that collected via the CSA collection service. This includes<br>
both clerical and system payments.<br>
10. Monthly amounts of maintenance collected will not sum to the financial year figures published in the<br>
Annual Accounts as they do not include end year adjustments.<br>
11. The value of Maintenance Direct arrangements in place shows the value of the assessments that the Agency has made i.e. the recommended amount to be paid to the Parent With Care by the non-resident parent. This value is an estimate because it is not possible to calculate, for every day of the year, the value of Maintenance Direct arrangements in place at that point in time. However, it is possible to calculate the value of weekly Maintenance Direct arrangements in place at the end of each month and derive a full monthly estimate from that.<br>
12. Money relating to Maintenance Direct arrangements is not collected directly by the Agency. As such, the arrangement in place is the best estimate of the money being paid by the Non-Resident Parent.<br>
13. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;0.1 million.<br>

<sup>(4 )</sup>New Deal 50 plus costs for 2004-05 and 2005-06 were only incurred by those people who claimed the New Deal 50 plus in-work training grant.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. On 6 April 2003 the New Deal 50 plus Employment Credit was replaced by the 50 plus element of the Working Tax Credit. For the period Jan-March 2004 some of those who were helped into work through New Deal 50 plus may still have been receiving the Employment Credit, which was paid for up to a year. Costs also included the New Deal 50 plus in-work training grant which some participants claimed after entering work through the programme.<br>
2. New Deal 50 plus costs for 2004-05 and 2005-06 were only incurred by those people who claimed the New Deal 50 plus in-work training grant.<br>
3. Costs are calculated on the total number of people participating and total spend on each programme, excluding administrative costs and include, where applicable, costs incurred in payments made to employers and Job Brokers.<br>
4. Calculations are also based on all New Deal programme costs and allowances paid to participants apart from the 50 plus element of the Working Tax Credit, which is met by HMRC. As this is not included, New Deal 50 plus costs reduce considerably from 2004-05.<br>
5. Following agreement with HM Treasury in 2002-03, ring fences were removed from New Deal. Calculations exclude administrative costs as it is no longer possible to identify the costs of administering the costs of each New Deal separately from the costs of other labour market activities.<br>
6. Calculations include start-up costs.<br>
7. Programme start dates are: New Deal for Young People: January 1998; New Deal 25 plus: July 1998; New Deal for Lone Parents: October 1998; New Deal 50 plus: April 2000; New Deal for Disabled People: July 2001 (New Deal for Disabled People pilots ran from September 1998-June 2001).<br>
8. Calculations are based on latest spend figures to March 2006 and New Deal programme start figures to March 2006.<br>

 It would not be possible for local authority social services departments to forcibly remove a child of any age into their care in circumstances where parents do not consent to this.

 As defined in the report of the Teaching and Learning in 2020 Review Group, personalised learning means taking a highly structured and responsive approach to each child and young person's learning, in order that all are able to progress, achieve and participate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_618"><a name="70626w0022.htm_para3"><a name="07062893000432">Many schools and teachers have tailored curriculum and teaching methods to meet the needs of children and young people with great success for many years. What is new is our drive to make the best practices universal across all schools, particularly for children whose needs can be the most challenging to meet. Personalised learning can therefore be described as effective day-to-day teaching and learning which is assessment-centred and which enables each learner to engage and &#145;own&#146; their own learning. It can also encompass a wide range of more specific practices, such as Assessment for Learning and small group and one-to-one work with pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_619"><a name="70626w0022.htm_para4"><a name="07062893000433">The success of personalising teaching and learning will therefore be measured in improvements in the attainment of all pupils&#151;especially in English and maths&#151;in narrowing the gaps between different groups and in all reports of the quality of teaching and learning. We do not gather information on personalised learning as a separate programme or initiative, but Ofsted inspection reports, attainment data, evaluation of the &#145;Making Good Progress&#146; pilots and a wide range of information sources can be used to build up a picture of personalised learning in both primary and secondary schools.</p>

 As a result of the recent Education and Skills Select Committee enquiry into bullying, and subsequent report, and an independent evaluation of the Department&#146;s work with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), the Department is in the process of assessing its overall strategy of work to identify upcoming priorities and will shortly be competitively tendering for elements of work to be carried out in the next financial year. One of these elements will be research into bullying. This will look at what strategies are most effective in tackling bullying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_622"><a name="70626w0022.htm_para7"><a name="07062893000440">The Department currently commissions Goldsmiths College London, through the ABA, to provide research aligned with policy needs. In the last financial year, the projects undertaken on behalf of the Department included reviews of disability and bullying and on bullying in the community. Research projects this year will look at how schools can best support young people displaying bullying behaviours; young people at risk of anti-social behaviour; and bullying of looked-after children. The Department has also undertaken research with young people on the subject of cyberbullying to inform and develop key, relevant messages for our planned digital information campaign.</p>

 The Department currently has no plans to collect statistical data from schools or conduct a formal audit on how schools respond to bullying. As stated in the Department&#146;s recent response to the Education and Skills Select Committee report on bullying, there are logistical difficulties involved in asking schools to record incidents of bullying and their responses to incidents. In particular, there are issues around consistency of definition and how bullying might be reported if it continues over a significant period of time. There is also a question of how we might interpret an increase in reported incidents, which might occur as the result of an improved anti-bullying policy and new focus on openness. These complications could lead to more bureaucracy and greater workload for schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_623"><a name="70626w0022.htm_para8"><a name="07062893000443">The Department will continue to recommend in its revised anti-bullying guidance that schools record incidents of bullying and report the statistics to their local authority. The guidance will further advise that the LA should analyse the information gathered from schools to identify any issues of particular concern. This will enable the authority to be better informed in the development of appropriate strategies to tackle  <br>

It will be an annual survey (starting this year), covering all LAs. Data will be considered by Ofsted in their annual performance assessment (APA) of each LA&#146;s services, and could lead to Ofsted looking more closely at anti-bullying practices in a particular authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="70626w0022.htm_para10"><a name="07062893000445">We are currently looking at how we might use data derived from the survey to inform future policy development. We are also working with the National Strategies to undertake some localised auditing of how schools deal with bullying. The National Strategies are identifying secondary schools with weak or ineffective anti-bullying policies and practice.

 We believe that individual schools are best placed to decide the arrangements which should be put in place to meet the needs of their pupils; if a school decides to provide a counselling service, it is free to choose an external provider or directly to provide the service on an &#145;in-house&#146; basis.

This should be done in line with their plan for rolling out extended schools which they will have drawn up in discussion with all their schools. Lancashire has received &#163;3,531,061 in 2006-07 and &#163;4,515,291 in 2007-08. We do not break down funding by parliamentary constituency.</p>

 It is inaccurate to say the police cannot take fingerprints or DNA from individuals on control orders. Section 1 (3) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act allows for the imposition of any obligations that the Secretary of State or the court considers necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by that individual in terrorism-related activity. The Government could therefore make the provision of fingerprints or DNA an obligation under a control order, if it was considered necessary and proportionate to do so. Moreover, powers to take fingerprints are governed by other legislation, such as PACE. If, for example, an individual committed an offence while subject to a control order, fingerprints and DNA could be taken in the usual way.</p>

This will provide the same police powers to retain, store and use the DMA and fingerprints of individuals on control orders and will mean that the procedures and safeguards that generally apply, also apply in control order cases.</p>

This does not include the costs of mounting an enforcement operation, but is based on the time it would take an officer to deal with the offence, such as dealing with the offender, arranging recovery of the vehicle and supervising the event.

 We published the &#145;Review of the Protection of Children from Sex Offenders&#146; on 13 June. The review lists a number of actions to be taken, including providing for registered sex offenders to be required to notify the police of their e-mail addresses. This information could then be used to help with the management of offenders. In the review, we also recognised the need to develop the capability to monitor the online activities of child sex offenders, and we will investigate the possibility of developing software to install on offenders&#146; computers to do this.</p>

 Decisions on cautioning are entirely an operational matter for local police forces. Serious sexual offences are very unlikely to be suitable for a caution. In a small number of cases local police and CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to take a case to court (e.g. where a 16-year-old boy has consensual sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend).</p>

 It is not possible to estimate the number of drivers falsely accused of motoring offences because of the fraudulent cloning of number plates; the number of drivers falsely accused of motoring offences due to inaccuracies in automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) databases or the number of motoring offences that the police have been unable to pursue due to inaccuracies in the ANPR database as these figures are not collected centrally. ANPR is used as the starting point to investigate offences and is not in itself used to press charges or comment on prosecutions.</p>

 Since the first Home Office pilot began in 2002, the police use of ANPR technology has resulted in more than 50,000 arrests; ANPR has now been rolled out across all police forces in England and Wales. Significantly, in the last three years it has delivered two to three times more &#145;offences brought to justice' (OBtJ) when compared to conventional policing methods. Much of this success is attributable to police intercept teams operating at the roadside although more recently, the benefits of ANPR as a police-intelligence and investigation tool has been realised by its ability to identify vehicles linked to many different types of criminal offending. It has consistently impacted on criminal activity at all levels, but particularly that involving drugs, cross-border crime and disqualified driving. With the help of new enabling-legislation, police ANPR intercept teams have been extremely effective in seizing vehicles for document offences.</p>

It is now seeking to embed the learning from the ANPR pilots into mainstream policing practice within police forces.</p>

 All data gathered by the police using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is covered by existing legislation. Home Office officials have been working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to ensure that information collected by ANPR technologies and retained by the police is cognisant of the relevant data protection legislation. The ACPO guidance is designed to ensure that the principles detailed in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are followed by all police forces.</p>

 The provision of services to detainees at Yarl&#146;s Wood Removal Centre is subject to self audit by Serco which operates the centre under contract to the Border and Immigration Agency. The self audit process is in turn audited by Border and Immigration Agency staff and is subject to routine monitoring and scrutiny by the Border and Immigration Agency managers in the site monitoring team. There is also an Independent Monitoring Board that has unrestricted access to the centre 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, and also has direct access to the Secretary of State&#146;s office. The establishment is also subject to regular inspection by Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons. Whenever issues arise concerning the provision of services including those listed in the question, both the on site Border and Immigration Agency staff and the contractor are committed to resolving concerns and improving systems accordingly. Since 26 April 2007 Serco has only received one complaint, this was in relation to the availability of telephone and fax services, and this was addressed immediately.</p>
