<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50207w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We do not hold bovine TB surveillance data for individual constituencies. However TB data is available for Leicestershire. At the end of November 2004 there were 3,187 registered cattle herds in the county. Of these, 49 herds (1.5 per cent.) were under restriction at some point between 1 January and 30 November 2004. There were 36 new herd TB incidents during this period, of which 13 have been confirmed to date (three remain unclassified). TB surveillance data for Leicestershire is published each month on Defra&#039;s website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/index.htm.

<a name="stpa_0">The level of bovine TB in Leicestershire is low in comparison to some other areas of the country, e.g. South West England. We realise the importance of preventing the risk of TB spreading to new areas and that is why we introduced new measures at the end of 2004, e.g. changes to testing frequency and the imposition of movement restrictions immediately a test becomes overdue.

she has made of the savings to UK public funds of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy since their introduction in 2003.  [213130]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50207w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The UK contributes to the EU budget as a whole rather than to individual elements, and it is not therefore possible to make precise estimates of savings to UK public funds following the reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy. However, increased financial discipline and setting the CAP budget until 2013 will limit the burden that the CAP places on taxpayers. Cross-compliance and modulation of direct payments into agri-environment schemes means that a greater proportion of public funds are now delivering better value for society by buying public goods not readily provided by the market. The Government will continue to press for further reforms which reduce the cost to taxpayers of the Common Agricultural Policy.

<i>[holding answer 3 February 2005]:</i> Iwill reply to the hon. Member as soon as possible.

The position set out in the letter, regarding the management of under 10 vessels through producer organisations (POs), was changed following a review of the operation of the FQA system in consultation with industry in 2000&#150;02. As a result of that review Fisheries Departments decided that under 10 metre vessels should, for the first time, be permitted to fish against sectoral&quot; quota allocations managed by POs as an alternative to fishing against the pool&quot; quota allocations for the under 10 metre fleet which are managed by Fisheries Departments in consultation with industry. The owners of the small proportion of under 10 metre vessels who elect to fish against PO allocations are required to complete EU logbooks and submit landing declarations in the same way as vessels over 10metres.

authorities about this shortly. We are encouraging them to actively promote understanding and greater use of national parks by all sections of society, especially people with disabilities, people from ethnic minorities, the inner cities and young people. We want our national parks to be appreciated fully by all sections of society as truly national assets. Defra and the Department for Education and Skills are working with national park authorities to develop initiatives to meet this aim. I also emphasised the Government&#039;s position on this policy of inclusion at a meeting with national park authorities on sustainable tourism in June 2003 so they have been aware of it for some time. I have also made clear that these ends can be achieved without excluding existing users groups and that we will encourage increased engagement of volunteers in meeting national park purposes.

An action plan will be published next year. In addition, many park authorities were involved in the Mosaic Project set up by the Council for National Parks and the Black Environment Network in 2001 to enable people from black and ethnic minorities to experience the parks at first hand. The Council for National Parks recently secured lottery funding to develop this project further over the next three years.

 Our policy is to expand interest in national parks so that they are understood by all communities, as intended, as a genuinely natural asset. Initiatives like the Mosaic project have successfully engaged members of Asian and Black communities in the attractions of visiting several national parks, but there is a long way to go. From my own experience as a youth worker in Wales and from visits to English national parks in the past nine years, I can testify to the value and impact of such visits on inner city youngsters in particular.

Also each national park has a sustainable development fund of &#163;200,000 per year to encourage innovation with a particular emphasis on linking the concept of sustainable development to the national parks and engaging people&#151;particularly young people&#151;from urban and rural areas in joint projects in the national park.

<p>
<a name="50207w03.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_11">Even with these additional resources the pressures on each national park is considerable.

The introduction, later this year, of a streamlined Comprehensive Performance Assessment and Best Value regime for the national park authorities will help to identify priorities and improve cost-effectiveness.

At local level the Government requires local authority to review and assess air quality locally and take actions (such as for example by using their traffic management powers) in cooperation with others if necessary, if they are unlikely to meet air quality objectives such as those for nitrogen dioxide; The Governments Air Quality Strategy and Guidance for Local Authority on Local Air Quality Management, including on local action planning, can be found at www.defra.gov.uk.

 In all its humanitarian responses, DFID works to ensure that the activities of the humanitarian community are informed by a solid analysis of the specific needs of the affected population.

Following the Indian Ocean disaster, DFID has channelled &#163;400,000 through the Save the Children Fund and &#163;2,250,000 through the United Nations Children Fund to support orphans and other vulnerable children.

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="50207w05.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK Government are Rwanda&#039;s major bilateral development partner. Our engagement with the Government of Rwanda is based on the UK/Rwanda Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU describes the Government of Rwanda&#039;s commitments to the Rwandan people on poverty reduction, promoting regional stability, creating a democratic and inclusive state, and progressively securing human rights. The Government of Rwanda&#039;s undertakings include commitment to playing a full part in international and regional initiatives to prevent and reduce conflict within and between countries and establish peace in central Africa.

<a name="stpa_39">DFID is concerned by reports that Rwanda planned to mount a cross-border operation in DRC against elements of the ex-FAR and the Interahamwe (ex-FAR/l). Any military action by Rwanda in DRC would have very serious repercussions for Rwanda, DRC and the region as a whole. DFID has urged all parties to refrain from any actions that would breach international law and undermine regional stability and the work of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC). We therefore welcome the recent statements by the Government of Rwanda indicating that they will not pursue cross-border military action and will support international efforts to disarm the ex-FAR/l in eastern DRC.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50207w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 A survey conducted by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in 2003 established that 75.2 per cent. of the address details held on its driving licence database were correct in every detail. The corresponding figure for its vehicle database was 85.6 per cent. The main cause of error was motorists&#039; failure to notify DVLA that they had changed address and 18 per cent. of driving licence holders and 7 per cent. of vehicle keepers had failed to do so. This means that DVLA&#039;s records were sufficiently up-to-date to allow law enforcement agencies to trace vehicle keepers in over 92 per cent. of cases.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="50207w09.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 It is not appropriate to provide anonymity for people accused of crime for a number of reasons. The principle that criminal trials should take place in open court and be freely reported is one of the key foundations of our criminal justice system. The fact that the system is open and transparent, and that the media is able to report freely what has taken place publicly in court, helps ensure public confidence in the system and helps encourage victims and witnesses to come forward. Also anonymity would raise important principles of the freedom of the press and the public interest. Publicity can work to an accused person&#039;s advantage: by helping him or her gather support and bringing to light evidence in his or her behalf. Equally there have been examples of responsible investigative journalism bringing to light cases of serious abuse that might otherwise have gone undetected.

 The United Kingdom takes very seriously the need to respect Iraq&#039;s cultural heritage. We are not aware of any assessments identifying damage done to sites of archaeological and historical significance by the British Army in Iraq. We have, however, taken a number of steps to minimise the risk. This includes being a signatory to the 1977 Additional Protocol (AP1) of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Under the terms of AP1, civilian objects are to be protected from attack unless that object is being used for military purposes, in which case it may lose its special protected status. An aide memoire is also issued to all UK service personnel deploying under Operation Telic, which reminds service personnel of their obligation under AP1. The leaflet contains a pictorial example of the protective emblem that can be used under the Hague Cultural Property Convention 1954, to which Iraq is a full signatory, to denote buildings used for religion, art, science, charity, historical monuments, or other important cultural sites. During the combat phase of Operation Telic, legal advisors briefed commanders deploying to theatre about the importance of protecting cultural property. Further guidance was, and continues to be available in the rules of engagement and the targeting directive.

The remaining 40 per cent. have been sent for materials recycling.

 The creation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) offers a unique opportunity to sustain and expand existing voluntary sector work with offenders, while opening up the prospect of new areas for partnership and engagement with the voluntary and community sector.

The work of the Unit will be overseen by an independently chaired Advisory Group drawn from the voluntary sector, prisons and probation. A voluntary sector representative has been appointed to the NOMS Board, voluntary groups are included in the working group on Offender Management and proposals are being developed for a voluntary sector stakeholder group to help develop the mixed economy of provision for NOMS.

It does not have statutory responsibilities in relation to mayoral referendums or local issues referendums under the Local Government Act 2003.

In July 2002 the Electoral Commission issued a statement regarding the possibility of elections to the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, and English local government elections, being combined with a referendum on the adoption of the single currency. In February 2004, it responded to the ODPM&#039;s consultation on combining regional and local referendums and on local referendum rules.

<p>
<a name="50207w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_154">On both occasions, the Commission expressed concerns about the possibility of combination, reflecting its view that on balance it is disadvantageous for elections to be combined with referendums.

<sup>(25)</sup>2004&#150;05 actuals are only available to December 2004. The estimated figure, for the financial year 2004&#150;05, is based on the actual spend to December 2004.<br>

1.PFI costs relating to a major computer system (Causeway Programme) within the department are not included in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05.<br>

2.The increases from 1996&#150;97 to 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 can be mainly explained by expenditure on consultants in the following areas which were not applicable in 1996&#150;97:<br>

the introduction of the findings of the Criminal Justice Review resulting in expenditure on consultancy by the Public Prosecution Service;<br>

review of the Electoral System in NI; and<br>

This compensation offer ensures that every business with a compensatable interest will receive the market value of their property interest and will also receive payments in respect of costs incurred in relocating their business, including any loss of profits directly attributable to the relocation. All of these payments will be made as though the property had been compulsorily acquired, even though no compulsory purchase order is currently in place and there is no obligation to offer compensation on this basis.

Notes:<br>

1.The prescription information is from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, from the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispenses in the community, ie by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, 



Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.<br>

2.The average number of blood glucose monitoring strips per PCT has been calculated by dividing the total number of strips by 303 (the number of PCTs). It is not a weighted average and hence does not take into account PCT populations, or number of registered patients per PCT. PCTs came into existence in October 2002. For consistency, the average number of strips per PCT has used the current 303 PCTs for all five years.<br>

3.Blood glucose monitoring strips are defined within the British National Formulary (BNF) paragraph 6.1.6 Diagnostic and monitoring agents for diabetes mellitus&quot;.<br>

4.More information on prescriptions dispensed in the community in England are available at: http://www.publications.doh.gov.uk/prescriptionstatistics/index.htm<br>

<p><a name="qnpa_36">(2) what percentage of dentists in London stopped taking NHS patients in each year since 1997, broken down by parliamentary constituency.  [213546]</p>








<p><a name="st_324"><a name="50207w34.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The majority of dental practices treat both private and national health service patients under an open&quot; contract with a primary care trust. The Office of Fair Trading report The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, published in March 2003 estimated that out of 11,000 dental practices about 210 are private. The table shows by London constituency the numbers of dentists who stopped doing general or personal dental service work in England and Wales during the year as a percentage of the total number of dentists for the years 1997 to 2004. These figures do not include dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing NHS work for a number of different reasons, for example, retirement or to take a short-term absence, apart from the reason that the dentist only wished to treat private patients. New contractual arrangements, which we are to introduce by April 2006, are intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dentists.

<p><a name="st_349"><a name="50207w37.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s modernisation of the national health service, underpinned by a sustained investment programme, is delivering more staff, faster treatment, more hospitals, a new focus on quality and, crucially, more choice for patients. Coupled with an increase in the NHS budget from &#163;43.9 billion in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;69 billion in 2004&#150;05 has come an increased devolution of power and responsibility to the front line NHS: 80 per cent. of the NHS budget in England is now devolved to local primary care trusts (PCTs), and central targets have been dramatically reduced to give the local NHS in rural and urban areas alike the headroom to address local priorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">The Government have therefore given PCTs in rural areas the resources and the authority to make a difference locally and address rural needs. At the national level the Department is committed to rural proofing policies so that they take into account the needs of people living in rural areas. To further support the rural proofing agenda, last year the Government incorporated the rural proofing checklist within the regulatory impact assessment framework, thus ensuring that new policies are screened for their impact on rural communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">The Department also supports rural health initiatives through grants to the voluntary sector. The Department has funded the Institute of Rural Health since 2001. The Institute is currently working on two projects (i) the rural health forum project which provides a regular interface between Government Departments and health providers at national, regional and local levels, and (ii)a rural proofing toolkit which will help PCTs and policy makers identify the health needs of residents in rural areas and help incorporate those needs into policy making at a strategic level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">The Department has also taken specific actions to help patients living with stress and mental health problems in rural areas.

<a name="stpa_275">Research was commissioned to establish the general levels of awareness of council tax benefit and to identify the effect of the publicity campaign. The research was conducted at both pre and post stages of the publicity activity. Overall, the research suggested that this activity had a positive effect in raising levels of awareness among our primary target audience of pensioners. Those respondents aged 65 plus were more likely than other age groups to have seen or heard something about paying less council tax, and this increased from 19 per cent. at the pre-publicity stage to 29 per cent. at the post-publicity stage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w39.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_276">In a recent survey, over 90 per cent. of authorities that responded said that they had introduced initiatives that overlapped with, or were as a result of, the council tax benefit campaign. And around two thirds of authorities said that this had resulted in an overall increase in case load.
