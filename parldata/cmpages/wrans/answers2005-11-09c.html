 Implementation of proper labour standards can play an important part in reducing poverty. DFID is supporting a range of activities to improve the treatment of workers in developing countries, including the elimination of child labour and trafficking for forced labour. Our support is primarily given through the International Labour Organisation. But we also support the work of non-governmental organisations, trade unions and business, for example through the Ethical Trading Initiative.

 The situation remains critical. More and continuing assistance is needed.

The focus of the plan is an emergency shelter programme, medical evacuations, pre-positioning of food assistance for 700,000 and the maintenance of mobile health units and vaccination services. Additionally, site planning and construction of 30 camps, repair of vital damaged water supply systems

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51109w03.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The primary responsibility for the protection of vulnerable people lies with their Government. This was endorsed at the 2005 Millennium Review Summit, to which the Government of Sudan was party. The UK Government continues to press the Government of Sudan on its responsibilities in Darfur, and we press all parties to abide by their commitments they have made. We have done this both directly to the Government of Sudan, and in our role as EU presidency. The UK also played a leading role in securing six recent UN Security Council Resolutions on Sudan, including resolutions 1591 and 1593, which extended the Darfur arms embargo to cover the Government of Sudan, allowed targeted sanctions on individuals responsible for the worst abuses, and referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_14">The African Union (AU) mission in Darfur is also playing an important role in protecting the people of Darfur. Despite the recent worrying upsurge in violence in Darfur, including the attack on the Aro Sharow camp on 28 September, attacks on civilians have decreased where the AU is deployed. DFID welcomes the ongoing expansion of the force to more than 7,700. The UK has provided &#163;32 million to support the AU mission since its inception. The EU has provided &#8364;92 million (&#163;63 million) so far, and has recently committed a further &#8364;70 million (&#163;48 million).

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51109w03.html_spnew5"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The overall number of abattoirs has declined dramatically in Britain in the last few decades, reflecting an increase in slaughtering capacity in fewer and larger abattoirs. Much of this has been due to logistic requirements of the major supermarket chains. Regulatory impacts of measures to improve food safety have also played a part. Some businesses, particularly in older premises, may be faced with investment costs if they are to continue to comply with EU-wide standards for hygienic production.

 The survival of avian influenza viruses in the environment will be influenced by the strain of the virus, whether they are held in water or faeces, the host from which the faeces came, the physical properties of the faeces and the ambient temperature.

<a name="stpa_27">Through English Nature, we have provided &#163;76,000 to Gateshead council for a &#039;Wildspace&#039; project, including a community liaison officer, which has resulted in five new local nature reserves (LNRs) being designated in the east of the borough, and the project has involved local people in caring for and enjoying the sites. Regular litter removal and maintenance of entrances and paths has ensured they appear well managed and welcoming. Along with management plans for the sites, this is maximising biodiversity, and there is a strategy to secure long term gains for local people. Due to the success of the project, Gateshead council have continued to employ the officer to carry on the good work.

Given the requirement in the EC regulations to define GAEC to reflect the specific character of the areas concerned including the condition of the land, environmental conditions and agricultural activity, it is to be expected that a variety of standards will have been set within the EU.

Where trams are promoted, they will need to be developed as part of an integrated approach to tackling an area&#039;s problems, and they will need to be supported by commitments to complementary measures to deliver the benefits of increased public transport usage and reduced congestion. We will continue to work closely with promoters and the industry to seek to ensure that these benefits can be realised, and that the costs of tram systems are minimised and properly controlled.

<a name="51109w15.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_106">During 2004&#150;05, the Department relocated 12 posts from London to Hastings and 25 posts from London to Derby. The work of a further 10 posts was dispersed from London to VOSA staff located outside the South East, making a 2004&#150;05 total of 47 posts.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps the Government is taking to ensure people have access to effective public transport, with particular reference to rural communities.  [25903]</p>








<p><a name="st_124"><a name="51109w15.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 We are working with the bus industry and local authorities to ensure that all communities have the effective bus services they need. The Bus Partnership Forum brings together senior representatives of the industry, central and local government to find practical ways of improving local bus services. The forum has, for example, published guidance on improving the punctuality of bus services and has encouraged bus operators and local authorities to form local punctuality improvement partnerships to help bring about improvements in performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_107">Local and central Government provides funding of over &#163;1.6 billion annually to support bus services. This includes &#163;53 million this year provided by the Department in the form of Rural Bus Subsidy Grant to assist local authorities to support bus services in rural areas. Since 1998 we have also allocated a total of &#163;110 million to 300 rural transport projects under the Rural Bus Challenge scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_108">On 1 November we announced Kickstart&quot; support, totalling &#163;20 million, for 43 projects involving new and improved bus services which will become viable through growth in passenger numbers after an initial period of pump-priming from Government funds. 11 of these schemes will serve areas which are mainly rural in character.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w15.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_109">Finally, we are expecting all local transport authorities to include accessibility strategies in their next Local Transport Plans, due in March next year. These strategies should be based on evidence and analysis of the problems people face in accessing jobs and essential services and facilities. They should include consideration of the accessibility and availability of local public transport. Our guidance to authorities makes clear that the strategies should take account of the particular needs of rural communities.

<a name="stpa_111">With regard to rail, 16 new four-coach Class 333 electric trains have been introduced on the Airedale and Wharfedale lines, which have seen a significant increase in patronage. This success story has helped rail patronage in West Yorkshire to rise from 16.3 million passengers in 1999&#150;2000 to 21.1 million in 2004&#150;05, an increase of 30 per cent. The new TransPennine franchise began in February 2004. It will deliver more than &#163;250 million worth of investment, with a brand new fleet of 50 trains due to be introduced in 2006. Also benefiting Leeds and West Yorkshire is a 44 per cent. increase in East Coast main line services since 1996&#151;currently 53 services per day, rising to 66 services per day in December 2007.

 Since the implementation of the Utilities Act 2000 licensing schemes and standard licence conditions in October 2001, Ofgem has had the power to appoint a Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) for all customers, domestic and non-domestic, in both the gas and electricity markets. This power is essential to ensure that all of a failed supplier&#039;s customers have continuity of supply.

For customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be less than 73,200 kWh the authority can direct a supplier to be a SoLR. For customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be between 73,200 kWh and 2,196,000 kWh the authority can only direct a supplier to be a SoLR with that supplier&#039;s consent. There is no provision for appointing a SoLR (by consent or otherwise) for customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be more than 2,196,000 kWh.

A SoLR&#039;s deemed contract must also allow for its termination when the customer chooses to take a supply from another supplier.

 The information requested is not recorded centrally and could be obtained only by an examination of individual case records.

Failed asylum seekers who have children in their household generally retain access to regular NASS support provided under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and have no need to seek section 4 support. Access to section 95 support is only usually lost if they fail to comply with removal directions or fail to take steps to leave the United Kingdom voluntarily and therefore fall to be considered under the provisions of section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.

 The general position is that failed asylum seekers are no longer entitled to access free NHS healthcare.

Failed asylum seekers who have been discharged from compulsory detention under the Mental Health Act 1983 are entitled to receive continuing residential support in the community. Failed asylum seekers with mental health problems, identified as in need of care and attention as a result of being destitute, may be supported by the local authority under the National Assistance Act 1948.

Note:<br>

The statistics of court proceedings are based on returns made by the police to the Home Office&#039;s Data Collection Group. Although these include offences where there have been no police involvement such as those prosecutions instigated by Government Departments (in this case DVLA) and private organisations and individuals, the reporting of these types of offences is known to be incomplete. Moreover, it is thought that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings, in particular those relating to motoring offences and to TV licence evasion may also be less than complete; the extent of under-reporting may vary from year to year and this could be responsible in part for the annual variations.<br>

 Apart from the National Museums and Galleries, The Department for Culture, Media and Sport does not allocate funding directly to any of our sectors. Instead money allocated to us by Parliament is channelled through our various non-departmental public bodies who are responsible for deciding how and where it is spent. For instance Arts Council England, East has allocated &#163;184,339 to the Old Town Hall in Hemel Hempstead over the last eight years. Similarly between 1995 and 1999 English Heritage allocated &#163;92,108 to the constituency and a proportion of its &#163;170,618 in strategic grants to Hertfordshire would also have benefited the town. According to the Department&#039;s Lottery Award database (using information supplied by the Lottery distributors) a total of just over &#163;8 million in lottery has been awarded to Hemel Hempstead since 1997.

 The sixth round of the inter-Sudanese peace talks on Darfur concluded on 20 October. Overall, the parties engaged more constructively than in previous rounds and some progress was made. All three areas identified for inclusion in a final peace agreement, power sharing, wealth sharing and security arrangements, were discussed. The parties agreed two out of the nine agenda items for negotiations on power sharing, adopted the agenda for wealth sharing negotiations to begin at the next round and held informal consultations on security arrangements.

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) prosecutes a substantial number of cases, a proportion of which are abandoned. It is not known how many may have been abandoned in error.

<p>
<a name="51109w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_244">Since April 2004, the CPS has recorded the reason for each decision to abandon proceedings on its Compass Case Management System. The attached table gives information drawn from the system for 2004&#150;05 and for 2005&#150;06 to date, showing outcome reasons numerically, and expressing each as a proportion of all cases completed during the year. Also shown are the number and proportion of cases acquitted by the courts, and the number and proportion resulting in conviction.

<a name="51109w31.html_para3">

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109w31.html_para4">

<a name="51109w31.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_247">It will also be seen that substantial numbers of cases are dropped unavoidably: for example where the victim, or another witness, refuses to give evidence, or fails to attend court, where key legal elements arc missing from the prosecution case; or where there is a conflict of evidence.

 Applications are dealt with by local authorities and the information requested is not held centrally. The target turn round for all applications for student support is six weeks.

The LSC is embarking upon a major transformation programme that will make it a smaller, more dynamic and more customer-focused organisation. This will build upon its existing strengths; further develop its relationships with providers and with its partners, and help push the highest proportion of its funding out through colleges and providers into front line delivery. At local level, the LSC will develop small teams of professional staff who will support the delivery of its priority objectives through strategic relationships with colleges, providers and other key stakeholders and so ensure that the needs of local employers and learners are met. I fully support the changes the LSC is making as I believe it will help bring about an organisation that is fit for purpose.

<a name="stpa_298">The support received by employers, via the pilots, was mainly indirect with payments going to a skills broker, learning provider and Information, Advice and Guidance adviser, rather than directly to the employer. However in some, though not all, pilots employers did receive a wage compensation payment aimed at reimbursing them for the time their participating employees spent on training. The rate of wage compensation varied between pilots, from between zero to 150 of pay, but averaged &#163;260 per learner. Based on an average of eight learners per employer over the period of the pilots, the average payment received per employer for wage compensation equates to &#163;2,080. From Phase 3 of the Pilots (September 2004), employers only receive wage compensation for time off actually taken when a learner successfully completes their learning.

<sup>(21)</sup> Only schools open for the whole of the financial year are included in the analysis. The number of schools in each authority used in the calculation of the mean and deciles is also provided as each authority has varying numbers of primary and secondary schools which should be borne in mind when interpreting these deciles&#151;as a decile for an authority with very few schools can be somewhat meaningless.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> City of London local authority have one primary school and zero secondary schools. On the 1 April 2002 Isles of Scilly amalgamated all their maintained primary and secondary schools into one school which is treated as a primary school for the purposes of Section 52.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup> The lower decile budget share (plus grants) per pupil is calculated such that 10 per cent. of schools within that authority have per pupil figures below this amount. Similarly, the upper decile amount has 90 per cent. of schools within the authority receiving less than figure.<br>





<sup>(24)</sup> The mean amount for an authority is calculated as the sum of all that authority&#039;s primary or secondary schools budget share plus grants divided by the total number of pupils at the primary or secondary schools within that authority.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Budget share (plus grants) is the combination of the schools individual budget share plus any devolved standards fund and Excellence in Cities (EiC) grants allocated to the school. In 2005&#150;06 the Schools Standards Grant is also included and this contributed &#163;856 million to the money allocated to primary and secondary schools in England.<br>

2. The amount of money delegated to schools depends very much on the individual local authorities own policy for funding their schools. Different authority&#039;s retain varying amounts of funding centrally to spend on behalf of their schools while others chose to give schools more autonomy over how they spend their money by devolving more funding to the individual school.<br>

3. The pupil numbers used to calculate the per pupil amounts are as reported by the local authority on their section 52 budget statement comprising the full time equivalent number pupils registered at the school used for the initial determination of the school&#039;s budget share under the local authority&#039;s allocation formula.<br>

4. Figures are taken from section 52 budget 2005&#150;06 as reported by LEAs and rounded to the nearest 10. <br>

Our recent White Paper Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot; set out our plans for a new professionalism&quot; for teachers, in which career progression and financial rewards will go to those who make the biggest impact on pupil progress and those who show commitment to their own professional development and that of their colleagues. A thorough reform of all teachers&#039; professional standards, with more stretch at every level, will set out what can be expected of teachers at each stage in their career. More effective performance development&#151;which includes performance management&#151;will help focus teachers on effective classroom practice and ensure that they are involved in the professional development that best meets their personal needs and the specific needs of the school and its pupils.

The Department funds the Centre for Research on the Wider Benefits of Learning (WBL) which produced a report and developed a model of the inter-generational transmission of educational success in 2004. The WBL report concluded that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_167">parental education is a major influence both directly and via other channels such as income and parenting skills. However, there are many other important elements&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_326">These other factors include pre-school, neighbourhoods and schools which can mitigate or offset the impact of family level factors in a substantial way. Parental beliefs, values, aspirations and attitudes, as well as parental well-being, have an independent effect on pupil attainment. Parental skills in terms of warmth, discipline and education behaviours are all major factors in the formation of school success. These behaviours can be adopted by parents no matter what their background. (http://www.learningbenefits.net/Publications/ResReps/ResRep10.pdf).

<a name="stpa_327">Another influential report commissioned by the Department and published in 2003 reviewed a large number of studies on the impact of parental involvement, parental support and parental education on pupil achievement. The review confirmed the importance of maternal education on child outcomes. However, the authors noted that when effects such as parental education and income were controlled the findings show that what parents do is as important as who they are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_168">parental involvement in the form of &#039;at-home good parenting&#039; has a significant positive effect on children&#039;s achievement and adjustment even after all other factors shaping attainment have been taken out of the equation&quot;.</p>

 We aim to support such parents through the development of Sure Start with 3,500 children&#039;s centres planned by 2010. All centres will provide information, advice and support for parents. Those in the most disadvantaged areas will provide more intensive programmes of family support and parental outreach. These services can help parents to access the wide range of courses in further and adult education designed to help people attain the platform of employability through improving their language, literacy and numeracy skills and studying for a full level 2 qualification (equivalent to five GCSEs at A*-C). Help is also available through family learning programmes funded by the Learning and Skills Council with budgets in 2005/06 of &#163;37 million. As part of this, extended schools can offer family learning sessions to enable children and parents to learn alongside each other. Adults from low socio-economic groups, including parents, are already eligible for a wide

 Departmental data shows that schools with higher levels of permanent exclusions tend to have lower levels of attainment and that young people who have been excluded from school also have lower levels of attainment. For example, only one in five young people who was reported as having been excluded from school in years 10 or 11, permanently or for a fixed period, achieved 5 A*-C GCSEs compared to almost three in five young people who had not been excluded. However, a direct causal link between exclusion and attainment has not been established.

<a name="stpa_338">As well as having lower levels of attainment, in general schools with higher rates of permanent exclusion also tend to have higher percentages of pupils who are eligible for free school meals. However, there is a lot of variation at individual school level. Data from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that children who have been temporarily excluded from school are more likely to come from lone-parent families or from families where both parents are working less than 15 hours per week.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if she will instruct the Health Protection Agency to carry out an audit of waiting times for genito-urinary medicines services.  [23962]</p>








<p><a name="st_406"><a name="51109w45.html_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Department commissioned the Health Protection Agency in 2004 to undertake a bi-annual, and now quarterly, audit of waiting times in genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics. The latest data, from a survey undertaken in May 2005, show that 45 per cent. of patients are seen within 48 hours at GUM clinics. Primary care trusts and strategic health authorities have already developed plans on how they will meet the target of 48-hour access through the local delivery planning process. To support this, the Department is investing an additional &#163;130 million for GUM services and infrastructure in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 to enable clinics to expand their services and reduce waiting times. An additional &#163;15 million capital funding has also been recently allocated.
