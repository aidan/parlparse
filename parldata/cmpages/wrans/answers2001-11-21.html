 Clergy in office are provided with a house and are paid a stipend. In retirement, however, they must meet their own housing costs. The derivation of the formula for the pension and retirement lump sum takes this into account.
<P>

<a name="11121w01.html_para0">Actual arrangement of retirement housing is a matter for the individual, who may purchase a property (if necessary with the aid of a mortgage obtained in the market) or rent. The Church offers, through the Pensions Board and supported by investment capital provided by the Church Commissioners, a scheme of housing assistance which widens the choice available. Subject to

the circumstances of the individual, a value-linked mortgage loan may be granted to enable accommodation to be purchased, or a property owned by the Board can be occupied in return for payment of maintenance contributions.
<P>

<a name="11121w01.html_para1">The Archbishops' Council has recently conducted a review of clergy stipends and the General Synod has agreed that the report should be sent to dioceses for consultation. A copy of the review group's report "Generosity and Sacrifice" (GS 1408) is available in the House of Commons Library. It includes the recommendation that the Pensions Board, the Church Commissioners, dioceses and clergy charities consider the possibility of finding sufficient capital for loans to clergy to enable them to make provision for retirement housing in advance of retirement by lending them the money for a deposit on a house, the mortgage for which could be funded by renting out the property. The Commissioners will give consideration to this in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement on the Churchwardens Measure.  [16296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The Churchwardens Measure 2001 provides a comprehensive set of rules about the appointment of churchwardens and their tenure of office, building on earlier legislation. Most of the Measure has caused no controversy, and the draft provisions about which the Ecclesiastical Committee expressed concern, relating to the possible suspension of a churchwarden from exercising his or her duties, were deleted by the General Synod and form no part of the Measure.
<P>

<a name="11121w01.html_para2">The Measure will come into force on 1 January 2002, and will apply to the elections of churchwardens at the annual meetings held in parishes from 2002 onwards. A good deal of information about the new rules has already been published and more guidance will be issued before the Measure comes into force.
<P>

<a name="11121w01.html_para3">The new rule that a churchwarden may not serve for more than six years without a break is laid down in the Measure as the norm, but the parishioners of an individual parish will be free to decide that the rule is not to apply in their case. As the six years will not start to run until the Measure comes into force, there will be ample time for every parish to consider the matter and reach its own decision.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The principal functions of the Administrator of Railtrack plc are set out in section 59 of the Railways Act 1993 and the Insolvency Act 1986, as applied by Schedule 6 to the Railways Act 1993. The timetable of the administration process is a matter for the Administrator. Once the administration process is complete, it will be clear what value is available for disbursement to its shareholder, Railtrack Group plc. Disbursement of Railtrack Group plc's assets is a matter for the Board of that company.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Railtrack's May 2001 Network Management Statement identifies the projects on which the company was working and expected completion dates.

<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Administration process is at a very early stage and any estimate of the cash needs of Railtrack plc in administration would be purely speculative.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the average daily rate of <i>(a)</i> loss (PBT) and <i>(b)</i> cash outflow at Railtrack plc in administration has been since 5 October.  [16360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Administrator. The premature release of unaudited financial information may prejudice the Administrator's orderly release of commercially sensitive information in detailed discussions with potential bidders for Railtrack plc.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what investment expenditure was planned for the period from the end of September to 31 March <i>(a)</i> 2002 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03 by Railtrack plc prior to being placed in administration.  [16359]<P>
<P>
<P>

 Railtrack's investment plans were outlines in its Network Management Statement published in May 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if the <i>(a)</i> Board and <i>(b)</i> auditors of Railtrack sought a letter of comfort concerning payments to Railtrack Group and plc before the directors and auditors signed the accounts for 2000&#150;01 on a going concern basis; and if the Government granted such a request.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2001 : Column: 291W</I><P>
assessment he has made of the impact on the environment of exhaust fumes produced by the use of chainsaws.  [16148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 UK emissions modelling suggests that small petrol-powered off-road equipment accounts for 2.1 per cent. of UK hydrocarbon emissions with chainsaws accounting for only a small part of this. However, the European Commission estimates the significance of emissions from these machines to be much greater. The Commission estimates small off-road petrol engines to produce 6.5 per cent. of EU hydrocarbon emissions with chainsaws accounting for approximately half of this figure.
<P>

<a name="11121w04.html_para0">Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of ground level ozone, which is harmful to human health and, in addition, certain hydrocarbons are carcinogenic. Despite the low significance of total hydrocarbon emissions from this sector of machinery, individual machines are high emitters. It is therefore desirable to reduce emissions from them as far as practical, not only to benefit the environment, but also to reduce operator exposure to carcinogenic emissions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of draft EU regulations relating to catalytic converters on chainsaws; and if he will make a statement on the impact of such regulations on the arboricultural industry.  [16149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The amendment would regulate, for the first time, emissions from small, off-road petrol engines, such as those used in lawnmowers, chainsaws etc, by means of two stages of emissions limits. Compliance with the Stage 2 limits may require adoption of oxidation catalysts on two-stroke engines (typically used in handheld equipment such as chainsaws). Where machines must be compact and lightweight it may be difficult to accommodate catalysts; 'tree-service' or 'top-handled' chainsaws as used by arboriculturists are a case in point.
<P>

<a name="11121w04.html_para1">The UK has campaigned vigorously for derogations for these machines to give industry the time they need to develop alternative emissions control technology. At their first readings of the proposal, both the European Parliament and the Council adopted a clause requiring the Commission to review whether all applications of handheld engines could meet Stage 2 limits and, if not, set derogations of up to five years where appropriate. The Commission have made a written declarations that this review will specifically consider chainsaws.

Failure to do so is a criminal offence which carries a maximum fine on conviction of &#163;1,000. Offenders are given the opportunity to settle out of court on payment of a penalty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what effects environmental conditions had on Army and Fleet Air Arm helicopters during Exercise Saif Sareea 2; and if he will make a statement.  [16556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w05.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Equipment reliability and availability during Saif Sareea 2 was affected by the desert environment, particularly the hot temperatures and flying dust. A number of equipment enhancement measures were implemented, such as sand filters and polyurethane self-adhesive tape on rotor blades which, together with an upgraded maintenance programme, combined to ensure that the helicopter fleet performed well in the environment.

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has no immediate plans to change the normal process of recruitment for Defence Fire Service (DFS) firefighters at locations where a requirement to fill vacancies has been identified. Currently, vacancies are managed at unit level and are filled either by internal level transfer, or where this is not possible, by external recruitment. Although temporary recruitment restrictions may occur from time to time under certain circumstances, the MOD intends to continue recruiting as normal until the outcome of the Airfield Support Services Project (ASSP) is known. The matter will then be reviewed at that stage. I refer the hon. Member to the statement on the future of MOD Fire Services made by my right hon.

 There are no arrangements for the fast-tracking of clinical treatment for Service personnel within the NHS.

These latter arrangements apply particularly, but not exclusively, to those required for operational deployments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made with the Assessment Phase of the Future Aircraft Carrier procurement programme.  [17400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Assessment work on the new carrier project began in November 1999 when contracts were awarded to two competing consortia headed by BAE Systems and Thales Naval Ltd. The first stage of the assessment was completed in June this year.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para1">Since then officials have been working to determine the most efficient and cost effective way forward for the remainder of the Assessment Phase, taking into account the views of both consortia about the amount of work required to minimise the level of risk in the CVF programme.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para2">On the basis of that work, contracts have been signed today for both BAE Systems and Thales Naval Ltd. to proceed to Stage 2 of the CVF Assessment Phase.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para3">For the next 12 months, until November 2002, the competing consortiums will concentrate on refining their designs and on taking key trade-off decisions. During this period, there will be a continuous assessment of the two consortiums' work leading to an announcement of a single preferred prime contractor in early 2003.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para4">The preferred consortium will then continue assessment work through the summer of 2003 in order to provide the robust cost, time and performance information needed to make the main investment decision. This will allow us to make a decision to place a formal build contract in early 2004. The selected prime contractor will be expected to maintain the time, cost and performance proposals agreed at the end of the Assessment phase. Following the announcement of a preferred contractor, there will be maximum competition at the sub-contractor level to ensure that robust prices are achieved.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para5">This approach reflects a sensible revision to the original procurement approach envisaged for the future carrier project. By applying Smart Procurement principles, it will help to ensure the maximum potential for competition throughout the remainder of the Assessment Phase. It will ensure that we achieve best value for money for the taxpayer. As part of the new approach, we will make around a further &#163;20 million available to the contractors during the Assessment Phase.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para6">The In Service Dates of the two new carriers remain unchanged at 2012 and 2015.
<P>

<a name="11121w06.html_para7">Both BAE Systems and Thales have welcomed this new approach which demonstrates innovative thinking to deliver value for money. It re-affirms in the strongest possible terms this Government's commitment to ensuring that our armed forces are equipped with battle-winning equipment. Combined with the Future Joint Combat Aircraft, the carriers will provide the UK with a formidable force projection capability.

Offers were made by EU member states at last year's Capability Commitments Conference for 94 of the 144 identified capability areas underpinning the Headline Goal. The new offers made on Monday enhance our capabilities in a number of these areas and provide solutions for a further 10. We also agreed an Action Plan to address the remaining shortfalls: there are already identified initiatives addressing 20 of the 21 most significant capability areas. This process also reinforces NATO's Defence Capabilities Initiative.

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> The Government Office for the north-east and the regional development agency, One North-East, already work very closely together on a wide range of issues and I have no plans to change that. The implementation of the new Single Programme Budget for RDAs next year is likely to lead to even closer working, with the Government office having a key role in monitoring One North-East's performance against the demanding targets for that budget. The Government office was fully involved in the production of the Regional Strategy, and will be working closely with One North-East in the coming months on the review of the Agency's Regional Strategy for the North East which is now under way.

 The Employment Tribunals Service, the government agency that provides the administrative support to the Employment Tribunals, seeks to ensure that 75 per cent. of single tribunal applications reach a first hearing within 26 weeks of receipt. However, due to the complexity of individual cases and the need to ensure proper judicial consideration it is not possible to ensure specific periods of time are achieved in individual cases if justice is to be done.
<P>

 Twenty-four counties have now qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, the latest being Ethiopia which qualified last week. Three countries have completed the process. More than $54 billion of debt relief has been agreed for those countries, which together owe about $75 billion, so a major part of their debt has been written off. The money released is being spent on poverty reduction. Social expenditure in these countries is projected to rise by some $1.7 billion per year, on average.

Where possible we support countries' own poverty reduction strategies, for example by financing work to help them to design and implement pro-poor economic and social policies, improve the quality of governance and tackle HIV/AIDS.

 Following the resumption of our bilateral programme in October 2000, we moved quickly to support economic and social reform in Serbia, and to help safeguard the well-being of the poorest people in Serbia. During the winter of 2000 we provided &#163;10 million of emergency aid. We also provided a grant totalling &#163;8.4 million to pay arrears of welfare benefits for the poorest families. We are assisting the Serbian authorities to make key economic, social and governance reforms that are necessary for sustainable and equitable development and poverty reduction. We have supported the development of strategies for reform in privatisation, banking rehabilitation and health care.

Plans are now being made for their international staff to return as soon as possible.

The third is bilateral and regional support, for example, DFlD's Africa Trade and Poverty programme which aims to help developing countries analyse the linkages between trade, poverty and sustainable economic and social development.

<a name="11121w11.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Many developing countries suffer from subsidised food being dumped on their markets. Owing to the complexity of subsidies and the widespread use of subsidies in industrialised nations, it is difficult to determine exactly which developing countries are being harmed by dumped subsidised food and to what extent. However, the EU is one of the principal users of subsidies. For this and other reasons the Government are strongly committed to fundamental reform of the CAP.

Statutory compensation for losses incurred as a result of the FMD outbreak is only paid on animals which have been slaughtered as a result of FMD, or on property, including animals which have been seized and destroyed in order to prevent the spread of FMD.

 Peak ozone levels in episodes of "summer smog" are declining as a result of significant emission reductions of ozone precursors in the UK and Europe over the past ten years or so.

 The Government are strongly committed to the public's right to know about polluting emissions. The Environment Agency has a comprehensive Pollution Inventory that provides easy access to annual emissions data on 150 pollutants from over 2,000 of the most potentially polluting industrial processes in England and Wales. The public can access this information through the Environment Agency's website www.environmentagency.gov.uk and from local Environment Agency offices (general line: 0845 9333 111).

<a name="11121w13.html_para3">The Environment Agency is working on improving the scope of the Inventory.

<a name="11121w13.html_para4">The number of sites reporting will increase to around 7,000 in 2003 as a result of the implementation of the European Union Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC).

The EPER will initially require reporting on 50 pollutants released to air and water every three years with the first year of reporting commencing in 2003.

 EC Regulation No. 2037/2000 on Ozone Depleting Substances will require "controlled substances" (including CFCs) in coolants and in insulating foam to be removed before recycling or reclamation of refrigeration units. Although the UK does not currently have facilities capable of extracting ozone depleting substances, including CFCs, from insulation foam, it is anticipated that some plant may come on-line as early as spring 2002. My Department is finalising measures to manage waste refrigeration equipment in the interim. Advice on storage of waste refrigeration equipment will issue shortly. We are currently considering funding options for local authorities.

<P>

<a name="11121w14.html_para0">Today, we are publishing a Consultation Paper on the distribution of &#163;140 million of additional funding for local authority waste minimisation and recycling. In that Paper we suggest that partnership working between authorities to deliver higher recycling might be one of the funding priorities.

<a name="11121w14.html_para1">The Consultation Paper also consults on a mechanism for allowing local authorities to 'pool' their statutory performance standards for recycling and composting of household waste. In doing so we are responding to those local authorities who have told us that this will help to deliver partnership working.

Further research to develop the indicator is currently being commissioned. The research will use existing national datasets about changing countryside character, including agriculture, forestry and land use change statistics and, from Countryside Survey 2000, information on landscape features and biodiversity. New data on traditional farm buildings are being collated by English Heritage and the Countryside Agency. The research will consider tranquillity as an aspect of countryside character.

 In 2000 the percentage of rural households in England living within 4 km of services was as follows:
<P>

<a name="11121w15.html_para0">Foodshops (supermarkets) 79 per cent., post offices 99 per cent., cash points 79 per cent., primary schools 99 per cent., GP surgeries 86 per cent. Data are not available for child nurseries.
<P>

<a name="11121w15.html_para1">It should be noted that 22 per cent. of rural settlement have a general store (selling a range of household goods including basic foodstuffs) and 28 per cent. have a small village shop (a sole shop selling mainly food).
<P>

<a name="11121w15.html_para2">This is the latest date for which figures are available. The figures for 2001 will be reported on by the Countryside Agency in April 2002. They have a research project for child care in preparation.

<P>
<a name="11121w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Good progress has been made. Commission Regulation 259/2001 established areas which are closed to most types of fishing between 14 February and 30 April 2001 to allow the maximum possible number of cod to spawn. We will not be able to asses how successful this has been before spring 2003 when the cod spawned should be large enough to be found in significant numbers in ground fish surveys.
<P>

 We are not aware of an Irish Sea Management Committee. Fisheries are managed at European Union level under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

A person in possession of a biological weapon for terrorist purposes would also commit an offence under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

The Kimberley Process was designed to devise a way to break the link between the illicit diamond trade and armed conflict. Urgent completion of its work on an international certification scheme for rough diamonds would also help curb other illegal sales, including those which fund terrorists.

We also work with our EU colleagues in the UN fora to keep our concerns on the international agenda. For example, the EU sponsored a resolution on Sudan at this year's UN Commission on Human Rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, (1) pursuant to her answer of 12 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 539W, what criteria were used in deciding which new early excellence centres should be designated;  [16600]

<P>
<a name="11121w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> Criteria and detailed requirements for joining the Early Excellence Centre (EEC) programme are set out in guidance issued by the Department. Guidance issued in 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2001 : Column: 348W</I><P>
February provided the framework for designations made so far this year. Additional guidance was issued on 5 October. The core activities of the programme which all centres are expected to deliver, or have well advanced and convincing plans to develop, remain unchanged and are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>good quality integrated early education and daycare for children 0 to five requiring centre-based extended-day and extended-year provision;
<P>
<BR>
parental and carer involvement in the education and care of children, eg schemes for family learning, developing parenting skills, raising parents' expectations and in other ways;
<P>
<BR>
support services for children and parents and carers of children, eg health, counselling and information services, home support, drop-in facilities;
<P>
<BR>
effective early identification and intervention for children in need and children with special educational needs, with a view to improving children's prospects and, wherever appropriate, achieving inclusion in mainstream provision;
<P>
<BR>
access to adult education and training by parents of young children and other adults, including those seeking skills and qualifications for employment;
<P>
<BR>
raising standards of integrated early years provision among other early years providers, including voluntary and private providers, childminders and other carers, by contributing to the training and development strategy of the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership and through the development and dissemination of good practice.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11121w20.html_para0">Decisions on designations also take into account links with other Government programmes, geographical coverage, support of key partners, especially the local Early Years and Childcare Development Partnership (EYCDP), and commitment to multi-agency working.




<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2001 : Column: 349W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11121w20.html_para1">The Department received 135 expressions of interest following the issue of the February guidance and 14 new centres were announced on 1 October. Officials are continuing to work closely with a further nine centres in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Wigan, Peterborough, Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire and Bury, on the basis of expressions of interest received in response to the February guidance. A further 93 expressions of interest in joining the programme have been received since additional guidance was issued in October.
<P>

<a name="11121w20.html_para2">Somerford Infant School's expression of interest in the EEC programme was submitted in response to the guidance issued in February. It was closely linked to emerging local proposals for the development of a Neighbourhood Nursery, but did not meet the requirements set out in the guidance for joint Neighbourhood Nursery/Early Excellence Centre schemes. Neither did it provide sufficient coverage of the core activities or relate them sufficiently well to the wider strategy of the EYCDP.
<P>

<a name="11121w20.html_para3">The Department wrote to the school inviting it to develop its plans further. I have placed a copy of that letter in the Library. The additional guidance issued in October indicates that those invited to do further development work should submit a fresh expression of interest taking into account feedback received. The guidance included full contact details for relevant officials at the Department and encouraged partners to make contact with them for further information.
<P>

<a name="11121w20.html_para4">The Department has not received a further expression of interest from Somerford Infant School. To continue to develop its interest in the programme the school should contact officials at the Department who will be most willing to discuss it with them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w20.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills which company was awarded the contract to run the Fast-Track Teacher Recruitment Scheme; what the cost and duration of the contract is; what the agreed recruitment targets for each year of the contract were; how the company was chosen; and what the criteria are for success and best value.  [16698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Following a competitive tender exercise the contract for assessing Fast-Track applicants was let to a consortium headed by Interactive Skills on 2 October 2000. The cost of the contract in Financial Year 2000&#150;01 was &#163;2,375,081. The contract covers a three-year period, with an option for a two-year extension. Selection is done against standards and not to quota. Main criteria for success are delivery to time and within budget of: (i) a high quality multi-stage selection process which will successfully identify those applicants who meet the competencies and values laid down in the Education (School Teachers' Pay and Conditions) (No.7) Order 2001; (ii) relevant application brochures, website, forms and guidance to a high professional standard; (iii) a cycle of continuous review and improvement in efficiency and effectiveness of the activities of the consortium.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11121w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the total cost was for each existing fast-track student of recruiting them to the Fast-Track Teacher Recruitment scheme; and what the total cost was for students recruited through the programme.  [16697]

<a name="11121w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills spent &#163;4.6 million on the Fast-Track Programme in the last financial year 2000&#150;01, the first year of its existence. This long-term investment supported (i) a national recruitment campaign which raised public awareness of the programme, established a credible presence at the upper end of the highly competitive graduate recruitment market, and attracted 1,574 applications; (ii) the design, development and implementation of a very high quality assessment and selection process which resulted in the offer of 135 places in the first round to potential future leaders of the profession; and (iii) the initial cost of setting-up enhanced Fast-Track Initial Teacher Training.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 7 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 315W, on passports, whether clear evidence of a proposed intention to go to Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban or al-Qaeda is sufficient to demonstrate the undesirability of the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities on grounds of public interest; and if he will make a statement.

 As indicated in my answer of 7 November, a passport may be withdrawn from a person whose past or proposed activities are so demonstrably undesirable that the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities would be contrary to the public interest. On the face of it, a clearly stated intention to fight directly against British interests would justify withdrawal of passport facilities on public interest grounds.

<a name="11121w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 "Making Punishments Work", the report of a review of the sentencing framework undertaken by John Halliday&#151;and known as the Halliday report&#151;was published on 5 July and responses were invited by 31 October. The report was sent to a large number of individuals and organisations and a series of meetings were held with members of the public and representatives of the judiciary and other bodies to encourage consideration of the report and obtain views.
<P>

<a name="11121w22.html_para5">In order to encourage wider public involvement in the debate, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, launched the Fairer Sentencing website which contained a quiz, a facility to e-mail views and an on-line debating provision. In addition debate was stimulated in local, regional and national media and hon. Members were encouraged to initiate discussion in their constituencies. A number of conferences have also been convened.
<P>

<a name="11121w22.html_para6">The level of interest and response has been considerable. Over 120 detailed responses have been received from individuals or organisations with connections to the criminal justice system and even more from members of the public by letter or e-mail or through the debating channel. In addition, the website received 33,482 page hits, the home page was visited 5,831 times, 2,839 copies of the layman's summary of the Halliday review were downloaded, 1,171 copies of the Home Secretary's speech on sentencing reform were downloaded and 1,226 people completed the quiz on the website. This has been a unique opportunity to hold a public consultation on the point of sentencing and many members of the public have offered their own suggestions and alternatives.
<P>

<a name="11121w22.html_para7">There has been almost unanimous support for the need for change to the present sentencing framework, accompanied by a strong message that the change should be done well, properly resourced and then allowed to stand the test of time. There has also been broad support for the general thrust of the proposals, in particular the need for radical changes in the approach to short prison sentences. There is widespread recognition that it is unacceptable to have no supervision for an individual leaving a short prison sentence and that there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of both a prison sentence and a community sentence.
<P>

<a name="11121w22.html_para8">There has also been considerable support for greater transparency in sentencing.
<P>

<a name="11121w22.html_para9">There has been mixed support for the greater involvement of the courts in the management of sentences through review hearings. Many commentators have seen the strength of the arguments in terms of principle but have expressed doubts about whether the enormous practical difficulties could be overcome sufficiently well to justify that intervention in every case.
<P>

<a name="11121w22.html_para10">Officials are now analysing the responses in greater detail and a summary of the responses will be published, with copies in the Library, towards the end of January 2002. I then anticipate publishing a White Paper in spring 2002.

data only go back as 1989&#150;90. Prior to this, information is not available in the format requested. Until 1985, data were collected via the hospital in-patient inquiry, which is not directly comparable with HES data due to a number of changes in the methods of collection. Changes in the boundaries between regional health authorities which existed in 1989&#150;90 and the regional offices which are in place now mean it is not possible to make direct comparisons by region over the 10 years.

<a name="11121w25.html_para0">The decrease in the number of registrations during 2000&#150;01 (and the consequent fall in numbers on the registers at 31 March 2001) is largely due to the majority of local councils excluding temporary registrations from their figures (children who are on the register in one authority but located in another and are simultaneously on the register of both councils). The year ending 31 March 2001 was the first year in which the Department of Health has requested that only the council with the original responsibility for the child should include the child in its figures until the receiving council has held a child protection conference to determine whether the child should instead be registered by that council. There has been some element of double counting of these children in previous years.

 A blocked bed occurs when a patient is ready for transfer from an acute hospital bed but is still occupying that bed. That definition has not altered since 1997. Until recently, published statistics have been based on the number of beds occupied by people aged 75 years or more. Current and future statistics on bed blocking will include all blocked beds.
