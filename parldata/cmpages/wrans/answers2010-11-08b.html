The national rural community buildings survey is probably the most comprehensive information source on community-owned buildings, and provides detailed information on their physical state, financing, use and governance. In particular, some of the data was used by the BIG Lottery to help make the case for the recently announced new BIG Lottery Reaching Communities Programme for extension and refurbishment of halls.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) considered one specific private financing proposal that was received in response to the 2009 public consultation on the St Helena airport. We also commissioned an independent review to determine whether there could be any other public private partnership (PPP) approaches that could be appropriate for financing the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="101108w0001.htm_para44"><a name="10110825000043">We were looking for a viable solution that would not only make the project more affordable in the short-term, but also deliver the project more efficiently by transferring risk from DFID to the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="101108w0001.htm_para45"><a name="10110825000044">The review concluded that a PPP approach would give limited scope for further risk transfer from the current Design, Build and Operate approach. Although a PPP approach could avoid the need for large up-front Government financing, it would do so on more costly terms, and therefore would be unlikely to deliver further value for money compared to the grant-funded approach.</p>

There are a range of measures in place to help people struggling to pay their mortgage. These include access to free advice, support for mortgage interest (paid by DWP to unemployed homeowners), Homeowners Mortgage Support, and the Mortgage Rescue Scheme which enables the most vulnerable homeowners at risk of repossession to remain in their homes. These provisions are nationwide and not particular to Coventry or the west midlands. In July 2010, the Minister for Housing and Local Government announced changes to the Mortgage Rescue Scheme to secure better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property price and repair costs for new applications.</p>

 Academies are not required to follow the national curriculum because we believe that having flexibility in their curriculum design, within a broad and balanced context, is a core freedom which is at the heart of the academies programme.

Many universities think that students should have more time to study subjects in depth to prepare them for higher education, and we will establish new arrangements for developing GCSEs and A levels which give universities and learned societies a much stronger say in their design.

<i> [holding answer 21 October 2010]:</i> The Department does not issue guidance to schools and sixth form colleges on a minimum number of teaching hours per subject for sixth form students, nor does it estimate the average weekly teaching hours sixth form students receive per subject. It is for institutions themselves to decide how much time they allocate to teaching in each subject for each group of students.</p>

 Applications to the Court of Protection cover a wide range of financial, health care and personal welfare issues, including where it is in the best interests of the person to live, and often the application will require the court to deal with a number of issues together. During the period from 1 October 2007 (when the current Court of Protection was created by the Mental Capacity Act 2005) to 31 October 2010, the Court of Protection made 420 orders in relation to its personal welfare jurisdiction, and in 294 of these cases, the court appointed a deputy to make personal welfare decisions on behalf of the person lacking mental capacity. Some of these orders may have involved decisions about where someone should live, but the court does not record this level of detail centrally and could obtain the information only by examining all the court files at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The concealment of the body, or other evidence, is already an aggravating factor in sentencing. This means that where, for example, a murderer fails to disclose the location of the body of the victim, the court will punish that aspect of the offender's behaviour by imposing a longer minimum term under the mandatory life sentence required for murder.</p>

 The Prison Service and NOMS are national agencies that cover the whole of England and Wales and provide a service for all offenders regardless of their home location. Presently there are no prisons situated in north Wales area and as such there has been no funding directly allocated to north Wales in relation to Prison Services. The majority of male offenders in custody that originate from north Wales are located at HMP Altcourse, with the majority of female prisoners being held in HMP Styal, and additional services have been allocate to support Welsh offenders held at both sites.

 Approved Premises provide close and enhanced supervised accommodation for high and very high risk offenders, which would be much more difficult if such offenders were dispersed into less suitable accommodation elsewhere in the community. Approved Premises accommodate prisoners who have completed the custodial part of their sentence and have been released on licence, as well as offenders serving community sentences and bailees with a condition of residence. The total budget for Approved Premises in each of the last three financial years (including 2010-11) has been £58,300,000.

 In accordance with the legislation which governs the release of prisoners, no prisoner serving a determinate sentence is required to serve the entire sentence in prison. Most are required by law to be released at the halfway point of their sentence and, for sentences longer than 12 months, they then serve the second half of the sentence on licence in the community. They are supervised by the Probation Service and may be recalled to prison during the licence period if they fail to comply with their conditions.

Those figures show that 333, 409 and 322 prisoner claims were settled out of court in 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively.</p>

 The Prison Act 1952 prevents prisoners being required to finance the cost of their prison sentence.

 The UK welcomes the measures Israel announced in June to improve the flow of goods into Gaza. According to the UN in May, prior to the Israeli announcement, there were 2,794 trucks allowed into Gaza compared to 3569 in September.

They will ensure citizens and civil society groups have the necessary data and evidence to hold public bodies to account, and to apply public pressure to drive a faster pace of change.</p>

 Engagement with the public and external experts has demonstrated a strong consensus in support of action to tackle the deficit and secure economic stability. It has also revealed broad agreement that spending reductions should be balanced across public services and welfare payments, rather than just focused on the former. Regarding the switch to the consumer price index (CPI) for the indexation of benefits, tax credits and public sector pensions, a number of economic commentators have endorsed the Government's assessment that the CPI has advantages over the retail price index, including that it better represents the real behaviour of consumers in substituting away from goods which have become relatively more expensive towards cheaper goods.</p>

The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase the efficiency of compliance. The value of individual certificates is determined by the market. To date the RTFO has met its objective of driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK. Therefore the introduction of a minimum floor price is not currently considered necessary.</p>

 In line with article 3 of the UK protocol to the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, the UK's opt-in applied to the European Investigation Order (EIO). As a result the three options open to the UK were: not to opt into the EIO; to opt into the EIO at the start of negotiations; or to apply to opt in once the EIO has been adopted. All these options were carefully considered by the Government and it was determined that it was in the UK's interests to opt in at the start of negotiations.

 There are no plans to allocate extra resources to Darent Valley hospital for this purpose, as, under the Payment by Results system, hospitals are paid by commissioners for all activity within the scope of the national tariff, adjusted by the Market Forces Factor to take account of unavoidable local cost differences. As tariff payments follow the patient, an increase in activity at Darent Valley hospital would result in it attracting tariff payments that it otherwise would not have received had those patients been treated elsewhere.</p>

 There are a range of ongoing activities to promote organ donation and increase donation rates.

For example, some areas have developed a smaller number of hospitals providing a 24 hour, seven day a week service for a larger population, while others are developing telemedicine arrangements to access stroke specialist expertise remotely out of hours.</p>
