 As of 30 June 2008, the ODA employed 212 members of staff. This consists of permanent staff, fixed-term contract staff, and secondments.

 In June this year we published the Legacy Action Plan (LAP) which sets out the long-term benefits we hope to stimulate through hosting the Olympic games and Paralympic games in 2012, and how we plan to achieve them. This is unprecedented as no other host city has ever been at this stage of planning, nor so committed to a broad and sustainable legacy, this early in preparations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para4"><a name="0807233000043">The LAP sets out the Government's priorities for UK-wide legacy as defined by our five legacy promises, published in Our Promise for 2012 in June 2007. This includes a target to help get two million people more active through sport and physical activity by 2012. Sport England will seek to get one million more active through sport; they will do this through new engagement with national governing bodies and through county sport partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_616"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para5"><a name="0807233000044">Further to the announcement in June, Government have now set out further details of the &#163;140 million cross-Government free swimming scheme. The scheme is designed to encourage as many local authorities as possible to participate in making swimming free for over-60s and under-16s in their local communities, but also to stimulate ambitious authorities to maximise and sustain uptake through other initiatives such as free lessons for adults who cannot swim, the introduction of swimming co-ordinators and to provide incentives for the most ambitious to move further towards a universal free swimming offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para6"><a name="0807233000045">The LAP also includes initiatives to stimulate economic and social benefit by increasing tourism and improving access to skills and business opportunities. This includes, for example, the London 2012 Business Network giving business across the UK access to the 75,000 contracts in the London 2012 supply chains worth &#163;6 billion.</p>

 The UK Government have been working closely with the major international organisations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN agencies and International Food Policy Research Institute) in order to assess future price trends and cereal production. Increased cereal production and the removal of export bans have brought about a calming of markets, and prices have fallen back from the very high levels seen earlier this year. But the consensus remains that the underlying demand for food remains strong, and this is likely to keep prices high for some years yet, with the trend price for grains stabilising at around 10-25 per cent. higher than 2001 levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="80722w0003.htm_para8"><a name="08072322000192">Many countries have experienced serious social and economic consequences of the recent surge in food prices, aggravated by similar movement in fuel prices. The macroeconomic impact on developing countries varies according to the degree of dependency on food and fuel imports. Some countries (e.g. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Mozambique) are experiencing significant food price rises; some (e.g. Kenya and Zanzibar) are experiencing clear food shortages; countries in West Africa (e.g. Nigeria and Niger) are heavily affected due to their reliance on imports from international markets; some (Malawi and Zambia) are relatively insulated from global price movements, while others (e.g. Vietnam) are benefiting. The poorest are hardest hit, with some families spending up to 90 per cent. of their income on food. The UK Government are pressing for a global partnership to address both the short term impact of surging food prices, and the longer term challenges of promoting food security for the 850 million people who continue to face hunger.</p>

Those factors include the introduction of the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 and the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005, improvements in the accuracy of the vehicle register, various Government and local campaigns to tackle abandonment, and the continuing high value of scrap metal.

 In 2003 the Environment Agency commissioned a report on the Prioritisation of Flame Retardants for Environmental Risk Assessment. The aim of the study was to assess the use of and risks associated with flame retardants, in particular to identify substances that might require detailed consideration in terms of their possible impact on the environment. It also considered issues concerning substitution of flame retardants. The study noted that little was known about the effects of many of the substances, including those sometimes proposed for use as environmentally-friendly substitutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_664"><a name="80722w0006.htm_para6"><a name="08072322000637">The new European Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (known as REACH) places on industry the responsibility to assess and understand the potential human health and environmental impacts of the substances they produce in accordance with the principle of &#147;No Data, No Market&#148;. REACH also has the aim of replacing substances of very high concern, as defined by criteria in the regulation, with suitable alternatives. Industry will have to justify their continued use. These provisions will drive substitution of harmful substances and also provide the assurance that the substitutes are less harmful than the substances they replace. On current evidence decabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE) does not meet the criteria of a substance of very high concern.</p>

 There are currently no regulations or statutory instruments which place a direct requirement on farmers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, a number of measures have an indirect impact on agriculture GHG emissions, such as measures under the nitrates directive and conditions under cross-compliance. There are also a number of voluntary initiatives which can help to reduce GHGs from farming, including the Environmental Stewardship schemes and various grant schemes.</p>

The legislation has been drawn up so that implementation will take account of the interests of landowners and minimise any impact on businesses.

 DEFRA published farm incomes in England by farm type in January 2008. These were based on figures from the Farm Business Survey. Farm Business Income per farm on dairy farms was expected to have increased to &#163;50,700 in the year ended February 2008, from &#163;33,600 in the previous year&#151;an increase of about 50 per cent. This was largely due to a higher farm gate milk price in 2007-08, although higher input costs, particularly feed, dampened down the size of the expected increase. This compares with the average income across all types of farms, including dairy farms, which was expected to have increased by 20 per cent. from &#163;37,600 to &#163;45,000 in 2007-08.

CODA was in part initiated to provide this information. The UK FCS assessments are available from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee&#146;s website.</p>

However, the 1994 estimate was not corrected for animals missed on the transect line or for responsive movement, and this is now known to generate significant positive bias. Therefore, it is unknown whether the differences in the abundances obtained were indicative of an actual change in abundance or were related to the different methodology used. Additionally, these two surveys only covered the continental shelf area. This species is known to move widely between inshore and offshore areas.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> Certain hormonal weed killers have the potential to remain in plant material from treated land and pass into the manure of livestock which eat such material. Susceptible crops may be adversely affected by the residues in the plant material. Labels of certain products which contain particular hormonal week killers therefore include warnings not to use manure from livestock which have eaten grass from treated land, or fodder derived from such grass, on susceptible crops or on land intended for growing such crops, until all plant material has fully decomposed. As with all plant protection products, users should always read and follow the label instructions; this is a statutory requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_711"><a name="80722w0009.htm_para0"><a name="08072322000892">Some cases of damage to susceptible crops which appear to involve the weed killer aminopyralid have arisen recently. In such cases, the label precautions on the use of manure may not have been followed when manure has been supplied to allotment holders and gardeners. The manufacturer has indicated that they are withdrawing products which contain aminopyralid from sale and PSD is formally suspending their authorisations while they investigate the options for preventing a recurrence of this problem. A key issue in their consideration will be whether the conditions of use regarding manure are sufficient, or sufficiently well known.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The first inquiry relating to the potential effects of the hormonal herbicide aminopyralid in manure was received by the Pesticides Safety Directorate's helpline on 12 March 2008. Around 90 inquiries had been received up to 16 July 2008, primarily from amateur gardeners and allotment holders. It is not known how many reports of damage to crops are attributable to aminopyralid.</p>

 The River Mimram lies outside the area of contamination. Sampling has shown that groundwater between the plume and the Mimram contains no bromate. Given these data and the generally stable nature of the plume the Environment Agency is confident that the Mimram is not, and will not be, subject to contamination by bromate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_712"><a name="80722w0009.htm_para1"><a name="08072322000899">Contamination of the chalk aquifer in Hertfordshire extends 20 km from Sandridge to the Lee Valley between Ware and Turnford, which includes Hoddesdon and Broxbourne. One borehole has been taken out of use for public supply. The contamination has restricted the use that can be made of seven other public supply boreholes and three private boreholes. The three private boreholes are all close to Sandridge. Concentrations of bromate and the size of the plume show no change with time.</p>

 The regulation of fishing activity in offshore waters is the responsibility of the EU Fisheries Council and the European Commission. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee has advised that, in respect of the offshore sites which it is so far proposed to designate as Special Areas of Conservation, the use of heavy towed gear should be prohibited in order to protect the features for which designation is proposed. Such controls already apply to the Darwin Mounds site, but it will be for the Commission to propose and ultimately for the Council to decide what measures, if any, should be applied in respect of the other sites proposed for designation.</p>

 The coverage of marine conservation zones (MCZs) proposed for designation under the draft Marine Bill will depend on the outcome of stakeholder-based regional projects being established by the statutory conservation agencies.

 The Forestry Commission's statutory remit under the Plant Health Act 1967 charges them with the responsibility for the protection of forest trees and timber against attack by pests. This statutory remit does not specifically extend to monitor amenity and urban trees in relation to pests and disease. In practice the Forestry Commission occasionally does this, either by individually financed surveys aimed at detecting specific pest problems, or by monitoring the issues raised in calls for advice through the Tree Health Diagnostic and Information Service operated by Forest Research. I have asked the Forestry Commission to consider whether there is a need to extend their remit to include a more targeted approach to amenity and urban trees.</p>

 The Gallagher review focused on the potential impacts of likely global demand for biofuels in 2020, rather than on the dynamics of specific regional biofuel markets. As part of this, it took account of matters such as the different types of biofuel feedstocks likely by 2020 to be used in different regions (including the EU, USA and China), and the different land requirements and impacts of these feedstocks. Matters such as current and projected levels of subsidies for biofuels and the impact these might have on different markets were outside the scope of the review.

 Where the particulate emissions limit is sufficiently strict as to oblige manufacturers to use a diesel particulate filter, as the future Euro VI standard proposed by the European Commission may be, the associated fuel consumption penalty would be likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent. if no offsetting improvements to engine or vehicle technology were made.</p>

The imposition of a carbon dioxide emission limit for lorries would be technically very difficult and deliver limited environmental benefits.</p>

 We have not carried out a specific comparison with the decent homes standard for either service family accommodation (SFA) or single living accommodation (SLA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_798"><a name="80722w0017.htm_para4"><a name="08072356000525">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has its own well defined criteria for assessing the condition of its properties. For the majority of SFA, this consists of a list of over 100 individual attributes that are assessed to arrive at an overall Standard for Condition (SfC) score for the property. SfC scores are banded into categories, S1fC the highest to S4fC the lowest. SfC assessment includes aspects such as the structure of the property, its energy efficiency, health and safety features, security arrangements and sanitary items as well as an assessment of the kitchen and bedrooms. On that basis, the majority of SFA is already at either S1fC or S2fC. This includes over 12,800 properties that have been upgraded to S1fC since 2001. By the end of this financial year, no Service family will have to live in S4fC accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_799"><a name="80722w0017.htm_para5"><a name="08072356000526">We are confident that the current SfC system used by the Department fully takes into account the four basic tenets of the decent homes standard. Rather than simply conforming to a minimum acceptable level of accommodation, MOD aspires to provide accommodation to a higher standard; and this is reflected in the criteria that must be met to achieve S1fC. (All eight categories must score at Standard 1 for the overall Standard for Condition to be 1).</p>

 The theoretical phenomenon known as "popcorning" is a process whereby a series of accidental detonations of a number of warheads' conventional explosives could lead to some nuclear yield.

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="4"><i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Finished admission episodes (FAE)<br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
3. Secondary Diagnoses<br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care:<br>
F10 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>
K70 Alcoholic liver disease<br>
T51 Toxic effect of alcohol<br>
4. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
 Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 6. Uncrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

<p><a name="stpa_859"><a name="80722w0023.htm_para3"><a name="08072356001487">Decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) is a flame retardant used primarily in plastics and textiles applications. Over an extended period it has been subject to risk assessment action under the EU Existing Substances Regulation (EC no. 793/93); the UK (the Environment Agency) was the Rapporteur for the environmental elements of the risk assessment and France was the Rapporteur for the human health aspects.</p>

The Act made provision for the creation of national health service foundation trusts (FTs), accountable to local communities rather than the Secretary of State; placed a duty on NHS bodies to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare that they provide; gave the Secretary of State power to publish standards in relation to healthcare; created a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (usually referred to as the Healthcare Commission (HCC)) and a Commission for Social Care Inspection; and made new provisions in relation to primary dental services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_882"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para9"><a name="08072356001663">There are now 103 NHS FTs in place. NHS FTs have demonstrated their ability to establish strong finances and deliver high quality services; the Healthcare Commission&#146;s Annual Healthcheck for 2006-07 showed that FTs are delivering better care and improved finances compared to non-FTs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_883"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para10"><a name="08072356001664">The Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, or HCC, reports directly to Parliament on the state of healthcare in England, and on the quality of NHS and independent healthcare, and its value for money. The assessment of individual providers of NHS healthcare takes into account the standards for healthcare published by the Secretary of State. By bringing together the expertise of previous health inspection bodies, the HCC is helping to reduce the fragmentation of inspection, easing the burdens on front-line staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_884"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para11"><a name="08072356001665">Similarly, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is an independent body, which provides a comprehensive picture of the quality of social care services and the performance of local authorities in meeting social care needs in their areas. It gives a star rating to councils annually and, from 2008, a quality rating to care services. The CSCI regulates, inspects and reviews all adult social care services in the public, private and voluntary sectors in England. It does so on the basis of regulations and standards issued by the Secretary of State. It makes an annual report to Parliament on the state of social care that gives a comprehensive overview of the social care sector in England.</p>

 The guidelines on the quality of herbal medicinal products prepared by the European Medicines Agency largely reflect good practice identified by the herbal industry. In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. The MHRA would expect some rationalisation in the manufacturing of herbal medicines reflecting the fact that to carry out this activity to systematic standards within a regulated environment requires specialist expertise. However, there is no basis on which to make specific estimates and feedback to the MHRA from individual companies suggests that many are still developing their plans. So far 14 companies have submitted applications to register one or more product in the United Kingdom under the THR scheme and we therefore anticipate that there will be a competitive market.</p>

 My right hon. Friend The Secretary of State would grant closed directions under section 7(2) of the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1967 in respect of staff transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) to qualifying social enterprises. A qualifying social enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community. The following legal forms will be acceptable; a registered charity, a community interest company or an industrial and provident society. The terms of the direction would mean that staff would be able to remain members of the NHS Pension scheme. The direction would be specific to the staff named on the direction, the organisation applying for the direction and to them remaining working wholly on the contract in respect of which they were transferred or other national health service contracts. If staff are subsequently transferred to another social enterprise or organisation qualifying for a direction, then a further direction would be granted in respect of those transferring staff. Directions will not cover a member of staff recruited individually in the open market from the NHS or elsewhere.</p>

Over the past year the TCCC wrote to all foundation trusts, national health service trusts and independent providers asking about their smokefree policies and inviting individual trusts to request additional support, such as visits. The TCCC has also worked with regional stop smoking leads to organise local workshops to address implementation issues. This initial contact was followed up by sending mental health providers smokefree resources, accompanied by a further offer of support to trusts on an individual basis.

1. Data are only available for the year 2006-07 and cannot be broken down by month.<br>
2. The information can only be collected at trust level. The University of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust is the trust which closely corresponds to the Westmorland and Lonsdale area.<br>
3. Data cannot be provided for the number of heart attacks and strokes recorded but are provided as the number of admissions to hospital with a primary diagnosis of a <i> (a) </i>stroke and <i> (b)</i> heart attack.<br>
4. Finished admission episodes&#151;A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
5. Data Quality&#151;HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. Assessing growth through time&#151;HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be accounted for when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be accounted for when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
7. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
8. Ungrossed Data&#151;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

In your first question on 21 November 2007, (Official Report, Column 990W) you asked how many instances of fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft had been recorded in the last 12 months. This was taken to be the period from 1 November 2006 to 31 October 2007. A fuel leak is defined as any leakage of fuel from aircraft couplings, pipes or fuel tanks. In that period, there were a total of 252 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. In your second question on 20 May 2008 (Official Report, Column 181W) you asked how many fuel leaks had been reported since January 2007. Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2007 there were 277 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. Based on current data, between 1 January 2008 and 31 March 2008 (the last full month for which validated data is available), there have been a total of 33 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. That figure is however provisional, as some records have yet to be received from aircraft deployed on operations, and it is therefore likely to increase as the records are completed.</p>

In particular we have, as you know, removed potential sources of ignition by switching off the aircraft&#146;s very hot air system while airborne; it is used for short periods on the ground but does not reach temperatures sufficient to ignite fuel. Despite this, no leakage, however small, from pipes, couplings or fuselage tanks is accepted and the aircraft will not fly until such leaks have been rectified. The only occasion on which an aircraft will fly with a fuel leak is with certain categories of leaks from the integral fuel tanks in the wings. In such instances leaking fuel from the wing tanks disperses safely into the aircraft's slipstream, and, as there is no potential source of ignition, there is no hazard to the aircraft.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]: </i>There has been one allegation of misconduct by the Iraqi authorities against a private military and security company contracted by the Government to work in Iraq. A complaint was made in February 2008 that a weapon was discharged from a vehicle owned by a private military and security company contracted by the Government. We carried out an investigation and established that this was a case of mistaken identity, as none of the company's vehicles were in the area at the time.</p>

This individual returned a quantity of surplus ammunition which he alleged had been sold to him improperly by two expatriate employees, one British and one Australian, of the same private military and security company. By the time the allegation was made the two individuals who were the subject of the allegation were no longer employed on the contract in Basra, which was in the process of being wound up, nor were they in the UK. We and the head office of the company concerned investigated, taking a formal statement from the local employee and also contacting the two employees who were the subject of the allegation. Taking into account the content of the individuals' statements and the absence of any independent evidence, we determined that there were no grounds for taking the matter further.</p>

 Our embassy in Kiev regularly raises issues relating to anti-Semitism with the Ukrainian authorities, including the specific concerns about the policies and publications of the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management.

 We are very concerned about the high level of anti-Semitism in Ukraine. A poll conducted in 2006 found that one in three Ukrainians do not want Jews to be citizens, while investigations into suspected anti-Semitic attacks often fail to result in arrests. President Yushchenko has spoken out strongly and frequently against anti-Semitism and stated that he would take a resolute stance on the matter. This has resulted in a number of welcome developments: the security service and Ministry of Interior have set up units to combat racism and religious hatred; and a task force for the development of a national action plan to combat xenophobia and intolerance has been established. In 2008 a number of proposals for legislative reform that could result in tougher action against anti-Semitism were tabled.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 July 2008]: </i>As we set out in the consultation document each eco-town location will need its own approach and the consultation document only provides an indication of some of the benefits that eco-towns will provide. Also, as referred to in the consultation document, the Town and Country Planning Association have produced a best practice worksheet on community development, which is available to all those taking eco-towns forward, and provides advice about working with communities, including faith communities. We will be encouraging schemes to put this guidance into practice as individual projects are taken forward, including for example the funding and endowment of community assets which may be available to faith groups, as part of the development gain.</p>

 Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such there are many possible measures of poverty. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146;. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income before and after deducting housing costs.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 July 2008]: </i>The Department runs pilots to test the effectiveness of different approaches to service provision in achieving results and in improving the customer experience. The decision on where these pilots are operated is based on a number of different criteria. These can include the type and location of the service being tested, the customer group involved, and the location of other pilots already under way. The decision on the location of a pilot also takes account of the need to ensure the customer base is sufficiently large to make the results of the pilot meaningful. Any pilot testing a service in Wales includes testing service provision in the Welsh language. Pilots that have been run in Wales include Pathways to Work in Bridgend, Rhondda, Cynon and Taff; Swansea Bay, West Wales; and Eastern Valleys; and new deal plus for lone parents in Cardiff.</p>

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>
2. The figures provided in the tables are not seasonally adjusted. This means direct comparisons between different quarters are not possible.<br>
3. In order to provide the more detailed breakdown that is required to answer the question, a country is defined as being in the EU only from the date at which it became a member state. This means that workers from some countries (e.g. Estonia) will be counted as non-EU nationals for some years (in the case of Estonia prior to 2004) and EU nationals for other years.<br>
4. The totals for foreign nationals in Table (D) may not be equal to the sum of the corresponding numbers shown for EU and non-EU nationals&#151;Tables (D) (a) and (D) (b) respectively&#151;due to rounding.<br>
5. As these figures are based on a sample survey they are also subject to sampling variability.<br>
6. It should be noted that the nationality question in the LFS is an undercount because:<br>
it excludes those who have not been resident in the UK for six months;<br>
it excludes students in halls who do not have a UK resident parent;<br>
it excludes people in most other types of communal establishments (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites, etc);<br>
it is grossed to population estimates that only include migrants staying for 12 months or more.<br>

1. Data for Northern Ireland have only been collected since 2002-03, so the information shown is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2006-07, and for Great Britain for 1996-97 to 2001-02.<br>
2. A pensioner is defined as anyone over state pension age.<br>
3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
4. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.<br>
5. Numbers of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>
6. Small year-on-year movements should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10, percentages to the nearest whole per cent.<br>
2. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
3. Figures refer to payment accounts. Claimants with more than one account will be counted for each account. Figures only relate to accounts live and in payment as at December in each year, 2003 to 2007.<br>
4. Child benefit is administered by HM Revenue and Customs and war pensions are administered by MOD. These benefits have therefore been excluded.<br>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br>
2. Data for Northern Ireland have only been collected since 2002-03, so the information shown is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2006-07, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02.<br>
3. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
4. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years.<br>
5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or "equivalised") for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
6. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
7. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.<br>
8. The Government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. Measuring income on an after housing costs basis is appropriate, as two thirds of pensioners own their property outright and so face lower housing costs to meet from their current income while still deriving value from their home. This is different to the current working age population and to the situation for pensioners in the past. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and between pensioners over time<br>
9. As part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17 three indicators of low income poverty will be monitored: the percentage of pensioners below 60 per cent. contemporary median income, 50 per cent median income and 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices.<br>
10. Numbers of individuals in each age range have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 individuals, while proportions of individuals in each age range have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>

 There are many possible measures of poverty. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication Households Below Average Income. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income before and after deducting housing costs.</p>

Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.  <br>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br>
2. Data for Northern Ireland have only been collected since 2002-03, so the information shown is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2006-07, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02.<br>
3. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
4. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years.<br>
5. This response includes a lower income threshold of 40 per cent. of the contemporary median income. The data for households with an income lower than 50 per cent. of median are not considered to be accurate as an indicator of living standards. Many of these households while having very low incomes would not be considered poor, but who do genuinely have few sources of income in the short-run. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the FRS may not actually have the lowest living standards.<br>
6. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
7. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
8. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are.<br>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7">9. The Government&#146;s preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. Measuring income on an after housing costs basis is appropriate, as two thirds of pensioners own their property outright and so face lower housing costs to meet from their current income while still deriving value from their home. This is different to the current working age population and to the situation for pensioners in the past. Considering pensioners&#146; incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and between pensioners over time.<br>
10. As part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17 three indicators of low income poverty will be monitored: the percentage of pensioners below 60 per cent. contemporary median income, 50 per cent. median income and 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices.<br>

 Decisions about legal funding in civil cases are entirely a matter for the Legal Services Commission (LSC), which is independent of the Government.

If there are mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the guideline suggests a range of a Band C fine (125 to 175 per cent. of weekly income) to 12 weeks custody. Where the weapon was not used to threaten or cause fear but the offence was committed in dangerous circumstances, the suggested starting point is six weeks custody, with a range of a high level community order to referral to the Crown Court.

 There are currently no plans to conduct a review of the cost of telephones calls made from prisons. The National Offender Management Service continues to discuss the cost of calls with the providers but they are not contractually obliged to reduce the cost. To do this without their agreement would require a large subsidy from the taxpayer. The current contract is in place until 2011 and the re-tendering project will commence this year. Reasonable call prices for prisoners will form part of the requirements of the new contract. However, we are implementing reductions for some international calls as part of an extension to a contract with a third party supplier.</p>

 While no specific assessment has been made of the length of time taken to transfer money between young offender institutions, the timings are dependant on where the offender is transferring to and from. For example, if the money being transferred is between public prisons, then it is processed as an electronic transfer and will be actioned overnight. When a transfer takes place to other types of establishments such as contracted-out prisons or immigration detention centres (for those over 18), the money would be transferred by cheque which would be subject to the normal cheque clearing process operated by the banking system.</p>

 We currently have no plans to extend the provisions of section 11 of the Children Act 2004 to the armed forces. Working Together to Safeguard Children (HM Government 2006) provides statutory guidance on how to help safeguard and promote the welfare of children, including young people under the age of 16 who are in the armed forces as recruits or trainees, or who may be dependents of a service family, whether based in the UK or overseas. The armed forces are fully committed to co-operating with statutory and other agencies in supporting families and have procedures to help safeguard and promote the welfare of children. In addition, the Department for Children, Schools and Families continues to work closely with the Ministry of Defence and offers advice on safeguarding children and young people attached to garrisons abroad.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The administration and marking of national curriculum tests is a function of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority that is delivered independently of Government. The National Assessment Agency (NAA) oversees the marking process which is delivered by ETS Europe, the new test delivery contractor, on the QCA's behalf. I have therefore asked David Gee, Managing Director of the NAA, to write to the hon. Member. A copy of his letter has been placed in the Library.</p>

 The following table shows the percentages of secondary school children, primary school children and all children who have access to the full extended school core offer in each local authority. The core offer comprises a varied menu of activities in primary and secondary schools; high quality childcare 8 am to 6 pm 48 weeks a year in primary schools; parenting support; swift and easy access to a wide range of specialist support services such as health and social care; and wider community access to ICT, sports and arts facilities, including adult learning.</p>

The percentages have been rounded up to two decimal places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1274"><a name="80722w0069.htm_para6"><a name="080723151000234">There are many other schools which are already providing individual parts of the core offer that are not yet included in these figures. Monthly variations can occur, resulting in figures going down as well, for example as a result of local school reorganisations. By 2010 we expect all schools to be offering access to extended services.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (1) what steps he is planning to implement to reduce the gap in attainment between deaf children and their hearing peers; and if he will make a statement. [220683]</p>

 Our key priority is to personalise learning by focusing on each pupil's progression so that every child achieves their potential. Our renewed literacy strategy builds on Sir Jim Rose&#146;s independent review of the teaching of early reading by putting phonics at the heart of &#145;teaching reading in order to help to raise attainment levels amongst all pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1276"><a name="80722w0071.htm_para1"><a name="080723151001435">The review found that there was a wide range of expert support and guidance available to help schools match provision to need regarding the teaching of literacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1277"><a name="80722w0071.htm_para2"><a name="080723151001436">Through the national strategies we will continue to encourage teachers to apply inclusive principles to address issues of accessibility, including the needs of children with severe sensory impairment such as deafness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1278"><a name="80722w0071.htm_para3"><a name="080723151001437">The primary national strategy and other partners provide a range of intervention programmes to help those children who struggle most in reading and writing. These include the Every Child a Reader and Every Child a Writer programmes. The former provides intensive one to one support in reading for five and six year olds, the latter is a new pilot currently under development but will include one-to-one intervention in years three and four in the areas of writing that children find hardest to master.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1279"><a name="80722w0071.htm_para4"><a name="080723151001438">Extra help is available for those children who need it to prevent them from falling behind: we provide early literacy support (ELS&#151;year 1), Y3 literacy support (Y3LS) and further literacy support (FLS&#151;year 5). These three packages are designed to help those children who, without additional help would not reach level 4 at the end of year 6.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> We are not aware of any specific research into the effect of stress caused by bullying in schools. However, we are aware that many external studies link being bullied to outcomes such as anxiety, depression, lowered self-esteem and, in extreme cases, suicide. The Anti-Bullying Alliance has carried out a number of research projects on behalf of my Department around various aspects of bullying, and the findings have informed our wider work to prevent and tackle this happening in schools. My Department has also recently tendered for research into the effectiveness of our anti-bullying strategies.</p>

 Violence to school staff is rare but any incident is one too many. We have therefore made it clear that head teachers may permanently exclude pupils for violence, even for a first offence. We are also helping to reduce the risk of violence through a national programme to strengthen schools&#146; capacity to manage pupils&#146; behaviour. This includes giving schools access to specialist training and advice, strengthening their legal powers to discipline pupils, reaffirming their legal power to use reasonable force to restrain pupils, giving them legal power to search pupils for weapons and encouraging them to form safer school partnerships that base police officers in schools. Sir Alan Steer is advising on how the programme could be further strengthened.</p>

 The Learning and Skills Council has responsibility for ensuring that there is sufficient, good quality provision for post-16 learners in further education delivered by FE colleges and providers in England.

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The Government have put in place a significant programme of action to improve levels of educational attainment among the prison population in England and Wales. Funding for offender learning has more than trebled since the predecessors of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Children, Schools and Families took responsibility for offender learning in 2001 and is expected to exceed &#163;170 million in 2008-09. We have introduced heads of learning and skills in prisons to take day to day responsibility for managing the learning and skills. Prisons are now subject to the same inspection arrangements as the rest of the further education sector, delivered by Ofsted and Estyn. Inspection outcomes are improving and the proportion of failed inspections are falling to similar levels as those in community adult learning settings. In England we have given responsibility for planning and funding offender learning to the Learning and Skills Council, operating collaboratively with the National Offender Management Service in commissioning the service to be delivered. Since the Learning and Skills Council took responsibility for the service, participation rates have risen from an estimated 36 per cent. in the 2006-07 academic year to 39 per cent. in the August 2007 to May 2008. Similar arrangements apply in Wales, with the director of offender management Wales playing a significant role in planning the service.</p>

Over the working life, the average graduate will earn comfortably over &#163;100,000 more, after tax and in today's valuation, than a similar individual who completed their education with two or more A-levels.</p>

For new entrants to full-time higher education in 2008/09 we have increased the means-testing threshold below which students are entitled to a full maintenance grant up from &#163;17,910 for entrants in 2007/08 to &#163;25,000. The threshold for a partial grant will increase from &#163;38,330 for entrants in 2007/08 to &#163;60,005. These thresholds relate to household income. This will mean that one third of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008/09 are expected to be entitled to a full non-repayable grant worth &#163;2,835 and another one third are expected to be entitled to a partial grant of between &#163;50 and &#163;2,835. Due to these reforms, by 2011 the number of students receiving some level of grant will increase by around 100,000. As part of this change, an extra 50,000 students will receive a full grant.</p>

There is no similar requirement for advance notification for the current income contingent repayment (ICR) student loans which have a low interest rate exemption from arrangements governing consumer credit agreements. ICR statements are issued in September each year for those borrowers whose loans are not yet in repayment.

The brokerage service has played an important part in the development of Train to Gain. It has helped engage a high proportion of hard to reach employers, many of which are small businesses.

In the case of testing for the presence of marine biotoxins, the benefits of such testing are the protection of public health by ensuring that consumers are not exposed to biotoxins present in molluscan shellfish. In view of this, we have no plan to revoke or amend any project licences that have been granted authorising marine biotoxins testing. However, the Home Office is committed to the replacement of both the PSP and DSP bioassays. To this end, Home Office officials are working closely with the Food Standards Agency, as competent authority for food safety, and those contracted by them to perform routine monitoring for shellfish toxins, to progress replacements.</p>

There are now about 500 SSPs of one form or another. Evaluations have shown that they are proving effective in improving behaviour and attendance, developing strong and positive relationships between the police and young people, and to help young people develop a sense of being part of the local community.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The UK Border Agency has a current contract with G4S to carry out enforcement of deportation. Additional firms are approved and used as required on case by case basis to provide capacity over and above the contract. Owing to the commercial nature of these contracts, if we were to release the information requested on the financial value of each such contract, in each of the next five years this would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of both the UK Border Agency and those companies with whom the UK Border Agency enters into contracts.

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences are less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative systems generated by the courts and police force. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

Persons admitted in this category are allowed to stay for an initial period of five years, after which they may apply for indefinite leave to remain.

<i>  [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The concession for gap year entrants allows applicants to be aged 17, 18 or 19 when they apply under the concession. A participant in the scheme can enter and remain in the UK for up to 12 months on a gap year entry clearance, and this is not affected by any birthday he may have while in the UK.

<i> [holding answer 29 February 2008]:</i> Over the last 12 months we have drawn up plans for the biggest ever shake-up of Britain's border security. This year we will make the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1408"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para1"><a name="08072427002333">We have put in place fingerprint checks before we issue a visa anywhere in the world. We have already delivered 1.4 million sets of finger scans, generating over 14,000 hits and bringing to notice 1,255 cases of identity swaps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1409"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para2"><a name="08072427002334">In February, we introduced large on the spot fines for employers who don't make the right checks. In financial year 2006-07, there were 15 successful prosecutions including cautions under section 8, and 21 so far this financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1410"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para3"><a name="08072427002335">Last month we introduced the first stage of the points based system as part of a phased approach to manage the flow of migrants coming to the UK. Applicants under the points based system will earn points for their skills and the potential they show for economic success, competence in the English language and ability to support themselves and their dependents. It is a simple, transparent and objective process that enables us to ensure that only those migrants who benefit the UK can come here to work or study. So far over 1,800 applications have been received under tier 1, highly skilled migrant workers. Future tiers will include students, skilled workers, youth mobility and temporary workers.</p>

The new agency will protect our border with single immigration and customs checks, tackle smuggling, immigration crime and border tax fraud, and implement fast and fair decisions.</p>

Airline liaison officers have assisted in preventing nearly 180,000 people boarding planes over the last five years. That's equivalent to about two jumbo jets a week. In 2007 our strengthening of cross channel border controls stopped 17,658 individual attempts to cross the channel illegally. Additionally at juxtaposed controls in France and Belgium we have refused over 6,000 people entry to the UK. This means the number of illegal immigrants arriving in Kent from juxtaposed locations has reduced by 86 per cent. since 2002.</p>

 Procedures and supporting systems for reporting lost, stolen and recovered British passports were introduced in December 2003. Since then the Identity and Passport Service has provided a range of management information on the number of passports that have been processed under these arrangements. In 2007 there were 251,751 reports of lost passports and 41,393 reports of stolen passports. In addition, 10,428 passports were reported under the &#147;other&#148; category, which includes those damaged or destroyed.

<i>  [holding answer 10 July 2008]:</i> Since April there has been a neighbourhood policing team in every area&#151;meeting the Government's commitment. Neighbourhood policing gives local communities a role in deciding policing priorities by working with them to identify and tackle local problems together, as well as providing a highly visible presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1429"><a name="80722w0095.htm_para0"><a name="08072427004835">Both Sir Ronnie Flanagan's review of policing and the Casey review &#145;Engaging Communities in Fighting Crime&#146; contain recommendations about how best to embed neighbourhood policing and ensure communities have a say in how they are policed. In the forthcoming policing Green Paper the new police pledge will take forward many of the recommendations and will set out new national standards for the police service to ensure the public receive visible, accountable and responsive policing.</p>

 The Home Office police funding formula is designed to assess the relative need for resources between police authorities in England and Wales. The formula does not assign specific funding for any particular aspect of policing. Allocation of resources to specific areas of work within a force is a matter for the police authority and chief officer.</p>

These proposals envisage withdrawing from Swinson house and retaining Hilary house but no decisions have been taken. As with all HMRC&#146;s proposals, these will be subject to consultation with internal and external stakeholders, including MPs with a constituency interest, and detailed feasibility work will also be undertaken before final decisions are made.
