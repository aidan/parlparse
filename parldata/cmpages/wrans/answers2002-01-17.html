<a name="20117w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he expects the NAO's report into the organisation of the Warship Support Modernisation project to be published; if he will list the representations made to his Department on this matter; and if he will make a statement.  [25867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The NAO were commissioned by the Warship Support Agency Management Board to undertake an assurance audit of the Warship Support Modernisation evaluation and value for money analysis processes. While NAO reports are normally conducted for Parliament after public money has been spent, officials have asked them in this case to act in advance of any expenditure and to advise them principally on the soundness of the assessment processes. This work is being undertaken for the Warship Support Agency and is not a formal NAO investigation which would be published and presented to Parliament. The assurance audit is continuing and it is expected to be completed before the end of this month. No decision has yet been taken on the publication of this report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will grant the funds necessary to finance <i>(a)</i> blood and <i>(b)</i> saliva tests for radiation pioneered by Dundee university.  [28058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w01.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has been approached in the past to grant funds to Dundee university for such studies into the possible radiation exposure of nuclear test veterans. We have declined to do so because there are reservations about the capabilities of the proposed techniques for estimating historic radiation doses. Other studies using these techniques have found them to be inconclusive when there is a considerable time lapse since exposure, and where the exposure is low. These constraints were found to be particularly so in an age group typical of British nuclear test veterans.

<P>
<a name="20117w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We continue to monitor events in the province of central Sulawesi closely. Sporadic clashes between Muslims and Christians in and around Poso, and more recently between Muslims and the security forces, continued after three Christian militia leaders were sentenced to death on 5 April 201 for their part in killings in May and June 2000. On 19 November 2001, the Supreme Court in Jakarta dismissed appeals by the three militia leaders against the death sentence.
<P>

<a name="20117w02.html_para3">On 23 November 2001, our charg&#233; d'affaires in Jakarta raised our concerns about the escalating violence with Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian Co-ordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs. Mr. Yudhoyono confirmed that police and military reinforcements had been despatched to Poso to help contain the situation. During a visit to Central Sulawesi on 5 December 2001, Mr. Yudhoyono announced that President Megawati had ordered a six-month security restoration plan for the province. The Indonesian Government subsequently brokered an agreement between the warring factions to end the fighting which was signed on 20 December. This appears to be holding up reasonably well, although four bombs exploded outside churches in the region on new year's eve. The culprits are unknown but both Christian and Muslim leaders have appealed for calm.

 The discovery of the arms shipment on the Karine A is a serious matter. We have seen evidence linking the shipment to Palestinian officials.

In a meeting with President Arafat on 15 January I urged him to investigate Palestinian involvement thoroughly and present his findings quickly.

<P>
<a name="20117w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce a new, additional benefit for members of the mineworkers' pension scheme on the lowest incomes, at a cost of &#163;90 million. This will be funded out of the Government's share of the scheme's reserves.
<P>

<a name="20117w04.html_para5">The package will help mineworkers' pension scheme members who have only very modest miners' pensions, despite many years of service to the industry before 1975. Help for that particular group was identified as a priority in discussions with the scheme's trustees. Now, thanks to gains in the scheme's value under the Government's guarantee, the Government and Trustees have agreed a package of benefits, which includes special one-off payments for up to 66,000 of these members, alongside the 9 per cent. bonus for all members agreed earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="20117w04.html_para6">These lump sum payments will apply to members with at least five years service who left British Coal before or shortly after 1975 and who are on low pensions, defined on a sliding scale from not more than &#163;5 a week after five years' service to not more than &#163;10 a week after 10 or more years' service. The amounts they will receive will depend on their length of pensionable service and the current value of their pensions. Those with the longest service and the lowest pensions will receive the most. Payments, will range between &#163;200 (e.g. for someone with, five years' service on &#163;4 to &#163;5 a week, or with 10 years' service on &#163;9 to &#163;10 a week) and &#163;2,000 (for someone with 10 or more years' service on less than &#163;1 a week). Details will appear in the next edition of the mineworker's pension scheme newsletter.
<P>

<a name="20117w04.html_para7">Members will not need to claim the money&#151;most of those eligible, including all the existing pensioners, are expected to be paid in May, with the remainder paid within the next 18 months.
<P>

<a name="20117w04.html_para8">The Government and the Trustees of the two former British Coal pension schemes, the mineworkers' pension scheme and the British Coal staff superannuation scheme, have also agreed a joint statement agreeing a review of arrangements for the Government's guarantee of members' basic pension benefits. The text of that statement is as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In 1994, when British Coal was privatised, the Government agreed to guarantee benefits already built up in the Corporation's pension schemes. These arrangements have served the members of the schemes very well, providing the basis for average pension increases of some 30 per cent. since 1994. Without the Government's guarantee, these closed schemes would have had to pursue entirely different investment strategies, based primarily on holding bonds, and would not have been able to pay anything like these increases.
<P>
<BR>
However, both the Government and the Trustees recognise that there have been changes in circumstances since 1994. They have therefore agreed to explore how these changes might best be reflected in revisions to the 1994 arrangements which would

One of the mobile testing units has been deployed at Mansfield since mid-October 2001.

<a name="20117w05.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 On its own the opening of a new WTO trade round will have little impact on UK manufacturing. This is because the opening of the round merely launches multilateral negotiations. A fuller assessment of the impact on UK manufacturing and the UK economy overall should come after the hoped for successful conclusions of those negotiations. World wide reductions in industrial tariffs should, for example, lead to both improved market access for UK manufacturing overseas and lower cost sources of components. Negotiations start with an expectation of significant benefits. A halving of WTO members' tariffs, for example, could increase world incomes by around $200 billion a year. UK manufacturers could be expected to benefit significantly from such increases in world incomes.

 Leprosy is a curable disease, and treatment provided in the early stages averts disability. Three quarters of a million cases are still detected each year, of which about 70 per cent. are in India. Ten developing countries account for 90 per cent. of cases. An effective drug cure is available free of charge via the World Health Organisation (WHO) in sufficient quantities to treat all people diagnosed with the disease. The priority now is to get treatment to all who need it, especially in isolated rural areas. To eliminate the disease, political commitment in the key endemic countries is needed along with the successful integration of leprosy treatment into strengthened general health services. Our strategy is to support the creation of basic health care systems&#151;encompassing the public, private and informal sectors&#151;to improve poor people's access to the care, services and essential health products to safeguard their health. Within the foreseeable future it should be possible to reduce the prevalence of the disease to such a low level that it no longer constitutes a public health problem.

<P>
<a name="20117w08.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 There have been no instances of fraud within the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers during the period since 1 May 1997 and no cost to its budget.

<a name="20117w08.html_para1">There have been no instances of fraud within the Serious Fraud Office since 1 May 1997 and no cost to its budget.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para2">Although the Treasury Solicitor's Department has suffered three frauds since 1 May 1997, none has involved any cost to the budget of that Department. The first, in 1998, was a fraud within Government Property Lawyers, which at that time was a separate agency, and involved the improper use of client money, resulting in a loss of &#163;1.2 million to the Exchequer. The second, in 2000, was the theft of jewellery to the value of &#163;250 which reduced the proceeds of Bona Vacantia to the Consolidated Fund. The third, in 2001, involved the misappropriation of &#163;170,000 from the proceeds of Bona Vacantia through the use of forged wills. The loss was to the Consolidated Fund. Of the sum lost, &#163;47,000 has since been recovered and action continues to recover further sums. Details of the three frauds are set out in the Annual Fraud Report, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para3">There have been seven instances of fraud against the Crown Prosecution Service since 1 May 1997 involving a total cost to the budget of &#163;8,426.98.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para4">Fraud is treated seriously by all the Departments for which the Attorney-General is responsible. There are cost implications against budgets from maintaining proactive systems of financial control and governance seeking to ensure fraud against the Departments does not occur. Such costs are, however, an integral part of the general management of the Departments and are not separately assessable.

<a name="20117w08.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The HMCPSI report on London was published 13 December 2001. The substance of any Inspectorate report is always the subject of discussion between the Law Officers in their capacity as superintending Ministers and the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is the Head of the Crown Prosecution Service. In this instance, the Attorney-General and I have been closely involved in decisions about the response to the report from the time when it appeared from the emerging finding that there were a number of issues of concern to be addressed. Additionally, I have undertaken a series of visits to units in London to establish at first-hand what have been particular problems which CPS London faces.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para5">The environment in which CPS London operates and has operated since its creation makes it different from any other CPS area&#151;in particular, the transient nature of the population and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified and unqualified staff. Now that better funding arrangements have been put in place it should be possible to recruit staff "to the level required" and to ensure that basic systems are maintained. The area is currently involved in a rolling recruitment campaign to increase the numbers of lawyers and administrative staff employed in London.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para6">The area is currently involved in a rolling recruitment campaign to increase the numbers of lawyers and administrative staff employed in London.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para7">The area will be producing by the end of January a detailed "action plan" which will address all recommendations made by the CPS Inspectorate. The Attorney-General and I will take a close interest in the implementation of the plan, and this will be followed by a review.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para8">Senior management have completed a review which is now being implemented. This has meant an increase in the number of Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutors from three to five, who exercise firmer control of the units for which they are responsible.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para9">Much has been done already to address issues of concern, working with the police. These include dealing with the number of ineffective trials and the high rate of discharged committals. By adopting this approach the area should be able to build upon the many features of their operation which were commended by HMCPSI.
<P>

<a name="20117w08.html_para10">Finally, a Ministerial Committee, which I chair, has been established which focuses on criminal justice system issues as a whole in London.

 Government policy on these matters is set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, and the concordats on International Relations and Co-ordination of European Policy Issues, agreed between the Government and the devolved Administrations.
<P>

<a name="20117w09.html_para0">In accordance with these agreements, the Scottish Executive are involved in formulating the UK policy position on issues which touch on matters within their responsibility. They may also form part of the UK delegation at Council of Ministers meetings where matters with a significant impact on their devolved responsibilities are to be discussed, and speak for the UK in appropriate cases, with the agreement of the lead UK Minister.

<a name="20117w09.html_para1">It is for the Scottish Executive to agree with the lead UK Minister on those occasions where they wish to attend. They have done so on a regular basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action has been taken in response to the named civil servant in his Department, Dr. Peter Doyle, who was criticised in the report of the public inquiry into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, 1984 to 1995.  [29079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Department commissioned independent assessors to lead a review of the inquiry report and other relevant information and make recommendations on whether or not any action should be initiated in respect of Dr. Doyle. The assessors were Lesley James, former Vice President of the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development and Sir David Carter, Vice Principal of Edinburgh university. Their overall conclusion was that Dr. Doyle responded appropriately to the information he was given by Dr. Bolsin on 19 July 1994 about poor results following paediatric cardiac surgery in the Bristol unit, taking into account the context in which he was operating at the time. They concluded that while it is possible with hindsight to question Dr. Doyle's decision not to examine the detailed data he was given by Dr. Bolsin, any criticism has to be balanced both against the prompt and positive action he did take in writing to Professor Angelini at the trust, raising the concerns that had been drawn to his attention and seeking reassurances, and against the subsequent assurances he was given. The Chief Executive of the Department of Health, Nigel Crisp, has accepted their conclusions, including the recommendation that no disciplinary action is warranted and that Dr. Doyle should resume his current duties in the Department, working as the senior medical officer providing advice on renal services and transplant services&#151;which he has done.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 19 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 33&#150;34W, on London Underground, how many lost passenger hours in 2000&#150;01 were attributable to the Infracos and how many to London Underground; what is the total equivalent number of Infraco-attributable lost customer hours for the whole of 2001&#150;02 so far; what penalty would have been incurred by each Infraco during 2000&#150;01 as a result of the attributable lost customer hours; and what penalty would have been incurred by each Infraco for 2001&#150;02 so far.  [22751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 London Underground have been "shadow running" the PPP contracts in the public sector since April 2000 to ensure they are robust for transfer to the private sector. In the light of that experience the initial performance benchmarks have been reset, generally to make the benchmark level of performance higher. This means that there will be realistic benchmarks in place from the start of the PPP contracts. As a result London Underground and not the Infraco will benefit from improvements in performance in the period before transfer of the infrastructure companies to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="20117w10.html_para0">Data on lost customer hours and Infraco penalties are operational matters for London Underground, who have provided the information below.
<P>

<a name="20117w10.html_para1">During 2000&#150;01, 18 million indicative lost customer hours were attributable to London Underground. For the lost customer hour figures for the Infracos for the same period, I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 19 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 33&#150;34W. For the period 1 April to 11 December 2001, 13 million indicative lost customer hours were attributable to the Infracos.
<P>

<a name="20117w10.html_para2">For 2000&#150;01, the abatement figures (penalty payments to London Underground incurred by Infracos) would, on the basis of the set of benchmarks then in place, have been: &#163;6 million for Infraco BCV; and &#163;2 million each for Infracos JNP and SSL.
<P>

<a name="20117w10.html_para3">For the period 1 April to 11 December 2001, on the basis of the earlier benchmarks, the abatement figure for Infraco SSL would have been &#163;9 million. Infracos BCV and JNP would have received bonus payments from London Underground of &#163;3 million and &#163;1 million respectively. Levels of payment would have been different, and generally lower, on the basis of the reset benchmarks. London Underground will shortly set the final performance benchmarks based on performance during shadow running of the contracts.

 No such estimate has been made. PFI contracts are for the provision of a service in return for a unitary payment to cover the costs of the assets, their maintenance and operation. The unitary payment is not broken down into constituent parts. The Highways Agency's contract for the new Traffic Control Centre is the only PFI contract let by DTLR which allows the contractor to generate additional revenues to the income it will receive through the unitary payment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will accept students for registration under the individual learning accounts scheme who could not register by the deadline of 7 December 2001 because of a subsequent decision to close the scheme on 23 November 2001; what representations have been made to her about such closures; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="20117w12.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> The Department has received representations from hon. Members, learners and learning providers about the inability to register learning onto the ILA system between 23 November and 7 December.
<P>

<a name="20117w12.html_para0">The ILA programme was closed down on Friday 23 November following evidence of serious potential fraud and theft and it is the Department's first duty to safeguard both public funds and the interests of individual learners. I do recognise the impact the decision to withdraw the programme will have on learners; however, because the programme is now closed, learning that was not booked onto the ILA system before 23 November will not be eligible for a discount. We cannot therefore accept account holders for registration who could not register by the deadline of 7 December because of the decision to close down the programme on 23 November.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Officials and I have met with a number of leading providers and provider representative organisations. They have offered us some helpful views on the previous ILA scheme as well as constructive ideas on what a new ILA-style programme might look like. We are now seeking the views of a wider group of providers and a range of other stakeholders.

 The Department employed a team of four who were responsible for day-to-day performance monitoring, issue resolution, contract finance and budget management. These people, supported by specialists employed within the Department were also engaged in matters relating to the 7 December planned closure of the individual learning account programme.

 The table shows school premises repair or renewal costs over the next five years for each local education authority. The figures are derived from data supplied by LEAs from their asset management plans over the past two years. The costs relate to work needed to restore buildings to a serviceable state, but do not cover improvement, modernisation or sufficiency issues. Costs have been adjusted to current prices and to take account of regional variations in pricing levels.

<a name="20117w12.html_para2">Details have not been included for the City of London, Isles of Scilly and the 15 LEAs that are reassessing their condition needs following last year's AMP appraisal exercise.

 The numbers of Personal Advisers (PAs) working in Connexions Partnerships since the Service was launched in April 2001 have risen steadily as partnerships have established their infrastructures. At the end of November, 1,820 PAs were in post in the 15 partnerships that are fully operational, representing nearly three quarters of the first year's PA recruitment estimates provided by Partnerships in their business plans.
<P>

<a name="20117w14.html_para0">PAs are being recruited from a range of backgrounds, including careers, education and youth services. Steps have been taken to widen the age and ethnic mix of PAs. Data from PA training records indicate that 12 per cent. of

 A total of 2,123 student places were made available on 40 prototype foundation degree programmes. Of these programmes, 32 commenced in September 2001 and offered 1,539 student places. 85 per cent. (1,303) of these places were filled. The remaining eight programmes are on offer from January 2002. Figures relating to take up of these places will not be available until February 2002.
<P>

<a name="20117w14.html_para1">In addition to the 40 prototype programmes, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocated 1,790 additional student numbers for delivery of a further 29 courses. These student places were funded through HEFCE's mainstream funding routes and information on the take up of these places is collated as part of their management information cycle. This information is expected February 2002.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The costs of increases in the basic state pension and state pension are net of income related benefit savings that would be generated by these increases.<P>

2. The costs given for earnings uprating of state second pension assume that expenditure on SERPS (accruals up to 2001&#150;02) would not be affected.<P>

3. The costs of earnings uprating of the state second pension only begin to become significant by 2015 because S2P only begins accruing in 2002&#150;03 and therefore the amount of S2P in payment will be negligible for some time after that.<P>

4. The costs shown for state second pension in the table have been calculated based on the estimated costs of S2P which were shown in the report by the Government Actuary on the Financial Effects on the National Insurance Fund of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill 1999 (Cm 4573). The costs shown are the increase in expenditure over and above the baseline projected S2P expenditure shown in this report.<P>

5. It has been assumed that the basic state pension and state pension changes would not happen together. If they did, there would be an interaction because the Lower Earnings Limit is linked to the basic state pension. This means that the cost of S2P would be reduced if the basic state pension and, therefore, the LEL were raised.<P>

6. Average earnings are assumed to grow in line with Treasury economic assumptions until the end of the Parliament and then 1.5 per cent. above inflation over time.<P>

7. The pensioner population is assumed to grow according to GAD's central population growth estimates.<P>

<a name="20117w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The objective of the basic state pension, since it was introduced in 1948, has always been to provide a foundation for income in retirement on which individuals could build their own second pension or other savings income. The Government are committed to retaining the basic state pension in this role as well as making it easier to build up second pensions, whether through private stakeholder pensions or the new state second pension (which will particularly help people on low pay or with broken work records such as carers or disabled). In addition, the Government are committed to tackling pensioner poverty directly with the minimum income guarantee and ensuring that thrift is rewarded through the pension credit.

<a name="20117w18.html_para4">The cost of the Millennium Experience includes the National Programme of events and activities. Also included is the London Riverside new year's eve celebrations of 31 December 1999. Negative figures shown in the table against 2001 result from rebates and savings on costs provided for in previous years' account.In addition, from 1 July 2001, when the lease of NMEC ended, English Partnerships, the Government's urban regeneration agency, has incurred &#163;1.5 million on care and maintenance related costs, &#163;6.4 million on decommissioning the Dome contents in preparation for a future use and about &#163;2.2 million in relation to the current sale process, up to 31 December 2001. The cost of the previous competition to find a long-term use for the Dome, which began in March 1999 and ended at the beginning of 2001, was &#163;6.7 million. All these costs will be met from within English Partnerships' normal budget, and recovered from eventual sale proceeds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much has been spent on fees for advisers to the <i>(a)</i> Government and <i>(b)</i> New Millennium Experience Company for the Dome project.  [22693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w18.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) paid &#163;82,000 to consultants for specific advisory work in connection with the potential sale of the Millennium Dome. In terms of supplying details of all other advice for all aspects of the project, an accurate figure could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20117w18.html_para5">English Partnerships, the Government's regeneration agency, responsible for managing the Dome sale process on behalf of the Government, is expected to incur costs in the order of &#163;2.2 million for the current sale process up to 31 December 2001. This largely relates to consultants' costs for the market testing and other matters associated with the on-going sale process. The cost of the previous competition for the sale of the Dome, which began in March 1999 and ended at the beginning of 2001, was &#163;6.7 million. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport incurred costs of &#163;68,495 for legal advice relating to the sale process during this period.

<P>

<a name="20117w18.html_para6">An estimated (still to be finalised) &#163;17,600 is likely to be incurred by DCMS for advice received in relation to the appointment of liquidators to NMEC in December 2001.

 Local authorities are responsible for rents charged to sports clubs which are located on their property, and the Government have no scope to dictate the amounts charged.
<P>

<a name="20117w18.html_para9">Local authorities can already grant discretionary rate relief of up to 100 per cent. to sports clubs, and the majority do so. However, sport's governing and representative bodies have asked the Government to provide greater certainty for local clubs. I therefore welcome the Charity Commission's announcement of 30 November 2001 that community amateur sports clubs may now apply for registered charitable status. Eligible clubs which successfully apply to become charities will enjoy a range of financial benefits including mandatory rate relief of 80 per cent. (which may be topped-up to 100 per cent. at the discretion of local authorities).

<a name="20117w19.html_para2">The introduction of the radically improved Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in June 2000 represented a difficult challenge for both scheme managers. The national shortage of gas heating engineers has led to severe delays in some areas in the installation and repair of central heating systems. Both scheme managers have worked hard to recruit installers and to improve the quality of service provided to householders. The Department continues to maintain a close watch on their performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what provision there is within the warm front schemes to allow the most vulnerable households who are in immediate danger of risking their health because of lack of heating to queue jump the waiting list for grants during the winter months; how many households were allowed to queue jump in each month since April 2000; and what plans she has to review the first-come, first-served system of Warm Front grants during the present review of the grants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 January 2002]:</i> The Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES). HEES is marketed as the Warm Front Team. Two scheme managers, Eaga Partnership Ltd. and TXU Warm Front Ltd. administer the scheme.
<P>

<a name="20117w19.html_para3">HEES has been developed to help tackle the problem of fuel poverty, those who spend 10 per cent. or more of their income staying warm. Fuel poverty is caused by a combination of energy inefficient housing and low incomes. Certain people are particularly vulnerable to cold-related ill health&#151;the old, families with children, the disabled and the long term sick. HEES is targeted at these priority households and all applicants are therefore treated equally.
<P>

<a name="20117w19.html_para4">We have no intention of removing the current first-come approach. Any prioritising system would be complex to administer and likely to dissuade households from the scheme. Instead, we believe it is better to concentrate resources on reducing the time taken to install measures on all households.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 January 2002]:</i> The Regulations place a monitoring duty on the Environment Agency. The agency continues to trace businesses which should be subject to the packaging regulations and they have the powers to monitor businesses which they believe should be subject to the regulations. It is impossible to estimate the number of businesses that might still be evading their producer responsibility obligations. However, comparison of the data derived from obligated businesses with estimates derived from materials organisations and making allowance for businesses outside the scope of the regulations because they do not satisfy turnover and packaging tonnage threshold limits, the amount of packaging not accounted for is probably less than 2 per cent. of the total. The Environment Agency's compliance plan for 2001&#150;02 has provision to check on more than 2,000 businesses and the agency is on schedule to fulfil that commitment. The number of registrations under the regulations (which includes individual businesses and groups of companies) has continued to rise, from 5,451 at the end of 2000 to 5,629 now.
<P>

<a name="20117w19.html_para5">Agency enforcement is steadily improving. There were 38 prosecutions in 2001 (a total of 72 since the start of the agency's enforcement programme in 1998). Fines are on average higher, with fines totalling &#163;152,350 (average &#163;4,000) in 2001, compared to only &#163;63,878 (average &#163;2,060) in 2000 in 31 cases. The highest fine last year reached &#163;25,000. As fines increase, so does their deterrent effect.

<P>
<a name="20117w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what estimates she has made of the cost to <i>(a)</i> public funds 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2002 : Column 478W</I><P>
and <i>(b)</i> land managers of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Uncultivated Land and Semi-Natural Areas) (England) Regulations 2001;  [27140]
<P>
<UL>(2) what consultations were undertaken, with whom, prior to the laying before Parliament of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Uncultivated Land and Semi-Natural Areas) (England) Regulations 2001.  [27138]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w21.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2002]:</i> The cost to public funds and land managers cannot be estimated accurately without knowing in advance the number of projects subject to EIA. As part of the Regulatory Impact Assessment, it was estimated that the cost to DEFRA might be in the region of &#163;0.1 to &#163;0.2 million per annum. Costs to land managers will vary depending on the nature, size and potential impacts of the project and whether any changes need to be made in the light of the assessment. As an illustration it was calculated that the costs arising from 100 projects subject to an application, of which 10 led to preparation of an Environmental Statement prepared by a consultant, could be around &#163;20,000 to &#163;28,000.
<P>

<a name="20117w21.html_para0">Two formal consultations were carried out in 2001; the first in May on the options for implementation elicited 42 responses; the second in September, with detailed proposals, received 32 responses. Respondents included statutory agencies (English Nature, English Heritage, Environment Agency and Countryside Agency) and bodies representing environmental and historic interests and the farming industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her decision to apply for planning permission for the mass burial of animal carcases at Great Orton.  [27137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w21.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2002]:</i> The mass burial site at Great Orton is Crown property and, as such, planning permission was not required for its use. However, to fall in line with best practice DEFRA applied for a retrospective Notice of Proposed Development and Environmental Statement on 4 December 2001.

<P>
<a name="20117w21.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what the age and status are of children in a household for that household to be deemed vulnerable under the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy; and how many such households with children there are in <i>(a)</i> private sector housing and <i>(b)</i> public sector housing in England;  [26425]
<P>
<UL>(2) what age a person must be for their household to be classified as vulnerable under the fuel poverty definition; and how many such households there are in <i>(a)</i> private sector housing and <i>(b)</i> public sector housing in England.  [26424]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Householders aged 60 years or more, families with children under 16 and those that are disabled or suffering from a long-term illness are all regarded as being particularly vulnerable to cold-related ill-health.




<P>
<P><I>17 Jan 2002 : Column 479W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20117w21.html_para1">The number of fuel poor households in England in 1998 is set out in Table 4.1 of the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy. This shows that out of the 2.7 million vulnerable households in fuel poverty in England in 1998, 2 million were in private sector housing and 0.7 million in social housing.
<P>

<a name="20117w21.html_para2">Chart 4.2 of the strategy shows that in 1998, some 14 per cent. or half a million fuel poor households had a child under 16. It is not possible to estimate the breakdown of this between different housing tenures.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many regulatory impact assessments have been produced by his Department since August 2001; and if he will list those produced <i>(a)</i> following initial consultation with affected parties about the most appropriate methodology for assessing costs and other impacts and <i>(b)</i> which set out full commercial impacts, including profitability, employment, consumer prices and competitiveness, as recommended in Good Policy Making.  [28397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20117w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Full regulatory impact assessments are placed in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="20117w21.html_para3">The Good Policy Making Guide recommends that policy makers take early soundings from affected parties. The results of these informal consultations are not required to be produced in a RIA at this stage. However, Departments are advised to include a partial RIA in formal consultations. Consultations can be accessed via www.ukonline.gov.uk/citizenspace/consultations/.
<P>

<a name="20117w21.html_para4">The Good Policy Making Guide does recommend that as part of the RIA's assessment of costs and benefits, any additional costs and indirect costs should be identified and quantified stating who or what bears them.
<P>

<a name="20117w21.html_para5">There is no specific requirement in the Good Policy Making Guide to consult on appropriate methodology, nor is there a specific requirement to set out the information at <i>(b)</i>. The information is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
