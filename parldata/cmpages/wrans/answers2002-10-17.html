The construction of a flyover at Countess roundabout is part of this scheme and, subject to the completion of statutory procedures, is expected to open in Summer 2006.<P>

The A303 Chicklade Bottom&#151;Mere Improvement is one of the schemes that were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS). The study recommended that this improvement should be taken forward to provide, with other improvements to the A303, an improved strategic route into the south west of England, and is supported by the South West Regional Assembly. The representations received on the study are being reviewed and an announcement will be made in due course.<P>

<P>
<a name="21017w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Djanogly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport to what extent airports have powers to restrict aircraft use by reference to engine noise levels. [74827]

<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Restrictions on aircraft use by reference to engine noise levels must be compatible with the recommended standards and resolutions of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and with the relevant directives and regulations of the European Union, in particular Directive 2002/30/EC on rules and procedures relating to operating restrictions at airports. Subject to these constraints, and to the airport's licence conditions, an airport may restrict the access of aircraft on noise grounds, either absolutely or subject to conditions, provided it does so in a non-discriminatory fashion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the Government's Code of Practice on Written Consultation applies to multi-modal studies; and if he will make a statement.  [75604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In certain circumstances Ministers can decide to depart from elements of the Code of Practice on Written Consultation issued by the Cabinet Office in December 2000. We decided in October 2001 that the Multi-Modal Studies should not be bound by the Code's requirement for a 12-week consultation period for their consultation exercises.
<P>

<a name="21017w01.html_para1">The main reason for departing from the Code is that consultation is not a one-off exercise but an integral part of the Study process. Key stakeholders and the wider public are consulted at various stages during a Study. In addition to specific consultation events, members of the public and key partners are kept informed of progress through tailor made leaflets and newsletters. Most Studies have also established specific websites or have a page within the Government Office website where key documents are posted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when he plans to propose a Harbour Revision Order to reconstitute the Dart Harbour and Navigation Authority; and if he will make a statement.  [74549]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have received an application from the Authority itself for a Harbour Revision Order to reconstitute the Dart Harbour and Navigation Authority. This Order was formally advertised (in accordance with Schedule 3 of the Harbours Act 1964) in May and June of this year. No formal objections were received during the 42 day period for such objections to be made and we hope to be in a position to make this Order in the near future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A new European Directive is in the closing stages of agreement that will, subject to final negotiation between the Member States and the European Parliament, require sulphur-free petrol and diesel to be widely available from 1 January 2005, with all petrol and diesel sold for road-use being sulphur-free from 1 January 2009. This Directive is expected to be adopted in the coming months.

<P>

<a name="21017w01.html_para2">Two recent initiatives will ensure sulphur free petrol and diesel fuel is increasingly available in the UK over the next few years.
<P>

<a name="21017w01.html_para3">In his last Budget statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced plans to introduce duty incentives favouring sulphur free fuels in 2003, subject to agreement with the European Commission. This announcement was aimed at providing the oil industry with early notification so that they could plan their investment in the necessary refining technology accordingly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 With the expiry of the call-out order made last October, a new order has been made to enable reservists to continue to be called out into service to support military operations in Afghanistan and related operations arising as part of the campaign against international terrorism. The new order is effective until 30 September 2003. Over 500 reservists were called out under the order made last October, of whom over half were called out compulsorily. The reservists are providing an invaluable contribution to the operations and we are most grateful for their continuing commitment and their employers' support.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the EU directive introduced on reducing further emissions of gases from coal and oil-fired power stations and the implications for electricity prices.  [72349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Among its provisions, EC Directive 2001/80/EC, otherwise known as the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD), requires that so called ''existing plants'' (defined as those for which the original construction or operating licence was granted prior to 1 July 1987) comply with emission limit values (ELVs) for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust, by 1 January 2008. Such limits apply to all large combustion plants with a rated thermal input of 50MW or above, not just to power stations.
<P>

<a name="21017w02.html_para3">As an alternative to meeting ELVs, existing plants may be subject to a National Plan. Such a plan would reduce the total annual emissions of these pollutants to the levels that would have been achieved by applying the ELVs referred to above to the existing plants in operation in the year 2000, on the basis of each plant's operational performance averaged over the last five years of operation up to and including 2000.
<P>

<a name="21017w02.html_para4">The LCPD leaves it open to Member States to decide whether, instead of pursuing the specified ELV approach, to develop a National Plan approach, which could offer some additional flexibility, while meeting the broad aims of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="21017w02.html_para5">Existing plants may, however, as a derogation from the LCPD, opt to operate for a maximum of 20,000 hours between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015 during which time they may operate with less stringent emission limits. At the end of this period, existing plants opting to operate under the 20,000 hour derogation must close.
<P>

<a name="21017w02.html_para6">We do not yet know which approach to implementing the LCPD would best suit the UK's needs. Such a decision will need to take account of the costs and benefits of each approach, as well as the UK's energy policy objectives. There will be consultations before a decision is taken.
<P>

<a name="21017w02.html_para7">The implications for electricity prices will not be clearer until consultation and appropriate analysis of future options has been completed.

<a name="21017w02.html_para10">In the financial years 2001&#150;2002 and 2002 to date, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has paid a total of #883,027 to two public relations firms for the ''Know Before You Go'' public awareness campaign. This sum includes design and implementation of the campaign together with management fees. The two firms are: AEA Technology Environment and Biss Lancaster Euro RSCG.
<P>

<a name="21017w02.html_para11">We have also spent a total of #14,687 on consultancy advice and focus groups related to UK public attitudes towards the European Union. The firms involved were LA Associates/Peter Kellner and ICM Research.

<P>
<P>

 Staff are expected to use their judgement about alcohol consumption. Any member of staff unfit for work due to the consumption of alcohol could be subject to disciplinary action and dismissed. Members of the public will not be admitted onto court premises whilst significantly under the influence of alcohol, and are forbidden from bringing alcohol onto court premises.
<P>

<a name="21017w03.html_para6">The smoking policy guidelines aim to provide smoke-free working conditions for those staff who want them, while offering limited facilities for smokers, and help for those who wish to stop smoking. Local arrangements may differ, but in general, those offices and courts with a smoking policy will enforce ''no smoking'' in staff corridors, toilets, lifts and other common areas, and at meetings and seminars. Before local arrangements are introduced the views of smokers and non-smokers are sought and any differences resolved by agreement. Overall consideration has to be given to the wishes of non-smokers.

 The amounts claimed, paid, and withheld at the end of each month from August 2001 to end September 2002 are set out in the following table. The amounts in the withheld column relate to those claims from registered Individual Learning Account (ILA) providers which are subject to validation checks and/or investigation. The claims withheld are those which are in dispute.
<P>

<a name="21017w03.html_para7">At the time of closure on 23 November a total of #19.4 million relating to learning episodes confirmed on the ILA Centre system was awaiting payment and therefore outstanding. Following validation checks payments for eligible learning relating to this amount were subsequently made in December and January.
<P>

<a name="21017w03.html_para8">ILA programme rules allowed bookings to be made 6 months in advance of the learning episode, so booked learning could be confirmed up to and including 22 May 2002. A paper based claims and payment system was introduced in January 2002 to allow providers to confirm and claim for delivery of this advanced booked learning. Claims, payments and amounts withheld are reflected in the table. In addition an estimated sum of #5.3 million remains unclaimed relating to advance booked learning by providers who cannot be invited to claim until all investigations are complete.

<a name="21017w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Livestock auction markets have an important role in the marketing of farm animals between the various stages of production and some markets may be suitable for a range of activities or for more diversified marketing. This issue is of particular importance where large numbers of cross-bred breeding stock and store stock for fattening are sold off the hills to lowland farms such as, for example, in the Northern Uplands. We are in contact with industry interests to help identify and respond to day to day issues as well as to consider together the longer-term marketing framework.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement about the outcome of the World Summmit on Sustainable Development and its follow up.  [76116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w04.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The World Summit on Sustainable Development addressed some of the greatest challenges of our times. For over a year I had said the Summit should be about more than just fine words. It should be about a step-change&#151;a move from words to concerted action and implementation. And it was. I also made clear from the beginning that separate fora would take forward discussion on climate change and on trade, including trade in agricultural produce.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para0">So Johannesburg built on the success of last year's Doha talks on the new trade round, the Marrakech accords on climate change and this year's Monterrey conference on financing for development. It reaffirmed and strengthened the international community's commitment to sustainable development, and reinvigorated the Rio Earth Summit agreements as well as the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty eradication. There are no silver-bullet solutions, no miracle cures. But what we do have is a new political commitment, momentum and energy for the attainment of a sustainable world.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para1">As in all negotiations, we were rightly ambitious, given the agenda we had. I judge the final deal reached between the 180 participating countries&#151;for which the UK, led by the Prime Minister, negotiated hard&#151;to be a successful outcome. We went to Johannesburg to 



<P>
<P><I>17 Oct 2002 : Column 919W</I><P>
make a concrete difference to people's lives. I believe that we succeeded. And, whilst I understand the disappointment of those who pushed us for more, I believe that what was achieved, taken in conjunction with the UN Millennium Development Goals will, if implemented, represent a revolution in the lives of the poorest people on the planet, and the beginnings of a revolution in how we treat the planet itself.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para2">The Summit agreed an impressive plan of implementation. We agreed a new target to halve by 2015 the proportion of people living without basic sanitation. This will save millions of lives in developing countries, and support existing goals on safe drinking water and health. There are also new targets and timetables on chemicals, biodiversity, marine protection and fish stocks. These and other commitments will galvanise action and set standards for the next 10 years or more.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para3">The Summit also agreed joint actions on reliable and affordable energy provision for the poor and to urgently and substantially increase the global share of renewable energy sources. The provision of energy is a prerequisite for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Summit did not set a global target for renewables, but even those countries which resisted a global target have nevertheless committed themselves to domestic action. At the Summit the Prime Minister announced that the UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department will make available #50m per year to renewable energy exports to developing countries.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para4">And on climate change, Johannesburg issued a ringing call for countries to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Three key developing countries&#151;China, India and Brazil&#151;recently ratified. Crucially, in his positive statement at the Summit, the Russian Prime Minister Kasyanov again signalled that Russia is preparing to ratify the Protocol. The Canadian Prime Minister, Chretien, said that Canada will make a decision on ratification later this year. We are hopeful that the Kyoto Protocol might enter into force in early 2003.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para5">Over 300 new partnerships were also launched at the Summit representing in excess of $235million in resources. We are familiar with the idea of partnerships at home. But this is a bold new idea for the UN. These partnerships will be the unique inheritance of Johannesburg&#151;they are not a substitute for multilateral commitments, but they will provide additional and complementary resources. For example, the EU ''Water for Life Initiative'' and the UK-led multistakeholder partnership for water and sanitation will support the delivery of the new sanitation target and the existing goals on safe drinking water and health.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para6">Johannesburg has given the global community a strong mandate for intensified action at global, regional and national levels. More fundamentally, it has forged close links between development and environment policy, in the service of sustainable development. There is now a widespread agreement that development assistance should be directed at helping the poor and that it needs to be sustainable if it is to be of lasting benefit. Sustainable management of natural resources and of the environment are essential for poverty 



<P>
<P><I>17 Oct 2002 : Column 920W</I><P>
eradication. This now needs to be reflected in the poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies of developing countries.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para7">We shall work with our partners in the international institutions&#151;the UN, the G8 and the OECD&#151;to ensure that development and environment policy are mutually supportive. We need to ensure that the follow-up to Johannesburg, Monterrey and the Millennium Development Goals is coherent.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para8">International trade, and climate change issues already have dedicated international processes of their own. On both, the UK Government is taking a lead role.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para9">The Prime Minister has hammered home the case for trade reform, especially of agricultural subsidies. Developing countries need improved market access, so they can sell their produce fairly, without being hampered by trade-distorting and environmentally-damaging subsidies in the developed countries. This is the single most important issue we need to follow up after Johannesburg. Improved market access and subsidy reform are a joint concern for development and environment policy. Currently OECD countries give around $55billion in overseas aid, but subsidise their agricultural industries by around seven times that amount. CAFOD have suggested that through the CAP the average European dairy cow gets a $2 subsidy a day&#151;the same as the daily income of half the world's population. We will continue to push for reform of agricultural subsidies both within the WTO and, within the EU, on the Common Agricultural Policy.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para10">On climate change, later this month I shall be in Delhi for the next stage of the UN negotiations on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para11">The implementation of the EU's Sustainable Development Strategy will be a driver for change in Europe. In particular, it will need to reflect the Summit agreement to develop a global ten-year framework of action programmes to accelerate the shift towards sustainable production and consumption. We need to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation&#151;to get more from less. The industrialised North has agreed to take the lead on this and it must be central to the EU's Strategy. This means action on a whole range of issues such as energy efficiency, waste minimisation&#151;a real challenge for us in the UK&#151;and integrated product policy.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para12">But equally important is action we will take at home. We will integrate the Johannesburg agreements and relevant follow-up into UK policy and action, with a sharp focus on the use of technological innovation to deliver sustainable development. If, as a nation, we achieve greater resource efficiency, this will not only help our environment but also improve our competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para13">On energy, we are working towards our 10 per cent. renewable electricity target by 2010. We are making great strides in both energy efficiency and tackling fuel poverty. On climate change we have been leading globally in the Kyoto process. We are on track to meet our Kyoto target of a 12.5 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and have put in place a 



<P>
<P><I>17 Oct 2002 : Column 921W</I><P>
comprehensive programme of measures to meet our more ambitious domestic goal to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para14">The Government will shortly publish an Energy White Paper that addresses how to set the UK on the longer term path to a low carbon economy, as the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and others have recommended. In particular, the Commission has recommended we put ourselves on the path to 60 per cent. reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. We will respond formally to that recommendation at the time of the White Paper, but already it is clear that action on that scale&#151;in the UK and internationally&#151;is what is necessary.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para15">This Autumn we shall be taking receipt of, and later responding to, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit's report on how we manage waste, stemming growth, and promoting recycling and re-use.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para16">Last week I hosted a meeting with leading UK stakeholders, to discuss the follow-up action by government and stakeholders at UK level. This provided a useful forum for us to discuss the proposals developed by stakeholders and within government, and to establish some shared conclusions on the implications of the Summit.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para17">Our next review of progress toward sustainable development, which will be out early in the new year, will include further details on how we intend to take the Johannesburg outcomes forward. Over the course of the next year, we will also be reviewing the UK Sustainable Development Strategy and meeting our Summit commitments will form a significant part of this.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para18">Perhaps the most innovative feature of the Summit was the emphasis on partnerships between governments and civil society; particularly NGOs and business. The UK delegation therefore included Members of this House, representatives from the devolved administrations, local government, the UK Sustainable Development Commission, from business and NGOs. And since this was a Summit on the future, 4 youth representatives. Besides the formal government negotiations there was a wealth of other events and initiatives. UK participants were active everywhere and made a huge contribution to the overall outcome. Governments must take the lead in setting the framework for sustainable development, they cannot deliver it alone.
<P>

<a name="21017w04.html_para19">Johannesburg demonstrated that it is possible to reach agreement on practical steps towards a more sustainable world. We must, and will, keep moving forward. In the words of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan; ''This Summit will put us on a path that reduces poverty while protecting the environment, a path that works for all peoples, rich and poor, today and tomorrow. We have to go out and take action. This is not the end. It's the beginning.''

his conclusions are likely to have limited relevance to fish stocks exploited in the waters around the UK. One of the main reasons for this is that there are relatively few large fish in our waters.

 Cement manufacture is a carbon intensive process and carbon dioxide emissions from this source in the UK are about 1 per cent. of our annual total emissions.

 Flooding is a natural phenomenon and whilst it is not possible to eliminate the risk totally, the flood and coastal defence operating authorities have permissive powers to reduce that risk. It has been the policy of successive Governments not to pay compensation to those affected by flooding as it is generally an insurable risk. However, we may be able to assist in reducing Government requirements on those affected, for example by relaxing the eligibility rules for agricultural support schemes or by considering estimation of VAT liabilities where floods have damaged paperwork.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under what guidelines the Environment Agency monitors dioxin emissions from Waste Disposal incinerators; to whom the Environment Agency is accountable in this respect; and if she will make a statement.  [73481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As set out in the Waste Incineration Directive (WID), the Environment Agency requires operators to measure emissions from municipal waste incinerators at least every 3 months during the first 12 months of a new installation. In subsequent years operators must take at least two measurements per year.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para0">Dioxins in England and Wales can be measured using two validated methods; a European standard BS EN 1948 and the USEPA Method 23. Historically, USEPA method 23 has been used and is considered an acceptable standard for dioxin emission limit values of 1ng/m3 and above. However, WID will impose a limit of 0.1ng/m3 from 28 December 2005 and, as the Agency has already started moving towards this new limit, European Standard EN 1948 is being used in the majority of cases for regulatory compliance monitoring of municipal waste incinerators. EN 1948 has been validated on a large number of European incinerators, the measurement uncertainty has been determined and the appropriate quality assurance/quality control measures have been introduced. Both methods require samples to be taken over a period of six to eight hours. Samples are then removed for laboratory analysis using sophisticated and time consuming techniques.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para1">The analysis of dioxin levels is a difficult and expensive process which only a few laboratories in the UK are able to carry out. The laboratories are independent, with a broad client base including Government agencies as well as various sectors of industry. The laboratories are subject to quality assurance schemes (such as UKAS) and are fully open to individual and Government scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para2">The Agency is currently researching other ways of sampling incinerator emissions of dioxins. A research programme is in place investigating the performance of continuous dioxin sampling systems that have recently been employed in some European countries.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para3">The Agency is accountable for its activities in England to the Secretary of State. Regulation of the incineration industry by the Agency and its predecessors has been very effective. Over the past eleven years there has been a very significant decrease in the discharge of dioxins from municipal waste incinerators. In 1990 they released 605.26g ITEQ, but by 1999 this figure had fallen to 1.05g ITEQ. In 2001 the sector released 0.81g ITEQ.

<a name="21017w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government has no plans that local authorities should provide any particular number of incinerators.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para4">They are required to take account of the policy framework set out in Waste Strategy 2000 (Cm4693&#150;2), including achieving targets set for recycling and recovery and the need to progressively divert increasing amounts of waste from landfill.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para5">With the growth in municipal waste of 3&#150;4 per cent. per annum in recent years, fulfilling our obligations through minimisation and recycling, although desirable, may not be feasible alone. In that case there is a range of technologies, in addition to conventional incineration, available for treating and disposing of waste. This includes those advanced conversion technologies which qualify as sources of renewable energy under the Renewables Obligation Order 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Concentrations of dioxins in food are controlled by the levels in the surrounding environment, the critical factor for which is the concentration in air. Air concentrations are controlled by emissions from primary sources and by complex exchanges/recycling of dioxins with water, soil and vegetation. Dioxins may subsequently enter the food chain through vegetation and the diet of animals.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para6">It is not possible to estimate what proportion of dioxins emitted from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators enters the food chain but, because they contribute less than 1 per cent. of total dioxins emissions, we can say that they make only a minor contribution to levels in food.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para7">Dioxins which do not enter the food chain remain in the environment and low levels of dioxins can be detected in all environmental media. In the UK the mean levels are currently approximately:

<P>

<P>
<a name="21017w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Municipal solid waste incinerators are regularly monitored by operators on a six monthly basis to check compliance with the EU wide emission standards. It is a breach of operators' authorisation conditions not to carry out this monitoring.




<P>
<P><I>17 Oct 2002 : Column 928W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para8">Additionally, the Environment Agency carries out independent check monitoring at a minimum frequency of once per year. All monitoring results, including those carried out by the operators, are available on public registers.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para9">This monitoring frequency is in excess of the bi-annual monitoring required as a minimum by the new Waste Incineration Directive. It is open to the Environment Agency to require or perform more frequent monitoring if that is considered necessary.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para10">In tightening this year the authorisations under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 of existing municipal solid waste incinerators, the Environment Agency has applied a condition requiring the operators to report on a review of techniques for continuous dioxin monitoring, including cost, availability, accuracy, detection limits etc by 1 January 2003.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w06.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will further limit the acceptable amount of dioxin which may be emitted from waste disposal incinerators.  [73484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Dioxin emissions from municipal solid waste incinerators are limited by authorisation conditions issued under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime. This regulatory regime is being subsumed into the even more exacting Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). Existing installations will have to apply for IPPC permits by 31 August 2005.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para11">Additionally, we are currently transposing the new Waste Incineration Directive (WID), which will further tighten dioxin emissions standards tenfold to 0.1 ng/m3&#151;the level considered technically achievable when the Directive was finalised in 2000. This will apply to all new incinerators within its scope by 28 December 2002, and to existing plant by 28 December 2005.
<P>

<a name="21017w06.html_para12">The Environment Agency has also recently varied the authorisations for existing municipal solid waste incinerators to reduce the dioxin emission limit to that required by the WID ahead of the required timescale. The IPPC Directive requires that permit conditions for these incinerations be set on the basis of best available techniques (BAT) for incinerator design and operation, and that those conditions be reconsidered in the event that future substantial changes in BAT make it possible to reduce emissions significantly below the WID standard without imposing excessive costs.

 All legally presented consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK from other EU Member States must have been produced in accordance with Community rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC. Imports from third countries must have been produced to standards at least equivalent to those in the Directive.

<P>

<a name="21017w07.html_para3">In respect of the importation of meat into the United Kingdom and the risk posed by FMD, European Community legislation permits us to import meat from certain countries where FMD is present but only where the disease is restricted to specific areas.

<P>

<a name="21017w07.html_para4">All imported meat in to the United Kingdom from third countries must enter at a designated Border Inspection Post where it is subject to veterinary inspections.

 There is no doubt that, for some offenders, prison is both an appropriate punishment and a factor in reducing crime. The same Home Office study also shows that the general public sees prison combined with supervision in the community as a sentence, which is effective in reducing crime. 72 per cent. of the general public in the study thought that a sentence of three months followed by three months supervision was more constructive than six months imprisonment.

As part of this it is important that return to Afghanistan is sustainable and the Agreement commits the United Kingdom Government to providing support to those returning, in Afghanistan, to ensure they are able to reestablish themselves in their homeland.

It should be noted that the figures relate to the date on which the illegal entry notice was served. In-country detections could relate to an individual who entered the United Kingdom in an earlier period.<P>

More recent information is not yet available. Figures on illegal entry papers served are published annually in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin ''Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom'', the 2001 edition of which was published on 26 September 2002.

<P>
<a name="21017w09.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Coffey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedural changes are being made following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 28 May in the case of Stafford concerning the release of mandatory life sentence prisoners.  [75903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w09.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Mandatory life sentence prisoners who have served the minimum period necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence, have their cases reviewed periodically by the Parole Board. At present responsibility for their release rests with the Secretary of State. This responsibility cannot be conferred on the Parole Board or any other body without primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="21017w09.html_para0">As an interim measure, the Home Secretary has decided to change the administrative arrangements for the review and release of mandatory life sentence prisoners. These administrative arrangements will apply to all such prisoners whose next Parole Board review begins on or after 1 January 2003. The changes will mean that in most instances these prisoners' cases will be heard initially, as now, by the Parole Board on the papers which will make a provisional recommendation. If prisoners wish to make representations about provisional recommendations it will then be open to them to request an oral hearing before the Parole Board at which they may have legal representation. They will normally receive full disclosure of all material relevant to the question of whether they should be released. They will also be able to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Similarly the Secretary of State may also require an oral hearing of the Board in cases where he believes further examination of the evidence is required.

<P>

<a name="21017w09.html_para1">If, at the end of the review process, the Parole Board favours the release of a mandatory life sentence prisoner once the minimum period has been served the Home Secretary will normally accept such a recommendation.
<P>

<a name="21017w09.html_para2">The Stafford judgment affects only the process by which the decision is made on whether to release mandatory life sentence prisoners. It does not relate to the period of detention which such prisoners must serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence, or Parole Board reviews that take place before the end of that period. There will usually be no change to the dates set for Parole Board reviews of prisoners who have served that period. Those prisoners serving whole life tariffs do not have their cases referred to the Parole Board.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will identify the components of the line labelled Tax Credits in table A10 in the Comprehensive Spending Review document, Command Paper 5570; whether it includes all personal tax credit expenditure that is classified as negative taxation; and if he will make a statement on the reduction in the figure between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.

 The tax credits line in Table A10 of the 2002 Spending Review white paper (Command Paper 5570) covers spending on tax credits which is classified as expenditure by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the National Accounts but as negative taxation on the basis of OECD revenue statistics rules. Spending on tax credits classified as expenditure under both ONS and OECD guidelines is included in Table A2 of the 2002 Spending Review white paper.
<P>

<a name="21017w09.html_para5">The tax credit figure in Table A10 falls between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 because of changes in personal tax credits. Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) is classified partly as expenditure and partly as negative taxation under OECD guidelines but entirely as expenditure in National Accounts, so the Table A10 tax credit figure for 2002&#150;03 includes the proportion of WFTC scored as negative taxation under OECD rules. However from April 2003 WFTC is being replaced by two new tax credits, the Working Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, and the ONS have announced that these new tax credits will be classified in line with OECD classification rules in the National Accounts. Therefore no expenditure under these new tax credits scores in the tax credits line in Table A10 for 2003&#150;04 onwards and the total falls considerably from 2002&#150;03.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2002]:</i> Officials with responsibility for the policy take the lead in drafting answers to parliamentary questions, which are then cleared by Ministers before a final reply is sent. There is no formal role for special advisers in this process, but they may from time to time be consulted by Ministers and/or officials about draft replies.

 National Health Service foundation trusts may have limited access to other income streams, in a similar way to existing NHS trusts, in addition to standard NHS funding from Her Majesty's Treasury. Their prime purpose will be to treat NHS patients.

 Provision of clinical services to National Health Service patients will remain the principal objective for NHS foundation trusts. However, as is the case for existing NHS trusts, the new organisations will

<a name="21017w10.html_para2">The governance and regulatory framework that we are developing for NHS foundation trusts will ensure that appropriate controls are put in place to prevent these organisations from developing private business at the expense of developing services for NHS patients.

<P>
<a name="21017w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 To develop the policy on National Health Service foundation trusts, the Department has sought a wide range of specialist advice. In particular, since December 2001 Chief Executive Officers from NHS trusts that have achieved three stars in the NHS performance ratings have been consulted on a range of issues. Key topics for discussion have been development of new freedoms and policy development on NHS foundation trusts. We expect these arrangements to continue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans there to award, <i>(a)</i> Northamptonshire and <i>(b)</i> Norfolk and Norwich NHS trusts foundation trust status.  [74554]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 On 25 July, the Department published <i>NHS Foundation Trusts: Eligibility Criteria and Timetable</i>. Amongst other criteria, applicant National Health Service trusts need to hold and retain three star status in the NHS performance ratings. Northamptonshire and Norfolk and Norwich NHS Trusts will not be eligible to apply for NHS foundation trust status this autumn because they did not achieve three star status in the NHS performance ratings announced in July 2002.

<P>
<a name="21017w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 At present, there are nine Departmental staff working full time on National Health Service foundation trusts. However, as policy on NHS foundation trusts embraces a wide range of issues a number of other staff are also contributing to the policy development as and when required.

 Information is not available in the form requested. Ministers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have frequent meetings with Ministers from the Scottish Executive, both formal and informal, covering a broad range of topics.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he is taking to address problems with flooding in areas of new housing development.  [72362]<P>

<P>
<a name="21017w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In July 2001 the Government published Planning policy guidance note (PPG) 25 <i>Development and flood risk</i>. This introduces a risk-based approach to planning for new development that gives priority to lower risk areas. Within high-risk areas priority is given to those areas that are already developed. Built development should be wholly exceptional within the functional flood plains that are essentially unobstructed by defences and existing development.
<P>

<a name="21017w11.html_para0">Those proposing new development are advised to carry out a flood-risk assessment. This should assess the risks of flooding to the development, its impact on flooding elsewhere (including the impact of increased

run-off due to development) and identify any mitigation measures that may be required. Where flood defences or other mitigation is required because of a new development, its provision and future maintenance should be fully funded by the developer as part of the development.
<P>

<a name="21017w11.html_para1">In February 2002, DTLR published <i>Preparing for floods</i>. This contains interim guidance for improving the flood resistance of domestic and small business properties. It provides practical advice for existing property owners whose properties are at risk of flooding and for all those involved with construction of new properties or renovation of existing buildings in areas of flood risk. The Environment Agency, together with the Construction Industry Research and Information Association, has also produced guidance on temporary measures to protect against flooding (such as flood boards) and on what to do after a flood.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what his policy is on development on green belt land.  [72377]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21017w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Government policy on the Green Belt remains as set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 2, which states that protecting the countryside from encroachment is one of the main purposes of including land in the Green Belt. Since 1997 approximately 30,000 hectares of land have been earmarked for addition to the Green Belt.
