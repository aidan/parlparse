<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_wqn2"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when he will make regulations to allow cameras to be used to enforce bus lanes outside London; and if he will make a statement.  [136362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Section 144 of the Transport Act 2000 enables regulations to be made so that local authorities outside London can enforce bus lanes using cameras to detect vehicles being driven in them illegally. The work on the preparation of the regulations including resolving relevant legal points has taken longer than expected but the Department for Transport and the Department for Constitutional Affairs hope to be able to make the relevant regulations later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to increase the number of MOT testers; and if he will make a statement.  [136183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None&#151;there is no evidence to suggest that there is a shortage of qualified MOT testers. Currently there are around 19,500 MOT testing stations with 50,000 testers. There is no restriction on the number of garages that can apply to become MOT testing stations and, once designated, garages can employ as many MOT testers as they wish.

<a name="31106w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the safety implications for road users of speed cameras.  [136082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 On 11 February 2003 the Department published an independently produced evaluation report of the two-year trial of the safety camera cost recovery system. This showed a 35 per cent. reduction in those killed or seriously injured at camera sites, equating to around 280 people and a 4 per cent. reduction in those killed or seriously injured across the pilot areas, equating to around 530 people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have an on-going research programme into fitness to drive, the results of which will help inform the Secretary of State's Honorary Medical Advisory Panels in relation to their advice on the driver licensing standards.

<a name="31106w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have produced a large body of material on cycle safety aimed at younger children promoting the use of cycle helmets as well as other cycle safety messages such as conspicuity and training. We have also developed a Cycle Sense campaign aimed at teenagers that was launched on 21 May this year. The campaign encourages teenagers to wear cycle helmets and consists of posters and a new cycle sense website.

<a name="31106w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Traffic Management Bill</H3>

<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B>

<a name="31106w01.html_sbhd8"><H3 align=center>UK Airport Security</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_wqn10"><B> Jim Dowd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what powers exist to authorise security staff at United Kingdom airports to examine passengers' luggage, by 



<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2003 : Column 728W</I><P>
force if necessary, without the knowledge or consent of the passenger; and how many times they have been exercised in the past 12 months.  [136796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Aerodrome managers and aircraft operators are directed through secondary legislation, made under the Aviation Security Act 1982, to examine passenger baggage to a standard sufficient reasonably to ensure that no prohibited articles are taken into a restricted zone or onto an aircraft. Where passengers refuse to permit such an examination, the baggage is not allowed to pass beyond the point of search. If the baggage is not accompanied by its owner, and x-ray screening of a bag has not resolved all doubts, the aircraft operator is permitted by direction to search the bag by hand. Searching unaccompanied hold baggage by hand is therefore rarely necessary.

<a name="31106w01.html_sbhd9"><H3 align=center>Underground (Vandalism)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_wqn11"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many prosecutions there have been by British Transport Police for acts of vandalism on <i>(a)</i> on tube trains, <i>(b)</i> in tube stations and <i>(c)</i> on tube lines in each of the last 10 years.  [136524]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Vandalism is not classified as a crime group but the offence of criminal damage is the closest equivalent. Prosecutions are a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service. However, the BTP have provided the information in Table 1 regarding the number of people arrested, summonsed or charged with criminal damage in the past six years which is the maximum period for which reliable data are available. Table 2 shows the total number of criminal damage offences reported and cleared for the last 10 years. Table 3 gives a breakdown for criminal damage offences reported and cleared, split between tube stations, tube lines and tube trains for the last four years, the maximum period for which reliable data are available.

Data in Table 3 differ slightly from data in Table 2 as it has been extracted on crime committed date as opposed to approved date. A crime report has an approved date which is the date the crime report has been evaluated and is often different to the date committed. Therefore crime figures will differ slightly depending on which date is used.

 The Government are committed to developing a modern, flexible and outward focused Civil Service that works in partnership with all sectors of society. A key tool in meeting that commitment is the Interchange initiative, which promotes and encourages

 The Government are committed to the new EU Chemicals Strategy which aims to improve protection for human health and the environment. The new EU Chemicals Strategy is trying to address the fact that thousands of chemicals have been used for many years without adequate information about their hazardous properties or what risks are involved in their short-term and long-term use. In doing so, the proposal for new chemicals legislation, which was adopted by the European Commission on 29 October 2003, should create greater transparency and help identify chemicals of concern.
<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To create a fast, efficient and workable process of testing, screening and assessing substances of concern, starting with the most harmful, because of their impact on human health or the environment;
<P>

To keep animal testing to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment; and
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The public health aspects of the slaughter of animals for human consumption are a matter for the Food Standards Agency. The Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended) require that no person shall carry on the business of a slaughterhouse unless the premises are licensed under the Regulations. Furthermore the Regulations also require that no person shall sell fresh meat for human consumption unless it has been slaughtered in a licensed slaughterhouse. Consequently it is unlawful for a mobile licensed slaughterman to kill and dress an animal for human consumption outside of licensed premises. At a meeting in February this year, at which Defra officials were present, the Agency explained the regulatory framework to representatives of the National Farmers Union. Subsequently officials from both the Department and the Agency participated in a meeting arranged by the Union, at which representatives of the Union and former mobile slaughter operators were present, to discuss how the framework could apply to the licensing of mobile slaughterhouses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 28 October 2003]:</i> Defra-funded trials to reduce cetacean bycatch in the offshore bass fishery have demonstrated that separator grids are a viable means of minimising dolphin bycatch in this fishery. The very significantly reduced mortality rate overall in this trial compared with observations on boats over previous years is extremely encouraging. Two animals died in 82 hauls over a seven-week period beginning in March this year, a significant reduction in what is normally observed to be the case. In observations elsewhere in the fishery without the grid deployed, 28 dolphin casualties were recorded in 49 hauls.
<P>

<a name="31106w03.html_para6">On the basis of these results, we will be moving forward from trialling the separator grid to deploying the gear in the fishery. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the grid and adjust as necessary. If an effective reduction in small cetacean bycatch cannot be maintained through the use of the grid, I do not rule out other options such as closure of the offshore-bass fishery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The biggest implication for tenant farmers arises from the decoupling of support from production. This will mean that all farmers, including tenants, will have more flexibility in terms of what they produce. This is because the support they receive will no longer be dependent on the types of crop or livestock they farm. Taking the reforms as a whole, it is difficult to forecast the precise effects reform might have on rents. However, where tenants continue to farm and claim support, the requirement for land will continue to underpin the land rental market. Further work is planned in this area and we hope to make the results generally available in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on Government action to encourage fair trade initiatives.  [135508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I strongly support the aims of the Fairtrade movement. It gives a clear indication to consumers that disadvantaged producer groups in developing countries receive a minimum price above that offered by mainstream markets.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para0">A real strength of the Fairtrade movement has been in raising awareness among mainstream retailers about the importance of managing supply chains to maximise benefits to the poor, and in raising public awareness of important development issues surrounding trade. That is why the Government, through the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided &#163;500,000 in support of UK development awareness and education campaigns centred on Fairtrade over the past two years. My hon. Friend the Minister for Corporate and Social Responsibility met business leaders last year to encourage greater take-up of Fairtrade products. I have ensured that Fairtrade tea and coffee is made available throughout the DTI offices and many of my Cabinet colleagues have responded to my urging to do likewise.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para1">The Fairtrade market, despite recent rapid growth, remains small (&#163;63 million in 2002). Through DFID's support for initiatives such as the Ethical Trading Initiative (&#163;1.3 million over three years 2002&#150;04)&#151;an alliance of UK retail companies, NGOs and trade unions working to improve labour conditions in the supply chains of its corporate members&#151;we are able to contribute to improving the working conditions under which &#163;100 billion of goods are produced each year.

This is complemented by recent changes to the National Curriculum to add

vocational choice, which will encourage young people to understand the opportunities that careers in various sectors, including manufacturing, can offer them.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para5">The DTI also published a Manufacturing Strategy, in May 2002, which set out seven areas of activity for manufacturing success, one of which was raising skills and education levels.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para6">Modern Apprenticeships are central to this Government's drive to improve the opportunities for work-based vocational training. Our target is that by 2004, 28 per cent. of young people will start a modern apprenticeship by age 22. To aid us in this task we have has set up a Modern Apprenticeship Taskforce to look at ways to increase the opportunities available for young people to participate in high quality Modern Apprenticeships and to recommend effective and innovative ways of ensuring that Modern Apprenticeship programmes respond to the changing needs of employers and young people.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para7">Many of the new Sector Skills Councils are helping to promote careers in manufacturing. In particular, SEMTA is supporting SETNET and financing careers advice; Skillfast UK has produced CDs containing careers advice for use in schools and colleges; and Pro-skills is developing a sandwiched based student apprenticeship programme.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para8">My Department continues to support the SETNET scheme, which was created in 1996 to raise interest in science, engineering, technology and mathematics (STEM) in young people (between five and 18) by showing them that they can lead to interesting and rewarding careers&#151;which clearly includes the manufacturing sector.

 <i>[holding answer 3 November 2003]</i>: In considering the best ways to encourage innovation in the UK, the Government believe that a fair and effective intellectual property system, for software as well as for other areas of technology, plays a central part in developing and protecting new ideas. The aim of the UK Government and the European Commission, in the proposed directive on software patents, is to clarify the position on patentability of computer-implemented inventions and confirm that only those inventions that involve a technical contribution can be protected by patents. We believe that this is beneficial for industry and consumers alike.
<P>

<a name="31106w05.html_para10">We continue to listen to the concerns of those who oppose the granting of patents in this field, and we believe that the Government's approach offers the best balance of protection for the industry and for users of software. The directive is now before a working group of the Council of Ministers where representatives from EU member states, and the Commission, will consider the amendments made by the Parliament and in due course submit it to the Council itself for its consideration. We will await the comments of the working group and the Commission before finalising our position.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment was made of the increase in running costs to the Criminal Records Bureau that necessitated the recent increase in fee levels;  [131815]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the changes were since 1993 in fees from the Criminal Records Bureau to local authorities for applications for posts in the education and social care sectors.  [131819]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w06.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau began operating in March 2002. Initially, the fee for both Standard and Enhanced Disclosures was &#163;12 (with Disclosures issued free of charge to volunteers). We made it clear that the Bureau would eventually become self-financing through the fees that it charged and that the fees would be reviewed regularly. With effect from 1 July 2003, the fee for Standard Disclosures has risen to &#163;24 and for Enhanced Disclosures to &#163;29. A copy of a Regulatory Impact Assessment containing more detailed information has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31106w06.html_para6">The Disclosure fee is determined by a combination of CRB costs and the volume of applications. The deferment of the introduction of Basic Disclosures has inevitably meant that the volumes of Disclosures issued has been less than forecast, thereby pushing up the unit cost of producing each Disclosure. In addition, the CRB has experienced some increase in costs, for example, as a result of the introduction of the paper application channel in response to customer demand. The CRB's planned expenditure in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;75 million (on the basis of a projected demand for 2.3 million Disclosures) as compared with an outturn of &#163;59 million in 2002&#150;03 (when some 1.5 million Disclosures were issued).

 The specific information that my hon.

The CRB does monitor and report on the average time to deal with all Disclosure applications, but its systems do not break this information down by sector.
<P>

<a name="31106w06.html_para7">Likewise, the number of applications from individual sectors that are still awaiting a disclosure is not available.

<a name="31106w06.html_spnew10"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Over 90 per cent. of Standard and Enhanced Disclosures are now issued within two and four weeks respectively, exceeding current service standards. These have been set based on experience gained of this complex operation. The current targets are realistic but challenging. They will be kept under review.

<P>

<a name="31106w06.html_para10">As the independent regulator, the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) has the responsibility to ensure that care homes meet all their statutory obligations. It has stated clearly that where CRB clearances are not in place, and provided that the welfare of care home residents is protected, it will apply its discretion on the use of its enforcement powers on a case by case basis. The NCSC issued a press release on 22 September 2003 setting out its approach to CRB checks for care home staff. A copy is available on the NCSC's website at www.carestandards.org.uk.

 We have received&#151;both direct and through right hon. and hon. Members&#151;a significant number of representations. These have chiefly concerned two issues: the size of the increases in fees, which reflect increased unit costs and the need for the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) to move substantially towards a target of being self-financing by 2005&#150;06; and the short notice of the increases which reflected the need to reduce the possibility of a surge in demand which could have had a detrimental effect on the CRB's operation.

The UNODC figures for 2001 reflects the Taliban ban on opium cultivation. The ban did not however address the underlying causes of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and was enforced with a mix of serious violence and bribery.
<P>

<a name="31106w07.html_para6">Afghanistan is the world's leading producer of opium and the UNODC has estimated that, taking into account seizures in the region, the likely amounts available for shipment out of Afghanistan in 2002 were 685 tons of opium and 212 tons of heroin and morphine. Approximately 25&#150;35 metric tons of heroin are targeted on the UK every year and we estimate that around 95 per cent. of this originates from Afghanistan. Trends have remained fairly static.
<P>

<a name="31106w07.html_para7">The UNODC poppy cultivation survey in 2003 has shown reductions in the traditional areas, which demonstrates that drug control policy has been effective where the Afghan Government have been able to exert control. Increasing security and stability in Afghanistan remains key to progress in reducing opium production. This in turn will also bring more stability to Afghanistan.

<a name="31106w07.html_para8">The FCO's commitment to tackle international drug trafficking is set out in its Public Service Agreements. In line with the Government's 10-year drugs strategy, '1998&#150;2008: Tackling Drugs Together to Build a Better Britain', the FCO's priority is to reduce the availability of Class A drugs in the UK. Through the Drugs and Crime Fund (&#163;9.9 million in the financial year 2003&#150;04), the FCO assists law enforcement and other agencies in key production and transit countries to improve their capability to disrupt the flow of Class A drugs to the UK.
<P>

<a name="31106w07.html_para9">About 95 per cent. of the UK's heroin comes from Afghanistan. Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy, agreed earlier this year, has set the target of eliminating opium poppy by 2013. The UK is investing &#163;70 million on sustainable measures over the next three years to support implementation of that strategy. Additional staff are being deployed to Kabul to assist in the implementation. I will be co-hosting, with President Karzai and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), an international conference in Kabul in February next year to boost further the international counter-narcotics effort in Afghanistan.

The Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament sets out new procedures for deciding the allocation of either-way cases, and for the sending to the Crown Court of those cases which need to go there, according to these principles.

<a name="31106w07.html_para16">The Government have proposed in the Criminal Justice Bill that the prosecution should be able to apply for a trial on indictment in the Crown Court to proceed in the absence of a jury where the length and/or complexity of the trial is likely either to be so burdensome upon the jury trying it as to make it necessary in the interests of justice to conduct the trial without a jury, or to place an excessive burden on the life of a typical juror. The length or complexity (or both) must be caused by the need to address arrangements, transactions or records of a financial or commercial nature or which relate to property. The Bill also provides for a trial on indictment in the Crown Court to be conducted without a jury where there is a real and present danger of jury tampering, or to be continued without a jury where the jury has been discharged because of jury tampering. None of these provisions is restricted to particular criminal offences.

<i>[holding answer 23 October 2003]:</i> The Government published in July this year a national strategy to deliver improved services to victims and witnesses. It recognises that ensuring witnesses come forward and give evidence in court is essential for the effective administration of justice.
<P>

<a name="31106w08.html_para2">The Criminal Procedure (Attendance of Witnesses) Act 1965 and the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 already provide for a witness summons to be issued if the court is satisfied that the witness is likely to be able to give or produce material evidence but will not do so voluntarily. On 3 October we published a consultation paper and invited responses by 2 January 2004 to a proposal to introduce a greater element of compulsion in securing the attendance of witnesses in court.
<P>

<a name="31106w08.html_para3">The Government have introduced a range of special measures to assist vulnerable witnesses to give their evidence in court, including video recording, live links, the use of intermediaries and communication aids.

<P>
<a name="31106w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The research by Machin, Vignoles and Galindo-Rueda showed strong productivity effects from academic level 4+ qualifications and positive productivity effects from level 2 academic qualifications, although these are not quite as robust as the academic level 4 results. At both of these levels employers receive a productivity benefit over and above the wage increase employees enjoyed as a result of holding these qualifications.
<P>

<a name="31106w09.html_para3">No systematic impact on productivity from vocational qualifications was found, regardless of level though the methodology used meant that the impact of vocational qualifications would be more difficult to detect than that of academic qualifications. The authors themselves admit that this finding contradicts previous research, such as that by Mclntosh <sup>1</sup> , which shows that there are wage returns to the individual for vocational qualifications. Further work is being carried out to gain a firmer evidence base in this area.
<P>

<a name="31106w09.html_para4">The analysis also showed that workers with the poorest basic skills are more likely to be found out of work.

 The Code of Practice on School Admissions was revised in January 2003 and makes it clear that all admission authorities have a duty to promote racial equality and should assess the impact of their admissions policies on ethnic minority pupils and parents.

The latest edition, published in December 2002, gives figures for students starting full-time degree courses in the United Kingdom in 1999/00. No data are held covering those students who drop out of their course after two or three years.

Nationally, the non-completion rate has remained broadly the same at 17&#150;18 per cent. since 1991&#150;92, a period of considerable expansion of student numbers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the "Education at a Glance" 2003: OECD Indicators finding that in the United Kingdom 82 per cent. of the variation in student performance lies within schools.  [131954]<P>

 The OECD's "Education at a Glance" for 2003 reports the variation in reading literacy between schools in the UK to be 22.4 per cent. of the average variation in student performance across all OECD countries, and the corresponding variation in reading literacy within UK schools to be 82.3 per cent. Taken together, these variances imply that 78.6 per cent. of the total UK variance lay within schools, and 21.4 per cent. between.
<P>

<a name="31106w09.html_para9">A majority of the countries that participated in PISA 2000 showed a greater variation in performance within schools than between schools. Compared with the UK, within-school variation was higher in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and the USA. The UK had a similar level of within-school variation to Finland, Ireland and Canada. Countries that have more selection by ability tend to show more variation between schools and less variation within them, compared to countries with less selection.

 The following tables show full-time equivalent regular qualified teachers in maintained nursery/primary and secondary schools in each London authority in January of each year since 1997. During this period there was a decrease of 8,200 in the number of pupils in primary schools in London and an increase of 42,800 in secondary school pupil numbers. The tables exclude regular teachers without Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), for example, those on employment based routes leading to QTS and those who have overseas teaching qualifications. There were 5,400 full-time equivalent regular teachers without QTS in service in maintained nursery/primary and secondary schools in London in January 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to change the income assessments for eligibility for full or partial remission of tuition fees.  [136541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We intend to keep the income thresholds at which students are eligible for full and partial fee remission under review. In addition, from 2004, the poorest 30 per cent. of students&#151;those whose parental income is below &#163;15,200&#151;will receive a full HE grant of &#163;1,000. From 2006&#150;07, Higher Education Institutions will need to offer additional bursaries to students, as part of the access agreements they will draw up in return for the ability to charge variable fees of up to &#163;3,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many and what proportion of undergraduates failed to complete a course at a higher education institution, broken down by <i>(a)</i> institution and <i>(b)</i> course title, in each year since 1997.  [133691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 3 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 215W, which gave the latest available information on non-completion rates contained in "Performance Indicators in Higher Education", published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).
<P>

<a name="31106w10.html_para0">The next edition, covering students starting courses in 2000&#150;01, is scheduled for publication later in the autumn.

<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. David: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what percentage of <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> Wales she estimates will be able to receive digital TV transmissions by January 2004.  [135768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_spnew3"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The ITC and BBC advise that around 73.1 per cent. of UK households and around 56 per cent. of households situated in Wales are now able to receive the Freeview digital terrestrial television (DTT) service. We do not anticipate further significant coverage increases from the current transmitter sites at this stage. Work on developing a detailed plan for increased DTT coverage is on-going under the Digital Television Action Plan, a copy of which is available at www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk. Digital television services are also available to around 98 per cent. of UK households on digital satellite and to around 25 per cent. of households on digital cable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many foreign visitors she estimates visited Romford in 2002&#150;03.  [136474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The International Passenger Survey records visits to Romford as part of the total for London; figures on the number of visits by foreign residents specifically to Romford are not collected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the total amount given in lottery grants was for each constituency in the past 10 years; and what the total amount of lottery money raised in each constituency was in the past 10 years, listed in descending order according to the amount spent in each constituency.  [136964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_spnew5"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 I am arranging for the information detailing the total amount given in lottery grants in each constituency to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="31106w10.html_para1">Information about National Lottery ticket sales is not broken down by constituency, but the National Lottery Commission is able to provide information about sales broken down by postcode area. I shall write to my hon. Friend with it as soon as possible, placing copies of my letter in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="31106w10.html_para2">Ticket sales do not directly link to the overall amount of money raised by the lottery. Payments not in respect of ticket sales form a part of lottery income and this money cannot be attributed to any specific area.

<a name="31106w10.html_wqn6"><B> Chris Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the total amount of Lottery grants given to <i>(a)</i> the richest 100 wards in the UK and <i>(b)</i> the poorest 100 wards in the UK in the past 10 years was, in descending order.  [136965]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w10.html_spnew6"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Based on information provided by the Lottery distributors for the Department's Lottery awards database, and using the most recent Index of Multiple Deprivation, the amounts awarded to the most and least deprived wards are in the tables. Since 2000, due to boundary changes, a number of wards have ceased to exist and so are not shown in the tables.
<P>

<a name="31106w10.html_para3">The lists relate only to England as no comparable UK list is available.

<a name="31106w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of the New Community Development Fund sports budget will be allocated to <i>(a)</i> tennis, netball, hockey and swimming and <i>(b)</i> other women's and girls' sporting activities.  [136794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Under the Community Club Development Programme, a total of &#163;60 million has been made available over 2003&#150;06 for the development of facilities at community sports clubs. Of that total, tennis will receive &#163;9.4 million as one of four major participation sports (the others being football, rugby and cricket). Netball, hockey and swimming will receive &#163;1.66 million each.
<P>

<a name="31106w11.html_para0">The Government have not made these funds available on the assumption that these, or other, sports are exclusively for women or girls. Each of the 16 sports included in the programme will make funds available for the encouragement of women's and girls' participation, against their own development plans.

<a name="31106w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Best: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps her Department is taking to tackle obesity through sport.  [136649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government are aware that obesity levels are rising, especially among young people. Raising levels of community participation is key to tackling this. The Government are addressing this by investing in high-quality local sport and activity resources which are available to all. The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and Space for Sport and the Arts are putting over &#163;581 million into new PE and school sport facilities in England and Wales, and putting over &#163;400 million into local sports facilities, healthy living centres and activity centres for young people. In addition, we are supporting the vital network of 110,000 amateur sports clubs with a new &#163;60 million capital investment, tax and charity breaks, and mandatory rate relief. &#163;28 million is also being invested by my Department in the recruitment, training and deployment of sports coaches across the UK.

 Under its modernisation and restructuring programme, Sport England is devolving greater responsibility for funding decisions on community sports projects to its regional offices. New Regional Sports Boards, constituted as sub-committees of Sport England, will prepare Regional Sports Strategies in consultation with all relevant regional interests, including regional development agencies. The strategies will inform funding decisions in the regions.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is working with other Government Departments and agencies to deliver the Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) programme during all school holidays, including half-term breaks. The programme builds on the success of last year's Splash Extra and Summer Plus schemes and aims to reduce youth offending, encourage children and young people to return to education or training and build community cohesion.
<P>

<a name="31106w11.html_para2">PAYP engages young people through arts, sports and educational activities. It is targeted at those young people most at risk of offending or truancy and areas where community cohesion or street crime is identified as being a particular problem.
<P>

<a name="31106w11.html_para3">It will run for an initial period of three years and is funded by the Department for Education and Skills, the Home Office and by the National Lottery through the New Opportunities Fund. The Youth Justice Board is making an in-kind contribution. The funds available for the first year total &#163;25 million and funding for years 2 and 3, to be confirmed shortly, will remain at least at this level. The programme is being delivered through the Government Offices for the Regions who in turn appoint sub-regional Lead Delivery Agents to plan provision according to local need. The most at risk young people receive key worker support to ensure continuity between school holiday periods.
<P>

<a name="31106w11.html_para4">The programme ran in four locations in the Leeds North West constituency and provided a total number of 549 places on 126 activities.
<P>

<a name="31106w11.html_para5">A full evaluation of the effectiveness of the year-round holiday provision is under way and key findings are expected to be available around May 2004. In the meantime initial feedback from the summer and half term programmes&#151;which is still being collated&#151;suggests a high level of take-up of the schemes over these periods and promising associated benefits.

 The decision on the appropriate purchasing strategy for any procurement has to take into account a wide range of factors, underpinned by the need to provide the armed forces with the equipment they require at best value for money for the taxpayer.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs pursuant to his answer of 22 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 631W, on divorced parents, if he will commission research on the impact upon children of one divorced parent being given leave to remove their children from the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement.  [136099]<P>

<P>
<a name="31106w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There are no plans to commission such research. Applications to remove children from the jurisdiction (of England and Wales) are made under Section 13(1)(b) of the Children Act 1989. The Section stipulates that where a residence order made under the Act is in force with respect to a child, no person may

"remove him from the United Kingdom; without either the written consent of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the court".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31106w13.html_para1">However, to take a child out of the country either parent requires the written or oral consent of the other parent, even if it is for less than one month. Where there is a residence order in place, the parent in whose favour the residence order is made may remove or send the child outside the UK for up to one month, provided there are no other court orders in place, e.g. a prohibited steps order. When making a residence order, the court may grant the necessary leave to remove the child either generally or for specific purpose.

 On 14 October, representatives from food supplement industry trade associations met with representatives of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to discuss requirements for dossiers supporting addition of nutrient sources to the lists appended to the Food Supplements Directive. The meeting was constructive. EFSA representatives indicated that applicants should submit data establishing the identity and purity of the nutrient source, and any available safety data. EFSA would then advise whether further data were required, taking into account similarities with substances which have already been approved either as nutrient sources or as additives. This, together with advice that combined dossiers for similar substances are welcome, means that dossier preparation costs for many of the 'missing' substances will be significantly lower than previously estimated. The Food Standards Agency is writing to inform interested parties of the outcome and will continue to liaise with EFSA and European Commission representatives on this issue.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2003]</i>: The Department of Health has not commissioned any research that looks at horizontal gene transfer from genetically modified (GM) bacteria to gut bacteria. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) however has published research on the use of human volunteers to examine the potential for horizontal gene transfer from GM food to gut bacteria. Seven people were involved in the study. No intact DNA was shown to be transferred to intestinal tract bacteria. The current state of knowledge regarding gene transfer was reviewed in the GM science review. This concluded that "transgenic DNA is no different from other DNA consumed as part of the normal diet and it will have a similar fate". The science review is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31106w15.html_para1">Applications to use oral GM bacteria are assessed on a case by case basis by either the Health and Safety Executive (under the Contained Use Regulations), or by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (under the Deliberate Release Regulations). Each application involving the use of GM bacteria is comprehensively evaluated with regard to safety, including gene transfer.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2003]</i>: Bids are treated in strict confidence and the information requested cannot be given. The specific clinical conditions to be addressed through the funding for both pharmacogenetic research and research into gene therapy for single gene disorders will depend on what bids are submitted by the research community and how the individual bids stand up to rigorous assessment through peer review.

 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2003]:</i> The Department of Health is working to improve access to genito urinary medicine (GUM) services. Primary care trusts should ensure that local GUM services are designed to meet local needs. The Department of Health is supporting them in this role through the provision of additional investment to 'pump-prime' GUM services and address long-waiting times and backlogs in those areas where it is most needed.
<P>

<a name="31106w15.html_para2">&#163;13 million was invested in GUM services in 2003&#150;04 and over &#163;6 million in 2002&#150;03, with additional funding of &#163;5 million announced this year in our response to the Health Select Committee's report on sexual health. To support those areas with little or no GUM services, or where services are struggling to cope with demand, a further &#163;2 million in 2003&#150;04 will be used to establish a small number of development schemes to pump-prime the establishment of new services or further develop those already in existence.
<P>

<a name="31106w15.html_para3">The Department of Health is also continuing to work to increase the role of primary care in the provision of sexual health services which will help to relieve the pressure on GUM services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w15.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what research evidence he has collated on the <i>(a)</i> incidence and <i>(b)</i> spread of head lice in schools; and what advice he offers head teachers to deal with the problem;  [136009]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions he has had with the Department for Education and Skills on strategies to eliminate head lice in schools.  [136010]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w15.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Department's policy research programme and the central national health service research and development programmes are not currently supporting research into this subject, due to the pressure of other priorities. The Medical Research Council (MRC), which is funded by the Office of Science and Technology, commissions most of the Government's research into bio-medical and clinical issues. The MRC is always open to new sound scientific proposals, in competition with other applications.
<P>

<a name="31106w15.html_para5">Head lice infestation is a relatively common problem among school age children, which is dealt with at local level. Our policy, which is shared by the Department for Education and Skills, is to encourage a "whole school approach" to the detection and treatment of head lice. This entails encouraging parents to check their children and other family members for head lice as need arises, and arranging treatment where necessary with such advice and support from the local primary health care team (general practitioner, health visitor, school nurse or local pharmacist) as they may require. If this exercise is successfully undertaken at the same time by all parents of children within a school, then the spread of head lice will be arrested.
<P>

<a name="31106w15.html_para6">This Department is in regular contact with the Department for Education and Skills on a range of health issues relating to pupils' health, including the treatment of head lice. Officials from both Departments provide advice to schools and parents on head lice control, including a leaflet containing guidance on prevention and treatment. This is also available on the Department's website at: http://www.doh.gov.uk/headlice/ including translations in 10 languages.

 The current legislative framework governing the authorisation of medicinal products contains neither obligations nor incentives to either evaluate medicinal products for use in the paediatric population or to make the products available for paediatric use. The United Kingdom is taking an active part in developing European legislation which will establish a system of obligations and incentives for the development and evaluation of medicines for paediatrics use. This is, however, unlikely to be finalised before 2006.
<P>

<a name="31106w16.html_para5">In the meantime, the UK will continue to use the existing regulatory framework to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate medicines for use in the paediatric population. The Committee on Safety of Medicines, an independent expert committee that advises the Licensing Authority has established a paediatric sub-group to provide expert advice on the regulatory strategy to improve the availability of medicines licensed for use in children.

<a name="31106w16.html_para6">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) routinely asks companies for paediatric development plans where appropriate, both pre- and post-licensing. In addition, when a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product is granted or amended the pharmaceutical companies are required by the Licensing Authority to provide evidence-based statements on paediatric use in the summary of product characteristics. The MHRA monitors authorisations granted for the paediatric use of medicines in the United States and contacts the marketing authorisation holder with a request for the data to be submitted to the MHRA for assessment. Several companies have submitted data in response to such requests and UK authorisations for paediatric use have been granted as a result. In other cases, the MHRA has asked companies to consider developing formulations of medicinal products that are specifically adapted for paediatric use. Following positive responses, the MHRA is actively discussing formulation development plans with several companies.

 'Polymer fume fever' is a term applied to an influenza-like illness associated with the inhalation of products resulting from heating polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, marketed under the trade name Teflon) and other fluorocarbon polymers, to temperatures of about 300&#150;450 degrees centigrade. These temperatures are well above those involved in cooking food in non-stick pans. Polymer fume fever is usually a mild and self limiting condition. Almost all reports of this condition relate to occupational exposure. Although the temperatures needed could arise from the misuse of non-stick pans, this does not appear to be a significant problem in practice. There is only one case report in the published literature which attributed these symptoms to exposure to fumes from an unattended cooking pan which overheated (Blandford et al. A case of PTFE poisoning in cockatiels accompanied by polymer fume fever in the owner. <i>Vet Record</i> v.96 175&#150;6 (1975)).

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received various comments on the planning of housing for older people from groups representing or having an interest in older people's housing. These include responses to the recent publication for consultation of "Influencing The Size, Type And Affordability of Housing", which set out proposed changes to the current policies on planning for affordable housing. The Housing and Older People Development Group, which advises the Department of

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. As far as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware, the powers in section 334 of the Housing Act 1985 have not been used by local authorities or my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister in recent years. However, all local authorities have carried out assessments of the need for new affordable housing, to underpin their housing strategies. Part 7 of the Local Government Act 2003 puts these strategies on a statutory footing for the first time.

into force; how many appeals it is expected to change; which appeals it applies to; and how many refusals there were on 5 September.  [136941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w18.html_spnew13"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The proposal to reduce the time allowed for an applicant to decide whether to lodge an appeal was one of many aimed at speeding up and improving the effectiveness of the planning system announced in the Green Paper "Planning: Delivering a Fundamental Change", published in 2002. The amendment is not expected to change any planning appeals, only to speed up the planning process and prevent delays.
<P>

<a name="31106w18.html_para6">The Amendment Order came into force on 5 September 2003 and reduces the time limit for receipt of section 78 appeals, as specified in article 23(2) of the Town & Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995. The reduced time limit also applies to an appeal made under section 78(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The reduced time limit applies to applications received by the local planning authority on or after 5 September 2003.
<P>

<a name="31106w18.html_para7">The decision on whether to allow a planning permission or not remains within the remit of a local planning authority and as such information on the number of applications refused on 5 September 2003 could be gathered only at disproportionate cost.

 Regional Housing Boards have been formed specifically to include representatives able to act collectively and corporately on all housing issues in their regions, including the needs of rural areas. Each Board is chaired by the Regional Director of the Government Office, the most senior official in each region responsible for rural affairs. Others, particularly the senior representatives from the Housing Corporation, carry rural issues as part of their wider remits. There has also been significant input from rural local authorities and others with an interest in rural issues in development by the Boards of Regional Housing Strategies. The Communities Plan, which introduced the Boards, makes clear that the Countryside Agency must be involved to ensure that all Strategies are rural proofed.

 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 "Housing" (March 2000) requires local planning authorities to provide wider housing opportunity and choice, and a better mix in the size and type of housing than is currently available.
<P>

<a name="31106w19.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently published for consultation proposed changes to the current policies on planning for housing mix set out in PPG3. The consultation document "Influencing The Size, Type And Affordability Of Housing" proposes that local planning authorities should plan to meet the housing requirements of the whole community by planning for a mix of housing types and sizes that reflects up-to-date assessments. It proposes new policy which would allow local planning authorities, where appropriate local plan policies are in place, to reject developments that conflict with the objective of widening housing choice.

<a name="31106w19.html_para2">A local planning authority can secure a range of sizes of housing either by granting permission to a planning application or by attaching a planning condition, where this information is not provided by a planning application. Alternatively, notes could be appended to an outline permission to give the developer guidance as to what precise form of development will be acceptable to the local planning authority. A section 106 agreement can be employed to secure that some of the housing for which planning permission has been granted must be affordable housing, and the agreement can specify the type of that housing.

 The Housing Corporation launched their new approach to investment on 24 October. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has agreed that as part of the phased introduction of the 'new approach' that total cost indicators (TCIs) will be phased out over time. For the Social Housing Grant bidding round for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, TCIs have been uprated by an average of 8 per cent. using a range of 5 per cent. to 15 per cent. based on existing TCI groupings.

Levels of all taxes are reviewed as part of the annual Budget process, taking account of a range of social, economic and environmental considerations. The Chicago Convention prohibits the imposition of taxes or charges on fuel kept on board aircraft and consumed on international flights.

This is because information held on foreshore lease arrangements in Scotland in previous years cannot readily identify income from piers and marinas. However, the estimated income for the current financial year in Scotland is &#163;95,000 from piers and &#163;60,000 from marinas, and this would be indicative of income in previous years.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the answer of 27 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 38W, on Crown Estate income, how much income has been received by the Crown Estate from rents paid for cables which connect <i>(a)</i> Orkney, <i>(b)</i> Shetland and <i>(c)</i> other Scottish Islands to the UK mainland for each financial year since 1997; and what estimate the Government have made of the impact on UK businesses of charges levied by the Crown Estate for cables that use the seabed.

 Revenue paid to The Crown Estate for cables to Orkney, Shetland and other Scottish Islands from the UK mainland is calculated under the British Telecom Master Agreement. The revenue is not calculated for each specific piece of land that is crossed and therefore information for cables connecting individual Scottish Islands is not identifiable. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer I gave earlier today 



<P>

regarding the revenue received by the Crown Estate from cables crossing either the seabed or land managed by the Crown Estate since 1997.
<P>

<a name="31106w20.html_para9">Rents charged by the Crown Estate for use of the seabed are established by professional valuers in negotiation with users, and where appropriate, involve consultation with the relevant industry or interest groups. The rents are set at levels appropriate to the market conditions and must not take advantage of any monopoly interest. The Crown Estate must comply with the requirements placed upon it by Parliament under The Crown Estate Act 1961, with regards to the maintenance of the Estate and the income which it yields. The Crown Estate manages the estate according to sound commercial principles, and also understands and works with the industries that use its assets to ensure that high standards of management and stewardship are followed.

 Claims for tax credits are processed as quickly as possible. Claims for which no further information is required, and which pass the various pre award checks, go through the stages of calculating the award quickly and will normally be in payment within a few days. Once an award has been made, the Inland Revenue identify the families who are entitled to a health costs exemption certificate and send the data to the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) to issue the certificates on behalf of the Department of Health. On receipt of the data the PPA processes tax credit exception claims and issues the certificate within 30 days of valid data being received. Data are sent monthly from the IR to the PPA.
<P>

<a name="31106w21.html_para4">Since the new tax credits were introduced in April 2003, the PPA has issued over 1.7 million certificates for tax credit claims. A certificate is issued on an individual basis and a couple would therefore receive one each.

 HIV/AIDS is a human catastrophe and a significant development challenge. This is acknowledged by many governments and it is frequently discussed in meetings the Department for International Development has with partner countries. The issue is also discussed in a range of regional and international fora.
<P>

<a name="31106w22.html_para4">HIV/AIDS is not just a health problem. It requires a response that addresses public services like education, livelihoods and food security, access to justice and security. In Malawi for example DFID is working with other donors and the Malawian Government to ensure that the Poverty Reduction Strategies addresses the impact of HIV/AIDS on all public services. In education, DFID is currently working with the UNAIDS Interagency Task Team for Education and HIV/AIDS to promote high level understanding and leadership, and strengthen the technical capacity of developing countries to develop and implement effective education responses to the epidemic.

 We expect the very latest statistics on orphans to be published in a report by UNICEF, "Africa's Orphaned Generations", on 23 November 2003. Until then the international community, including DFID, has drawn on the joint UNAIDS, UNICEF, USAID Report, "Children on the Brink 2002", which provides statistics on current and projected numbers of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS in 88 countries.
<P>

<a name="31106w22.html_para5">"Children on the Brink 2002" estimates that 13.4 million children under the age of 15 had lost one or both parents to AIDS in 2001. 11 million of these children are in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2010, this number is expected to rise to 25 million, with probable large increases in Asia. In the hardest hit countries, it is estimated that 15 per cent. of all children will be orphaned by AIDS by 2005.

 HIV/AIDS has created an unprecedented orphan crisis. By 2001 13.4 million children had lost one or both parents to AIDS. The growing impacts of HIV/AIDS on children, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have strong implications for the achievement of all development goals. Co-ordinating and harmonising the response to this crisis is a key challenge for the international community.

<a name="31106w22.html_para6">In June 2001, DFID joined the rest of the international community at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS in adopting the Declaration of Commitment which set common targets for reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and alleviating its impact. The Declaration includes three strong commitments to provide special assistance to children orphaned and affected by HIV/AIDS.
<P>

<a name="31106w22.html_para7">DFID is now working with UNAIDS and UNICEF, who are co-ordinating other development agencies and NGOs to develop a Global Strategic Framework to translate the UNGASS Declaration into country level action and commitment. Other governments engaged in this process include the US, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, and Denmark. Emphasis is placed on the need to strengthen community-based care of orphans and ensure that they stay in school.
<P>

<a name="31106w22.html_para8">At the country level, we are in dialogue with governments and development partners to ensure that national responses to the epidemic include appropriate provision for the education, health, nutrition and housing needs of orphaned as well as their protection from abuse and exploitation. In Uganda, we have supported the Government in the implementation of free universal primary education. Prior to the introduction of the free Universal Primary Education policy, 12 per cent. fewer orphans were attending school compared to non-orphans. In 2000 this had diminished to 4 per cent. as a result of free primary education. In Malawi we are working with other donors and the Government of Malawi to ensure that the needs of orphans and vulnerable children are addressed through the Poverty Reduction Strategy processes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The UK recognises that in order to be effective the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) needs predictable and sustainable financing. The UK recently extended its pledge by a further two years to 2008 bringing our total contribution to approximately US$280million.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para0">The pattern of our disbursements has been agreed with the Global Fund Secretariat&#151;for the financial year 2002&#150;03, the UK provided &#163;50 million in two separate payments of &#163;25 million, in 2003&#150;04 the UK provided &#163;25 million, in 2004&#150;05 we will provide &#163;30 million, and in 2005&#150;06 we will provide &#163;33 million. In the years 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 we have pledged US$40 million per year.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para1">UK funding is subject to the GFATM reflecting a clear poverty focus, achieving a better financing system, integrating the Fund's activities more effectively with national programmes and meeting agreed benchmarks to monitor its effectiveness.

 The Government have recently informed the Transitional National Government (TNG) of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and made public, a significant stepping up of its engagement with the DRC, following the installation of the TNG this summer. This year, our programme will amount to &#163;23 million.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para2">Ensuring a successful transition process, including embedding the TNG, is crucial to our overall goal of ensuring peace and poverty reduction in the DRC and through that, the region as a whole. As a member of the International Committee for Support to the Transition, we are pressing for a well developed and shared understanding between donors and government of the Transition Process and of the varied challenges and milestones that the process will entail, as well as strong day-to-day co-ordination of their support efforts.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para3">We are providing &#163;700,000 in direct support for the basic infrastructure needs of the Transition Institutions, which include the President and four Vice Presidents, Government, Parliament, Senate, Supreme Court and the five Democracy Support Commissions (Elections, Human Rights, Truth and Reconciliation, Anti-Corruption and Media).

 We believe that national elections are a key part of the transition period under way in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and an important challenge for the new Transitional National Government (TNG). This will require not only support from donors but also strong and effective engagement by civil society and a free and responsible media.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para5">We are currently providing &#163;700,000 in direct support for the basic infrastructure needs of the Transition Institutions, which include the President and four Vice Presidents, Government, Parliament, Senate, Supreme Court and the five Democracy Support Commissions, including the Independent Electoral Commission. When the financial needs of the electoral process become clearer, we will consider what further support we might give. With other donors and the TNG, we are looking at how we can provide core funding for all five Democracy Support Commissions (Elections, Human Rights, Anti-Corruption, Media and Truth and Reconciliation). We are promoting donor coordination and harmonisation to ensure an effective approach towards all aspects of holding free and fair elections.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para6">Media pluralism is critical for encouraging and supporting political pluralism. We are therefore providing support to the media sector not only as above through the Media Commission, but also: through &#163;500,000 funding to Panos Paris, an NGO who are working to build capacity and strengthen the media sector to improve access to, and quality of information; and over &#163;1 million through Foundation Hirondelle to support Radio Okapi, the UN linked radio station which broadcasts good quality news and peace messages and will play an important part in the elections.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps his Department is taking to meet the Millennium Development Goal to reduce the level of maternal mortality among mothers in childbirth in developing countries, with particular reference to Africa.  [136278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31106w23.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are central to DFID's work, including the goal to improve maternal health, and its associated target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) by 75 per cent. between 1990 and 2015. Our Public Service Agreement includes ambitious targets on increasing access in Africa and Asia to skilled attendance at childbirth. Skilled attendance is an important contributor to safe childbirth and serves as an internationally agreed proxy indicator of progress towards the maternal health MDG, trends in maternal mortality being notoriously difficult to assess directly. DFID's strategy includes advocacy in the international arena, support to countries to strengthen health systems and improve access to maternal and reproductive health services, and support for research and improved measurement tools. DFID is participating in a new international partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health.
<P>

<a name="31106w23.html_para12">Sub-Saharan Africa bears a disproportionate burden of maternal mortality. In 2000, there were approximately 247,000 maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, almost half the 529,000 deaths worldwide. We support the maternal health strategies of African countries through health sector budget support, through safe motherhood projects, for example in Kenya and Malawi, and indirectly through general budget support. Since 1997 we have committed approximately &#163;0.5 billion to health systems strengthening in Africa. We also fund international multilateral agencies and international NGOs active in supporting maternal health programmes in Africa.

 Several cities and towns of Zimbabwe are being affected by the interruption of their water supplies to varying degrees.

We are organising an international conference, co-hosted with the Afghan Government and UNODC that will take place in Kabul in February 2004 with the aim of encouraging wider international community support. The UK also provided financial and human resources to the latest UNODC Farmers Intentions Study. This has helped us to ascertain the best methods of ensuring that Afghan farmers cease to grow opium poppy and pursue alternative livelihoods.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what measures his Department is taking to meet the target set in the 2002 Spending Review to contribute to the reduction of opium production in Afghanistan; and what estimate he has made of changes to the size of the opium harvest in Afghanistan in each of the next three years.

<P>
<a name="31106w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Afghan Transitional Authority (ATA) adopted its National Drug Control Strategy on 19 May 2003. Its objective is to reduce opium poppy cultivation by 70 per cent. in five years and by 100 per cent. in 10 years. The UK is committed to helping the ATA achieve this objective and has prepared a balanced programme of counter-narcotics activity to support implementation of the Afghan strategy. We have committed &#163;70 million over three years and additional personnel are currently being posted to Afghanistan. It is difficult to assess expected cultivation levels in each year but we do not expect progress to be linear. Experience of counter-narcotics policies in other countries, such as Thailand and Pakistan, shows that cultivation tends to increase before declining. Cultivation also tends to move from traditional areas to more marginal and inaccessible areas to protect crops against law enforcement activity. Progress in the initial years of assistance towards reducing opium levels will also be dependent upon wider improvements in security and governance.

In the two weeks following the elections, our ambassador to Azerbaijan met twice with President-elect Ilham Aliev, and on both occasions he raised the issue of the post election arrests of opposition party officials and journalists. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Rammell) expressed our concern about the post-electoral developments in a press release of 23 October. A copy of the press release is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases. Many of those detained have since been released.

 We acknowledge progress over previous elections in Azerbaijan, but regret that some shortcomings were observed. The International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) stated in its preliminary conclusions that voting was generally well administered in most polling stations, but that the overall election process still fell short of international standards in several respects. It is important that Azerbaijan takes steps to build on the progress it has made and to reaffirm its commitments in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and obligations within the Council of Europe to the democratic process. We await the IEOM's final assessment on the conduct of the elections.
