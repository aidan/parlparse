 There is no need for any monitoring by, or cost to, the Department. The Big Lottery Fund (BLF) asks applicants to identify where its funding will be used. This information is collected and analysed at minimum cost. BLF regularly monitor these data to ensure that communities receive a fair share of lottery money. It is freely accessible throughout the organisation and therefore the BLF does not monitor its cost. Sport England does not hold a regional breakdown of funding, and while I have not made an estimate, it would exceed the disproportionate cost limit considerably to commission the work, and that is without considering the cost of monitoring.</p>

 The Air Travel Trust Funds meets the cost of refunds and repatriation arising from the insolvency of a travel company under the Air Travel Organisers License (ATOL) scheme. The deficit of the Air Travel Trust Fund was reported as £31.8 million in the Funds' annual accounts for the year ending 31 March 2010. One of the objectives of the reforms to the ATOL scheme that I announced to the House on 3 February 2011 is to reduce the Air Travel Trust Fund's deficit and return it to financial sustainability. It is expected that the Fund will be in surplus within three years of the reforms being implemented. The precise timing depends on a number of factors including the frequency and cost of travel company insolvencies.</p>

However, it is possible that regulations sponsored by the Department for Transport have been revoked by instruments for which other Departments have policy responsibility.

 The school and college (key stage 5) performance tables have included achievements in the international baccalaureate alongside A-levels since 1994. International GCSE (iGCSE) achievements were also included in the 2010 secondary school (key stage 4) performance tables for the first time, and will continue to be included from now on. As with all other qualifications included in the tables, iGCSEs are first accredited by Ofqual. This gives schools, parents, pupils, universities and employers an independent guarantee of quality. As soon as iGCSEs are accredited, the predecessor qualifications can be included in the performance tables. Some iGCSEs were not accredited in time, so could not be included in the 2010 tables. However, we fully expect that the most popular iGCSEs will be included in the 2011 performance tables.</p>

<i> [holding answer 31 January 2011]:</i> The Government believe that their new approach to encouraging competitive sport, including the changes to the funding of posts that were part of the previous Administration's strategy (such as competition managers), will result in more pupils playing more competitive sport. We can do much better than the two out of every five pupils that play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and the one in five pupils that plays regularly against other schools, reported last year. The national curriculum for physical education already requires schools to provide competitive sports for all pupils in maintained schools, aged five to 16, and we will make this clearer through the review of the national curriculum. We envisage schools and teachers taking greater control over what is taught in schools, innovating in how they teach it and developing new approaches. At the same time, we are encouraging the world of sport to improve and expand the competitions that are offered to schools, through the creation of a new School games.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Education, my right hon.

A final payment will be made to partnerships in Warrington at the end of February 2011, which covers the period to the end of the summer term. After that, it is up to the schools in Warrington whether they work in partnerships to organise physical education and competitive sports and how they fund this from their dedicated school grant. We envisage schools and teachers taking greater control over what is taught in PE, innovating in how they teach and developing new approaches. The Secretary of State also announced in December 2010 that the Department will provide £65 million in the new spending review period for secondary schools to release a PE teacher for a day a week to help local schools embed good practice and organise competitive sports. Secondary schools in Warrington will be eligible for a share of this funding. The Department is developing the arrangements for this and will notify schools in due course.</p>

Child support legislation establishes that, where a child is adopted, responsibility for the child, should they qualify for child maintenance, rests with the adoptive parent (section 26(2) of the Child Support Act 1991). The liability of a biological parent to maintain her/his child ends on adoption and the parent by adoption becomes the only person liable to maintain the child. This approach supports the principle expressed in the Adoption and Children Act 2002, namely that someone who is adopted should be treated in law as the natural born child of the person who has adopted them.</p>

 This Government is determined to deal with the legacy of youth unemployment. In all parts of the country our approach is to ensure that young unemployed people get the personalised help they need to find sustainable employment. Jobcentre Plus local offices will have more control to allow them to deliver in a way that is more responsive to local needs. Work Programme providers will be free to design support based on the needs of individuals and target the right support at the right time. Both Jobcentre Plus and Work Programme providers will work with local public, private, and third sector organisations where this delivers the best job outcomes for individuals.</p>

 Since 1998 a number of measures have been introduced by the United Kingdom blood services to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vGJD). These measures include the introduction of leucodepletion (the removal of white blood cells), the importation of fresh frozen plasma for children and the deferral from donation of transfusion recipients.

Further measures bring the estimated total cost to £540 million since 1998, with an estimated current annual cost of approximately £40 million.</p>

 As part of the spending review, national health service funding rising to £1 billion per annum by 2014-15 will be spent on measures that support social care and also benefit health. The "Operating Framework for the NHS in England for 2011-12" sets out that primary care trusts (PCTs) will need to transfer this funding to local authorities to invest in social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. The Department has also made available an extra £162 million from efficiency savings this financial year for local health and care services. The money should be spent on helping people to leave hospital more quickly, re-ablement and the prevention of unnecessary admissions to hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"><a name="110301w0003.htm_para27"><a name="1103022001155">At the local level, the NHS and local authorities should work together to improve the health and wellbeing of their local populations. As outlined in the Operating Framework 2011-12, NHS organisations should be working with partners on implementing the National Dementia Strategy. Moreover, the Carers' Strategy also identified that £400 million will be made available for carers' breaks over the next four years (2011-12 to 2014-15) and required that PCTs should agree policies, plans and budgets to support carers with local authorities and local carers' organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_448"><a name="110301w0003.htm_para28"><a name="1103022001156">Supporting people to live independently at home following hospital discharge sits at the interface between health and social care and relies on effective discharge planning, access to re-ablement services and both systems working in the interests of the individual. To underpin this, the Department will amend the 'Payment by Results' tariff from April 2012 so that the NHS pays for re-ablement and other post discharge services for 30 days after a patient leaves hospital. From April 2011, trusts will not be reimbursed for unnecessary re-admissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="110301w0003.htm_para29"><a name="1103022001157">To prepare for the changes to the 'Payment by Results' tariff, we have allocated £70 million in 2010-11 for PCTs to spend on re-ablement. This has been further supported by the spending review with £300 million of the £1 billion NHS support for social care being made available for re-ablement services by 2014-15.</p>

Over the spending review period it is estimated that the integration of HMCS and the Tribunals Service will deliver savings of £112 million.</p>

 We are working with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) which is launching a new approach to improving employment outcomes based on payment by results. The Green Paper "Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders" published on 7 December has set out the intention to incentivise Work programme providers to support post-release employment for unemployed offenders, linked to reducing reoffending, and also to engage more employers to train and recruit offenders.</p>

 Personality disorders are common conditions, with differing levels of severity. It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of prisoners, including sentenced and remand prisoners totalling approximately 57,000, would meet the criteria for at least one type of personality disorder. For a relatively small number of offenders, in its most severe forms, personality disorder is linked to a serious risk of harm to themselves and to others. These offenders have highly complex psychological needs that create challenges for staff in terms of management, treatment and maintaining a safe working environment.</p>

 It is the Government's policy to extend or negotiate new prisoner transfer agreements (PTAs) with as many countries as possible. PTAs provide one part of the solution to achieving our objectives of significantly reducing the foreign prisoner population in UK detention and so the burden on the UK taxpayer. In line with our normal practice, wherever possible we seek to negotiate PTAs that do not require prisoners to consent to transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="110301w0004.htm_para35"><a name="1103022002047">In consultation with the FCO, we have reviewed our global policy for the negotiation of new or amended prisoner transfer agreements. This policy reflects both the need to secure agreements with those countries that have the largest nationality groups serving sentences in UK prisons; and those where British nationals are imprisoned abroad, in particular where we have concerns about their welfare. We also seek to take advantage of opportunities where another country is seeking a PTA with the UK: even if the total number of prisoners from that country serving sentences here is small and there is no pressing consular need. Finally, agreement in one country can create momentum for approval in a neighbouring state. We therefore may work on a regional basis if a dynamic allows for progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="110301w0004.htm_para36"><a name="1103022002048">The UK currently has prisoner transfer arrangements with over 100 countries and territories. A prisoner transfer agreement with Rwanda was ratified on 23 November 2010 and in addition to Nigeria, negotiations have begun with other countries including Jamaica, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in line with the policy above. Preparations are under way for the implementation of the EU prisoner transfer agreement which enters into force in December 2011.</p>

 Asbestos was identified in all prisons following a comprehensive survey in 2002-03. Asbestos is still permitted by the Health and Safety Executive in some construction and building activities as there is currently no satisfactory alternative. In prisons it is still used in the gaskets to mechanical systems, but poses a low risk.</p>

This was completed in 2005 at a cost of around £1.4 million. We are not aware of any significant delay or cancellation in this programme to remove asbestos from prisons.</p>

 I refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement I gave on 21 January concerning the Off-Grid Energy market. I am keen that the reasons for the high price of domestic heating oil and supply issues this winter are thoroughly investigated by an independent authority. The Office of Fair Trading market study will provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.

 DECC does not produce a projection of the electricity mix between now and 2030. The generation mix to 2020 and 2030 will be driven by commercial decisions taken within the policy framework for the electricity market. However in the course of analysis undertaken for various policies we run scenarios that result in different generation mixes depending on the assumptions used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="110301w0005.htm_para28"><a name="1103028000076">For example, the analytical work for the Electricity Market Reform consultation document, published on the 16 December 2010, included modelling by Redpoint Energy of the electricity system out to 2030. The modelling work used an indicative carbon emissions target for the electricity system of 100gCO2/kWh by 2030, which was consistent with advice from the Committee on Climate Change at the time. This modelling showed that unabated power stations operating on fossil fuels would provide approximately 54% of electricity supplied in 2020 and approximately 24% of total electricity supplied in 2030.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="110301w0005.htm_para29"><a name="1103028000077">Following this analysis, in December 2010, the Committee on Climate Change suggested that a carbon emissions intensity of 50gCO2/kWh by 2030 would be required to meet longer term carbon goals. This scenario would result in less electricity being supplied from fossil fuel generation in 2030 than under the 100gCO2/kWh scenario.</p>

 The United Kingdom has no established relations with any entity known as the 'Nordic Baltic Alliance'. It is assumed that the hon. Member refers to the Northern Group, a collaborative grouping of willing sovereign nations in Northern Europe that currently enjoys the participation of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden. The Northern Group does not require its participants to assign assets to it nor has any participating nation announced plans to do so.

<i> [holding answer 28 February 2011]:</i> The Government are committed to a stable, predictable and competitive environment for financial services and one favourable to business more generally. The UK bank levy, a permanent tax that came into effect from the beginning of this year, has been introduced as a complement to wider regulatory reforms. The levy ensures that banks make a fair contribution reflecting the risks they pose to the financial system and wider economy and is intended to encourage banks to have less risky funding profiles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="110301w0005.htm_para67"><a name="1103028000253">The June Budget took immediate action to restore tax competitiveness with a phased reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% over the next four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_580"><a name="110301w0005.htm_para68"><a name="1103028000254">At the same time, the UK is leading the argument in the EU and internationally for robust, internationally consistent regulatory standards that will benefit the economy in the long run. On 17 February, the Government published a further consultation "A new approach to financial regulation: building a stronger system" which expands on the proposals set out last summer to establish a new system of specialised and focused financial services regulators. It marks a key step in delivering the coalition Government's commitment to reform financial regulation by providing the Bank of England with control of macro-prudential regulation and oversight of micro-prudential regulation. These reforms will promote greater financial stability.</p>
