This issue has primarily affected fuel tanks on leisure marine vessels, although some older road vehicles may also have been affected. However, ethanol content of UK petrol is not expected to exceed 5 per cent. in the next few years.

These benefits have to be balanced against the potential for some short-term localised impact during seasonal peaks of manure application activities.</p>

The variation in gross income estimates depends on product quality, access to markets (including storage), price, yield and the proportion exported. However, set up costs can exceed $1,000 per hectare with the possibility of no return for the first four years following planting.</p>

 No aid was seized directly from the Department for International Development (DFID) by the Government of Sudan. It is estimated, however, that around &#163;500,000 of British-funded goods were included in the seizures of assets from non government organisations (NGOs). The UK condemned the expulsion and closures of the 13 international NGOs and three local NGOs in unequivocal terms. We have consistently said that the best way to repair the damage was to revoke that action.</p>

 The Government have taken decisive action to ensure this country's housing needs are met. We have committed to investing &#163;7.5 billion over two years to deliver up to 112,000 affordable homes and around 15,000 private homes, including &#163;340 million to support local authorities in delivering new council housing. We have taken early action to provide people facing the threat of repossession with help at every stage of the process. I am also introducing a range of major reforms to the social and private rented sector. This includes the consultations I have recently published on a devolved system of responsibility and funding for council housing, a major review of the private rented sector and changes to social housing allocations to give councils more leeway on decisions to allocate housing in their area, and the initiative I have launched to clamp-down on fraud in the social sector. In addition, I will be setting out further details of the Government's plans to support housing recovery and ensure people have access to decent homes later this year. I therefore currently have no plans to pursue an additional housing reform green paper.</p>

 The Department allocates much of its capital resources on a local authority area basis. It then relies on the local authority to prioritise resources between schools, including any further resource available locally. Accordingly, records on the schools in Hendon which have received funding since 1997, and their purposes, are not held centrally and would be held locally by Barnet local authority.

<i>  [holding answer 9 September 2009]:</i> The Gas Act 1986 (as amended), which among other things set up the gas regulatory bodies, exempted liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from its provisions. The Gas Act principally addressed the issues of setting up a regulatory regime to ensure that the national transmission system for gas users was not exploited. In contrast, there is no natural monopoly in the transport of LPG by road. The LPG market operates with a number of distributors competing for supply using alternative supply sources. In that sense, it is broadly similar to other products such as diesel and petrol.</p>

My officials however have had meetings with Consumer Focus to contribute to its assessment of the market in Great Britain for the supply of LPG and heating oil for domestic use.</p>

our Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health, based at King's College London, is constantly reviewing the development of new treatments across the national and international spectrum and producing advice accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90914w0006.htm_para2"><a name="0909143000797">Diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders in members of the armed forces are performed by trained and accredited mental health personnel. In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide in-theatre care and treatment for our personnel. If personnel need to leave the operational environment, then their care continues either on an out- or in-patient basis in the UK or their permanent base overseas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90914w0006.htm_para3"><a name="0909143000798">In the UK, our mental health services for military personnel are configured to provide community-based mental health care, primarily through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental healthcare. The DCMH mental health teams, comprising psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers, have particular expertise in treatments for psychological injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90914w0006.htm_para4"><a name="0909143000799">For the relatively small number of military patients who need it, in-patient care is currently provided by a group of seven NHS trusts located throughout England and Scotland, led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust (SSSFT) through a central MOD contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90914w0006.htm_para5"><a name="0909143000800">When personnel leave military service their healthcare becomes the responsibility of the NHS. Ex-Service personnel receive good treatment from their GPs but we recognise that many health professionals have limited experience of dealing with veterans who have mental health symptoms arising from their Service experience. The MOD, the four health departments and the Combat Stress charity have been working together with clinical experts and the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (HASCAS) to develop a new model of community based mental healthcare that will address assessment and treatment of veterans' mental health problems in the long term.</p>

Two-year pilots, tailored to local circumstances, are operating at Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Healthcare Trust, Camden and Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust, Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust, Tees Esk and Wear NHS Trust, Cornwall NHS Partnership, and NHS Lothian (led by the Scottish Executive). Evaluation of the pilot areas is now underway; early results from all six are encouraging, with evidence that veterans feel able to access and use the service with confidence. Informed by the results of the evaluation the service will be rolled out across the UK. In the interim, for areas not yet involved in the pilots, veterans with operational service after 1982 who are concerned about their mental health can attend our Medical Assessment Programme based at St. Thomas' hospital, for specialist mental health assessment by a consultant psychiatrist with extensive military experience.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 September 2009]:</i> All Royal Navy fuel depots are subject to stringent safety regulations and are inspected and licensed on an annual basis. MOD is working closely with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to investigate the oil spillage that occurred at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde on 29 July 2009 and the findings are due to be published in the next few months.

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90914w0007.htm_para1"><a name="0909143000896">The initial assessments have similarly found that the oil spillage resulted in minimal impact to safety, including to the personnel employed at the naval base. Results to date also indicate that the incident was dealt with in accordance with the naval base's Oil Spill Contingency Plan by qualified departmental personnel who had access to industry standard personal protective equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="90914w0007.htm_para2"><a name="0909143000897">The Department operates stringent safety operating procedures to ensure that the risk of oil spills is kept as low as reasonably practicable. The circumstances of the spillage are unique to the fuels infrastructure at Faslane and are not replicated across the wider naval fuel depot estate in Scotland. Any lessons learned, however, regarding both the cause of the spillage and our response will be incorporated into working practices and plans as appropriate. Associated risk assessments will also be reviewed to take into account any necessary changes.</p>

 The discussions over the prisoner transfer agreement between the United Kingdom and Libya were part of the wider negotiations for the normalisation of relations with Libya following its renunciation of international terrorism and its voluntary dismantling of weapons of mass destruction. I concluded that the normalisation of relations with Libya, including the fight against terrorism, cooperation in stemming the flow of illegal migration, and wider UK/Libya trade relations, were in the United Kingdom&#146;s national interest.</p>

 Information on 'suicide watches' is not collated or held by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). NOMS has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses proactively identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. At-risk prisoners are cared for using Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. Detailed data is not readily available however some 31,000 ACCT plans are opened each year. These can be opened repeatedly for the same prisoner. There are no easy answers to managing self harming behaviour but NOMS remains committed to finding ways to manage it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90914w0012.htm_para1"><a name="0909143001650">Without exploring the intent behind a self-harm incident, it is difficult to establish such an incident as an attempted suicide. NOMS does not record intent, and does not hold information on attempted suicides. Table 1 shows annual totals of self-harm incidents by type of custody. Although intent is not recorded and the majority of incidents are not life threatening, analyses show that approximately 1.7 per cent. of all self-harm in prison involves hanging as a method or require resuscitation or hospitalisation on life support.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 June 2009]: </i>An important principle set out in legislation (sections 65(1) and 68(2b) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992) is that Ministers cannot intervene in the funding decisions of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). As is the case with other universities, London Metropolitan University receives grant from HEFCE under a Financial Memorandum which sets out how it should properly account for its public funding. It is for the Funding Council to keep the financial health of the institutions it funds under review to protect the public interest, including ensuring that public funds are properly spent.

 The role of UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) is to assist UK companies seeking to do business overseas and overseas companies seeking to invest in the UK. Assisting overseas companies to export to the UK does not fall within its remit. No steps have therefore been taken by UK Trade and Investment to encourage the export of goods from Afghanistan.</p>
