 Entry to the detained fast track procedure is determined by reference to published policy. There are no plans to exclude applicants from the detained fast track process solely because their asylum claim is sexuality-related. However, published policy already stipulates that cases may enter and remain in the process only if they are amenable to a quick, fair and sustainable decision. If at the time of application it is apparent that this condition cannot be fulfilled in a sexuality-related persecution claim, or indeed in a claim with any other basis, the applicant will not be entered into the process.</p>

The only exceptions to the recruitment freeze are for the graduate fast stream, and truly exceptional business-critical and frontline appointments. External recruitment is only allowed once every effort has been made to fill a role internally, from staff in the redeployment pool, or from elsewhere in the civil service. The recruitment freeze and targeted voluntary exit schemes helped reduce the headcount (paid civil servants) of the Home Office and its Executive agencies from 31,459 on 1 June 2010 to 28,162 on 30 June 2011. The largest proportion of the 3,297 reduction has been achieved through voluntary exit schemes.</p>

This must take place prior to the Department being allowed to consider whether to issue notice of compulsory redundancy.</p>

 As part of the work to strengthen the response to organised crime, the key law enforcement agenciesâthe Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), UK Border Agency and the policeâare pooling their intelligence on organised criminal groups. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, run by the City of London police, is also a key contributor. A good example of joint working against organised criminal groups engaged in fraud is the work of the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force (OCTF)  <br/>

            <p>where HMRC, SOCA, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, have been active in tackling organised criminal gangs involved in fuels duty fraud. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has specialist fraud investigation teams which focus specifically on identifying and disrupting organised fraud attacks on the benefits system. Investigations are undertaken in partnership with other agencies such as local authorities, the police and HMRC. There is also a specialist Financial Investigation Unit, which carries out financial investigations to track proceeds of crime and seeks to recover assets where benefit fraud has been committed against DWP. In the last financial year, DWP teams prosecuted 1,076 cases of organised fraud and identified criminal assets totalling Â£8.74 million of which around Â£3.5 million was recovered by confiscation orders.</p>

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is carrying-out an independent investigation into disclosure issues relating to the case. The DPP has also commissioned a separate review of the CPS decisions in this case. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) is undertaking a review of the operational accountability of undercover work conducted by the National Public Order Intelligence Unit and how intelligence activity is authorised in accordance with the law, including consideration of the proportionality of covert tactics in terms of their impact on protest activity. The full Terms of Reference can be found on the HMIC website. HMIC has met with campaigners with, an interest in the issues covered by the Review.</p>

The length of time that this requires varies but is often completed within 12 months. If the PCSO goes on to be recruited as a regular officer and completed training this should not require more than 12 months to complete.

If certificates are required, the CRB will process all applications within its Published Service Standards (PSS), which are to complete 90% of enhanced checks within 28 days and 95% of standard checks within 10 days. The CRB has been exceeding its PSS consistently since December 2010. In June the bureau issued over 96% of enhanced certificates within the target of 28 days.</p>

Of these, three are wholly marine (Carmarthen Bay SPA, Liverpool Bay SPA, and the Outer Thames SPA). Of the 97 SPAs established for breeding seabird colonies, 31 have been extended into the marine environment by up to 4 km. Under the 2010 Habitats Regulations, any plans or projects that are likely to have a significant effect upon one or more of these SPAs are subject to appropriate assessment by competent authorities, including where those activities occur outside the SPA.</p>

The long term trends in dairy production is towards fewer, larger and more productive herds.

 The bank payroll tax, introduced during the previous Parliament, was a one-off tax which applied from 9 December 2009 to 5 April 2010. In line with guidance from the Office for National Statistics, the yield from the bank payroll tax was allocated to the 2010-11 tax year, as this is the point at which the tax was passed into legislation. No further revenues from this tax will be collected in 2011-12.</p>

 In implementing the public sector pay freeze the Valuation Office Agency was unable to make consolidated pay awards in 2010 unless they were contractual or were for staff earning less than Â£21,000 (full-time equivalent). After taking extensive advice, the agency concluded that the 'intentions to maximum' policy was not a contractual obligation and therefore pay increases relating to this policy could not be paid during the pay freeze. No equality impact assessment was carried out as it could have no impact on the implementation of the pay freeze, which is mandatory and affects all staff in the agency. A full equal pay review was undertaken by the agency, in consultation with TUS, after the board's conclusion on the compatibility of the intentions to maximum policy with the terms of the public sector pay freeze.</p>

 We are encouraging local authorities and civil society to collaborate more, including greater involvement for voluntary groups in the design and running of public services. In this context, we recently consulted on light touch statutory guidance on the best value duty setting out some reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with voluntary and community groups and small businesses when facing difficult funding decisions. The consultation closed on 14 June and we expect to provide a government response and publish final guidance this summer.</p>

This will be backed up by the additional support for voluntary and community groups in the Best Value guidance. In addition, the new duties contained in the Localism Bill (i.e. the community rights to challenge and buy) aim to have a greater impact on links between councils and communities.</p>

 The total expenditure by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on hospitality in the financial year 2010-11 was Â£9,957; this figure includes the provision of water, soft drinks and sandwiches for official meetings. The CPS does not routinely fund hospitality for staff, although occasionally a small official event may be held and will be attended by both CPS staff and key stakeholders from other CJS agencies. The CPS does not hold central records of the expenditure on such events attended by staff and the information sought could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Support is tailored to the individual needs of each jobseeker, including help with work-related training and job-search support.

 The benefit cap will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>

1. MA is based on a 5% sample and therefore subject to sampling variation, all other figures are based on 100% data.
2. MA figures are rounded to the nearest 100, JSA are unrounded with all other figures rounded to the nearest 10.
3. Figures are based on the timepoint listed.
4. JSA figures are based on claimant count figures and are available at:

All other figures are available on the Department's website at:
http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=tabtool
5. DLA, AA, and CA figures are based on people in receipt of an allowance, and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
6. Incapacity benefit was replaced for new claims with employment and support allowance in October 2008.
7. Widow's benefits include widow's pension and widowed mother's allowance. All claimants of widow's benefits are female. No new claims for widow's benefits have been accepted since April 2001 when they were replaced by bereavement benefits.
8. Bereavement benefits include bereavement allowance and widowed parent's allowance.
9. Housing benefit/council tax benefit refers to benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple.
10. Winter fuel payments data refer to the final payment run, i.e. they include the late payment run figures.

 The Welfare Reform White Paper sets out that the Department for Work and Pensions will be responsible for organising the delivery of universal credit. It also states that we will continue to pay housing benefit to working age customers until we can migrate them successfully on to universal credit, currently expected to be by October 2017. We have yet to settle on the precise details of how the transition will work, and the effects on housing benefits staff. This approach will ensure an orderly transition and that we have people with relevant skills and experience to support claimants both in work and out of work, as they migrate to the new credit.</p>

This work will also confirm whether and how TUPE will apply for those staff affected in all organisations.</p>

 It is still too early to say how many staff, and what skills and experience will be required for universal credit. Decisions about TUPE and redundancy cannot be made until there is much more definition around the specific roles required to deliver the new universal credit. Although it is anticipated that fewer staff will be required compared to the legacy benefits, it is too early to say which staff and organisations will be affected. The impact on local authority staff will be affected by the design of the council tax benefit replacement, and decisions about the delivery model for universal credit.</p>

The provisions are longstanding and I can confirm that no legal advice on the development of the provisions has been given in recent years. However, we are satisfied that there is no legal difficulty with any disparity between differing terms of service in the three services or between different age groups. Individuals join a single service of their choosing, not the armed forces generally, and each service has different operational requirements. Depending upon which service a recruit has chosen they must abide by its requirements in relation to terms of engagement.</p>

They mainly fall into four broad categories: counter improvised explosive device systems (detection and defeating the device); improved protected mobility (for example, the foxhound vehicles); information management and information exploitation systems; and base protection intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) systems. The Ministry of Defence undertakes to deliver all UORs to theatre as quickly as possible, usually within 12-18 months, however, some procurements take only a matter of weeks.</p>

 BBC Hindi provides services via shortwave, FM, online and to mobile devices. The cost of BBC Hindi, excluding the costs of transmission and UK-based accommodation, technology and studio operations, was Â£1.7 million in 2010-11. It is not possible to give figures, for the excluded costs as they are used by more than one BBC World Service and an accurate break down of the cost to BBC Hindi is not available. However, according to the BBC World Service's evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, savings associated with changes to BBC Hindi announced in January would be about Â£680,000 in production costs. Additionally, there would be Â£190,000 savings in distribution costs.</p>

 Cabinet Office has not introduced any new regulation in the last 12 months.

 The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill includes provisions to implement fundamental reforms to how no win no fee conditional fee agreements operate across all categories of civil litigation, for both claimants and defendants. Under our proposals, claimants in libel cases would still be able to bring claims under no win no fee agreements. The Bill is now before the public bill committee for scrutiny. The Government are not minded to delay the reforms to no win no fee agreements in respect of libel cases, which are intended to make the costs of civil litigation more proportionate.</p>

 The Government are committed to encouraging the public to resolve their issues out of court without recourse to public funds, using simpler, more informal remedies where they are appropriate. In this context, my Department is working to develop proposals to promote wider use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) across the courts and tribunals system.</p>

               <a name="11072013000177"> Insofar as employment tribunals are concerned, and given the unique position of ACAS in the employment dispute resolution system, ADR is already embedded as a central feature of the process. The Pre Claim Conciliation scheme run by ACAS allows parties to engage in ADR before claims are even lodged with a tribunal. The Governmentâs consultation paper âResolving Workplace Disputesâ sets out how we intend to build on our experience in this area.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_750"> 
               <a name="110719w0005.htm_para13"> 
               <a name="11072013000178"> However, it is generally accepted that there will be cases which reach the tribunal but have little or no prospect of success. Identifying these cases at an early stage helps tribunals to allocate resources more effectively. There are already wide-ranging powers for employment judges to case manage proceedings from an early stage. These include holding interim hearings to consider the relevant issues involved. Tribunals have the power to make deposit orders where a claim/response has little reasonable prospect of success; and ultimately to strike out any claim/response which has no reasonable prospect of success. Again, the âResolving Workplace Disputesâ consultation considers how these powers could be made more effective.</p>

               <a name="11072013000179"> In the tribunals system more widely, we have considered early neutral evaluation (ENE) techniques, alongside others. Given the findings from pilot exercises, there was no clear case for onward consideration of ENE specifically. However, we have been able to apply lessons learned to good effect and we are considering how increased use of ADR could be further encouraged across the civil, family and administrative justice system.</p>

 While Employment Tribunals collate, and HMCTS regularly publishes, data on awards made, no data are collected on whether those awards are satisfied in individual cases. This is largely because of the difficulties in collecting any reliable data, particularly in the scenario where judgment creditors receive payment but then (understandably) fail to report that fact to the tribunal after the end of their case. In any event, once an award has been given, it falls to the claimant to enforce that award using the civil courts should they so wish.</p>

The Fast Track enables the claimant to have a High Court Enforcement Officer (HCEO) appointed to their case as soon as the respondent has defaulted in payment of the award. The HCEO will then take forward the enforcement process on behalf of the claimant.</p>

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply that I gave on 9 June 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> column 473W. The normal pension age (NPA) for Prison Service staff is in line with the relevant provisions of the principal civil service pension scheme (PCSPS). Lord Hutton's final report on the proposed reform of public service pensions recommended that a pension age of 60 might be more appropriate for employees in uniformed services to recognise the unique nature of their job. Consultation will take place on what form this takes and whom it covers as part of the reform process.</p>

 The decision to close these two sites is not a reflection of performance at either establishment. It followed a rigorous economic evaluation of every establishment in the prison estate based on age and economic factors, including operating costs, outstanding maintenance issues and land value. This gave a ranked economic assessment of the prison estate which was then used as the basis for an operational assessment which considered the geographic and strategic function that each prison provides to the rest of the Prison Service and the possible staffing implications of closure. The process of selection and decision making was therefore not based on a single piece of analysis which can be placed in the Library.</p>

 Such representations could be received by a large number individuals and groups within the Ministry of Justice and National Offender Management Service, and no central record is kept. To provide this information could therefore be provided only at disproportionate cost. The prisons announced for competition by the Secretary of State on 13 July 2011 were chosen because they form a balanced package that meets our competition priorities. We expect to obtain savings from each of these prisons, which will help the National Offender Management Service meet its revised budget for the spending review period. Individual prisons within the package also offer the potential for service innovation, as outlined in the Competition Strategy for Offender Services.</p>

 Under the education maintenance allowance (EMA) scheme payments were not made on the basis of a defined vulnerable group, but on the basis of an assessment of household income.

There were 1,664 such young people who were resident in London and receiving EMA in 2010-11.</p>

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 No representations concerning errors in A level marking have been received by the Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), during the past six months. As regulator of the examination awarding bodies concerned, it is for the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) to work with the awarding bodies to investigate any issues concerning A level examination marking standards. Ofqual have not advised Education Ministers of any representations on this matter during the last six months. No forecast of A level marking errors has been prepared for Ministers. While it is not feasible to eliminate all incidences of error from the initial marking process, Ministers expect that awarding bodies will always operate procedures to minimise marking errors, and that all suspected errors that are subsequently reported to them by schools will then be dealt with through the established inquiry and appeals mechanisms.</p>

 On 5 April 2011 I chaired a roundtable meeting of senior representatives from organisations with wide-ranging knowledge and experience of child sexual exploitation. We recognised that much excellent work is being done around the country, especially by voluntary and community organisations who have a key role in reaching out to and engaging the most vulnerable children and young people. However, we identified a number of further actions that needed to be taken by the Government, working with national and local partners, to safeguard children and young people from this appalling form of child abuse.</p>

This will ensure that the review has the best chance of determining how schools can be supported to improve the quality of PSHE teaching and of how to give teachers the flexibility to use their judgment about how best to deliver PSHE education.</p>

Independent schools can apply to become free schools and receive state funding, which would give them equivalent funding to other publicly-funded schools of a similar character in the same local authority area.</p>

 We have introduced the Pupil Premium to provide additional funding to schools to help raise the attainment of deprived pupils. Eligibility for the Pupil Premium is based on known eligibility for Free School Meals (FSM) as the link between FSM eligibility and educational underachievement is strong. We aim to extend the coverage of the Pupil Premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for FSM.</p>

However, whether a school provides school meals more generally should not be a significant factor in this registration as a school or local authority must provide a meal for FSM pupils where valid requests for such meals are made.

The method makes use of the internationally applied concept of attributable fractions. In the case of alcohol-related admissions, an attributable fraction represents the estimated percentage of admissions that can be attributed to alcohol consumption. The NWPHO estimated fractions for the 47 conditions for which there was sufficient epidemiological evidence that the risk of morbidity is significantly affected by alcohol consumption. In some cases, such as alcoholic liver disease, the conditions are wholly attributable to alcohol, in which case the attributable fraction is one or 100%. In the case of partially attributable conditions, the fractions often vary by age and sex. The list includes chronic conditions such as some cancers, acute conditions such as ethanol poisoning, and external causes such as road accidents. For most conditions, NWPHO estimated the attributable fraction for a condition by combining information from epidemiological studies on the risk of different levels of alcohol consumption, with information on alcohol consumption among adults in England from the 2005 General Household Survey. Information on the primary and secondary diagnoses recorded for each admission is then used in combination with the fractions to estimate the number of admissions involving an alcohol-related condition.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Figures are provisional.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. Advertising spend is defined as covering only media spend (inclusive of agency commissions but excluding production costs, Central Office of Information (COI) commission and VAT).
2. These figures do not include the Department's recruitment/classified advertising costs and ad hoc spend under Â£10,000. All figures are rounded to the nearest Â£10,000.
3. These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by national health service organisations, to supplement national campaigns in their area. While this expenditure has been excluded as far as possible so that this spreadsheet reflects central Departmental spend, it would incur disproportionate cost to validate that every item of NHS expenditure has been removed.

               <b>Mr Simon Burns:</b>
 The Department operates standard contractual payment terms of 30-days and any payments that are delayed beyond that date may be subject to interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. The Act states that suppliers who are not paid within 30-days of the receipt of the invoice by the party billed are entitled to claim interest on the delayed payment at a rate of 8% above the Bank of England base reference rate. Penalty payments may be due where a small or medium sized business obtains a ruling that any contract terms that were applied were grossly unfair.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Finished consultant episode (FCE).
A FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.
<sup>(2 )</sup>Primary diagnosis:
 The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.
 ICD-10 codes used:
 T67.0 Heatstroke and sunstroke
<sup>(3 )</sup>Assessing growth through time:
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.

 The Government currently have no plans to introduce central reporting on heroin overdoses following release from prison.

 Professor Martin Lombard was recruited as the National Clinical Director for Liver Disease in January 2010. His remit was to provide clinical leadership to the development of a national strategy for liver disease that matches measures designed to achieve quality improvement (and improvements in outcomes for patients) with the identification of where the national health service might release resources to support them. The National Liver Strategy will be an integrated programme, recommending actions to improve the prevention, identification, treatment, care and support of people with liver disease within evidence-based and dignity assured standards of care. Professor Lombardâs budget for this task (net of core staffing costs) has been Â£560,000 in 2010-11, and Â£224,440 in 2011-12.</p>

 As a matter of course, a set of costs are sought from investigators at the close of each prosecution. These are added to the legal office costs to reach a total. If a defendant is convicted, there would normally be an application for prosecution costs. If the defendant is acquitted, there is no application for costs. As Mr Levinson and Jbol Ltd were acquitted, the costs schedule was prepared but was never presented to the court. The costs up to that date were Â£45,260.41.

1. These costs include monies for employer contributions to national insurance and pensions.
2. The financial cost of national awards comes from the NHS bundle and is ring-fenced for this purpose. Funding for Employer Based Awards is built into the baseline funding that the trust receives to cover staffing etc. It is not separately identifiable, and is not reflected in the information above.
3. The information above does not include national clinical excellence awards that are paid from central funds to consultants holding a national health service contract and employed in the Department or arm's length bodies.
4. The reduction in expenditure in 2008-09 reflected a scrutiny exercise which identified a number of consultants who had retired without notifying the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards (any excess payments in 2007-08 were to Trusts only and those monies were available for patient care. No consultants received payment to which they were not entitled).

1. The year that the claim is notified is not necessarily the year that the fatality occurred.
2. The data include all clinical negligence claims not just those pertaining to doctors (medical). They do not include claims against self-employed practitioners in primary care, such as general practitioners, dentists and pharmacists, who are not members of the NHSLA's schemes.
3. The NHSLA does not record malpractice as a specific cause of injury. It has therefore supplied data relating to all non-clinical claims that involved fatalities. These claims may include public and employer liability claims, as well as other types of claims by third parties.

The statement issued by Southern Cross on 11 July makes it clear that the company, its landlords and lenders appreciate their responsibilities to residents and staff of the companyâs homes. All parties have given a clear commitment that the continuity of care will be paramount during the transfer process. Southern Cross has undertaken in a letter to care home staff that they will transfer to new operators with their existing terms and conditions.</p>

 On 23 June 2011, the Government announced their consultation on reforms to the ATOL scheme, with the objective of providing greater clarity for consumers and also to put the scheme's finances back on a self-sustaining basis.</p>

               <a name="11072027000122"> The Air Travel Trust Fund (ATTF) meets the costs of refunds and repatriation assistance provided to the consumers of insolvent ATOL licensed businesses. It is financed through a mix of income from ATOL Protection Contributions (APCâcurrently Â£2.50 per booking), bank facilities and an insurance policy. Underpinning this, the Government have provided a guarantee for part of the bank facilities, currently up to Â£42 million. These arrangements provide access to Â£70 million which should be sufficient to meet all demands placed on the fund. The insurance policy has an annual limit of Â£300 million, with an excess of Â£50 million, available in the event of the failure of one or more major ATOL licensed businesses.</p>

               <a name="11072027000123"> There are no plans to increase the APC, which would require prior consultation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and approval by the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

               <a name="11072027000124"> The latest published accounts of the ATTF show that it was in deficit of Â£42.3 million as of 31 March 2011. The CAA believes that the ATTF should return to surplus within three years of the proposed reforms being introduced. The actual timing depends on factors such as the cost of future insolvencies of ATOL licensed businesses and the actual income from APC payments, both of which are difficult to predict with certainty. The proposed reforms should allow the Government guarantee to be withdrawn and the fund to return to a fully financially self-sustaining basis without the need for taxpayer support.</p>

 The Department has traditionally promoted both the cycle to work scheme and the cycle to work guarantee to employers, employees and other Government Departments across the country through a number of departmental led promotions and projects. The Department also funds the National Business Travel Network (NBTN). NBTN launched a DFT part funded 'ways2work' tool kit in November 2010 to help people and businesses work more efficiently. The tool kit includes a section on encouraging cycling to work.</p>

 The Department received a bid from Transport Scotland for funding under the Plugged-In Places programme on 29 October 2010. This bid was successful with Transport Scotland awarded Â£1.2 million to install 375 chargepoints by March 2013. There have been a series of programme management conversations with the Transport Scotland project team on the progress of their project but we have received no further representations relating to chargepoints in Scotland.</p>

As the Department is currently consulting the public on the principle of High Speed Two (HS2) and is yet to seek powers from Parliament, it would be inappropriate at this stage to conduct discussions of a commercial nature about the four stations proposed for a London to the west midlands high speed link. Similarly, no inquiries or expressions of interest have been received in relation to submitting bids for construction work at HS2 stations.</p>

 Officials received on 7 July a letter dated 30 June from the Commission. The letter confirmed that Directive 96/53/EC only permits longer semi-trailers if the criteria for one of the exemptions set out in Article 4.4 are fulfilled. The Government's view, previously communicated to the Commission, is that our proposals for longer semi-trailers fulfil the criteria for exemption in Article 4.4 (b), because their loading length (15.65 metres) can also be achieved by existing rigid/drawbar combinations. The Commission's letter did not address this point.</p>

 Progression from apprenticeships into higher level skills and qualifications is key to our plans. I have renamed apprenticeship levels so that there is a clearer pathway from intermediate to advanced and on to higher apprenticeships. This reinforces the fact that apprentices can, and already do, progress into post-graduate level and professional qualifications.</p>

This followed on from the 2009 Anderson review which recommended that the Government should provide access for SMEs to a tailored and insured advice service. The evaluation of the pilot, published by BIS on 16 July 2011, concluded that there was not a case for the Government to proactively promote insured advice, although Government information services should provide information about their availability.</p>

The guidance states that when applicable the consumer should be informed that consolidating debts may involve paying higher interest rates and increase both the overall amount repayable and the repayment period.</p>

               <a name="11072027000783"> The OFT would also consider it likely to be an example of irresponsible lending for any lender to grant a debt consolidation loan to a consumer where it is known, or reasonably suspected, that the credit is likely to be unsustainable. Failure to comply with the irresponsible lending guidance could call into question that company's fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. The OFT continues to keep this sector under review and if necessary will not hesitate to take enforcement action.</p>

 BIS published âCredit, debt and financial difficulty in Britain, 2009/10â in June. The aim of the report is to explore credit use and the extent of consumer indebtedness in Britain over the twelve months from November 2009 to October 2010 and changes since the previous 2010 report, which covered the period from July 2008 to July 2009. The survey provides useful information about consumer indebtedness and borrowing behaviour among the general population, as it is based on a nationally representative sample.</p>

 A total of 23 consortia containing 24 UK companies prepared bids to the bidding round of the Eureka Eurostars programme which closed on 24 March 2011 and scored high enough to be considered suitable for funding by the programme but were not subsequently funded by the Technology Strategy Board and/or the national funding bodies in the other Eurostars participating countries. The 24 UK companies were collectively seeking â¬5.3 million of grant funding with each company seeking between â¬70,000 and â¬300,000. The total project cost for the 23 consortia bids, which included 40 non-UK participants, was â¬27.8 million with public funding approximately 48% of the total cost.</p>

 Local enterprise partnerships (LEPS) are developed from the bottom-up and it is for LEPs themselves to decide what their priorities are. The Governmentâs expectation are that LEPS will work closely with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in deciding these priorities. Where LEPs are interested in assisting SMEs to commercialise new and emerging technologies in areas with potential environmental benefit, then the Government will work with them to do so.</p>

Developed prospects are ones where British Coal carried out a lot of work including applying for planning permission (not including Witham). Mines were actually developed in the case of NE Leicestershire (Asfordby) and Carway Fawr. Identified prospects are those where there was a lesser amount of work carried out.

 The Low Carbon Network Fund will allow up to Â£500 million over five years 2010-15, encouraging and enabling the distribution network operators to trial new technology, operating and commercial arrangements which can aid the transition to a low carbon energy sector. Â£64 million funding is available each year in the competitive element of the fund and a further Â£80 million is available over the five years to help fund smaller scale projects. A further Â£100 million is available over the five years as a discretionary award to reward projects which bring particular value in helping the networks adapt to climate change while providing security of supply and value for money to consumers.</p>

               <a name="11072048000273"> Hydrocarbon releases are potential major hazard precursor events and a key indicator of how well the offshore industry is managing major hazard risks and asset integrity. HSE takes them very seriously and investigates all releases classified as significant and major to establish the root cause, assess compliance with legislation and ensure that the operator takes any necessary remedial action. Reducing the frequency of hydrocarbon releases is therefore a key priority for HSE, but this is not a new issue. The number of releases has reduced significantly since data was first collected in 1996/7. In that year there were 226 releases, of which 19 were major, 129 significant and 78 minor. However further reductions have proved harder to deliver in recent years. HSE has continued to challenge the Industry to do better and fully supports the industry target, agreed this year, to reduce hydrocarbon releases by 50% over the next three years. HSE expects all operators to draw up and implement plans to achieve that reduction.</p>

 In 2009 the Government commissioned Cogent, the Sector Skills Council for Nuclear to build on their assessment of the current civil nuclear work force and look at the number of jobs that would be created by industry's plans to build 16 GW of new build nuclear by 2025. Their findings were published in the March 2010 report âNext Generation: Skills for New Build Nuclearâ. It is estimated that 30,000 new jobs could be created by industry's current plans. The role of nuclear up to 2050 has been considered as part of the Department's 2050 pathways work, however there are no immediate plans to look at job forecasts beyond 2025.</p>

 Future employment levels in the UK oil and gas industry will be dependent on how successfully the industry is able to capitalise on the UK's remaining reserves potential. The Government will continue to support the industry in maximising economic recovery of the UK's oil and gas resources.

 At the start of the feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme in April 2010, tariffs were set with the aim of providing solar PV installations with an approximate 5% internal rate of return. Based on modelling assumptions at the time, annual net income from FITs (taking into account income from the generation tariff, export tariff and electricity bill savings; and annual maintenance costs) was expected on average to pay back on (1) upfront capital costs in around thirteen years; and (2) planning and installation costs in three years.</p>

               <a name="11072048000282"> The recent fast track review of the FITs scheme found evidence that solar PV capital costs had fallen by around 30% from levels originally assumed. Based on this latest information, the above payback period estimates would still be expected to hold under the fast track review tariff for 50 kW to 150 kW installations, but would be longer for installations between 150 kW and 5 MW and stand alone installations. However, leaving tariffs unchanged would significantly reduce the estimated payback periods for all installations above 50 kW and stand alone installations to (1) around nine years for upfront capital costs; and (2) two years for planning and installation costs.</p>
