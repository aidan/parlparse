 The Revitalising Health and Safety target for injury which applies to Great Britain is to reduce the incidence rate of fatal and major injury by 10 per cent. between 1999-2000 and 2009-10; the pro-rata target for 2005-06 is a 6 per cent. reduction. The available sources indicate no clear change since the base year in the rate of fatal and major injury to employees. Since 2000, HSE has concentrated on key priority areas in partnership with industry and others. This has resulted in significant improvements in, for example, falls from height where the number of injuries has reduced.

 The Strategic Rail Authority made an extensive study of the effects of ERTMS on the UK railway. Network Rail now leads the National ERTMS Programme and has updated the SRA&#146;s work. If applied when a line is being resignalled, ERTMS can reduce the overall cost of the railway and support capacity enhancement. ERTMS also produces a small safety improvement over and above the high level of train protection afforded by TPWS. However, the capacity and cost benefits only apply if ERTMS Level 2 is used to eliminate lineside signalling.

Where there have been increases in enrolment as a result of the abolition of school fees, only aggregate data are available, it is not possible to identify where the extra children have come from.

In Kenya, this led to an additional 1.2 million students entering the school system. In Burundi, almost 500,000 additional primary school pupils arrived to enrol on the first day of school, double the number anticipated. Removing school fees increases enrolment but also makes it necessary to plan for the surge in order to maintain adequate quality.</p>

 No decision has yet been made on whether a one-off ivory sale should go ahead.

The UK is currently considering the evidence to decide whether those criteria have been met and will also look to be informed by the African Elephant Dialogue meeting that will take place between 30 May-1 June, immediately prior to the CITES Standing Committee.</p>

However, the concept of a fixed period moratorium is not in keeping with the way that CITES operates, where decisions are taken on the best scientific and trade data available at any time.</p>

The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) for Phase II of the scheme estimates that the cost of the scheme to the UK economy could be between &#163;80 million and &#163;640 million per year. This cost assumes a certain level of abatement will take place within the UK and also that the UK will purchase some allowances from the market.

 Responsibility for tackling fuel poverty in England is shared between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s main contribution to tackling fuel poverty is through ensuring a competitive energy market, which will bear down on the cost of energy to the benefit of all consumers but particularly those in fuel poverty.</p>

Cogent Sector Skills Council, working with employers, is taking a strategic view of the nuclear sector to ensure that the education and training base can meet the nuclear employers' current and future needs. The nuclear industry, working with Cogent, has successfully competed for a national skills academy through the Department for Education and Skills academy programme. The Nuclear National Skills Academy is at the business planning stage which is expected to be finalised shortly. The academy, which is employer-led, is designed to deliver high-quality training provision and drive up standards in the nuclear industry.</p>

 The Department&#146;s task force on violence and abuse against social workers reported in 2000, and made a number of recommendations for employers, including that they should undertake a service and training needs analyses in this respect, and put in place and implement actions plans where required. The latest data collected by the Commission for Social Care Inspection from local councils for April 2005 indicate that more than 80 per cent. of councils had completed the taskforce recommendations mostly or in full. The data have not been collected for more recent years and therefore should be treated with caution as a statement of the current situation.</p>

The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 There are two suppliers of diamorphine to the United Kingdom market, Novartis and Wockhardt. Both are working to their full available capacity, but are currently unable to produce enough to meet historic demand, although that demand may have changed owing to changes in prescribing practice. The supply position improved during 2006 and the trend is expected to be maintained during 2007. However, the improvements vary by product strength, reflecting manufacturing capacity issues. Some strengths remain in relatively poor supply, while the position for others is satisfactory. We believe that through careful prescribing and use of available stocks, as advised in the guidance the Department issued to prescribers and healthcare professionals in December 2004, patient care is not being compromised.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 May 2007]:</i> The founding values of the national health service are secure with this Government. The Government continue to develop the vision and policies for an NHS that is fit for the challenges of a new century. In this context, an NHS constitution could provide a clear expression of what is unchanging about the values of the NHS. It would set down and protect the values of what is a precious and unique institution, at the same time as the NHS itself is reforming and improving. The Government are currently exploring the idea of a constitution for the NHS, on which it could then consult. If successful, this work and consultation could lead to the adoption of a new constitution for the NHS in 2008, its 60th anniversary year, setting out a direction for the next decade.</p>
