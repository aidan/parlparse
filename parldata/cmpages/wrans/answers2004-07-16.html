<p><a name="40716w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 13 July 2004]:</i> The UK ratified the Kyoto Protocol, along with the rest of the EU, in May 2002. The Kyoto Protocol is a crucial first step in developing an effective international regime on climate change and we continue to encourage all countries that have not yet done so to ratify. In order to enter into force the Protocol must be ratified by at least 55 countries including developed countries that account for 55 per cent. of this group&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. Because of the withdrawal of the United States from the Protocol in 2001, entry into force requires ratification by Russia, responsible for 17.4 per cent. of developed countries&#039; greenhouse gas emissions in 1990.

This Department along with others continues to urge Russia to ratify as soon as possible.

<p><a name="40716w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 As befits an organisation with its range of regulatory responsibilities, the Environment Agency has frequent contact with other EU and international environmental regulators to share experience and knowledge on mattersconcerning the implementation and enforcement of environmental law. This includes active participation in IMPEL, a network of EU environmental regulators whose purpose is to ensure more effective implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation, to share information and experience and to promote good practice. The Agency led a recent IMPEL project on better EU legislation and is leading projects on transfrontier shipments of waste, emissions trading and assessing the impact on human health of environmental emissions. Reports on completed IMPEL projects are published on the IMPEL web-site, as is information about IMPEL&#039;s current work programme.

We have drawn up a detailed communications framework, in partnership with the Countryside Agency, the Association of National Park Authorities, English Nature, the Forestry Commission, the Local Government Association, the Ministry of Defence and Ordnance Survey.

In addition, to coincide with the issue of a new and up-to-date Countryside Code on 12 July, the Countryside Agency launched a new website to help the public find out what they can do and where they can go in the English countryside. The new website contains information about the new access rights and also advice for landowners and managers on how to manage public access and details of the restrictions process. As the new rights are commenced, the website will include a map showing access land in each region. The public will be able to see if other access rights are available (such as bridleways), to check whether any local closures or restrictions are in force and to find the location of local &quot;Access Information Points&quot;. An Open Access Contact Centre has also been established to provide information to the public about the new access rights.

We also expect information for walkers to be available locally, from a variety of outlets including National Park visitor centres, and &#039;on the ground&#039;.

We will continue to pursue this approach in policy at a national level and in discussion with our international partners. We also support the development and uptake of technical standards and methodologies (principally in the &#039;ISO 14000&#039; series of the International Organisation for Standardisation) which help to apply life-cycle thinking in the field of impact assessment, product development, product information and environmental management systems.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place to minimise the disruption to farmers caused by the Rural Payments Agency Inspectorate; what the estimated average length of farm staff time has been for compliance with the Rural Payments Agency Inspectorate; and what the average length of notice given to farmers prior to an inspection has been.  [182916]</p>









<p><a name="40716w02.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 EU regulations require that a specific percentage of claims across all CAP schemes are subject to on the spot checks within defined periods and with limits on the amount of notice that can be given. The Rural Payments Agency endeavour to minimise disruption to farmers by combining different inspections into one visit. An example of this is the Cattle inspections which can incorporate up to six different schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40716w02.html_para6">
The estimated average length of farm staff time taken on inspections will depend on the type of inspection, the size and clarity of the submitted claim and how that compares with what is found on the ground. However, the RPA is committed to reducing, as far as possible, the time spent on farm by ensuring that its inspectors are fully trained in all aspects of the schemes they are verifying.

EU regulations for on farm inspections require that no notice of inspections to be given. However, for some visits up to 48 hours notice may be given without breaching the regulations. Nevertheless the EU expectation is that visits will take place without notice and only exceptionally should notice be given for example, when farm staff need to gather animals which are extensively grazed.

Natura 2000 sites are underpinned by designation as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), with approximately 70 per cent. of SSSIs being Natura 2000 sites. There is not separate accounting for costs relating to European and National site designations, and protection of Natura 2000 sites is not differentiated from measures to protect SSSIs more generally. Moreover, decisions on spending are devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40716w03.html_para4">
Measures which contribute to protecting Natura 2000 sites in England include the operation of the planning system, the work of Sea Fisheries Committees, funding from English Nature, the Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission, agri-environment schemes and spending by public bodies in their role as owners of Natura 2000 sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40716w03.html_para5">
In 2002 the European Commission asked member states for a 10 year estimate of forecast spending on Natura 2000 sites. In reply we estimated that, as a minimum, in the region of &#8364;50 million per annum was likely to be spent on the UK&#039;s network of SSSI and Natura 2000 sites from all sources.

Their position on agriculture for example, as set out during a recent meeting they held in Guyana, is that they want progress in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the three key issues of reducing export subsidies, reducing trade distorting domestic subsidies, and increasing market access for developing country exports.

It is not appropriate to compare the amounts of RSG alone year-on-year since the level of RSG is partially determined by the amount of NNDR an authority receives for that year.

 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. The most recent survey, published in October 2003, showed that the level of opium cultivation in 2003 was 80,000 hectares and production was 3,600 tonnes. The UNODC is in the process of assessing the 2004 harvest in conjunction with the Afghan Government. Its report will be published in the autumn. We expect to see a rise in levels of cultivation. This is unwelcome but experience of counter-narcotic policies in Pakistan and Thailand, which both had much lower initial levels of production and were more stable countries, shows that cultivation tends to increase before declining. In my response to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns) on 9 June 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns124&#150;27WH, I set out the action in hand to tackle drugs in Afghanistan and made clear that the UK, as lead nation, remains committed to supporting the Afghan Government in its strategy to eliminate opium production from its country.

The UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Mazar-e Sharif and Meymana have transferred to ISAF authority and continue to help defuse tensions in the region. The New Zealand-led PRT in Bamian and the coalition PRT in Oruzgan are helping to maintain stability in central areas.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Llew Smith) on 7 July 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 765W. There is no reason to believe that income remains unaccounted for from the export of Iraq&#039;s oil during the occupation. During the Coalition&#039;s tenure all revenue from the sale of Iraq&#039;s oil was paid into the Development Fund for Iraq (DPI), which was established pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 of 22 May 2003. As of 24 June 2004, the last date of oil sales before the handover of authority on 28 June, total proceeds from Iraq&#039;s oil exports to the DPI were US$ 11.1 billion.

The Coalition Provisional Authority oil team had been pressing the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for meters to be installed as a matter of urgency, but at the handover of authority the issue remained outstanding.

 As the Secretary of State explained to the Informal Transport Council in Amsterdam on 9 July during discussion of developments in aviation, state aid to EU airlines has been damaging in the past because it inhibits desirable structural change in the industry, discourages innovation and enterprise, and puts airlines which do not receive Government support at an unfair commercial disadvantage. This is why the Government have consistently supported the European Commission in its efforts over recent years to eliminate state aid in the aviation sector, efforts which have been largely successful.
