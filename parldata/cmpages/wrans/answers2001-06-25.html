<a name="10625w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Galloway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what military actions HM forces conducted over northern Iraq on 19 June; and if he will make a statement.  [386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 On 19 June, coalition aircraft conducted routine patrols over the Northern No-Fly Zone over Iraq. During these patrols, aircrews came under multiple attack by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. On this occasion, no coalition ordnance was released in self-defence. In fact, all coalition aircraft involved in the patrols returned to base safely and all of their ordnance has been accounted for.
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para0">Saddam Hussein's propaganda machine yet again has made completely false claims. The Iraqis have asserted that, during these patrols, coalition aircraft attacked civilian targets when in fact, the evidence suggests that his own air defence system was responsible. The US Defence Department has stated that it has good reason to believe that one of the missiles fired at coalition aircrew may have returned to earth in the area where the casualties are alleged to have occurred.

 The review of the BFPO at Mill Hill has now been completed, but no firm decision has yet been taken. I understand fully the need to bring this issue to closure as quickly as possible and I will write to my hon. Friend as soon as a decision is made.

<P>
<a name="10625w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 It is my normal policy to do so. However, we have always made it clear that in relation to party political peers, the Appointments Commission was taking over the role formerly fulfilled by the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee. It was never the custom that appointments to the Lords to enable someone to take up ministerial office should be subject to scrutiny by that Committee. I have also decided, after consultation with the House of Lords Appointments Commission, that a limited number of holders of very high office may be recommended direct to the Queen by me.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I have asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a review of the strategic issues surrounding energy policy for Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para1">The review will be set within the context of meeting the challenge of global warming, while ensuring secure, diverse and reliable energy supplies at a competitive price.
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para2">The aim of the review will be to set out the objectives of energy policy and to develop a strategy that ensures current policy commitments are consistent with longer- term goals. The findings will also inform the Government's response to last year's report from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution "Energy--the changing climate".
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para3">The work the PIU has already started, on resource productivity and renewable energy, will be an important input into this project. This review will work closely with the resource productivity team and the main Whitehall Departments, as well as business, international institutions, other Government and non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para4">The Minister for Industry and Energy will chair an advisory group for this project, which will report by the end of the year. Other Ministers on the advisory group include the Minister for the Environment and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

To ask the Prime Minister, in respect of the Government's intention to introduce a new tax credit for families with children, if he will make a statement on the future of the administrative arrangements for the Child Benefit Centre in Great Britain.  [1062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The new tax credit will build on the foundation of universal child benefit. I have decided that responsibility for child benefit in Great Britain will transfer to Inland Revenue so that when the new credit is introduced in 2003, Government support for children will be administered by one Department. Until the transfer takes place, child benefit will remain the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department has been scrutinised by the Home Affairs Committee in the past, and this arrangement is likely to be appropriate in the future. The Lord Chancellor's Department's new responsibilities have largely been transferred from the Home Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what powers are available to local authorities to compel private landowners to clear up derelict sites.  [23]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 gives local planning authorities a discretionary power to require private landowners to clear up sites if they are adversely affecting the condition of land or amenity in their area.
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para5">If owners do not comply with a notice served under s215, local planning authorities have the power under s219 to enter the land to carry out the specified work and recover the costs incurred from the landowner.
<P>

<a name="10625w01.html_para6">The Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions last September published research on "Derelict Land and Section 215 Powers" which included a number of practical suggestions to facilitate its use.

<a name="10625w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 give effect to the requirements of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. The regulations apply to categories of projects specified in schedules 1 and 2 of the regulations. For development listed in schedule 1 of the regulations, environmental impact assessment is always required before planning permission may be granted. For development listed in schedule 2, an assessment is required if the project is likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, scale or location.

<P>

<a name="10625w02.html_para0">Where these hedges encroach on people's property, they already have rights to cut overhanging branches back to the boundary--unless any trees in the hedge are protected by a tree preservation order or the people live in a conservation area. In such cases, people should check with their local council before carrying out any works on the hedge.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There is no firm deadline for the sale. We are, through the on-going market testing, exploring all avenues, and the aim is to secure a sale as quickly as possible. However, it is important that all diligence is done both in the market testing and the assessment of on-going process issues, in order that the process--and the continued regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula--is not undermined. We will make an announcement as soon as possible, consistent with independent professional advice.

 The allocation of proceeds from the sale of the dome is set out in a legal agreement between English Partnerships and the New Millennium Experience Company. This was signed on 12 January 2001 and announced to Parliament on 17 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 258W.
<P>

<a name="10625w02.html_para1">After deduction of competition, decommissioning and other costs from the sale proceeds, half will be paid to English Partnerships as owners of the land and half to the New Millennium Experience Company as builders, owners and operators of the dome structure. Once NMEC has been wound up, it is intended that any remaining share of the proceeds will pass to the Millennium Commission.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what level of assessment is undertaken by social services when a client is vulnerable and self-funding but has no partner or advocate; and if he will make a statement.  [183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w02.html_spnew13"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Under Section 47 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 local authorities have a duty to give a community care assessment to anyone, who, in their view, might be in need of community care services. This duty applies irrespective of the person's means and whether or not the person has a partner or advocate. The content of the assessment is a matter for the local authority to decide.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will require the General Social Care Council to develop an interim register that covers all unqualified social care workers employed by local authorities and in the independent sector.  [185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10625w03.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The General Social Care Council (GSCC) will register social care workers who hold the appropriate level of qualification for the job that they do, and who satisfy the requirements as to conduct and competence. Registration will begin with social workers, most of whom are qualified. Other early groups for registration will be residential child care workers and managers of care homes. The GSCC will set out the timescales for registering the remainder of the workforce.
<P>

<a name="10625w03.html_para0">The GSCC will publish codes of practice for social care workers and other employers. All social care workers will be expected to abide by these codes, whether or not they are registered with the GSCC.

 The General Social Care Council (GSCC) will be responsible for regulating social care workers. There are no plans for it to regulate health support workers. The social care workforce in England comprises over a million workers, and the GSCC will concentrate on introducing regulation in this new area.

The text gives employees in the undertakings covered a right to be informed about the undertaking's economic situation, informed and consulted about employment prospects, and to be consulted with a view to reaching agreement about decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or contractual relations, including redundancies and transfers. Employers and employees may agree on different arrangements than those prescribed in the directive.

 The future ownership arrangements for Consignia and certain of its subsidiaries are governed by Part IV of the Postal Services Act 2000. In accordance with sections 65 of the Postal Services Act, no shares in the Post Office company (i.e. Consignia Holdings plc) may be issued or disposed of to anyone other than the Treasury or the Secretary of State (or their nominees) without authority from Parliament in accordance with section 67 of the Act. The Act also prohibits the issuing or disposal of shares in any "relevant subsidiary" of the Post Office company to anyone other than the Treasury or the Secretary of State (or their nominees) or the Post Office company or any other appropriate relevant subsidiary (or their nominees) without parliamentary authority in accordance with section 67. Consignia plc--

 In March 2001, the Commission proposed a new Directive to amend the existing rules on electricity and gas liberalisation. The Commission also proposed a Regulation on cross-border electricity trading. The new Directive includes the date of 2005 for full liberalisation of the EU electricity and gas markets. These proposals were discussed at the Stockholm European Summit. Discussions of the proposals are continuing in the Council Energy Working Group. UK officials are also actively engaged in a number of bilateral discussions with other member states and representatives from the Commission.

 The DTI will continue to ensure that administrative burdens associated with necessary regulation to protect the interests of consumers and citizens and to provide decent minimum standards for workers are minimised. The regulatory impact appraisal (RIA) process was changed in 2000 to require that administrative and policy costs should be separately identified, enabling us to concentrate on minimising the cost of the administration associated with regulation. Where it is shown to us that administration is excessive, we will reduce it, as we did with the Working Time Regulations in 1999.
<P>

<a name="10625w04.html_para3">The new Regulatory Reform Act will play a vital role in the Government's drive to reform outdated, overlapping and over-burdensome regulation. The Labour Party's Business Manifesto commits the Government to use the new Order-making power in the Act to bring forward a programme of regulatory reform initiatives involving all the key Government Departments. A list of 51 examples of reforms that could be achieved by this means is available from the Libraries of the House, and on the Cabinet Office website.

 The Government have an extensive programme of action to reduce the pay gap between men and women. This gap has reduced from 37 per cent. when the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970, to 18 per cent. now. We are taking steps to make the legislation work better, by making equal pay claims quicker and easier. We are working with the Equal Opportunities Commission, employers and trade unions to develop voluntary equal pay reviews. The EOC has received an extra &#163;100,000 to take this forward. The Government are committed to equal pay for its own staff. All Departments and Government agencies must undertake reviews and prepare equal pay action plans within two years. We are introducing Castle Awards to recognise employers' excellence in promoting equal opportunities and pay, and have appointed fair pay champions from a range of backgrounds to promote the issues. We also have a number of initiatives in place to address the underlying causes of the pay gap. These include tackling gender stereotyping in education, removing barriers to women's employment in traditionally male industries such as ICT and encouraging employers to take measures which allow parents to combine work and raising a family. In April of this year, the Government appointed Denise Kingsmill to lead an independent review into Women's Employment and Pay. This review will report in the autumn, and the Government will then consider what additional action is required to make further progress.

 The decision on whether or not to launch a UK bid to host the Olympic Games is a matter for the British Olympic Association. The Government will take a view on what steps they might take to promote any bid in the event the BOA decides to make a bid.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced on 8 May that the Government had asked Patrick Carter, a non executive member of the Strategy Board for Correctional Services, to analyse the alternative ways forward for the project. This work was delayed because of the general election but is now under way. The terms of reference for Mr. Carter's work are:

 I am pleased to announce that the pilot project assessing the feasibility of sight-impaired people acting as magistrates has been completed. It has been a great success. Nine sight-impaired people were recruited as Justices of the Peace to the Commission areas of Leicestershire, Devon, North East London, Wiltshire, Humberside and Manchester. Each was appointed after having met the normal selection criteria and completed the training. The responses from those who have worked with the sight-impaired magistrates have shown that each one of them has made a positive and valuable contribution to the work of their Benches. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor is therefore removing, forthwith, the bar to appointment of sight-impaired applicants as Justices of the Peace.

 The rules on severance payments for special advisers are the same as those that have applied under previous Administrations.

<a name="10625w07.html_para1">The recorded crime statistics for the 12 months to March 2000 show that Surrey had the second lowest number of crimes per 100,000 population in England and Wales. However, a boundary change involving Surrey and Metropolitan police forces took place on 1 April 2000, when Surrey took on some areas from the Metropolitan police. Figures for Surrey before and after that date are therefore not directly comparable. By excluding the boundary effect (i.e. by assuming these areas were policed by the Metropolitan police throughout the period), the increase in overall crime in Surrey in the 12 months to September 2000 compared with the 12 months to September 1999 is an estimated 3 per cent. The Government are committed to reducing all crime, including violent crime, and to tackling the causes of crime, ensuring proper punishment of those who break the law and providing the resources necessary to tackle crime. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2001 : Column: 41W</I><P>
Although there continues to be an increase in the number of violent crimes recorded by the police, the rate of increase is slowing down and crime overall has fallen under this Government. The British Crime Survey, which is widely accepted as the most authoritative source of information on the real rates of crime, indicates that violent crime has been falling since 1995, and reduced by 4 per cent. between 1997 and 1999, the latest date for which figures are available.

All of these are concerned with risk to the public or risk of breaching the curfew. In respect of all other offences, offenders can be released on Home Detention Curfew only if they have passed a rigorous individual risk assessment.

 Provisions in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 introduced a statutory duty on local probation boards to consult and inform victims of offenders sentenced to 12 months or more for a sexual or violent offence about the conditions of release. These came into force on 1 April 2001. Prior to a prisoner's release, the victim may opt to make representations about whether the offender should be subject to any licence conditions and to receive information about any conditions which are imposed and are relevant to them.

<a name="10625w08.html_para1">I have no plans to legislate for other victims to be told when prisoners are released on Home Detention Curfew (HDC).

 The Government are committed to ensuring that the implications of sentencing are explained in open court. The then Lord Chief Justice issued a practice direction in January 1998 requiring a court imposing a custodial sentence to explain the practical effect of that sentence for the benefit of the defendant, any victim and members of the public. Although the practice direction was issued before home detention curfew became available, it makes clear that any future changes to early release arrangements should be reflected in the court's explanation. We will consider whether any legislative requirement is necessary in the context of proposals emerging from the review of the Sentencing Framework.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has adopted a twin track approach towards the inspection of property. The main reason for this is to ensure a focus on housing management and support in addition to technical housing conditions.
<P>

<a name="10625w10.html_para7">Firstly, NASS has developed a Housing Management inspection function that aims to monitor the performance of accommodation providers and act upon any problems that inspections highlight in relation to management and support.
<P>

<a name="10625w10.html_para8">In terms of the condition of accommodation and, in particular, health and safety issues, NASS has appointed Contract managers to work in tandem with the Housing Management function to ensure a comprehensive approach towards both housing conditions and management.

 The Government have made available substantial resources for directly tackling the problem of drug misuse.

<P>

<a name="10625w11.html_para2">Analyses by Department or function are difficult to calculate because drugs spending in many cases forms part of wider expenditure streams or functions.
