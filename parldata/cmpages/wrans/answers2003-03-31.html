3. <a name="30331w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his policy is towards the commitment of British forces to long-term peacekeeping missions in urban areas in Iraq.  [105449]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We have made it clear that we are committed to help the Iraqi people rebuild their country once Saddam Hussein's regime is removed from power. We envisage that United Kingdom forces will help to provide a safe and secure environment to allow the renewal effort to begin.

16. <a name="30331w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to secure the Iraq/Iran border.  [105463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The area in Southern Iraq in which United Kingdom forces are operating includes a significant segment of the Iraq/Iran border. UK forces are responsible for ensuring the security of the whole of the area under their control. I can assure my hon. Friend that the Government is making every effort to liaise closely with the Iranian authorities to reduce the scope for any potential misunderstandings. We see no need to take special measures relating to the security of the Iraq/Iran border.

<P>
20. <a name="30331w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gray: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Members to the answer I gave a short while ago to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), my hon. Friend the Member for North West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many <i>(a)</i> soldiers from British Overseas Territories and <i>(b)</i> Gibraltarians are deployed in Iraq.  [105248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Details of the number of soldiers from the British Overseas Territories and Gibraltarians are deployed in Iraq are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker), of 23 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 450W, on Iraq, how much of the money was spent on munitions.  [105355]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The costs identified in my earlier answer are only the net additional costs the Department has incurred. Operational costs are recorded only when normal rates of peacetime activity and consumption are exceeded. As a result figures do not record the cost of all munitions used, only those expended in excess of normal requirements. However, centrally held records do not identify separately the additional costs of munitions consumed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn6"><B> Jim Knight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment his Department has made of the logistic support required to sustain British forces in the Gulf region.  [105453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The massive logistic effort, involving many of the 28,000 civilian and military personnel in the Defence Logistics Organisation and around 5,000 personnel in theatre, in support of United Kingdom armed forces operations in the Gulf, and the build up to it, has been extremely successful. The size of this task has been considerable; we have deployed an equivalent quantity of materiel to that supplied for the last Gulf conflict in half the time. This has ranged from some 13,000 tonnes of ammunition and over 15,000 vehicles, to 2.5 million operational ration packs. This level of logistic support is being maintained, including delivery of about 2,000 bags of mail per day totalling over 185 tonnes so far.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what representations he has received about delays to mail from UK forces in Iraq to the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement.  [106068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have received no representations about delays to mail from United Kingdom forces in Iraq. On the wider question of mail services between UK and the Gulf area, I have received a large number of enquires from hon. Members and from the general public about services available. The British Forces Post Office is despatching and receiving mail regularly and there are no delays. Naturally, it is more difficult to arrange collection and delivery of mail to deployed units, many of which are moving rapidly across Iraq.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many hot meals a day soldiers in the Gulf conflict are receiving.  [105512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Personnel who have moved forward into Iraq are currently on Operational Ration Packs. These provide for two hot meals and one cold meal, plus snacks, per day. Similarly, personnel in the camps in Gulf have access to at least two hot meals a day.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn9"><B> Sandra Gidley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many women from each of the British armed forces are taking part in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  [105215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> As of 28 March 2003, there were 2,966 women serving with all three services in support of Operation TELIC. The figures by service are not available. Of these, 2,690 were serving in the Arabian Peninsular and 276 are in Cyprus.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on Iraqi defections.  [105461]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There have so far been no 'defections' of very senior politicians or military commanders to the coalition.
<P>

<a name="30331w01.html_para0">The coalition is, however, currently holding over 8,000 prisoners of war, many of whom have surrendered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his working relationship with the media during the conflict with Iraq.  [105464]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The working relationship between the Ministry of Defence and the media during times of conflict or war is covered in detail in the Green Book&#151;"Working Arrangements with the Media in times of Emergency, Tension, Conflict or War".
<P>

<a name="30331w01.html_para1">In the United Kingdom, we have provided the media with briefings by Ministers, officials and military officers, and arranged facilities to demonstrate our capabilities. In theatre, we have established a media information service at the Coalition Headquarters. We have also compiled a media pool of 128 accredited UK war correspondents who are now embedded with our forces in the Gulf.
<P>

<a name="30331w01.html_para2">While it is inevitable that at times the relationship is bound to be tested, overall the new arrangements appear to be working very well for both parties.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on military co-ordination of humanitarian aid in Iraq.  [105465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Coalition forces are taking the utmost care to minimise the effects of conflict on the Iraqi people. However, there is an urgent need for humanitarian relief, not least because of damage and neglect during the long years of Saddam Hussein's misrule.
<P>

<a name="30331w01.html_para3">United Kingdom forces will, where they are able, deliver emergency humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq until the post-conflict security situation is stable enough for civilian aid agencies to deploy. The Government have allocated up to &#163;30 million to United Kingdom Forces to provide this immediate assistance.
<P>

<a name="30331w01.html_para4">In due course, the intention is that responsibility for humanitarian provision should be transferred to civilian aid agencies, however, assistance provided so far by UK forces has included drinking water, food, shelter, and medical supplies. Supplies have been delivered both overland from Kuwait, and through the deep port at Umm Qasr.

<P>
22. <a name="30331w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, If he will make a statement on the future of the European Security and Defence Policy.  [105469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We continue to make progress in developing the European Security and Defence European Union agreed Policy. Earlier this month, NATO and the arrangements, known as "Berlin Plus", giving the EU ready access to the Alliance's common assets and capabilities for operations. As a consequence, the EU is now able to launch its first military mission in Macedonia, taking over from the NATO operation "Allied Harmony" today. This is a tangible 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2003 : Column 490W</I><P>
demonstration of the strategic partnership between the two organisations and of the EU's determination to strengthen its ability to undertake crisis management operations. We also continue to make progress on improving European military capabilities and are actively engaged in the debate on the future of the ESDP in the Convention on the Future of Europe.

<P>
23. <a name="30331w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what percentage of the Army is deployed or warned to deploy on operations.  [105470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Around 57 per cent. of the Army are currently deployed and between four to five per cent. are preparing to deploy on Operations.

<P>
24. <a name="30331w02.html_wqn0"><B> Patrick Mercer: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to replace units currently engaged in the Gulf.  [105471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave earlier today to my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham).

<a name="30331w02.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Aircraft Carriers</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if it will be possible to adapt either of the two new aircraft carriers so as to make them interoperable with the Rafale aircraft.  [97328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As we announced on 30 September 2002, the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers will be configured to operate the STOVL version of the Joint Strike Fighter rather than a conventionally launched aircraft such as Rafale. The vessels will, however, be constructed to an adaptable design, which will allow us, if we so decide in the future, to modify the vessels from their original STOVL configuration to facilitate conventional flight operations.
<P>

<a name="30331w02.html_para0">Although it might be technically possible to build the vessels so that they could operate STOVL-JSF and conventional carrier aircraft simultaneously, we assess that this could not viably or safely be achieved without substantial revision of the basic design. This would impact on construction and through life operations, as well as affordability.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Viggers: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the effect of a declaration of war is on the <i>(a)</i> pay, <i>(b)</i> taxation and <i>(c)</i> legal liability of armed forces personnel.  [105223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The declaration of war has no effect on the pay or taxation of armed forces personnel. In the event of a fatality, the only tax issue affected is the estate of the deceased member of the armed forces of the Crown, which may qualify for an exemption from inheritance tax under section 154 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. The presence or absence of a declaration of war does not have any effect on the legal position of 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2003 : Column 491W</I><P>
armed forces personnel. Once a state of armed conflict exists, international humanitarian law applies to the conduct of the campaign.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_wqn3"><B> Adam Price: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether UK military liaison teams provided <i>(a)</i> advice and <i>(b)</i> assistance to the Colombian armed forces during 2002; and what plans there are to do so this year.  [105584]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There have been occasions when we have sent military liaison teams to Colombia to provide advice and training assistance. The nature of this advice and assistance is confidential between governments and I am withholding the details under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which covers information whose disclosure would be harmful to national security, defence or international relations. The uncertainties regarding military deployment as a result of Operation TELIC make forward planning for this type of assistance this year impossible at present.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence provides the following child care support for its civilian and military employees:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>45 work place nurseries offering 1,700 full day care places for children aged three months to five years. (Three new nurseries were opened during 2002&#150;03 at Northwood, Andover and Ensleigh Bath).
<P>
<BR>
36 cr&#232;ches (benefiting 700 children) providing occasional care and 70 pre schools (benefiting over 2,000 children) providing education on a sessional basis, primarily for Service families.
<P>
<BR>
14 wrap-around care schemes for 5&#150;12 year olds (benefiting 350 children) providing after school care to match the working day.
<P>
<BR>
15 holiday play schemes providing full day care for 5&#150;12 year olds during school holidays (three are shared with other Government Departments) benefiting 550 children.
<P>
<BR>
Two child care voucher schemes: for civilian employees in Glasgow and a new scheme for Defence Science and Technology Laboratory staff, which started May 2002. (The schemes benefit over 18 parents).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30331w02.html_para1">Within MOD responsibility for child care is delegated to the main budget areas. Initial funding can be from a variety of sources: the central budget allocation, MOD's grant from the Civil Service Modernisation fund (&#163;900,000 in FY2000&#150;01 and FY 2001&#150;02 only), local authorities, benevolent funds or raised by the parents themselves. The business case then determines how much direct or indirect subsidy the MOD gives.
<P>

<a name="30331w02.html_para2">MOD nurseries are usually run by contractors, as commercial enterprises. They frequently receive indirect subsidies in the form of a peppercorn rent. In addition about 10 per cent. of the nurseries offer direct subsidies, which can reduce the fees by around a third. Some play schemes also receive direct subsidies. MOD's two voucher schemes provide employees with about a third of actual costs for the registered care of their choice at a cost of some &#163;16,000 a month.

 The Gulf Trust was set up on 12 February 1991 to meet the financial needs arising out of the engagement of the British Armed Forces and civilian personnel attached to or accompanying British Armed Forces in military and other operations relating to or in connection with the 1990&#150;1991 Gulf conflict. The Gulf Trust was administered independently of the Ministry of Defence in accordance with Charity Law by the United Services Trustee. The fund was closed on 31 July 1994 at which point the remaining money in the fund was distributed on a pro-rata basis to the three Service Benevolent Funds. It would be inappropriate for the Ministry of Defence to intervene in any issues concerning disbursements of funds raised by the Gulf Trust. All enquiries, representations, applications for financial assistance or questions regarding the administration of funds raised by the Gulf Trust, should be directed as follows:

 My noble Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement (Lord Bach) announced in another place on 19 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 175&#150;77W, that, as a result of the recent agreement with BAE SYSTEMS to restructure the Nimrod MRA4 contract, the revised in-service date is 2009. This is now defined as the delivery of the sixth series production aircraft. The balance of the 18 aircraft fleet is envisaged to be delivered during the subsequent period to mid 2011. The reasons for the delay are those that are indicated by the reply my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Moonie) gave to the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) on 10 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 222&#150;23W. The Agreement with BAE SYSTEMS recognises the delays that have occurred on this programme by deferring the start of series production of later aircraft until we have seen demonstrated performance from the first three flight trials aircraft. When an appropriate level of design maturity has been reached (and we envisage this to be in late 2005), we will then be in a position to finalise the negotiations with the Company over the production price of the remaining number of aircraft. As my hon. Friend also indicated in his statement of 19 February, the MOD has agreed to make a contribution to this restructured programme of an additional &#163;270 million. Subject to on-going negotiations, this increase therefore brings the expected contract value to some &#163;2,600 million at current prices. I have nothing further to add to the statement made by my hon. Friend on 19 February 2003.

 The British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) is produced by the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC) under contract to the Ministry of Defence and provides radio and television services to most locations overseas where significant numbers of British forces are permanently stationed and, subject to practicality, to operational theatres.
<P>

<a name="30331w03.html_para0">Two channels of BFBS TV, plus BBC News 24 and Sky News, are transmitted continuously from the UK to a satellite covering the Greater European and middle east operational areas. The signal is distributed to 55 locations in Kuwait and from 27 March to parts of southern Iraq. BFBS TV is therefore available live at all major UK military locations in the middle east, as well as to RN andRFA ships in the area.
<P>

<a name="30331w03.html_para1">BFBS TV film messages from both service personnel in the Gulf and their families in the UK and Germany, and transmit these as "fillers" between TV programmes in lieu of the more usual community and welfare announcements. BFBS has a 'tie-in' with ITV's flagship programme "This Morning" (which is retransmitted on BFBS) which also provides a chance for families to see video messages from their people on operational duty. BFBS TV also communicates to the Forces via a daily news magazine programme, 'BFBS Reports' which goes out across the BFBS network.

 The Department wrote to local authorities in England on 14 February last year inviting applications for Supplementary Credit Approvals to support proposals for capital expenditure in 2002&#150;03 on their air quality management duties under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995. Milton Keynes was the only authority in Buckinghamshire to apply, and &#163;30,000 in additional borrowing powers has been awarded.

An Addendum to the strategy was published in February 2003. The strategy and addendum can be found at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/index.htm.

<P>

<a name="30331w03.html_para4">The strategy sets objectives for nine main air pollutants to protect human health and two objectives to protect vegetation and ecosystems. The air pollutants covered by the strategy are benzene; 1,3-butadiene; carbon monoxide; lead; nitrogen dioxide; particles (PM10); ozone; sulphur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
<P>

<a name="30331w03.html_para5">The Government and devolved Administrations monitor progress to meeting the objectives in the strategy through the national air quality monitoring network, which consists of over 1,500 sites.

 Local authorities have a statutory duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the local air quality in their area against the national air quality objectives for seven of the pollutants prescribed in regulations for the purpose of local air quality management. Where it is likely that the air quality objectives will not be met by the relevant deadline, the local authority must designate an air quality management area and produce an action plan setting out the measures they intend to implement to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.

Wycombe District Council has produced an action plan which has been appraised by my Department. Wycombe will now have to work with the Highways Agency and other stakeholders to look to implement the most cost-effective and proportionate measures to improve the local air quality within the area affected by the M40.

 Responsibility for assessing such risks rests with the local operating authorities. The Environment Agency has sea defence responsibility for the length of coastline from Cart Gap, Eccles to Winterton, which fronts the low lying hinterland including the Norfolk Broads. North Norfolk district council has coast protection responsibility for the cliffs at Happisburgh. There is some concern abut the risk of a breach in the frontage at Cart Gap as a result of cliff erosion, but both operating authorities judge that such a risk is not expected for at least 15 to 20 years. Both authorities are keeping the position under review, and the Council monitors the rate of erosion monthly.

 Our bi-lateral programme assistance to Iraq in 2002&#150;03 is expected to total approximately &#163;8 million.
<P>

<a name="30331w04.html_para5">Since the onset of the current crisis, DFID has committed &#163;50 million to support preparations by humanitarian agencies, including &#163;32 million for the Red Cross/Red Crescent and &#163;8 million for the World Food Programme. DFID has a further &#163;160 million earmarked for the humanitarian response and is considering further assistance in line with emerging needs. We will consider further resource needs for the reconstruction phase in due course. It is not possible at this stage to anticipate the sums that will be required over the next three years, or to anticipate the balance between bi-lateral and multilateral funding.
<P>

<a name="30331w04.html_para6">DFID provides 19 per cent. of European Community (EC) funding to Iraq through the Humanitarian Aid Office of the European Commission (ECHO). Since 1991, these contributions have totalled &#163;15 million.
<P>

<a name="30331w04.html_para7">On 21 March 2003, the College of European Commissioners proposed to release an additional 79 million euros from their Emergency Aid Reserve for Iraq, increasing their total humanitarian commitment in the current crisis to 100 million euros.

<a name="30331w04.html_para8">United Kingdom forces will, where they are able, deliver emergency humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq until the post-conflict security situation stabilises sufficiently for civilian agencies to deploy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w04.html_spnew15"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The immediate humanitarian priority is to get the UN humanitarian actors back into Iraq as soon as the security situation allows, at the same time we must work to get the Oil For Food (OFF) programme back up and running. A new Security Council Resolution has been passed which allows the UN Secretary General to take charge of the programme.
<P>

<a name="30331w04.html_para9">The UK has meanwhile been in discussion with the UN humanitarian agencies, Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and international NGOs to determine what resources they require to procure food to cover any temporary, gap in the OFF programme. The UN is currently planning on a medium case scenario under which the World Food Programme will provide food assistance for a three-month period. We have committed &#163;115 million to support the preparations of our humanitarian partners including the World Food Programme. The WFP is acutely aware of the need to maintain and re-build the Iraqi distribution system used for OFF so that humanitarian supplies can be delivered quickly to those in need.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w04.html_spnew16"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The first step is to secure a strong UN mandate for reconstruction. The European Council on 20 and 21 March agreed that the UN Security Council should give the UN such a mandate for post-conflict Iraq and make sure that the new Iraqi administration is one that is representative, respects the human rights of the Iraqi people, and allows the people of Iraq to live in peace internally and with their neighbours.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how she will ensure that humanitarian aid and re-construction of Iraq are carried out under the auspices of the United Nations.  [105830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w04.html_spnew17"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UN humanitarian agencies are well prepared and ready to re-enter Iraq as soon as the security situation allows. Iraq staff are still working within Iraq. The UN system has prepositioned stocks and supplies in the region, the World Food Programme has one months worth of food for two million people and is procuring more. The next priority is to get the Oil For Food (OFF) programme back up and running. A Security Council Resolution has now been passed to allow the UN Secretary General to take charge of the programme. 16 million people are reliant on OFF. Most have been provided with food supplies to the end of April but thereafter the need to supply food will be very urgent.
<P>

<a name="30331w04.html_para10">We are also working to secure a UN mandate which will be required to provide legal authority for the reconstruction effort, and to make possible the

 There is no statutory requirement on local planning authorities to consult parish councils when issuing lawful development certificates. The local planning authority may, however, seek evidence from the parish council if there is reason to believe that they possess relevant information about a specific lawful development certificate application. Lawful development certificate applications and decisions are entered in the local planning authority's planning register in accordance with section 69 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The planning register is available for inspection by the public, including members of parish councils and elected council members.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what action she is taking to <i>(a)</i> increase and <i>(b)</i> refurbish sports facilities in London; and if she will make a statement.  [105598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Local authorities are the key providers of sport and recreation facilities in their areas. For that reason they are responsible for making the difficult judgments about what sports facilities to provide at the expense of local taxpayers, and the decisions about the renovation of local facilities.
<P>

<a name="30331w07.html_para2">Significant investment from the National Lottery has helped to create new state of the art community sports facilities. Local authorities may apply to the Lottery Sports Fund for grants for the creation of new sports facilities, and the upgrading of existing facilities to increase participation. London boroughs have received 201 grants from the Lottery Sports Fund's Community Capital Fund totalling over &#163;249.5 million, for projects costing over &#163;675 million.
<P>

<a name="30331w07.html_para3">Local education authorities in the London boroughs will also benefit from the New Opportunities Fund's PE and Sport programme which aims to bring about a step change in the provision of sports facilities for young people and for the local community. The New Opportunities Fund provisionally allocated funding to each local education authority area to ensure that funding is available for projects in all parts of the country. Local education authorities in London have been allocated &#163;81,286,000 under the programme.
<P>

<a name="30331w07.html_para4">The Government's planning guidance to local authorities (PPG 17) requires local planning authorities to undertake assessments to determine what deficiencies exist in their areas and to remedy those deficiencies in provision via their plans and planning decisions.

<P>
<a name="30331w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what impact he estimates a reduction in passenger demand for air travel as a result of the introduction of proposals to introduce environmental taxation on air travel, outlined in Aviation and the Environment, would have on Government estimates of passenger demand cited in 'The Future Development of Air Transport in the South East'.  [105240]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There would be no material difference as this has already been taken into account. Demand forecasts in 'The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom' consultation document took into account aviation's contribution to climate change, by far the most significant environmental cost. They did so by assuming a CO2 tax in place by 2015 to internalise aviation's climate change costs.
<P>

<a name="30331w08.html_para0">The recent discussion paper 'Aviation and the Environment: Using Economic Instruments' cites a figure of &#163;1.4 billion as the estimated annual cost of aviation's contribution to climate change. The costs are similar to the value of the CO2 tax, which was assumed in the demand forecasts.

<P>
<a name="30331w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The option for three new runways at Stansted that was developed for the SERAS study provides for four runways arranged in two close parallel pairs. For the purposes of the study certain assumptions were made about the operation of the runways. The assumptions are set out in the SERAS Stage 1 report (option 7 on page 214), which is publicly available.
<P>

<a name="30331w09.html_para3">One runway in each pair would be used for take-offs, the other for landings. In the case of the western pair, the outer (new) runway would be staggered to the north-east of the existing runway.

 Diary pressures have restricted my meetings on the post-primary review to Northern Ireland political parties. However, in December I hosted a dinner for the main education sector interests, including the Governing Bodies Association representing the views of the voluntary grammar schools, to hear at first hand views on how best to take the review forward. In recent months my officials have met representatives of the GBA on four occasions and with representatives of grammar school principals on three occasions on this issue, most recently on Wednesday 26 March. My officials keep me fully advised of the views of the grammar school sector and I do not believe a meeting is necessary at the present time.

 There are several disease modifying medicines (three beta interferon products and glatiramer) currently available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). To meet the needs of all MS patients, including those who have been assessed as suitable for treatment with disease modifying drugs, there is also a requirement to secure the services of professionals with specialist expertise.

It is anticipated that this will both sustain current services and enhance provision for MS sufferers.

This figure does not include patients who are taking a break from treatment for clinical and other reasons, nor those who are being supplied drugs through third party commercial suppliers&#151;for example, a number of additional patients in the Western Health and Social Services Board area have been offered treatment through a contract with a private sector organisation.

 The government does not believe that there is a continuing obligation upon it to hold a new, article 2 compliant investigation into a past incident where there has already been an investigation. This position is presently being challenged in the courts, but no final judgment has been reached.

That is why, in May 2002, the British and Irish governments appointed the Canadian Judge Peter Cory to look at allegations into six high profile cases, including that of Billy Wright, with a view to advising what more needs to be done to establish the truth.

 The international objective of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is to measure how well young people approaching the end of compulsory schooling are prepared to meet the challenges of today's knowledge societies. Through PISA, OECD member countries are collaborating to improve comparative indicators on the performance of education systems. Research and statistics provide the basis for sound, evidence-based policy making. The specific objective of Northern Ireland's participation, over and above enabling UK figures to be produced, is to build up a time series, independent of GCSE results and capable of international comparison, of data on how well pupils in Northern Ireland are performing in reading, maths and science.
<P>

<a name="30331w13.html_para11">Participation by Northern Ireland in PISA 2000 and PISA 2003 was respectively authorised by my predecessors: Tony Worthington in October 1997 and Martin McGuinness in September 2000.

 Each school that agreed to take part in the study nominated a 'School Co-ordinator' who was supplied with a 'School Co-ordinator's Manual' describing all the procedures associated with the study, from the build-up to the survey through to the administration of the test. The school co-ordinator was also provided with letters and leaflets for the parents of each child selected to take part in the survey. The letters were provided in unsealed envelopes, giving the school the option of adding a letter of their own or a reply slip. It was for the school to decide whether to send the letter and leaflet by post to the parents, or give them to the pupils to take home. The information for parents included a clear statement of what the survey was about, its voluntary nature, information for parents on how to withdraw their child from the survey, and information on what was involved and how long it would take.

 The White Paper, "The Future of Higher Education", highlighted how those with higher education qualifications earn on average around 50 per cent. more than non-graduates. Higher education is undoubtedly a good investment. Our estimate of the average additional earnings of those who get two or more 'A' Levels but choose not to go to university is &#163;120,000.

<a name="30331w14.html_para14">However, nine out of 10 of those who obtain two or more 'A' Levels go to university. We have no analysis of how the small minority of one in 10 differ from the majority, so comparisons should be treated with caution.

The Department currently allocates most capital funding to schools and local education authorities (LEAs) by needs-related formulae, and it is for LEAs to assess and prioritise the capital needs of their school buildings through their asset management planning process, in consultation with local schools.
<P>

<a name="30331w15.html_para3">I am also announcing today further allocations of capital funding for schools from the totals that are available over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="30331w15.html_para4">There will be 15 private finance initiative (PFI) projects with a total allocation of &#163;830 million PFI credits, in response to the invitation we made in 2002 to all LEAs to apply for this funding. I am also establishing four LEA pathfinders, to be funded through PFI credits, to help develop the Building Schools for the Future programme. In total, this represents around &#163;1 billion of support to schools PFI projects.
<P>

<a name="30331w15.html_para5">There will be Targeted Capital funding to 78 LEA projects totalling &#163;199 million at 71 LEAs, and &#163;146 million of support for 56 projects in voluntary aided schools at 41 LEAs, which should start in 2003&#150;04. These projects support our educational priorities, including promoting inclusion, advancing the 14&#150;19 agenda, and standards-led investment at schools causing concern.
<P>

<a name="30331w15.html_para6">We are also allocating a new formulaic Modernisation programme of just over &#163;1 billion in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;717 million in 2005&#150;06. The new programme brings together the existing Condition and Modernisation programmes and will include &#163;300 million of funding in each year targeted at building needs in primary schools to encourage up to 25 per cent. more investment in that sector.

<P>

<sup>(31)</sup> New students in 1998&#150;99 received support for maintenance through income-assessed grants (comprising about a quarter of the support available) and non income-assessed student loans (comprising about three quarters of the support available). (The ratio for existing students is roughly 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. non means-tested student loan). In 1999&#150;2000, students who entered higher education from 1998&#150;99 onwards received support for maintenance entirely though loans, of which three quarters of the value was non income-assessed. Loans made under these arrangements are repayable on an income contingent basis.<P>

<P>

<sup>(32)</sup> Dependent students are assessed for support based on the income of their parents and of the students themselves.<P>

<P>

<sup>(33)</sup> Independent students are assessed for support based on their own income and that of their spouse/partner. A student is regarded as independent if he/she is aged 25 or over before the start of the academic year for which they are applying; have been married for at least two years before the start of the academic year for which they are applying or have support themselves for at least three years before the start of their course.<P>

<P>

<sup>(34)</sup> Students who entered higher education up to 1997&#150;98, and those who entered in 1998&#150;99 to whom the mandatory scheme funding arrangements applied, received support for maintenance through income-assessed grants.<P>

HEFCE has re-balanced the funding levels between ratings to ensure better resourcing and improved quality of the best research. This did mean a reduction in funding of &#163;21 million for departments rated 4 and a net reduction of &#163;4.3 million for departments rated 3a and 3b. This takes into account the new capability development funding for 3a and 3b departments in subjects where there is a particular need to boost research.

 Information is not available in precisely the form requested.

However there are only figures available at a primary care trust level for the first three quarters of 2002&#150;03, (April to December 2002) when the average number of patients delayed on any one day was 32 in Suffolk West PCT, and 18 in Central Suffolk PCT.

 Statistics on the time patients wait for thrombolysis are collected through the Myocardial Infarct National Audit Project (MINAP) run by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP). MINAP shows that for the last three months of 2002, 44 per cent. of clinically eligible heart attack patients in England were treated within 20 minutes of hospital arrival, an increase of 24 per cent. over the same period in 2000. The data for strategic health authorities and hospitals in England where heart attack patients are treated are available online to individual health authorities and trusts for monitoring purposes. The RCP published the data covering the first six months of 2002 on 19 November 2002 and copies of the report will be placed in the Library. The RCP plans a further publication which will include the full 2002 dataset later this year.

 <i>[holding answer 21 March 2003]:</i> Government funding may be available from a variety of sources, and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has recently announced that &#163;14 million will be made available over the next three years to support local partnerships in developing mainstream responses to domestic violence. He also announced that the Home Office will be funding a post at the Local Government Authority (LGA) to support this work.

<a name="30331w24.html_para11">In addition, for example, the Children's Fund allocates money to local partnerships which commission services which have been agreed as a local priority, and which will include support for children who are living with domestic violence. During last summer there were 158 services funded by the Children Fund that explicitly targeted children suffering from domestic violence. To provide safe accommodation for those suffering domestic violence the Homelessness Directorate has announced a &#163;7 million capital investment programme through the Housing Corporation to extend the national network of women's refuges in England. The Directorate is planning to invest similar amounts over the course of the following two years, bringing the total amount to &#163;21 million over three years. Initial allocations for Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) are being agreed with the Housing Corporation for 2003&#150;04 and it is hoped that further schemes, drawn up by RSLs in collaboration with local authorities, will be supported in the following two years.
<P>

<a name="30331w24.html_para12">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has offered every local housing authority in England an allocation to assist them in the implementation of the Priority Need for Accommodation (England) Order 2002 and they could, if they wish, utilise this money to support domestic violence projects.
<P>

<a name="30331w24.html_para13">Supporting people, which comes into effect from 1 April 2003, will provide &#163;1.4 billion funding in its first year for local authorities to provide housing-related support. One of the key principles of Supporting People is that support should be offered regardless of the type of accommodation in which people live. So for people experiencing domestic violence, Supporting People may be used for housing-related support whether this is offered within a refuge, in temporary accommodation or in the home.

<P>
<a name="30331w25.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 28 March 2003]:</i> As part of Her Majesty's forces, Gurkhas are exempt from immigration control while serving in the UK, and therefore, the 1971 Immigration Act does not apply to them. Accordingly, no leave can be conferred on a Gurkha soldier during their service here. The question of conferring indefinite leave to remain upon termination of service does not arise, as Gurkhas are discharged in Nepal in accordance with their terms and conditions of service.

 Diamorphine (heroin) is already one of those controlled drugs to which the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations 1973 apply. Pharmacies are covered by these Regulations, which oblige them to hold controlled drugs in such a way as to prevent any unauthorised access.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will undertake a survey of the operation by police forces of the Home Office's non-negotiable processes of applications by officers seeking retirement on the grounds of ill-health retirement; whether he will amend the process to enable a speedier conclusion; and if he will make a statement.  [105301]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Police officers are a valuable resource and one of our priorities is to ensure that their skills and expertise are retained by forces as long as practicable. Under the Police Pensions Regulations it is the responsibility of the police authority for the force concerned to decide whether to retire or retain an officer who has been assessed as permanently disabled by their selected medical practitioner. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary reviewed the management of ill-health retirement of police officers in their thematic inspection report of 1997, 'Lost Time'.
<P>

<a name="30331w25.html_para3">As part of the police reform process the Police Negotiating Board agreed in May 2002 ways to deliver a fair and more consistent approach towards early retirement due to ill health. Following the May Agreement the Police Negotiating Board agreed on 30 January changes to the Police Pensions Regulations to help support good practice, and joint guidance on the procedures for considering ill-health retirement. The new regulations come into force on 1 April and the joint guidance should be applied from 1 July. Under the guidance each case should be handled as expeditiously as possible consistent with a properly informed decision as to retirement or retention, with cases involving imminent death or severe disablement being given expedited treatment.

 The requested information is in the table.

<a name="30331w26.html_para1">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime in 1 April 1998, which would have the tendency to increase the number of crimes counted. Crime rates before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.

<a name="30331w26.html_para2">The Kent County Constabulary adopted the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard on 1 April 2000, in advance of its national implementation on 1 April 2002. This may have inflated its recorded crime figures, and so crime rates before and after this date may not be directly comparable.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how his Department intends to evaluate the Street Crime Initiative in the relevant police force areas; and if he will publish the evaluation.  [105313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Street Crime Initiative is ongoing and as part of its day to day management there is regular identification and exchange of good practice across the various agencies involved. At local level a number of specific evaluations of projects or initiatives have been commissioned. These are a matter for the local partners.
<P>

<a name="30331w26.html_para3">In addition, various strands of activity contributing to reducing street crime are being examined by a number of independent inspectorates, including Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Constabulary, Prisons, and Probation, and the Social Services, Crown Prosecution Service, and Magistrates Courts' Inspectorates. Findings are expected to be made available in the summer.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether there is evidence to show that the street crime initiative has displaced such crimes into areas not subject to the initiative.  [105314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 It is not currently possible to make an assessment of displacement effects from areas subject to the Street Crime Initiative to areas that are not part of the initiative. It should not be assumed that decreases in crime in a particular force area are at the cost of increases elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30331w26.html_para4">Criminal statistics are published on a quarterly and annual basis. The latest figures for England and Wales show that robbery fell by 10 per cent. in July to September 2002 compared to the year before.

 Action Teams for Jobs focus on the most disadvantaged jobless people in the most employment deprived areas of the country. They target the wards within these areas which have the lowest overall employment rates and the highest rate of people claiming all benefits.
<P>

<a name="30331w28.html_para0">There are no Action Teams for Jobs based in the Portsmouth area. However, through Jobcentre Plus, we offer a wide range of help for jobless people in the city. For example, the New Deals have helped almost 3,000 people in Portsmouth move from welfare into work. This has played an important part in increasing employment and reducing unemployment in the city. Since 1997, the working age employment rate has risen to over 75 per cent. and remains above the national average, claimant unemployment has been cut by 60 per cent., and the number of people unemployed for 12 months or more has fallen by 90 per cent.

However, the percentage of bills which were paid by the Department within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice was 93 per cent. for the financial year 2001&#150;02. The average percentage of bills paid by my Department's agencies was 94 per cent. over the same period. There were no executive non-departmental public bodies in that year.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, I have been asked to reply to your six questions concerning our dress standard. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A copy of the Jobcentre Plus dress standard has been placed in the Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our dress standard requires all our staff to dress in a professional and business like way. It reflects our role as a gateway to the labour market for people of working age and in providing vacancy-filling services for employers. It is consistent with the approach adopted by many other service delivery organisations and is entirely appropriate for us as a highly visible public-facing service. It is also an important element in promoting a single, integrated culture within our organisation&#151;which was created from staff of the former Benefits Agency and Employment Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our records from July 2002 show that 47 staff have received oral warnings, of whom 21 went on to receive written warnings, and 10 went on to receive disciplinary penalties.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked how many of these were from the former Benefits Agency and from the former Employment Service, and how many were frontline and non frontline employees. This information is not available, and to gather it would involve a disproportionate cost.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At present there are 23 people failing to comply with the dress standard, out of the approximate 82,000 staff of Jobcentre Plus; around half of whom are claiming exemption on medical grounds.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Consultation on the dress standard took place in the lead up to the introduction of integrated Pathfinder offices, which preceded Jobcentre Plus, and on the launch of Jobcentre Plus itself. The Public and Commercial Services Union was formally consulted and some of their comments were incorporated into the standard though, regrettably, we were unable to reach full agreement with them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In developing our dress standard, we took extensive legal advice which has led us to be firmly of the view that our dress policy is not discriminatory, is reasonable and does not contravene the Human Rights Act.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what consultations he has had with the liquidators of the Lister Group regarding the level of pension to be paid to former employees of the firm.  [105184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 No consultations have been held with the liquidators of the Lister Group regarding the level of pensions to be paid to scheme members. But we are aware of the difficult situation faced by members of the Lister pension scheme, and I sympathise with their position.
<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para6">We are concerned about instances when the employer sponsoring a pension scheme becomes insolvent and the pension scheme winds up under-funded. We are aware of the impact this has, and we are determined to protect the long term security of pensioners and other scheme members in occupational pension schemes.
<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para7">That is why we have consulted on proposals in our Green Paper, 'Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement' (Cm5677), published on 17 December, aimed at improving protection for scheme members on wind up. This includes proposals to share out scheme assets more fairly, introduce a centralised "clearing house" or some form of insurance, remove the restrictions on the amount of compensation payable under the compensation scheme and strengthen protection for members whose solvent employer chooses to wind up its scheme.
<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para8">The Government want to ensure that when a scheme winds up, the assets are divided among scheme members as fairly as possible. Through the Green Paper we have consulted on:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. whether people who are approaching retirement age should be given a higher priority when scheme assets are distributed on wind-up, than at present;
<P>
<BR>
2. whether people who have been members of their pension scheme for a number of years should be given a higher priority; or
<P>
<BR>
3. whether there should be a fairer sharing of assets between those with larger and smaller pensions when a scheme winds up, possibly setting a cap on the level of pension that those with the highest pensions might receive, if there are limited assets available in the scheme.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30331w29.html_para9">We are considering moving pension schemes up the order of priority for payment, possibly creating a new category of creditor, which would give pension schemes higher priority than at present.
<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para10">We have sought views on other approaches to dealing with under-funded defined benefit schemes that are wound up because their sponsoring employer becomes insolvent. Possibly:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. a form of insurance (perhaps a central discontinuance fund) that enables members to be more confident that, if their employer becomes insolvent with an under-funded pension scheme, they will receive the benefits promised; or




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>31 Mar 2003 : Column 601W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>
<BR>
2. a centralised arrangement or "clearing house" into which people whose employer became insolvent could pay the funds that they receive on wind-up. The "clearing house" would seek to buy the best available deferred annuity from an insurance company and should be able to negotiate better annuity rates.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30331w29.html_para11">Insurance or a centralised "clearing house" might have advantages, providing better protection for scheme members where a company becomes insolvent and is forced to close its under-funded scheme. However, the costs would need to be balanced against the greater overall level of security offered.
<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para12">A compensation scheme already exists to provide compensation for losses caused by dishonesty where the employer is insolvent. Nonetheless, we are seeking views on removing the restrictions on the amount of compensation payable under the compensation scheme.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2003 : Column 602W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para13">Also, we are seeking views on changes to the debt on the employer provisions that might result in more funds being put into a scheme when a solvent employer chooses to wind it up.
<P>

<a name="30331w29.html_para14">The consultation period ran until 28 March 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 20 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 925&#150;26W, on fraud and the New Deal, (1) if he will make a statement on the nature of the frauds committed by contractors in relation to the New Deal; and what steps his Department has taken to prevent such frauds;  [105351]

<UL>(2) if he will list, in each year in which an estimated total loss was given in his answer, the cases in which fraud was found to have occurred, and the precise level of the fraud in each case.  [105352]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> Allegations made against contractors delivering New Deal programmes fall mainly into two broad categories: allegations that the claimed outcomes were fabricated or mis-stated, and allegations that the claimed training delivered was not in fact provided.
<P>

<a name="30331w30.html_para3">New Deal providers are subject to thorough contractual and quality audits. These specifically consider the delivery of training against the requirements set out in the contract between Jobcentre Plus and providers. Contractual terms and conditions include appropriate clauses requiring parties to the contract to use all reasonable endeavours to safeguard Jobcentre Plus funding of the New Deal against fraud generally and, in particular fraud on the part of the provider's directors, employees or sub-contractors.
<P>

<a name="30331w30.html_para4">The Department investigates all such allegations, of which some are false, some are true but caused through clerical or administrative error and others are caused by fraud.
<P>

<a name="30331w30.html_para5">Where evidence of fraud is found, it is reported at the earliest opportunity to the police, who are responsible for any subsequent criminal law investigation. Some reported fraud is suspected to be corporate, but most cases are investigated as internal frauds by employees of the contractor.
<P>

<a name="30331w30.html_para6">Since the Department's action following investigation is often a referral to outside bodies, such as the police, it is not possible to state the outcome of each case.

 Jobcentre Plus and New Deal providers have mechanisms in place that aim to maximise information about the destinations of those leaving the programme and Jobcentre Plus is working to ensure that best practice is shared across different districts and providers.

<P>

<a name="30331w30.html_para7">Later this year we are planning to conduct further research into people whose destination on leaving NDYP was unknown. Previous surveys of this kind have shown that the destinations of this group mirror that of people leaving to known destinations, with a large number of these young people entering sustained employment.
<P>

<a name="30331w30.html_para8">However, individuals are not obliged to inform us of their destination on leaving the New Deal for Young People (NDYP) and following up all of these cases can be very time consuming.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what arrangements are in place to credit pension payments paid into a bank account <i>(a)</i> weekly and <i>(b)</i> in advance rather than arrears; whether changes in method of payment are made only on request; and how such a request can be made.  [105378]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will list the <i>(a)</i> funded and <i>(b)</i> unfunded public sector pension schemes for which his Department, its agencies and its non-departmental public bodies are responsible; when the last actuarial valuation was of each scheme; what the value was of the assets at the last actuarial valuation of each scheme; what deficit is disclosed by the last actuarial valuation of each scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [104923]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many people of working age were not making second tier pension arrangements <i>(a)</i> in 1997 and <i>(b)</i> in the last year for which figures are available.  [105825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30331w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 In 1997, we estimate that 11.9 million working age people were not members of SERPS or making private pension arrangements. In 2001&#150;02, this figure was 11.4 million. We estimate that state second pension, introduced from April 2002 will reduce the number to about 7 million. These figures have been estimated using the Family Resources Survey, 1997&#150;98 and 2001&#150;02.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many people were in approved personal pensions in each year since 1988; and what proportion of members were accruing no additional pension rights in each year.  [105826]<P>
<P>
<P>

based on administrative returns made to the Inland Revenue by personal pension providers and show the number of arrangements for employees which have received a contribution in the year.
<P>

<a name="30331w31.html_para0">It is not possible to estimate how many individuals these relate to. Neither is it possible to say how many of those with only minimum contributions have made no further contributions to a private pension as, for example, an appropriate personal pension may have been used by an individual to contract out while a member of an employer's occupational scheme. Alternatively, the individual could have arrangements with other personal pension providers to which they are making contributions.

 The Department treats very seriously any instances of theft or fraud. In instances where a member of staff is proven to have committed fraud against the Department, disciplinary penalties, including dismissal, will be considered in addition to any criminal proceedings. The Department has put a number of measures in place to deter theft and fraud including working with property managers to make buildings more secure, internal fraud investigators actively operating in each government region, security specialists assessing internal security risk within a number of business units, awareness training for staff on internal security, a Whistleblowers hotline for staff to report instances of internal fraud, a portfolio of fact sheets on fraud and securty for staff and regular bulletins to middle managers on internal fraud matters.
