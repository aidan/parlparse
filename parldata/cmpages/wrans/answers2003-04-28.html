<i>Notes</i>:<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(1)</sup> Energy consumption: this is weather-corrected in the usual manner, using annual degree days relative to the 20 year average for 1990&#150;01. The figures are those reported on for the Central Government Estate campaign, and generally include each Department's main estate plus all agencies, but not NDPBs.<P>

<P>

<sup>(2)</sup> Energy expenditure: this is actual spend, and from April 2001, includes the climate change levy.<P>

<P>

<sup>(3)</sup> Energy/m2: this variable allows for changes in both weather and estate size on energy consumption. So annual changes will generally reflect efficiency changes.<P>

<P>

<sup>(4)</sup> Savings over 1997&#150;98: These have been expressed as percentage savings relative to the first year quoted here, and are based on the figures in the preceding column.<P>

<P>

<sup>(5)</sup> Energy efficiency spend: Note that this is not necessarily a good measure of an effective energy efficiency policy. For example, when a new building is commissioned or an existing one refurbished, good design can actually reduce capital costs, e.g by avoiding air conditioning. The costs of an effective energy management team may also not be included.<P>

<P>

</FONT>

<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para3">In the past two years, energy efficiency has been built into the relocation/refurbishment plans for both sites. In London, some of the main features were:
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para4">New plant ventilation systems (&#163;1.5m), to replace the poorly performing existing systems;
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para5">A new building management system (&#163;800,000) which allows energy usage to be managed and controlled effectively;
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para6">A new lighting installation (&#163;1m), which is more energy efficient.
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para7">In our East Kilbride Office, some of the main changes which are about to be made include:
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para8">New double-glazed window units with reduced u-value (low winter heat loss) and high performance glass (low summer heat gain), and therefore utilising energy free natural ventilation in lieu of air conditioning;
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para9">Energy efficient lighting system, including presence detectors;
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para10">Replacement of four existing boilers with three high efficiency units.
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para11">It is currently not possible to make meaningful direct cost comparisons on savings on energy efficiency measures with regard to the London office as we moved from a shared 1960s building (over whose landlords' policies DFID had little direct control) to a newly refurbished building in December 2001. However, energy efficiency was a major factor in the refurbishment specification. Similarly, extensive refurbishment works are currently being carried out in our office at East Kilbride, and the designs for these works have received an "excellent" BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) rating.
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para12">The Energy White Paper, Our Energy Future&#151;Creating a Low Carbon Economy made clear the importance the Government attaches to improving energy efficiency in its own estate. This is reflected in several targets. There is currently an interim target of a 1 per cent per annum ongoing reduction in weather- corrected carbon emissions, pending the development of new indicators and targets based on benchmarking the performance of each Department's largest buildings.
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para13">In addition, the review of Government procurement has identified areas where procurement could reinforce the achievement of these targets, and arrangements are being made centrally for Departments to purchase goods with high energy efficiency standards and which provide good value for money.




<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 4W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para14">On the purchase of renewable electricity, Ministers agreed the following target in May 2001: All departments will ensure that by 31 March 2003, at least 5 per cent. of their electricity comes from renewable sources that are exempt from the Climate Change Levy or from self generation, provided this does not entail excessive cost. This will rise to at least 10 per cent supply from such sources by 31 March 2008, but will be reviewed after 31 March 2003 to take account of market conditions following the introduction of the renewables obligation. The review of 2003 will include consideration of increasing or bringing forward the target. DFID has already more than achieved this target, as in July 2002 the London office changed its electricity supplier, resulting in a 100 per cent renewable supply for a lower unit charge (3.824p compared to 4.402p previously for a non-renewable supply).
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para15">Energy saving has therefore been an integral part of the Department's refurbishment/ relocation programme. We are also on track with the development of our Environmental Management Strategy (EMS) in line with Central Government Sustainable Development policies and targets, and this will address the issue of Energy Management.
<P>

<a name="30428w01.html_para16">There are no agencies or non-departmental public bodies for which DFID is responsible.

 We have supported a wide range of initiatives, bilaterally and through our contributions to the EC and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, to meet the needs of Palestinians as the humanitarian situation has deteriorated. This includes a number of emergency health programmes including midwifery training and women's health development. We also support work aimed at reducing the impact of violence on Palestinian children, as well as supplementary educational materials for children unable to attend school full time due to closures and curfews. Our work with the World bank and UNRWA helps fund employment generation schemes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w02.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We maintain very close contact with both the World Bank and the United Nations on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I discussed the Palestinian situation with both UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and World Bank President Wolfenson in New York and Washington last month. The World Bank and the United Nations Special Co-ordinator's Office play a key role in analysing the social and economic impact of the current conflict. We work closely with them on these issues, and jointly finance a number of specific initiatives. Our relations with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees are strong. Its mandate to provide education, health and emergency services to the refugee population remains critical in these troubled times.

 We maintain close contact with our European partners and with the European Commission. I have spoken recently to Commissioner Patten about the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We discussed the importance of support to Palestinian reform efforts, and implementation of the Roadmap towards a two state solution. The appalling humanitarian situation can only be resolved through a just political settlement. The EC shares our view of the need to balance immediate humanitarian assistance with longer-term support for institutional development. In the current circumstances it is essential that organisations respond quickly and flexibly to emerging Palestinian needs. I raised this issue with Commissioner Patten in relation to EC assistance.

<P>
<a name="30428w02.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 No formal assessment has been made&#151;nor has there been any need for one. DFID employment practices were already compliant with the Part-time Workers Directive and the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 in advance of their introduction. Other than a minor technical adjustment to the formula used to calculate hourly remuneration rates there have been no substantial consequences for DFID. DFID supports work/life balance for staff and part time working is only one of several ways in which we offer staff flexibility in their working patterns. 7 per cent. of DFID's UK based staff work part-time.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement in response to the comments made by the Executive Director of the World Food Programme to the United Nations Security Council on 7 April.  [109227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w02.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I agree with the assessment of James Morris that conditions in many parts of Africa are a cause of great concern and must not be overlooked at a time when the world's attention is on Iraq. I welcome the efforts of the World Food Programme to address urgent humanitarian need in the continent and elsewhere. In 2002, the UK gave over &#163;60 million to WFP, principally for humanitarian operations. We will continue to be strong supporters of the Programme.
<P>

<a name="30428w02.html_para3">However, the Government puts different emphasis on some of causes of the crises and on the steps needed to address them. An adequate donor response is of course important. I made special efforts last year to encourage other donors to respond to the urgent needs in Southern Africa. But we must go beyond investments in food aid and agriculture. In Southern Africa, the main problem is Zimbabwe and the central issue is one of governance. As Mr. Morris recognises, in other parts of Africa, continuing conflict drastically hampers opportunities to reduce hunger and poverty. We need to take account of the wide range of factors affecting food security in Africa andencourage steps, including by African governments themselves, to address the social, political and economic constraints.




<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 7W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30428w02.html_para4">I talk regularly to James Morris about problems in Africa, most recently in London on 31 March. We will continue to keep in close touch. We will also give full consideration to the proposals set out in Mr. Morris's statement for actions by the G8 countries.

<a name="30428w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Control systems to prevent the use of unapproved aircraft parts by the aviation industry have been in place in the UK for over 30 years. Parts and components are not fitted to UK registered aircraft unless the certifying engineer releasing the aircraft to service is completely satisfied that the parts comply with CAA requirements and those of the aircraft manufacturer. In addition, all UK registered commercial aircraft are subject to regular airworthiness inspections and the CAA carries out systematic audits and ad hoc inspections of UK operators and aircraft maintenance organisations. The UK has no jurisdiction over the availability of counterfeit parts in other countries, responsibility for which rests with the State concerned.
<P>

<a name="30428w03.html_para0">Airworthiness Notice 19 is an advisory notice to operators and maintenance organisations reminding them of the need to remain vigilant in the detection of bogus aircraft parts. It is reviewed and updated to reflect current knowledge on the issue of unauthorised or bogus parts. Notice 19 also reminds operators and maintenance organisations that any unauthorised parts must be reported to the CAA.

 The Treasury complies with the requirements of the Part-time Workers Directive. Part-time workers in the Treasury are treated in the same way in their contractual terms and conditions as comparable full-timers. There are 60 staff across all grades who currently work either part-time or have job shares. The Treasury has a number of practical policies in place to recognise the importance of having a work life balance. In addition to working part-time and job shares, the Department encourages other alternative working patterns such as term-time working, homeworking and working flexible hours.

A five day working week is, wherever practicable, the standard arrangement throughout the Department.There is no standard departmental core hours or flexible working hours scheme.

<a name="30428w04.html_para9">Staff work 41 hours, including lunch breaks, in London and 42 hours including lunch breaks, elsewhere, with the attendance pattern being dictated by the needs of the work at a particular location. Within these attendance patterns, the Department operates various attendance schemes which enable staff to balance their work and domestic lives, and this supports the Department's policy of achieving a diverse workforce.
<P>

<a name="30428w04.html_para10">These attendance schemes include part-time/term-time working and job sharing; home-working and flexible working hours (FWH). Under FWH, staff have a core time of attendance which is locally agreed between management and unions, typically 10.00 to 15.30. Staff have a reasonable degree of freedom over their meal break within the core time, and over their starting and finishing times outside the core time.

Core hours are between 10:00 and 12:00 and between 15:00 and 16:00. Flexible working bands exist for employees to start work at anytime between 08:00 and 10:00 and leave anytime between 16:00 and 18:30. This is recorded on an electronic 'flexi clock' over a four week period. Employees are allowed to take up to two days flexi leave in the relevant period provided they have the relevant amount of credit. Extra time must be worked to reduce any deflicit.

<P>

<a name="30428w04.html_para25">The core times are 09.30&#150;12 noon and 14.00&#150;15.30. The earliest and latest start and finishing times are 0700 and 1800. Staff may carry over each month a debit or credit of up to a day and a half. There is, however, an overriding principle that this flexibility must be achieved without impairing the efficiency of the Department and the service it provides. Staff working in, and directly linked to, the manufacturing processes are not on a flexible working hours system.

<P>

<a name="30428w04.html_para28">OGC have introduced a Flexible Working Hours scheme (FWH) that provides staff, with the agreement of line management to work flexibly within agreed core times. The OGC Flexible Working (FWH) Scheme is based on conditioned hours of 144 hours across a four-week accounting period, for full time staff. Staff who work more than their net conditioned hours in the accounting period are able to carry over a number of credit hours into the next 4-week accounting period. Staff may also carry over a debit into the next period. The scheme aims to provide staff with as much flexibility as possible to allow more scope to accommodate personal and domestic commitments. It also provides flexibility for managers to meet the business needs of OGC.

 DCMS undertakes a variety of activities to encourage a wider diversity of applicants for public appointments, including those from all parts of England. This includes advertising in the national press, articles in selected publications, advertising of all vacancies on our own website (www.culture.gov.uk), the new public appointments website (www.publicappts- vacs.gov.uk) and the Just Do Something site (www.justdosomething.net) run by Common Purpose. We also participated in the regional public appointments seminars organised by the Women and Equality Unit during 2002.

May last year. However, recent restructuring of several of our strategic bodies supports the aim set out in the White Paper to reflect the needs of individual regions in developing national policies and programmes. For example, we have created regional representation on Arts Council England and Sport England through the appointment of regional Board Chairs to their Councils, and recognised the role of Regional Development Agencies in restructuring support for tourism.

<a name="30428w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 There is a wide variety range of summer school and performance camp activity planned for the London borough of Harrow in the next year.
<P>

<a name="30428w05.html_para3">Sport England's Active Sports Programme will deliver activities across an increasing range of sports in the area. More details on these are set out in the table.
<P>

<a name="30428w05.html_para4">Arts Council England will also be funding summer school activity in the Borough. This will include a four-week summer school at Arts Culture, Harrow, providing a wide range of arts and crafts sessions for pre-school children to 16-year olds. The organisation is also running two weeks of participatory musical theatre courses for children of all ages and Tomorrow's Warriors, a local information, co-ordination and advisory resource centre for promoters, musicians, and arts organisations, which is currently developing plans for a series of 'jam' sessions for local young people over the summer.
<P>

<a name="30428w05.html_para5">Harrow will also be covered by the new holiday activities programme jointly developed by DCMS and others across Government. Building on the success of last year's summer activities schemes, the new programme will, through a 'single pot', provide funding for positive activities for children and young people aged 8&#150;19 during all school holiday periods. While the scheme is due to go live in the Whitsun break, delivery plans for this are still in development, so it is not possible to say at this stage what provision there will be in Harrow.

 The Department, in consultation with business generally, the insurance industry, and other relevant Government Departments, undertook a detailed assessment of the implications of compulsory financial security, which has emerged in the course of the Council negotiation on the European Commission's draft Directive on Environmental Liability. The Commission's proposal was merely for Member States to encourage operators to use appropriate insurance or other forms of financial security. The need to have financial cover could impose disciplines on operators to improve their operations in order to minimise the risks of environment damage. The assessment suggests that the environmental benefits, which were evaluated in the Department's Extended Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (COM(02)17), could be substantially lower than the costs.

 My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Commons) and I represented the UK at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 8 April. The Ministers with agriculture and fisheries responsibilities in the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government were also present.
<P>

<a name="30428w06.html_para0">The Council held an in-depth debate on the Commission's proposals for decoupling farm aids, cross-compliance, transferring funding from direct subsidies into rural development spending and other cross-cutting measures which form the centrepiece of its proposals for reform of the CAP. I expressed the United Kingdom's broad support for the proposals while calling for greater simplification, reduction of bureaucracy and fairer mechanisms for allocating reductions in direct aids and increases in rural development funding.

 The carcases, or parts of carcases, of wild animals, including deer, badgers and foxes, will be exempt from the scope of the Regulation unless they are thought to be diseased or are used to produce game trophies.

(3) if she will make transitional provisions to enable shellfish producers to find alternative means to landfill of disposing of shellfish waste after 1May.  [108794]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 April 2003]:</i> Council Directive 90/667/EEC (the Animal Waste Directive) already classifies shellfish and fish waste as an animal by-product and applies to all member States. The Directive will be replaced by Regulation 1774/2002 (the Animal By-Products Regulation) which maintains the same principle. The Sea Fish Industry Authority was consulted during negotiations on the Regulation and a number of other fish and shellfish industries were sent the consultation document of 27 January 2003 on enforcing the Regulation. The consultation document and list of consultees can be found at http://defraweb/corporate/consult/euanimbyprod/conslist.htm. As landfill is not currently a permitted disposal route for most shellfish waste, we have not asked the Commission for a transition period to allow that practice to continue. We do not know whether, or how, other member States intend to apply the derogation permitting the burial or burning of animal by-products in remote areas. However, in the UK it is likely to be limited to parts of the Highlands and the Islands of Scotland.

Appropriate action can subsequently be taken against the owner of the carcase. Animal by-products legislation already controls the collection, storage, transportation and disposal of animal by-products, including fallen stock. It also requires records to be kept of any off-site consignment of animal by-products to assist in the auditing and traceability of this material. In addition, there will be a record keeping requirement to ensure that all animals which die on-farm are accounted for and disposed of through permitted routes.

<P>
<a name="30428w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Newly formed cattle herds and premises restocked after a herd slaughter require, as a rule, one whole-herd TB test three to six months after restocking. To manage the increased risk of introducing TB through movements of infected cattle into re-formed herds, DEFRA has instigated a programme of frequent testing of premises restocked after the foot and mouth outbreak. In addition to the usual check test carried 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 25W</I><P>
three to six months post-restocking, those premises now require two further check tests at 12-month intervals before reverting to the normal testing interval for their parish.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Cattle which react to the TB test are removed for slaughter, and the herd is placed under movement restrictions until all the eligible cattle have cleared two further short interval tests (60 days).
<P>

<a name="30428w07.html_para0">Movements of cattle to and from herds with unknown disease status constitute a disease risk. Historically, herds with overdue TB tests have not automatically been put under movement restrictions. After the TB testing programme was suspended during the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, there was a backlog of 27,000 overdue tests at the end of December 2001. On 31 January 2002, after veterinary risk assessment, herds considered most at risk of infection were put under movement restrictions. On 1 February 2003, as part of the 'autumn package' of measures for the control of bovine TB, herds with tests overdue by more than 12 months were put under movement restriction. From 1 April 2003, herds with tests overdue by more than six months were also placed under movement restriction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In designing and conducting the randomised badger culling trial (the "Krebs" trial), MAFF (now DEFRA) and the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB have given a high priority to animal welfare issues. Snares and gassing are not used in the trial. Badgers are caught in cage traps, and shot at close range by personnel trained in the safe and humane use of firearms, specifically in relation to badgers. Traps are set as late as possible in the day, and checked as early as possible next morning, to minimise the time badgers spend in traps. Trial procedures require that trapping be suspended if, due to bad weather, there is a risk that cage traps could be flooded or that trapped badgers would suffer from extreme exposure. Both temperature and wind chill must be taken into account. Seven day weather forecasts are used in the planning of trapping operations. Badgers are not culled between 1 February and 30 April (the closed season) each year to minimise the risk of capturing lactating sows with dependent cubs below ground.
<P>

<a name="30428w07.html_para2">The humaneness of despatch procedures has been subject to independent audit which found trial procedures to be humane. The audit report is published on DEFRA's website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/publications/auditor/report.shtml

 Defra is funding research at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge to produce candidate vaccines and to evaluate these in host species. The candidates include a range of live attenuated vaccines and sub-unit vaccines. Defra is also funding experimental vaccination of cattle with BCG and other vaccine candidates, development of a test to differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals, and development and testing of vaccines against TB in badgers, in collaboration with University College, Dublin.
<P>

<a name="30428w07.html_para3">The sequencing of the genome of Mycobacterium bovis (announced by Defra in March 2002) represents significant progress in vaccine research, as all genes, proteins, enzymes and antigens present in M. bovis are likely to be identified rapidly in a highly cost-effective manner. This will underpin all future Defra bovine TB research in the development of vaccines and improved diagnostic tests. Defra is funding research at the VLA in this area.

 Defra's extensive bovine TB vaccine research programme is aimed at identifying the most effective vaccine candidates and the most appropriate vaccination programmes to reduce the incidence of bovine TB. Depending on the outcome of this research, it will be necessary to gain approval for the selected vaccine or vaccines to be used in cattle or badgers or other susceptible species.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what efforts her Department is making to prevent the spread of bovine TB through cattle movement <i>(a)</i> in foot and mouth affected areas which have been restocked since 2001 and <i>(b)</i> other areas.  [108746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Newly formed cattle herds and premises restocked after a herd slaughter require, as a rule, one whole-herd TB test three to six months after restocking. To manage the increased risk of introducing TB through movements of infected cattle into re-formed herds, Defra has instigated a programme of frequent testing of premises restocked after the foot and mouth outbreak. In addition to the usual check test carried out three to six months post-restocking, those premises now require two further check tests at 12-month intervals before reverting to the normal testing interval for their parish.
<P>

<a name="30428w07.html_para9">Movements of cattle to and from herds with unknown disease status constitute a disease risk. Historically, herds with overdue TB tests have not automatically been put under movement restrictions. After the TB testing programme was suspended during the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, there was a backlog of 27,000 overdue tests at the end of December 2001. On 31 January 2002, after veterinary risk assessment, herds considered most at risk of infection were put under movement restrictions. On 1 February 2003, as part of the 'autumn package' of measures for the control of bovine TB, herds with tests

overdue by more than 12 months were put under movement restriction. From 1 April 2003, herds with tests overdue by more than six months were also placed under movement restriction. Herds with a TB test overdue by three months or more will be put under movement restriction from 30 September 2003.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Energy consumption is weather-corrected in the usual manner, using annual degree days relative to the 20-year average for 1990&#150;91. The figures are those reported on for the Central Government Estate campaign, and generally include each Department's main estate plus all agencies, but not NDPBs.<P>

2. Energy Expenditure: this is actual spend and, from April 2001, includes the climate change levy.<P>

3. Energy/m2: this variable allows for changes in both weather and estate size on energy consumption. So annual changes will generally reflect efficiency changes.<P>

4. Savings over 1997&#150;98: These have been expressed as percentage savings relative to the first year quoted here, and are based on the figures in the preceding column.<P>

5. Energy efficiency spend: Note that this is not necessarily a good measure of an effective energy efficiency policy. For example, when a new building is commissioned or an existing one refurbished, good design can actually reduce capital costs, e.g. by avoiding air conditioning. The costs of an effective energy management team may also not be included.<P>

 There is no information to indicate a specific threat to the agriculture or food industry in the UK, but if such a threat should arise then specific advice targeted to the nature of the threat will be provided. The Home Office terrorism website (www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism/index.html) currently contains general advice to the public and this will be updated and changed in accordance with the perceived threat.

<P>
<a name="30428w09.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Department is carrying out no specific research into methods of controlling Johne's disease. The former MAFF commissioned the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) to carry out a detailed review of surveillance and control options for Johne's disease in farm animals in Great Britain. The report was published in May 2001 and is available on the Defra website.
<P>

<a name="30428w09.html_para4">In view of the absence of an established link between Johne's disease in cattle and Crohn's disease in humans, the need for research on Johne's disease was considered against research needs in respect of other non-zoonotic endemic livestock diseases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w09.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Mycobacterium avium sub-species paratuberculosis has been known for many years to be the cause of Johne's disease. With regard to the relationship between Mycobacterium avium sub-species paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease experts differ in their opinion on such a link and worldwide there is no consensus. The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens has on two occasions (1992 and 1998) concluded that a link could not be established on current evidence. A similar view was reached by the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare.
<P>

<a name="30428w09.html_para5">The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food did however, recommend that, given differing views on possible links to human illness, which are unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future, the Food Standards Agency should convene an expert group of stakeholders to look at ways to prevent the bacterium from entering the food chain. Consistent with this recommendation Defra's research programme has been directed towards reducing the levels of MAP in milk and milk products.

<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The main forum for discussion of issues concerning the mutual recognition of marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products is the Veterinary Mutual Recognition Facilitation Group (VMRFG). This meets monthly (except in August) and is attended by my officials and those from the other member states and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). The UK was instrumental in establishing the VMRFG in April 1997. In addition, there are a number of other EU fora at which issues relating to veterinary medicines are discussed and at which issues relating to mutual recognition may be raised.

<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department carried out a Review of its five science-based agencies, including the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), in 2002. It was published on 17 December 2002. Copies of the report are available on: www.defra.gov.uk/agency review/index.asp
<P>

<a name="30428w11.html_para0">The Review explored a number of possible options on the organisational structure for VMD, including combining the Medicines Control Agency (now the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)) and VMD. Having taken account of the current assessment of business prospects, it concluded that there should be no organisational change for VMD. However, there should be a further reassessment of the option of a merger with MCA once the future role of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in the EU's approval procedures is known.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the cost to British industry of delays in the processing of authorisation applications by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.  [108904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 European legislation requires member states to process applications for new marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products within 210 "clock" days of the submission of a valid application. "Clock days" are calendar days, including weekends and holidays but excluding any period where further information is requested and awaited from the applicant. In addition to this legal requirement, annual performance targets are agreed for the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) which, together with details of how they have been met, are published in the VMD Annual Report and Accounts. The Annual Report for 2001&#150;02 illustrates that, during the period 1999 to 2002, the VMD met its target of determining 100 per cent. of valid applications for new UK marketing authorisations within 210 clock days in each successive year. Furthermore, during each of these years, the VMD has exceeded agreed performance targets of determining or referring to the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) valid applications for new marketing authorisations within 120 clock days, achieving outturns of 92.2 per cent., 95.9 per cent. and 94 per cent. respectively. For 2002&#150;03, the average time for determining or referring applications for new marketing authorisations to the VPC is 89.1 clock days. Applications are only referred to the VPC where the product is novel or where the VMD considers a marketing authorisation cannot be granted.

<a name="30428w11.html_para1">In the light of the VMD's performance in processing applications I do not consider an assessment of the cost to British industry of delays in the procedures to be

<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 41W</I><P>
disallowing alternative presentations of single products in the marketing authorisation of parent producers by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.  [108907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Veterinary Medicines Directorate ceased to accept applications to include alternative presentations in single marketing authorisations in April 1997. The decision to do so was made to bring UK procedures into line with those of the other member states and procedural guidance produced by the European Commission. It was considered that the practice of allowing alternative presentations on marketing authorisations was not compatible with European harmonised procedures and could be detrimental to holders of UK marketing authorisations who wished to apply to have them recognised in other member states under the mutual recognition procedures. It was further considered that facilitating easier access to the markets in other member states through the mutual recognition procedures would counterbalance any resulting additional costs to British industry.

<a name="30428w11.html_wqn5"><B> Andrew Bennett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many water companies have not yet reached the targets for leakage agreed at the Water Summit in 1997.  [109091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat set each water company annual leakage targets to progressively reduce leakage to its economic level by 2003. This is defined as the level at which the costs to make further reductions in leakage are greater than the costs of supplying additional water from its sources. Ofwat published details of companies' performance against their targets for 2001&#150;02 in the "Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water" report, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. Of the twenty-one companies set targets, two failed to progress in line with their annual target. Ofwat is monitoring the actions taken by these companies to recover their positions. Thames Water was subject to special measures rather than being set a volumetric target in 2001&#150;02, due to its unsatisfactory performance in managing leakage. Ofwat is taking a number of increased measures to ensure that Thames Water brings its leakage under control, including the recent setting of leakage targets for North London, South London and the area outside London. Water company performance against targets for 2002&#150;03 will be published in July this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with the Director General of OFWAT on changing the investment criteria for Thames Water to enable them to invest more in capital infrastructure to alleviate sewage flooding in rural areas.  [109144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has been working closely with the Office of Water Services to look at ways of tackling the serious problem of sewer flooding. Following a consultation on flooding from sewers last year, OFWAT announced that they would consider proposals from sewerage undertakers for additional schemes to alleviate the most serious problems in the period up to 2005. Thames Water has been given approval for significant additional investment before 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 42W</I><P>
2005. All sewerage companies are currently developing proposals for investment to deal with sewer flooding during 2005&#150;10.
<P>

<a name="30428w11.html_para3">In the Secretary of State's initial guidance on the Periodic Review of water price limits for 2005&#150;10, it was made clear that there should be closer attention to tackling sewer flooding in all areas. This should help to ensure that many more customers than at present benefit from sewer flooding schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what policy on <i>(a)</i> core hours and <i>(b)</i> flexible working hours is operated by her Department and each agency and non-departmental public body for which her Department is responsible.  [107609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w11.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra is committed to accommodating staff requests to work flexibly subject to the overriding needs of the Department. Flexible working hours are available to staff except where overriding business, operational or management requirements make this inappropriate. Most Defra staff are required to observe core hours (10&#150;12 am and 2&#150;4 pm) although pilot schemes are exploring how greater flexibility could be offered to staff without reducing operational efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30428w11.html_para4">The position in the Agencies for which Defra is responsible is similar, although the Rural Payments Agency has recently introduced new flexible working arrangements on the basis of daily bands of 7.30 am to 7.30 pm without core hours. Defra sponsors a number of other public sector bodies, including 20 executive NDPBs. Information is not held centrally on their working hours arrangements and could only be obtained as requested at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which Royal Navy vessel last carried out the duty of Gibraltar Guard Ship; and which warship is on station carrying out those duties.  [109158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Navy presence in Gibraltar is provided by The Gibraltar Squadron. The Squadron usually comprises two patrol vessels. This is appropriate 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 53W</I><P>
to the current assessment of requirements. Currently, on a temporary basis, there are four patrol craft in Gibraltar whilst the task is transferred to vessels reassigned from Northern Ireland. HMS Ranger and HMS Trumpeter are the outgoing patrol craft, HMS Scimitar and HMS Sabre are the incoming patrol craft. No frigate or destroyer is deployed as a Gibraltar Guard Ship.

<P>
<a name="30428w15.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what forms of Identification Friend or Foe equipment which distinguish between friendly and hostile ground forces have been evaluated by the Ministry of Defence; and whether he will introduce such a system.  [108851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) equipment contributes to our combat identification capability&#151;how we distinguish between friend, foe and neutrals in modern joint and coalition military operations. This capability is delivered through a combination of three elements: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (for example, the use of recognition devices on vehicles and the clear definition of areas of operation), Situational Awareness (knowledge of what is happening in the battlespace) and Target Identification (the ability to positively identify a target within the battlespace). IFF equipment particularly supports the latter. Distinguishing between friendly and hostile ground forces, whether from the ground or from the air, is generally recognised to be a significant challenge and, as in other environments, there is no single technical solution to the problem. We are seeking to update and improve our capability across all elements of combat identification and for target identification we will introduce in the second half of this decade the Battlefield Target Identification system and the Airborne System for Target Recognition, Identification and Designation.

The only legal actions in which International Military Services Ltd. (IMS) has been involved have been those relating to its arbitrations with Iran on the tank contracts and an infrastructure contract, and the consequential appeals. Different elements of the actions have been conducted under Dutch and English jurisdiction. IMS will be wound up when the appeals proceedings are complete. This may not be for four or five years.

 <i>[holding answer 7 April 2003]:</i> The information requested is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Service records do not give details of how individuals have acquired their language skills. Some personnel will have been trained in Arabic, for example at the Defence School of Languages; others, however, will have acquired their language skills by other means, such as from having lived in an Arabic-speaking country or from an Arabic-speaking parent. Determining how many Arabic speakers among our forces in the Gulf have received training in Arabic could only be done by seeking the information from the individuals concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All casualties suffered by our armed forces are a serious matter. It is especially tragic that British Servicemen have lost their lives in so-called "friendly fire" incidents. Sadly such casualties are a risk of warfare. The issue of Combat Identification is taken very seriously; we worked closely with the United States to ensure that effective arrangements were in place before the start of operations in Iraq. United Kingdom forces' Combat Identification capability is compatible and comparable with that of our US allies. Combat Identification is not delivered by a single system or piece of equipment, but by a combination of tactics and procedures backed up by technology. Regrettably, no system can be 100 per cent. fail-safe, but we remain confident that the capability with which we have provided our forces is as effective as possible, despite the recent tragic incidents.

 Embedded journalists with British forces in Iraq have been provided with a range of facilities, services and equipment in accordance with the instructions in the Green Book&#151;"Working Arrangements with the media in times of Emergency, Tension, Conflict or War". This has included documentation, military clothing, protective equipment, training, accommodation, food and military transport into, within and out of theatre.

 The United Kingdom is working to improve multi-national defence co-operation across a wide range of military capabilities through NATO's Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC), in co-ordination with the EU's European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP), which seeks to fill specific shortfalls against the Helsinki Headline Goal, and through our regular bilateral contacts.
<P>

<a name="30428w16.html_para4">The UK has been engaged in several ECAP panels including on medical co-ordination, outsized air transport, air-to-air refuelling, search and rescue and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. As part of our participation in a number of NATO capabilities initiatives we

currently hold observer status on air-to-air refuelling in the Prague Capabilities Commitment High Level Group.
<P>

<a name="30428w16.html_para5">In the area of medical co-ordination, we have worked with Finland to ensure that arrangements are in place to provide continuing medical support of Finnish forces deployed in the Balkans. On air manoeuvre, we have had close consultations with the Netherlands to establish common procedure on doctrine, training, sustainability and equipment for our respective Attack Helicopter forces. We have established permanent liaison with Germany to facilitate the exchange of information on tactical and operational developments. In 2001, we carried out combined air-to-air refuelling training with Finland and an Air Defence exercise is planned in June 2003. We have exchanged information with Italy on Search and Rescue and discussed Combat Search and Rescue. We co-operate with France in a wide range of capability areas and hold an annual summit, which prioritises those key areas of capability in which we wish to work more closely. The UK routinely conducts bilateral and multilateral training to varying degrees with a wide range of NATO and EU countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps the Government has taken to promote multinational defence co-operation <i>(a)</i> within NATO, <i>(b)</i> within the European defence dimension and <i>(c)</i> with other partners; and if he will make a statement.  [109354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government are actively promoting multinational defence co-operation within NATO, within the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and on a bilateral basis, primarily in order to enhance military capability. Within NATO, the Prague Capabilities Commitment aims to improve Alliance capabilities in CBRN defence; information superiority; combat effectiveness; and deployability and sustainability, and has directed Allies towards pursuing multinational solutions. Within the EU, the European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP) fosters co-operation between member states in order to fill specific capability shortfalls against the Helsinki Headline Goal. The work within NATO and the EU is closely co-ordinated and mutually reinforcing, and the United Kingdom plays an active role in both. The Government also promotes multinational defence co-operation through regular bilateral contacts with friends and allies. In particular, together with NATO, we are encouraging the seven countries invited to join the Alliance to participate in multinational defence co-operation activities with existing members.

 The European Multinational Maritime Force has now evolved into the European Maritime Initiative, bringing together a number of European Navies. As part of this initiative, we are developing a Generic European Maritime Concept of Operations for endorsement in Helsinki at the end of May 2003.

 On 17 April 2003 the British Embassy was officially informed, via a diplomatic note, of the Russian Naval Fleet deployment to the Indian Ocean. The international rules for the prevention of collisions at sea, the INCSEA agreement, form the basis for ensuring safety between units. INCSEA rules are embedded within Royal Navy standard operating procedures and these will be employed by the Royal Navy to ensure safe passage and to deconflict between units. Russian naval activity should in no way impede the Royal Navy's involvement in Operation Telic.

<P>

<P>

<a name="30428w17.html_para0">The Department will pursue the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) wherever it delivers the value for money quality services that we require. There are a number of projects that are likely to be signed within 2003 and others that are already signed that will commence service delivery. Information relating to projects in procurement is available on the Department's PFI database: http://www.mod.uk/business/PPP/database.html

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many PFI contracts his Department or its agencies <i>(a)</i> have with and <i>(b)</i> are being tendered for by (i) Amey plc and (ii) consortia involving Amey plc; what the total value is of those contracts; what the average length is of the contracts or proposed contracts; and what assessment his Department has made of the financial position of Amey plc and the implications for his Department.  [108332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Amey is involved with the signed PFI deal for the Main Building Redevelopment, which is a 30-year deal worth a total of &#163;746.1 million (net present value). The contract is with Modus Services plc. Amey provides services as a sub contractor to Modus. Responsibility for meeting the contract therefore rests with Modus who are ensuring that the Ministry of Defence's requirements are met.
<P>

<a name="30428w17.html_para1">Amey is also part of consortia on the short lists of bidders for the Allenby Connaught project (the redevelopment of the major garrisons in the Salisbury Plain area and Aldershot) and the C Vehicles project (earthmoving and specialist plant, engineer construction plant and materials handling equipment). The length of these contracts will be 30 and 15 years respectively, with a combined value in excess of &#163;2.4 billion (net present value).
<P>

<a name="30428w17.html_para2">The procurement process for PFI includes an assessment of the financial robustness of bids and in most cases, these involve more than one party, thereby adding to their financial strength. Furthermore, the Ministry of Defence makes an assessment of the financial capability of many companies before placing contracts with them. As a result of such an assessment, the Department may require financial indemnities or guarantees before awarding contracts. The results of such assessments are commercially sensitive and are being withheld in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. It would be inappropriate to comment on the financial position of particular companies, which is a matter for the shareholders concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research he has commissioned on the effectiveness of smart technology weapons which has factored in combat identification; and what the findings were.  [109222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 April 2003]:</i> Combat Identification capability contributes to military success by enabling commanders to distinguish rapidly and effectively between friend, foe and neutrals in complex modern military operations. This would normally happen before a decision was made to engage a target and the role of a weapon system would be to translate the decision into effect.
<P>

<a name="30428w17.html_para4">A key element of Combat Identification is Target Identification. Research on Target Identification relating to smart weapons systems is currently focused on the ability to distinguish, for example, between classes of vehicles&#151;such as whether a vehicle is tracked or wheeled.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w17.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In the Department full-time non-industrial civilian staff below the Senior Civil Service are conditioned to 42 hours gross, 37 hours net per week (41 hours gross and 36 hours net in London). Full time industrial staff are conditioned to 37 hours net per week (36 hours in London). Staff working a standard working week normally will attend for five days of the same duration.
<P>

<a name="30428w17.html_para5">It is the Department's policy to encourage civilian staff, at all levels, to adopt flexible working hours as part of our work life balance strategy. A variety of policies are in place to achieve this. In this context, the new statutory right for those with young children to request flexible working has been publicised. The responsibility for authorising these alternative working patterns has been delegated and records are not held centrally. As it will take time to collate the relevant information I will write to the hon. Member and place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.

Three families travelled during this period, and each family received the maximum &#163;2,500 grant. Current available records do not distinguish between returnees who had exceptional leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom and returnees who were awaiting either a decision or an appeal outcome following their asylum application.

Changes in financial recording systems from 2001 mean that it is no longer possible, without disproportionate cost, to separate the cost of Ministerial from non-Ministerial offices. Consequently this figure is not directly comparable with those provided in previous years, which did not include the cost of the offices of the Permanent Secretary, the Director General, Resources and Performance, Special Advisers, as well as the Typing Centre and the Ministerial Briefing Unit, which was largely created by bringing together existing staff in other Directorates.

 The ability of police forces to respond to a terrorist attack involving the use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) materials is being strengthened through the increased provision of specialist police training at the Police National CBRN Centre. Home Office funding is being made available to meet the full running and equipment costs involved to provide training for the first responders, senior commanders and specialist officers who would respond to a CBRN incident. This is in line with the Association of Chief Police Officers desired level of training to ensure that police forces nationally have the necessary resilience to deal with a CBRN incident. The total number CBRN trained officers to date is approximately 3,400 with 2,000 of these having been trained by the PNCBRNC since August 2002. In addition to the training being provided by the Police National CBRN Centre and in force training carried out by the Metropolitan Police Service and Sussex Police, some police forces have also undertaken local CBRN awareness seminars for all their staff.

 Information is not available in the form requested. A questionnaire completed in 2002&#150;03 estimated the cost of health care for that year at those prison establishments in England that are wholly or in part young offender institutions to be over &#163;34 million. Since it is commonly estimated that around half of the prison health care budget is spent on mental health services, this would indicate expenditure of around &#163;17 million at such establishments. For private prisons payments are made for the contracted service and the health care element is not separately identified. In addition, the Department of Health allocated &#163;419,000 in 2001&#150;02 and over &#163;1.5 million in 2002&#150;03 to NHS commissioners for mental health in-reach teams at prison establishments with young offenders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress his Department has made towards the aim in the White Paper, "Your Region, Your Choice", of assessing the balance of staff between the centre and the regions in terms of effective policy design and implementation; and what examples there have been since the publication of the White Paper of the Department deciding between locating new streams of work <i>(a)</i> in and <i>(b)</i> outside London and the south-east.

 The Home Office is committed to ensuring that it has the right balance between the centre and the regions to develop and deliver its aims. The Home Office has developed a substantial regional delivery capacity in Government offices, which are committed to delivering key Home Office Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets. In particular, Crime Reduction teams and Drug Prevention Advisory Service, and dedicated staff working to promote racial equality, community cohesion and active communities are an essential part of our delivery mechanism as well as contributing to policy development. Links between the centre and Government offices are being strengthened by the recruitment of four Crime Reduction Delivery Managers, working to enhance delivery of Home Office PSA targets on a regional and local basis.
<P>

<a name="30428w19.html_para5">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate already has a substantial regional presence, in particular with large offices in Liverpool and Sheffield. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is establishing 12 regional offices in order to strengthen links between NASS, local partnerships and the communities they serve. On 1 April 2003 the Security Industry Authority was established as an Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB) with headquarters in London, but it is planning a number of regional offices.
<P>

<a name="30428w19.html_para6">New work streams have been established outside London. The Criminal Records Bureau was established in Liverpool in 2001. The new Local Criminal Justice Boards will be supported by locally based Performance Officers who will be managed by seven Performance Advisers, mostly based outside London.
<P>

<a name="30428w19.html_para7">The Home Office will contribute to Sir Michael Lyons' review of departmental structures to examine the scope for relocating civil service and other public service staff from London and the south-east to other parts of the country, to improve cost effectiveness and achieve a better regional balance of Government activity.

<a name="30428w19.html_para9"><i>(b)</i> Posts within Home Office regional structures are advertised to all staff; posts within Government offices may be trawled within the Department.
<P>

<a name="30428w19.html_para10"><i>(c)</i> The Home Office has an active interchange programme that covers all sectors of the economy, public, private and voluntary. Interchange with Government Offices and the regions forms part of this programme, and we have recently established a number of short attachments for staff between Government Offices and the Home Office. In addition, a major scheme due to be launched shortly involves encouraging all staff to buddy up with staff in other organisations with whom they work, or who are affected by their work, including Government Offices and local authorities. It will enable staff in both organisations to learn more about one another, and about how they work together in delivering shared aims.

The new offences in the Bill tackle the movement of people into, within and out of the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and will carry maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment.

 The Home Office published its rape action plan in July 2002.

<P>

<a name="30428w20.html_para10">In addition, the Sexual Offences Bill includes a number of provisions designed to send a clear signal to everyone about the circumstances in which sexual activity will be presumed to be non-consensual. These are designed to give juries the best possible chance of reaching the right decision on what is one of the most difficult issues they can be asked to consider. We hope that this will encourage victims to place their faith in the criminal justice system and to bring more cases to trial.

 The Home Office helps victims of all types of crime, including women victims of sexual assault, through its annual funding of the voluntary organisation Victim Support. Since 1998&#150;99 the annual grant in aid to Victim Support has risen from &#163;12.7 million to &#163;30 million.
<P>

<a name="30428w20.html_para11">Each year since 1997&#150;98 Victim Support has received between 13,000 and 15,000 referrals for victims of sexual crimes, of whom between 4,000 and 5,000 have been victims of rape. The help offered is both sensitive and confidential, and can include onward referral to other types of support (such as counselling).
<P>

<a name="30428w20.html_para12">Since April 2001 the Home Office has also been funding the Rape Crisis Federation to enable that organisation to provide core services such as training to its network of some 40 local rape crisis groups.

 If a person moves from Great Britain before qualifying for a winter fuel payment, he or she will not be able to receive payments while living in other EEA countries.

As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has made clear, the priority for the Criminal Records Bureau is to ensure that the demand for Standard and Enhanced Disclosures is fully met.

Consequently, if alcohol is an ingredient, this will be on the label of the product. However, alcohol may also be used as a solvent for some flavouring. In this case, it will be present in the final food at low levels. Alcohol may be inadvertently present, for example, due to the fermentation which occurs when fruit juice is opened and stored.

In response to concerns about illegal imports of bushmeat and other foods, the FSA has, since February, been drawing up a work programme to take forward a step change in the delivery and co-ordination of local authority enforcement of imported food controls at seaports, airports and at 'inland' UK local authorities.

<a name="30428w25.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We welcome the latest report of the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy (CESDI). It is not usual Government practice to publish a formal response to reports of confidential inquiries but we examine the findings of all reports very carefully and take action as appropriate. We note particularly that the report published on 24 March underlines the significant improvements that have taken place in care leading to twice as many premature babies being saved than was the case 15 years ago. CESDI rightly pays tribute to the work and dedication of the antenatal and neonatal intensive care staff who continue to improve outcomes for these smallest and most vulnerable of babies.
<P>

<a name="30428w25.html_para0">However, it is right that efforts continue to improve the level of care further in this area. Clinical guidelines have now been issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the use of electronic fetal monitoring, the induction of labour and the routine use of Anti-D prophylaxis for rhesus negative pregnant women. Additional guidelines are due to be published later this year on antenatal care, including antenatal screening, and the use of caesarean section. We have recently commissioned NICE to develop further guidelines on intrapartum care (delivery), and postnatal care. NICE'S work will enhance and support the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, which will set national standards of care for antenatal, intrapartum and post natal services.
<P>

<a name="30428w25.html_para1">CESDI advises the introduction of national standards to ensure appropriate referral and transfer arrangements in neonatal intensive care. The Department established an expert working group to advise on the most effective ways of caring for very sick and premature newborn babies and the delivery of these services. The group's conclusions were published on 10 April 2003 for wider consultation and are available on www.doh.gov.uk/nsf/neonatal.htm. In order to help implement the outcome of the review and consultation, we are making available &#163;20 million capital funding this year, and additional revenue funding of &#163;12 million this year, &#163;19.8 million next year, increasing to &#163;20 million in 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30428w25.html_para2">We have also established the National Patient Safety Agency to improve the safety of national health service patient care, by promoting an open and fair culture and by introducing a national reporting and learning system for adverse events, including those involving mothers and their babies. The system will be rolled out across the NHS from summer 2003. Using data from the reporting system and other sources, the Agency will identify priorities to address areas of known risk to patients and develop solutions to prevent errors being repeated. The Agency plans to develop a patient safety programme in obstetrics and gynaecology and is in the process of appointing a specialist clinical adviser, jointly with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, to develop this work.
<P>

<a name="30428w25.html_para3">The CESDI report pointed to a shortfall in specialist pathology services. We fully accept that specialist paediatric pathologists are best placed to perform all post mortem examinations on preterm infants, where resources allow&#151;and we are very aware of the challenges facing NHS pathology services, including 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 91W</I><P>
specific subspecialties such as paediatric pathology. There is no quick and easy solution: it takes time to train new doctors and for them to gain the relevant experience. However, the Department is committed to addressing these staffing difficulties and is taking action to increase the number of pathologists overall, to fund specific projects to support paediatric pathology in the short-term, including funding Conversion Fellowships in paediatric pathology, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many NHS patients were treated in hospitals outside the United Kingdom but within the EU in <i>(a)</i> 2001 and <i>(b)</i> 2002, for (i) hip joint replacements, (ii) knee joint replacements, (iii) coronary artery bypass grafts and (iv) cardiac surgical procedures.

 No patients were treated abroad in 2001. In 2002, 191 patients were referred abroad for orthopaedic procedures, mainly major joint replacements. Overseas referrals for cardiac procedures will commence in 2003.

 In being ready to receive casualties from the Gulf our approach has been to give the national health service maximum local freedom to respond to the needs of those who return. While it is not the intention to bring prisoners of war back to this country, the NHS would be able to cope if the need arose. Which hospital would be involved would depend on local operational circumstances at the time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the consultants who have been employed on the franchising of Royal United Hospital, Bath and Bristol Royal Infirmary (RUH and BRI) what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> official and <i>(b)</i> managerial man hours spent on the proposed franchising of RUH and BRI; what the latest estimate is of the cost to public funds of the proposed franchising of RUH and BRI; and if he will make a statement on the future of the Royal United Hospital, Bath.  [108538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w26.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Work on franchising at the Royal United Hospitals Bath national health service trust and United Bristol Teaching Hospital NHS trust has been progressing over the last three months. This work has been informed by specialist legal and financial advice commissioned by Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Strategic Health Authority (SHA) at an expected cost of approximately &#163;119,000.
<P>

<a name="30428w26.html_para0">It has become clear that the issues facing the local health community require a system wide approach, rather than looking for solutions within individual NHS organisations. The SHA has concluded that given the scale of the problems&#151;and the management action required to achieve recovery&#151;the SHA will be taking a much more direct role in the overall management of the two trusts than would normally be the case. This decision was based in part on the work carried out over the last three months.
<P>

<a name="30428w26.html_para1">Management time is not recorded by task undertaken and it is therefore not possible to differentiate the amount of time allocated to this task in the SHA.

 Advice is issued to the public via travel and web based information.

<P>
<a name="30428w26.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) is one of 11 laboratories in nine countries working together to investigate the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Two different viruses have been identified in a number of laboratories within the network in cases of SARS: corona viruses and metapneumoviruses. The discovery of these viruses in association with SARS enables work to be developed on tests which detect the presence of these viruses in patients. CPHL are involved in developing and preparing diagnostic tests for both viruses.

 There have been several meetings involving the Department, the Patient & Relatives Group (PARG), the Surrey Learning Disability Partnership Board, the relevant health authority (HAs) and trusts to discuss the future of St. Ebba's Hospital.
<P>

<a name="30428w26.html_para2">PARG were asked to produce a preliminary feasibility study to reflect the number of residents that a village community could meet, the range of facilities required and the financial robustness of the proposal.

 Information about patients treated for strokes by individual hospitals and their survival rates is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="30428w26.html_para4">The national service framework (NSF) for older people, published in March 2001, requires all general hospitals that care for people with stroke to have by April 2004, a specialised stroke service, as described in the NSF stroke service model.
<P>

<a name="30428w26.html_para5">Implementation of specialist stroke services is required in "Improvement, Expansion and Reform, the Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&#150;6." This makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority, and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.

<P>
<a name="30428w27.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 April 2003]:</i> EU Directive (83/129/EEC) prohibits imports of skins from seal pups and breeding mothers of certain species of seal. By protecting these sections of the seal population, the ban aims to protect overall numbers. The EU, with the strong support of the UK, continues to press for animal welfare concerns to be recognised as legitimate grounds for taking trade measures under WTO rules.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans she has to prevent the early shredding of <i>(a)</i> audit records and <i>(b)</i> bank reconciliations by auditors and to require audit records to be kept to facilitate investigation of audit failure; and if she will make a statement.  [109159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w27.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The keeping of audit records is covered by regulation 3.08b of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW) Audit Regulations 1995 (as amended in 1999). This regulation says that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a registered auditor must keep all audit working papers which auditing standards require for an audit for a period of at least 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 100W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>six years. The period starts with the end of the accounting period to which the papers relate."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30428w27.html_para15">The relevant auditing standards are SAS 230 which details the content of audit working papers, and others such as SAS 200 (on planning) which detail other documentation that needs to be created during the course of an audit. Early shredding of any relevant audit papers, including audit records and bank reconciliations where these form part of the audit working papers, is therefore contrary to regulations. While these are not statutory regulations, compliance with them is indirectly a statutory requirement; the Companies Act 1989 requires audit firms to be registered with a Recognised Supervisory Body such as the ICAEW and to subject themselves to their rules including inspection and enforcement of compliance.

<P>

<a name="30428w27.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The majority of accountancy bodies and other representative bodies that responded to the Government's consultation document on the review of the regulatory regime of the accountancy profession considered that there was a strong case for the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) taking on the functions of the Accountancy Foundation.

<a name="30428w27.html_para16">On 29 January 2003 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced that she had accepted the conclusions of the Review team, the main conclusion of which was that the FRC should take on the functions of the Accountancy Foundation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on claims by surface workers exposed to coal dust for compensation for respiratory disease resulting from their work in the coal mining industry.  [108598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department has been in discussion with the Claimants' Solicitors' Group (CG) for some time over the issue of surface dust. The Department does not believe that the level of respirable dust on the surface was sufficient to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This position is consistent with its expert medical advice, which is based on surface dust levels recorded by the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM). The CG were unable to accept this position, and in order to move matters forward, the Department agreed to engage in a joint study of the effects of surface dust, which would then be analysed by the parties' respective medical experts. The Department and the CG met with their medical experts in December 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 102W</I><P>
2002 to discuss the evidence produced by the joint study. The Department agreed to review further documents produced by the CG at that meeting and give its final position by the end of February 2003.
<P>

<a name="30428w28.html_para2">Having considered the results of the study and the additional information produced by the CG, the Department's medical adviser has not altered his opinion that there was insufficient respirable dust to cause COPD to surface only workers. Accordingly, the Department wrote to the CG on 28 February 2003 to inform them that it maintains its original position. Surface workers are not therefore admitted under the Claims Handling Agreement for COPD.
<P>

<a name="30428w28.html_para3">However, claimants can pursue a claim for compensation in relation to surface employment under common law if they wish.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what impact the establishment of IRISC offices in Cardiff has had on the processing of compensation claims in Wales.  [108672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 IRISC Cardiff has been instrumental to the Department in achieving its target of making 15,000 respiratory disease offers to Welsh claimants during 2002. Since the office began processing claims in July 2001 some 43,000 respiratory disease claims have been received from Welsh claimants. As of 23 March 2003, over 16,000 interim payments have been made and some 17,000 claims settled, totalling over &#163;205 million. In addition, IRISC has received some 21,000 Vibration White Finger (VWF) claims from Welsh claimants. Some 7,300 interim payments have been made and 9,000 claims settled, totalling over &#163;85 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether a claimant for compensation for vibration white finger or chest disease resulting from mine-working is entitled to interest accrued or other compensation if a cheque for payment is not forwarded promptly by the solicitor representing the claimant.  [108673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department is only liable to pay interest for any delay in the payment of compensation up to the point that the damages payment is issued. Payment of interest resulting from any delay caused by the solicitors in forwarding those damages is a matter for the claimant and their legal representative. Under the solicitors Accounts Rules and dependent on the amount and the time payment for damages has been withheld from the claimant, the claimant's solicitor may be liable for payment of interest.

 Once payment is forwarded to the claimant's solicitors the Department has no means by which they can monitor the 300 or more firms of solicitors as to the time taken by them to forward payment on to their clients. However, I have expressed concern about the delays which occur in some cases and have emphasised the importance of effective communication between solicitors and clients at this stage in the process.

 Coal fired power stations are currently regulated by the Integrated Pollution Control ("IPC") regime. IPC was established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and regulates industrial pollution through a system of authorisation. IPC is being superseded by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control ("IPPC") regime, established by an EC Directive of the same name. Installations that came into operation before 31 October 1999 will be regulated by IPPC from 2006. New installations or those undergoing substantial change will be required to apply for an IPPC permit with immediate effect.

<a name="30428w29.html_para5">IPC requires operators to demonstrate that they will use the Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost ("BATNEEC") for their activities. BATNEEC have to be applied to prevent or minimise the release of prescribed substances and to render harmless any such substances which are released to air, water and land. If releases are made to more than one environmental medium, the Best Practicable Environmental Option is applied. The regulator assesses BATNEEC on a site by site basis and keeps authorisations under review. Depending on the characteristics of the plant, BATNEEC may include the use of flue gas desulphurisation.

 <i>[holding answer 14 April 2003]:</i> The 2000 Spending Review introduced Phase 1 of Resource Budgeting, which became the sole method of reporting and control for departments' budgets with effect from 1 April 2001. Prior to that, accounts and budgets were controlled on a cash basis. In preparation for the 2000 Spending Review the Treasury asked departments to restate baselines on the basis of the phase 1 resource budgeting rules. In addition the Treasury required 2000&#150;01 expenditure outturn to be reported on both a cash and a resource basis. Accordingly, the three Councils reported provisional 2000&#150;01 outturns in May 2001 and later reported audited figures, which the Department in turn reported in May 2002 to the Treasury as required.
<P>

<a name="30428w30.html_para2">As part of this process, the MRC raised questions with the Department in January 2002 about the classification of its End of Year Flexibility at the transition to Phase 1 of Resource Budgeting. These were satisfactorily resolved. The BBSRC also raised questions and these were satisfactorily resolved in July 2002. In the last quarter of 2001&#150;02 NERC informed the Department that the Council was experiencing difficulties associated with the assessment of End of Year Flexibility on a resource basis, which were resolved.

<a name="30428w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. This reported that 185 tonnes of opium was produced in 2001 and 3,400 tonnes in 2002.
<P>

<a name="30428w31.html_para0">The UNODC is in the process of carrying out the 2003 survey. Its results will be published in the autumn. The 2004 survey is likely to start at the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="30428w31.html_para1">In March 2003 the UNODC published an Opium Rapid Assessment Survey for Afghanistan. This gave an early insight into the pattern of opium poppy cultivation for the 2002&#150;03 growing season, but did not predict the level of opium production for 2003 or beyond.
<P>

<a name="30428w31.html_para2">The 2002 increase was no surprise. The Taliban's cultivation ban in 2001 was driven by short-term motives and inherently unsustainable. It was imposed with bribery and threats, including in some cases, death. It also did not cover trafficking, processing or stockpiling. Indeed the Taliban's profits from these activities grew as, after two bumper harvests, the ban drove up opium prices. Sustained reductions in cultivation will only follow from a long-term process to build up Afghan drug law enforcement and encourage alternative livelihoods for farmers.

 All applications are decided on their merits and in accordance with the Immigration Rules. Globally the monthly refusal rate in 2002 follows a similar pattern to the monthly refusal rate in 2001. The fee for family visitor appeals was abolished on 15 May 2002 but there is no evidence that ECO decision making has been influenced by the abolition of the fee. Work is now in hand on the final report of the interdepartmental review of family visitor appeals, which we expect to publish in June.

 We remain seriously concerned at the continuing unstable stand-off between India and Pakistan. The reductions in military deployments by both sides in late 2002 were welcome. But these were not unfortunately followed by further de-escalatory moves or movement towards the resumption of political engagement.
<P>

<a name="30428w32.html_para6">We face a significant risk of a renewed crisis between India and Pakistan over the coming months. It is in neither side's interests to provoke or initiate a military conflict that could escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. Pakistan should fulfil its commitments to stop infiltration across the Line of Control and discourage any acts of violence by militants in Kashmir. Both sides should consider immediately implementing a cease-fire and take other active steps to reduce tension. The United Kingdom stands ready to help both countries start a process aimed at building confidence, normalising bilateral relations and resolving outstanding differences, including Kashmir. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made these points clearly in his joint statement with US Secretary Powell at Camp David on 27 March.

<a name="30428w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We welcomed President Musharraf s decision to restore the joint electoral system for the 2002 elections. It is a step towards integrating Christian and other religious minorities into mainstream Pakistani society. We are actively funding projects to support National Assembly members in their parliamentary work to protect Human Rights in Pakistan.

 We do not have figures for the number of Palestinians detained by the Israelis since 27 March. But a reputable Palestinian human rights non-governmental organisation, Mandela Institute for Human Rights (www.mandela-palestine.org) has reported that as of 31 March around 5,759 Palestinians and Arabs had been detained since the start of the second intifada. This includes over 1,000 in administrative detention.

 Our Honorary Consul spoke with the Spanish court on 9 September 2002, and was informed that, except for certain items relevant to the investigation, the court agreed to release all of Force 9 Salvage's equipment. Our Honorary Consul spoke to the presiding judge again on 11 April 2003. The judge confirmed that the investigation was ongoing but would not release further information about the case. Our consular staff cannot intervene in the judicial system of another country. Our own judicial system is similarly protected. Our consular team in Spain will continue to monitor this case, but as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary noted in his letter of 20 November 2002, this is a legal matter and the company should continue to be guided by its lawyer.

 The UK Government agree with the assessment published on 21 March 2003 by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of Russia's implementation of the Convention. The Committee welcomed positive steps taken by the Russian Federation to improve the legislative framework and adopt other positive measures to combat discrimination. The Committee also noted a number of concerns, including: the absence of a definition of racial discrimination in domestic legislation; reports of racially selective inspections by law-enforcement officials, particularly against those from the North Caucasus; and reports of violence by, inter-alia, extremist groups against ethnic minorities.

Our expenditure for publicity, which includes advertising, publications, events, shows and direct information literature mailings in financial year 2002&#150;03 is estimated to be &#163;6.0 million. This includes communication on a very wide range of matters, much of it necessary or beneficial to the public and to the wide range of industries in which Defra has an interest, together with local government, voluntary organisations and other bodies.

 Defra seeks to reach as wide a range of applicants for its public bodies as possible. This includes advertising its public appointments vacancies in the national press and in trade or technical publications, if appropriate. Advertisements for regional bodies are also placed in the regional press. In addition the Department puts all public appointment vacancies on the Defra website at www.defra.qov.uk/corporate/appointments and on the Cabinet Office's new vacancies website at www.publicappts-vacs.gov.uk

 My Department has been committed to eliminating, and has a published Equal Opportunities Policy forbidding, discrimination on grounds of age for many years.

The implications of the EU Framework Directive on Equal Treatment will be kept under active review. Those implications are likely to centre mainly on the question of mandatory retirement ages. Within the last year DFID has implemented the recommendations of "Winning the Generation Game" and now allows staff below the Senior Civil Service to serve on to age 65.

<a name="30428w39.html_para3">Since August 2002 the EC has committed &#163;16.3 million for humanitarian work in Eritrea. A consignment of 24,000 metric tonnes of wheat for free distribution is being delivered to the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC). In addition the Commission's Humanitarian Office (ECHO) are expected to contribute a further &#163;1 million. DFID funds about 19 per cent of EC programmes.

 For medicines there is a range of innovative public options that can be employed. These were explored through a working group on Access to Medicines which was published in November 2002. DFID investment in public/private partnerships for research and development for medicines is of the order of &#163;21.5 million which includes the Medicines for Malaria Venture and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. In addition, the Chancellor has introduced new tax credits to promote research and development into diseases that predominantly affect people living in developing countries.

 The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) manages service families accommodation (SFA) in Great Britain and since its formation in 1995 has made significant progress in improving the general standard of service housing. About half of the long term core housing stock is now at Standard 1 for Condition (SlfC). The upgrade programme will continue with demanding targets set for the DHE each year, against the services' long term requirements for family housing. As a result many service families will move into better accommodation than they have experienced previously.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30428w43.html_para5">The reliability of average earnings estimates can be gauged by looking at the coefficient of variation for that estimate. That is the standard error of the average, expressed as a percentage of the average. The smaller the coefficient of variation, the better the estimate. For the areas stated above the average weekly wage and coefficient of variation are as follows:

<a name="30428w43.html_para7">The difference between the above figure for the Hereford and Worcester ACA area and that given on 16 December 2002, reflects the fact that unitary authorities are excluded from the published estimates of New Earnings Survey average wages in county areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w44.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The UK government recognises that foreign direct investment (FDI) is important for developing countries. It establishes long-term commitments and lasting assets, which bring new technologies, skills and products into developing countries. The UK Government has made an assessment that a basic framework of multilateral rules on FDI will reinforce sound domestic policies to attract FDI. Such a framework would help developing countries send a positive signal to potential foreign investors about the permanence of policy changes and the expected standard of treatment afforded to foreign investors.
<P>

<a name="30428w44.html_para2">Existing multilateral rules only partially cover FDI issues, and the proliferation of bilateral investment treaties does not provide a substitute for a coherent, basic framework of multilateral rules. Moreover, the UK government believes that the proposed agreement will have particular benefits for smaller developing countries which do not have the resources to negotiate numerous bilateral treaties or devise and implement an investment regime independently. We believe that the EU proposal under which WTO members would choose which sectors they wish to open up to FDI, offers a balanced and flexible approach, preserving countries' right to regulate in order to pursue national development objectives.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). A consistent series for assets and savings is available from 1997&#150;98. 2001&#150;02 is the latest year for which data is available.<P>

2. Adults include all those aged 16 and over, except for 16 to 18-year-olds in full-time non-advanced education; all adults in the household are interviewed as part of the FRS.<P>

3. Figures for investment income are particularly problematic. Questions on assets are a sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have relatively low level of response, and hence higher levels of imputation, compared to other parts of the survey. Responses are imputed in around one in 10 cases.<P>

4. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure type, council tax band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.<P>

5. The final column of the table shows the percentage of adults reporting one or more of the categories: stocks and shares, unit trusts, TESSAs, PEPs and ISAs. Note that not all ISAs, PEPs, unit trusts and TESSAs will be share based.<P>

<P>
<a name="30428w47.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) how many of the unsuccessful alpha plus rated research grant applications to the Medical Research Council could have been awarded if an additional &#163;8.1 million of funds were available;  [107422]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the definition of commercial exploitation is in the accounts of the Medical Research Council; and for what reason the level of commercial exploitation in the MRC account has increased by 40 per cent.  [107421]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w47.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The term "commercial exploitation" is used to cover all the activities concerning the exploitation of the intellectual property generated from research within the Medical Research Council's own institutes and units. It therefore covers the income received from licensing MRC's intellectual property and also any payments made in relation to these activities. The majority of expenditure reported in their accounts is covered under items 1 and 2 as follows and arises as a direct consequence of the revenues generated by MRC inventions, and received by the MRC, in the previous financial year. The main items of expenditure are:
<P>

<a name="30428w47.html_para2">1. Payments to the budgets of "originating" MRC units and inventors under the "awards to inventors" scheme&#151;a scheme similar in scope to those operated by most UK Universities and designed to provide incentives for MRC units and staff to assist in the identification, protection and exploitation of inventions.
<P>

<a name="30428w47.html_para3">2. Payments of revenue shares to external bodies who have licensed rights to the MRC in return for share of income.




<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 180W</I><P>
3. The management fee paid to MRC Technology (the company affiliated to the MRC which manages MRC intellectual property).
<P>

<a name="30428w47.html_para4">4. Fees for patents and legal costs relating to MRC inventions.
<P>

<a name="30428w47.html_para5">Overall, the MRC's exploitation activities are a net contributor to MRC funding in universities and MRC units.
<P>

<a name="30428w47.html_para6">In 2001&#150;02 there was a 40 per cent. increase in expenditure on commercial exploitation due to exceptional payments under MRC's revenue sharing schemes. This reflects, in part, the exceptionally high income in 2000&#150;01 resulting from the sale of part of MRC's shareholding in Cambridge Antibody Technology.
<P>

<a name="30428w47.html_para7">It is difficult to put a figure on the number of grants that could have been funded had an additional &#163;8.1 million been available as grant applications vary considerably in length, cost per year and total cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the costs of establishing the new headquarters of One NorthEast at Newburn Riverside were; and what estimate she has made of the annual running costs of the building.  [108695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w47.html_spnew10"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry gave One NorthEast approval to proceed with the construction of new headquarters following the submission of a detailed business case and the completion of a thorough and rigorous value for money appraisal by the Department. The net cost of the move amounted to &#163;3.3 million. The cost of constructing and fitting out the new building amounted to &#163;9 million, but this was offset by capital receipts of &#163;3 million and &#163;2.7 million respectively from the sale of the Agency's buildings at Great North House, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and St. George's House, Gateshead. The Agency also surrendered its lease of premises at Hadrian House Newcastle and, as a consequence, was able to achieve savings of &#163;50,000 per annum relative to those premises. The new Headquarters uses solar water heating and recycles roof water and this has allowed the Agency to achieve a Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) 'Excellent' rating. A cost <i>v.</i> savings analysis completed by the Agency has 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 183W</I><P>
shown that the Agency's capital investment in the new building will pay for itself within six years. Annual running costs of the building are currently estimated to be &#163;881,500 (less than 0.5 per cent. of total operating income), which is a significant saving against the operating costs of the three office premises in Newcastle and Gateshead, formerly owned or occupied by the Agency. The co-location of the Agency's core staff of more than 250 personnel in one building was not solely motivated by the clearly demonstrable financial benefits of doing so, but also by the desire to provide improved levels of customer service, and the benefits in terms of improved communication, both internal and external, by having key staff in one building.

 The rural network benefits from investment in the network generally.

 We have no plans for day one entry to New Deal 50 plus. New Deal programmes are aimed at those most in need of help to find sustainable employment and move from welfare to work.

The proposals include a package of more intensive back to work help for people aged 50 and over including extending the support available through New Deal 50 Plus so that individually tailored help for each customer can be drawn from a range of possible options.

<a name="30428w50.html_para9">We recognise that the majority of pensioners are women, and are committed to ensuring that our pension reforms improve women's pension rights.
<P>

<a name="30428w50.html_para10">Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) was introduced in 1978 to assist people, especially women, who were precluded from work for periods by caring responsibilities, to maintain their entitlement to basic state pension. The state second pension introduced in April 2002 is of particular benefit to women, many of whom work part-time or as carers.
<P>

<a name="30428w50.html_para11">We have announced that HRP will be extended to foster carers for each full tax year for which they are registered as an approved foster carer. This means that they will be covered for periods when they are awaiting a placement and will benefit emergency foster carers who are ready to take in a child at any time. It is expected that around 7,000 to 8,000 foster carers will benefit from this each year.
<P>

<a name="30428w50.html_para12">In addition to changes to state pension, we have made other changes that will be of particular help to women. We introduced the winter fuel payment which is worth &#163;200 per household and the minimum income guarantee which this year is &#163;102.10 a week for a single pensioner and &#163;155.80 for a couple. From October 2003, the new pension credit will benefit lower income pensioners further still. Two thirds of people receiving pension credit will be women, half of whom will be aged 80 or over. Also, in the 2003 Budget we announced that an extra &#163;100 will be paid to households with someone aged 80 or over for the lifetime of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30428w50.html_para13">In April 2001, stakeholder pensions were introduced as part of the long-term reforms to ensure that everyone has the chance to save for a decent income in retirement.
<P>

<a name="30428w50.html_para14">So far, a series of leaflets have been produced to inform the public of the pension options open to them. One of these&#151;"Pensions for Women"&#151;outlines the pension options available specifically for women. Also in the recent Green Paper "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement" we have said that we propose to look at how best to ensure that women are aware of their pension position and the choices they make.

<a name="30428w51.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Through the on-going development of the Community Legal Service, the Legal Services Commission has introduced initiatives to improve access to specialist advice in civil matters for the socially excluded, including a number aimed at those who live in areas where there may be a shortage of contracted suppliers. The initiatives include telephone advice pilots in categories such as debt, employment, housing and welfare benefits, as well as outreach contracts through which law firms and other service providers deliver advice sessions at a range of venues such as community centres and GP surgeries.

 My Department has not formally consulted on the issue of a statutory duty either compelling local authority participation in Community Legal Service (CLS) Partnerships, or compelling the inclusion of CLS coverage in local authority strategic plans. From the outset of the CLS, local authorities have demonstrated a willingness to participate actively in the emerging CLS Partnerships. Their participation is regarded as central to the success of each CLS Partnership. These now involve over four hundred local authorities and cover over 99 per cent. of the population of England and Wales. The introduction of a Best Value Performance Indicator measuring the percentage of local authority expenditure on CLS quality marked services has provided an incentive for local authorities to include the CLS as part of their own strategic plans.

 Immigration officers take a range of factors into account when assessing whether or not an individual or family is likely to comply with the terms of temporary admission or release.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w54.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government are very grateful to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) who sponsored Sussex Police to pilot this scheme. Fortunately, there has not been a case of child abduction in Sussex to test the system, but a number of different forces across the country are now interested in implementing child rescue schemes of their own.
<P>

<a name="30428w54.html_para0">The ACPO Homicide Working Group has now agreed that it should be a locally delivered service with national standards and guidelines, and it will be implemented as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w54.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many animals were used for experiments in 2002; and what plans he has to reduce that number.  [108630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w54.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The latest relevant figures are published in "Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals in Great Britain 2001", Cm 5581. A copy has been placed in the Library. These show that in 2001 the number of animals used for the first time in scientific procedures was 2.57 million. This is a reduction on the previous year, and the number of procedures concerned is the lowest since the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 came into force.
<P>

<a name="30428w54.html_para1">Corresponding data for 2002 are currently being collated and analysed, with publication planned for later this year.
<P>

<a name="30428w54.html_para2">Under the 1986 Act the Home Office licenses the use of animals for scientific purposes where there is no non-animal alternative, and then only when both the number of animals and their suffering is minimised. This reflects the principles of the 3Rs&#151;replacement, reduction and refinement.




<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 2003 : Column 206W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30428w54.html_para3">As the regulator of the use of live animals in scientific procedures the Home Office is demand-led&#151;it has no control over the number of project licence applications which it receives. While we must seek to minimise the number of animals used in particular programmes of work, the Home Office cannot therefore influence the overall amount of animal research and testing which takes place&#151;that is determined by many other factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour. There are current developments&#151;such as advances in the use that can be made of genetically modified animals&#151;which may lead in coming years to more rather than fewer animals being used overall.
<P>

<a name="30428w54.html_para4">The Government fully support and encourage development and promotion of the 3Rs in a number of ways, and additional impetus has been given to its efforts to that end by the related recommendations recently put forward by the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures. This is not, however, an area where quick gains can be expected. In the longer term we must rely for any further significant reduction in animal use largely on the scientific community's own continuing efforts to develop, validate and accept non-animal alternative methods.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his Written Statement of 20 January, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1&#150;2WS, on Animals (Scientific Procedures), when he expects to conclude his Department's consultations with the scientific community with a view to reaching a final decision on possible amendments to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.  [108811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w54.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government's response to the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on animals in scientific procedures, published on 20 January 2003 (Cm 5729), announced plans to publish details of programmes of work authorised under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, subject to safeguards for personal and confidential information and also acknowledged the significant concern within the scientific community about the possible repeal of section 24 of the 1986 Act, the "confidentiality clause". We, therefore, also announced our intention to consult further with scientific stakeholders and animal protection groups about section 24 before reaching final decisions on its future.
<P>

<a name="30428w54.html_para5">As part of this consultation, a joint working group with scientific stakeholders has been set up to look at these issues and met for the first time on 5 March 2003. Separate discussions will be held with animal protection groups. I expect to receive the findings of these discussions in the autumn and to consider the options for the future of section 24 later in the year.

Cost benefit analysis was not part of the review process; rather, all bids to the fund were reviewed by an international panel of experts on the basis of scientific excellence. The Cambridge neuroscience project was judged to be one of the best in the biosciences field.

The care and welfare of animals is closely regulated by this Act and Centres are routinely inspected to ensure that animals are treated humanely. This combination of

Primates are an essential part of the work, as much of what we understand about the human brain derives from primate research. The exact nature of the research will depend on what type of research grants are obtained, but is likely to include non-invasive forms of brain imaging and behavioural testing of functions such as memory.

 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="30428w55.html_para5">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Buckingham. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drugs. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).
<P>

<a name="30428w55.html_para6">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.
<P>

<a name="30428w55.html_para7">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.

 The figures for distraction burglaries received from police forces do not distinguish between suspected and other cases. Nor is it possible to provide a breakdown by whether the burglary was successful or an attempt.
<P>

<a name="30428w55.html_para8">In the British Crime Survey, burglaries where entry was gained by false pretences are split between "with entry" and "attempts". The most recent results can be found in table 3a in "Crime in England and Wales 2001&#150;02. Supplementary Volume", which was published in January 2003. This reports that there were 426,000 attempted burglaries and 565,000 burglaries with entry, of which 10 per cent. and four per cent. respectively involved the offender using false pretences to gain, or try to gain entry.

 Between 1 October 2000 when the order was first rolled out to all courts in England and Wales and 28 February 2003 (which is the latest month for which figures are available) 303 Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) were made in Derbyshire.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what plans he has to ensure effective treatment for offenders whose crimes are drug-related.  [109296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w56.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Research shows that appropriate treatment can reduce both drug use and offending. To get more offenders into treatment, the Government is developing a range of interventions at every appropriate stage in the criminal justice system, which provides opportunities to identify and engage with drug misusing offenders and helps them gain access to appropriate treatment.
<P>

<a name="30428w56.html_para0">This programme will build on and expand existing interventions such as the Drug Treatment Testing Order (DTTO), a community sentence which has been available to courts in England and Wales since October 2000 following successful piloting in three areas, and arrest referral schemes. It will also introduce drug testing, initially into the 30 Basic Command Units (BCUs) with the highest levels of acquisitive crime, and develop throughcare and aftercare arrangements aimed at case managing offenders.
<P>

<a name="30428w56.html_para1">At the same time, we are expanding our treatment provision to make it more accessible to all that need it, when they need it, which is essential to the success of the Government's National Drug Strategy as a whole. The

<P>

<a name="30428w56.html_para2">The main treatment target is to increase the participation of problem drug users in drug treatment programmes by 55 per cent. by 2004 and by 100 per cent. by 2008, and to increase the proportion of users successfully sustaining or completing treatment programmes year on year.

<a name="30428w56.html_para5">The Energy White Paper, 'Our Energy Future-Creating a Low Carbon Economy' made clear the importance the Government attaches to improving energy efficiency in its own estate.

There is currently an interim target of a one per cent. pa ongoing reduction in weather-corrected carbon emissions, pending the development of new indicators and targets based on benchmarking the performance of each department's largest buildings. These new targets are planned to be in place later this year. New targets for Government Departments' use of CHP generated electricity will also be established during 2003.

This will rise to at least 10 per cent. supply from such sources by 31 March 2008, but will be reviewed after 31 March 2003 to take account of market conditions following the introduction of the renewables obligation.

 Europol supports the operations of the EU Member States' law-enforcement authorities in combating serious and organised cross-border crime, by collating and analysing intelligence provided by national authorities. At present national authorities can only liaise with Europol through the national unit designated in each Member State. The UK's national unit is based at the National Criminal Intelligence Service, through which an excellent working relationship has been developed between Europol and our police and security forces. This is demonstrated by the fact that the UK continues to have the highest total number of investigations supported by or through Europol among all the Member States.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many fixed penalty notices have been issued under section 72 of the Highways Act 1835, in each year since 1 August 1999, broken down by <i>(a)</i> police and <i>(b)</i> local authority area.  [108610]<P>

<a name="30428w57.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The regular collection of data on fixed penalties for motoring offences does not identify separately offences peculiar to driving a motor vehicle on a footpath (section 72 of the Highways Act 1835), from other motoring offences of neglect of pedestrian rights. Fixed penalty data are not collected centrally on the number of pedal cyclists driving on a footpath (also under section 72 of the Highways Act 1835). Information by local authority is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="30428w57.html_para0">The table shows information collected as part of a special exercise conducted in 2001 on the number of fixed penalties issued by police force area, under section 72 of the Highways Act 1835, in 1999 and 2000 only.

 It is understood that this question refers to the work being done to reduce crime.
<P>

<a name="30428w57.html_para2">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established partnerships between the police, local authorities, probation service, health authorities, the voluntary sector, and local residents and businesses. These Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships now include other groups including police authorities.

<a name="30428w57.html_para4">The strategy lasts for three years, but must be kept under review by the partnership.
<P>

<a name="30428w57.html_para5">Stemming from the strategy are various projects and schemes, some of which will be very local and some of which will be borough, area or even region-wide. Funding is provided to support this work. Over &#163;3.2 million has been allocated to Northumbria for 2003&#150;04 with &#163;269,920 going to Gateshead Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership and &#163;226,489 to the Police Basic Command Units covering Washington and Gateshead East.
<P>

<a name="30428w57.html_para6">Police numbers have also increased. In September 2002 Northumbria had 329 more officers than in March 1997, an overall total of 4,006. This was a record number.

<P>
<a name="30428w57.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 I am advised by Greater Manchester Police that this report related to a two year investigation launched in 1979 into allegations of corruption involving detectives working from the Platt Lane police station.

However, all personal victims of reported crime should be given or sent a copy of the leaflet and, in 2001, some 2&#190; million copies of the leaflet were distributed to police forces for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="30428w58.html_para1">It is not known how many personal victims of crime reported the crime to the police. But in 2001&#150;02 the total number of recorded crimes (all categories e.g. including fraud and public order offences) was 5,527,082. 1,257,089 victims were referred to Victim Support by the police, other agencies or self-referred. Victim Support contacted 295,658 victims by telephone; 159,693 were contacted by a home visit and 45,978 by an office visit.

<sup>(66)</sup> New student support arrangements in higher education came into effect in September 1998. For the first year of the new scheme, eligible new entrants received support for living costs through both grants and loans. Grants, which were assessed against family income, on average formed about a quarter of the support available. All students were entitled to a non income-assessed loan, which comprised the remaining three quarters of support available.<P>

<sup>(67)</sup> New entrants to higher education in 1999/2000, together with those who started in 1998/99, received support for living costs mainly through loans which are partly income-assessed. Grants for living costs are no longer available except for some limited allowances, e.g. for students with dependants; single parent students; and disabled students. Grants for students with dependants and single parent students are income-assessed but the Disabled Students' Allowance is not. Any student contributions towards income-assessed maintenance grants for students in these circumstances are not included.<P>

<sup>(68)</sup> Figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.<P>

<sup>(69)</sup> Latest year for which tuition fee data are available.<P>

<sup>(70)</sup> Student loans are available to most 'home' students on full-time undergraduate HE courses (and students on full-time and part-time postgraduate courses of initial teacher training) normally domiciled in the United Kingdom<P>

<sup>(71)</sup> Data relate to students domiciled in England and Wales and studying in the United Kingdom. Data are not available for 1998/99.<P>

<sup>(72)</sup> From 1998/99 most new students were expected to contribute towards the cost of their tuition depending on family income. The maximum contribution (&#163;1,075 in 2001/02, &#163;1,050 in 2000/01, &#163;1,025 in 1999/2000 and &#163;1,000 in 1998/99) represents only about 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the average cost of the course. The balance is met from public funds.<P>

<sup>(73)</sup> Includes students on their placement year in sandwich courses and part-time courses of ITT.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w61.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many cases concerning schools in the Buckingham constituency were heard by the Special Education Needs Tribunal in 2001&#150;02; and in how many cases the Tribunal ruled that additional support should be provided for children with special needs.  [108490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w61.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Tribunal does not collate statistics based on the location of schools named in appeals or attended by children who are the subject of appeals. Of 28 appeals against Buckinghamshire LEA in 2001&#150;02, seven concerned the school to be named in the child's placement. Parents requested a special school placement in two of these appeals and a mainstream placement in three. In the other two the parents requested home tuition.
<P>

<a name="30428w61.html_para0">Parents withdrew 17 of the 28 appeals and the LEA conceded a further five. The remaining six all concerned the detailed provision to be made for children, and in four of these the Tribunal ordered amendments to the provision specified in the statements.

 We estimate the steady state cost of the new Higher Education Grant to be almost &#163;300 million. The grant will be targeted at those students from the households with the lowest income. We aim to provide the full &#163;1,000 grant to approximately 30 per cent. of students.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w61.html_wqn5"><B> Paul Farrelly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills based on latest admissions, whether he estimates that the universities of <i>(a)</i> Oxford, <i>(b)</i> Cambridge, <i>(c)</i> The London School of Economics, <i>(d)</i> Bristol and <i>(e)</i> The Royal Veterinary College would be allowed to charge top-up fees from the start if his proposals for higher education were implemented.  [108690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w61.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 That would be a matter for the Office for Fair Access, and would depend on its consideration of their access agreements. Individual universities' admission policies will be a matter for universities themselves to decide.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) how many British university students participated in international exchange programmes, where at least one term of a full academic year was spent at an institution abroad, in <i>(a)</i> 1995, <i>(b)</i> 1997, <i>(c)</i> 1999, <i>(d)</i> 2001 and <i>(e)</i> 2002;  [103931]

<UL>(2) which British university had the highest percentage of students spending at least one term abroad at a foreign university institution as part of an exchange programme in the last year for which figures are available.  [103928]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="30428w61.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The latest available information, showing the number of students who are on exchange programmes for the year as a whole, is given in the table. The data for 2001/02 show that the University of Lancaster had the highest proportion of full-time UK domiciled first degree students studying abroad as part of these programmes.
<P>

<a name="30428w61.html_para3">A number of measures have been taken recently to encourage more students on UK higher education courses to study abroad as part of their course. These include giving access to higher loans for all students who study abroad; simplifying the student support arrangements; offering funding incentives to higher education institutions with mobile students; and wider and better publicity for the Socrates-Erasmus and other programmes.

 Modern Apprenticeships (MA) provide young people in England with quality work-based learning in craft, supervisory and technician skills. We and the Learning and Skills Council are implementing Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee recommendations to ensure the highest standards and to encourage take-up by employers and young people. We have adopted a challenging Public Service Agreement (PSA) target for MA entrants by 2004&#151;28 per cent. of young people to begin an MA by the age of 22. A new Modern Apprenticeship Task Force is now taking a key role in promoting MA to employers and thereby contributing to increased take-up.
<P>

<a name="30428w61.html_para4">From August this year, the Government is introducing Entry to Employment (E2E), a work-based programme for those young people not yet ready or able to enter a Modern Apprenticeship. It will enable young people to progress on to Foundation Modern Apprenticeships, sustained employment or further vocational learning opportunities.
<P>

<a name="30428w61.html_para5">The Government continues to encourage community-based learning. For example, in my speech at NIACE's Autumn Annual Conference on 10 December I reaffirmed my commitment to the breadth of purpose of adult and community learning, from fostering social inclusion to learning for leisure.
<P>

<a name="30428w61.html_para6">In June, we will be publishing the Skills Strategy and Delivery Plan, setting out a wide ranging agenda for raising skill levels amongst young people and adults to meet employers' skill needs.

 The New Earning Survey (NES) contains information on the occupation and workplace of participants. Management accountants and chartered or certified accountants are two of the occupations into which NES participants are categorised. At a more aggregate level, information on the occupation of NES participants is one variable that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister analyses in calculating each area cost factor.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he will take to ensure that the definition of affordable housing used by his Department and local authorities reflects local pay levels rather than local housing market values.  [109579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w61.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For the purposes of securing affordable housing through the planning system, affordable housing encompasses low-cost market and subsidised housing (irrespective of tenure, ownership&#151;whether exclusive or shared&#151;or financial arrangements) that will be available to people who cannot afford to rent or buy houses generally available on the open market. Local authorities are expected to define through their local plans what they consider to be affordable. Circular 6/98, "Planning and Affordable Housing", advises that definitions should be framed through references to the level of local incomes and their relationship to house prices or rents, rather than to a particular price or rent.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister for what reasons he identified a separate area cost adjustment factor for fringe and non-fringe areas in shire counties.  [109359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w62.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The new area cost adjustment (ACA), recognises that authorities in the fringe areas around London face significantly higher wage costs than those in non-fringe areas. Examples of these increased costs are the inner and outer fringe payments made to teachers and other staff on national pay scales. These increased costs are mirrored in the ACA factors calculated by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<P>

<a name="30428w63.html_para5">The Government wrote to all principal local authorities on 2 December 2002 inviting them to respond to the soundings exercise. Local authorities were written to again on 8 April 2003 to inform them of amendments made to the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill in the House of Lords and giving them the opportunity to add to or change their response to the exercise if they so wished.

 As my right hon.

Sir Michael Lyons has been asked to review departmental strategies in this regard and make recommendations for relocation across Government as a whole. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, as one that already has a strong regional presence, will be happy to give evidence.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he will take to increase the number of shared ownership homes in areas of <i>(a)</i> high housing demand and <i>(b)</i> high housing cost in the north-west.  [109580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w64.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that shared ownership has an important role to play in areas of high housing demand and cost. As announced in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future" on 5 February 2003, we have increased the funds available for housing to around &#163;1.5 billion in 2003&#150;04 through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP), providing homes for both rent and low cost home ownership. The funding includes &#163;300 million for the Challenge Fund to tackle issues of high demand areas within London and the wider south-east of England.
<P>

<a name="30428w64.html_para1">Within the north-west region, over &#163;9 million from the ADP has been approved for shared ownership schemes in 2003&#150;04. As with all approvals, these are based on the regional priorities set within the regional housing statements jointly produced by the Government Offices and Housing Corporation regional offices in consultation with local partners and stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="30428w64.html_para2">From 2004&#150;05, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is strengthening the role of the regions to ensure that housing investment is targeted more effectively on local and regional investment priorities. Regional housing boards will advise on the best use of resources to support identified priorities in regional housing strategies.

<P>
<a name="30428w64.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Some restrictions on a shared owner's ability to purchase 100 per cent. equity in their home already exist in rural areas to ensure that the property remains affordable for local people. In addition, housing associations have discretion in certain circumstances to restrict the purchase of further shares

<P>

<a name="30428w64.html_para3">Irrespective of any restrictions, the proceeds from the sale of shared ownership properties and the purchase of further shares by shared owners are recycled by housing associations to help others in priority housing need.
<P>

<a name="30428w64.html_para4">The Home Ownership Task Force, announced in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future" on 5 February 2003, and launched on 18 March 2003, is looking at the schemes currently available to potential homeowners on low or modest incomes and identifying the most effective ways of promoting sustainable homeownership. The task force's terms of reference include shared ownership. Their report is expected in the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w64.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects all of the funding allocated in the Sustainable Communities Plan to provide good value for money. In some cases the benefits that will be delivered can be valued in financial returns. In others the benefits cannot be measured in that way, but this does not mean that they are any less valuable. No distinction was made between benefits that can be valued in financial terms and other benefits in allocating funding to deliver sustainable communities.

<P>
<a name="30428w64.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 All telecommunication network rateable values are calculated in accordance with the definition of rateable value contained in schedule 6 of the local Government Finance Act 1988.

 It is rare for individuals to have no income whatsoever. However, the majority of care home residents do not have sufficient income to meet care home fees and have assets below the upper capital limit. In these situations, they can approach their local council for financial support. Residents should contribute to care costs according to the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992, and neither they nor third parties should be asked to make top-up payments in addition to the resident's assessed contribution in order to meet assessed needs.
<P>

<a name="30428w68.html_para0">If there is a difference between what a council would usually expect to pay for residential care and care home fees, the burden of meeting the shortfall should not be borne by residents or third parties if the residential services are necessary to meet assessed need. It is the council that should make up the difference. These matters are fully set out in the National Assistance Act 1948 (Choice of Accommodation) Directions 1992 ("The Direction on Choice") and the amending Direction, the National Assistance Act 1948 (Choice of Accommodation) (Amendment) (England) Directions 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the effectiveness of the safe house operated by West Sussex county council in meeting the needs of children who have been trafficked to the UK; if he will issue good practice guidance to other local authorities on the care of children who have been trafficked; and if he will discuss with the Home Secretary the implications of the safe house project for proposals to establish a safe house for trafficked adults.

 I am aware of the important work undertaken by the West Sussex Safe House&#151;a resource for unaccompanied asylum seeking children for whom West Sussex county council has responsibility. I understand that a proposal has been put to West Sussex county council to replace the safe house with training and support packages to carers of young people assessed as being at risk of being trafficked. It is the intention of West Sussex county council to refocus their delivery of protection and support, making it more flexible while building on the progress they have undoubtedly made.

<a name="30428w68.html_para11">The White Paper, "Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain" contained a commitment to develop a best practice toolkit to raise awareness of trafficking and to help those who deal with illegal immigrants and trafficking victims to distinguish victims in genuine need and to deal with them appropriately. The toolkit, which was launched on 10 March 2003, aims to provide useful information for those dealing with both child and adult victims of trafficking. It also identifies ways in which enforcement officers may be helped to identify traffickers and obtain better evidence.

 Under Section 17 of the Children Act, social services departments can provide support and advice to children under the age of 18 who have caring responsibilities for another family member. This includes providing help to adults, where this will promote the welfare of the child. The Government have prioritised services for young carers as set out in both the "Quality Protects programme" (launched in 1998) and "A National Strategy for Carers" (1999). The Government aim to ensure that young carers gain maximum life chance benefits from educational opportunities, health care and social care and are not expected to carry inappropriate levels of caring responsibility. The Government believe that young carers are best helped as part of their family, so that they can enjoy as normal a childhood as their peers.

The mental health NSF sets out how modern mental health services will be delivered. Services will be much more accessible; intervene more quickly to offer help and support; seek out those who are difficult to engage; involve users and carers in planning developments; use effective care processes and be delivered in partnership across health and social care as well as other key agencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much money has been spent on research on eye conditions since 1997; and if he will make a statement on the progress made.  [109203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w71.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The main Government agency into the causes and treatments of disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. Between 1997&#150;98 and 2001&#150;02, the MRC spent a total of &#163;24.4 million on research into vision. This research was into eye function and eye disorders, the causes of visual defects including blindness, short-sightedness, long-sightedness, and squints; reduced visual field; cataracts and glaucoma; retinal disease such as macular degeneration and problems with eye movement control.
<P>

<a name="30428w71.html_para3">As an example of progress made, the gene that controls development of the eye has been found by researchers at the MRC's human genetics unit. Mutations in a gene called SOX2 have been identified as one of the causes of babies born without eyes. Identifying very rare disease-associated genes provides an important stepping stone to understanding the biological networks involved in other, sometimes more common, related diseases. The research team has explored the role of SOX2 in the development and the adult maintenance of the lens and the retina. Genes that regulate eye development also play a role in eye maintenance after birth, so understanding their function may help in the management of later onset sight problems such as macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma.
<P>

<a name="30428w71.html_para4">The Department funds research to support policy and delivery of effective health and social care. The Department and the Chief Scientist's Office, Scotland, together spent about &#163;2million on projects covering a wide range of eye conditions. The Department has asked the national Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to conduct an appraisal of photodynamic therapy for age-related macular degeneration and provide guidance on its use on the National Health Service. NICE has not yet issued any guidance to the NHS on this.

<a name="30428w73.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton:  </B> 
The Department's workforce census collects data about numbers of paediatric nurses and this includes neonatal nurses and other nurses involved in the care of children. As at 30 September 2001, there were 17,640 paediatric nurses working in the national health service in England, of which 1,924 were aged 50 years or over.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what alterations the Government plans to make to example 4 in the NHS funded nursing care practice guidance and workbook used by nurses in making their determinations about the correct band of NHS payment towards nursing care, in response to case E 420/00&#150;01 ('Mrs. N') in the Health Ombudsman's recent report, NHS funding for long term care;  [110050]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w74.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The case studies that are set out in the Practice Guide and Workbook assume that a continuing care assessment has already been carried out. These are fictional examples that do not identify needs for other therapeutic or medical input. It is therefore not meaningful to compare these to cases identified in the Ombudsman's report, and I do not consider that there is any need to amend either the guidance or the guide.
<P>

<a name="30428w74.html_para7">The recently issued guidance on NHS Funded Nursing Care (HSC 2003/6: LAC (2003)7) emphasised the distinction between National Health Service funded nursing care and NHS continuing healthcare very clearly. It stresses that all the individual's needs for medical and nursing care, as well as therapeutic and personal care, should be examined. Based on this examination, it highlights the need in every case to consider whether the person meets the criteria for fully funded NHS healthcare, before there is any consideration of NHS funded nursing care as part of a mixed package of care.

<P>
<a name="30428w74.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Since the publication of the Green Paper in February 1998, a number of steps have been taken to tackle osteoporosis. In June 1998, we launched a strategy aimed at reducing the number of fractures caused by osteoporosis. The strategy is evidence-based; prioritises treatment for those at higher risk of developing the disease; is easily accessible and encourages people to think about how they can play a part in preventing fractures and accidents and ultimately to prevent osteoporosis. Health authorities were recommended to use the strategy as a basis for developing their own local strategies.

This standard requires each local health system to have a falls service in place by April 2005. These services must include appropriate interventions and advice to prevent osteoporosis.
<P>

<a name="30428w74.html_para9">We have asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to undertake an appraisal of pharmacological treatments for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis with a view to giving doctors the latest evidence based information on the most effective treatments for their patients. NICE expects to publish towards the end of the year. NICE is also drawing up clinical guidelines for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Although the guidelines are being developed to support the NSF for older people, they will have an effect on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis at all ages.
<P>

<a name="30428w74.html_para10">Towards the end of 2002, we announced the first three pilot schemes for pre-retirement health checks for people approaching retirement, including one on osteoporosis. Pre-retirement is a good time to make people aware of lifestyle changes they can adopt to prevent the onset of this disease. These checks can also identify those in need of immediate treatment for established osteoporosis.

<P>
<a name="30428w75.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Inquiries set up by the Secretary of State for Health are usually in accordance with the provisions of section 2 or section 84 of the NHS Act 1977. There are no express restrictions on setting up inquiries under these sections while legal action is pending or taking place. These inquiries usually involve wider serious systemic service failures often involving a number of patients across a longer time frame. They are not normally regarded as the appropriate method for investigating an individual incident unless it is so serious as to have implications for National Health Service services more generally or raised health policy issues which have not been satisfactorily addressed before. These incidents are usually investigated under the NHS complaints procedure. Complaints made under the NHS complaints system will be suspended if the subject of the complaint and the case for legal action are the same.

 At present two and half hours of dental time are made available to prisoners each week at Shrewsbury prison. This has led to average waiting times to see a dentist of 14 days for a prisoner who is experiencing dental pain and 95 days for a routine appointment. Both waiting times are unacceptable and action will be taken in the near future to bring about reductions.

<a name="30428w77.html_para7">The implementation, shortly, of the strategy to modernise dental services for prisoners will provide the prison's dentist and healthcare manager with clear recommendations about what types of dental treatment should be carried out in a local prison. Shrewsbury is one of a number of prisons which will receive additional funding this financial year to procure extra dental sessions to reduce excess waiting times. Funding is also being made available to prison health's regional development teams to purchase dental expertise to ensure that advice and assistance is available to accompany implementation of the dental strategy, in order to ensure that unacceptable dental waiting times do not build up again.

 Smallpox vaccination is not being offered to the general population at present. Smallpox vaccine has a much higher rate of serious complications than vaccines that are in regular use today. Certain groups are at even higher risk, such as those with weak immune systems or with eczema. We are following World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance&#151;and plan to "ring vaccinate" in the event of a smallpox outbreak. Our contingency plans for dealing with smallpox are detailed in the draft guidelines on smallpox available on http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm.
<P>

<a name="30428w77.html_para11">A small number of key frontline national health service staff and a small number of military personnel, who would provide the first response in the event of a confirmed, suspected or threatened release of smallpox, are being vaccinated. The Department of Health programme is under way on a regional basis, co-ordinated by the regional directors of public health.
<P>

<a name="30428w77.html_para12">We have sufficient stocks of smallpox vaccine, which would be rapidly deployed to contain any outbreak. We have taken steps to considerably increase our supplies. We are planning for every eventuality and this includes the ability to vaccinate the entire population if necessary.
<P>

<a name="30428w77.html_para13">In addition, guidance for individuals wishing to have smallpox inoculations is available in the information pack, "Smallpox Vaccination of Regional Response Groups&#151;Information for health care workers administering or receiving the vaccine". This guidance is available on www.doh.gov.uk/smallpox/vaccination.

 We recognise that teenagers have particular needs, as far as their health and wellbeing are concerned, that differ from those of younger children or adults. Furthermore, they have different educational and social needs that should also be considered in the design and delivery of health services.
<P>

<a name="30428w78.html_para4">On 10 April 2003, we published the first part of Getting the right start: the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, covering the standard for hospital services. Throughout the NSF, the particular needs of different age groups, including teenagers, will be addressed, as will periods of transition between different stages of childhood from pre-birth to adolescence and subsequently into adulthood. The hospital standard recommends that the needs of adolescents are given careful consideration in hospital, such as their need for privacy. We have consulted widely with teenagers, as well as younger children and parents, during the development of the NSF.

A range of applications for NHS Employers, an extension of web-based forms for updating, were developed in late 2002 and released early in 2003, which accounts for the increased level of traffic. Currently, for security reasons this is only available on the NHSnet version of the site, but it is planned to extend to the public internet site when security can be assured.<P>

<P>

<sup>(83)</sup> IT FM and Development services were outsourced from January 2002 to Envision and most of the costs are absorbed within their overall contract price for all services over the lifetime of the contract and are therefore difficult to apportion.<P>

<P>

<sup>(84)</sup> Capital costs: Development costs are included and cover the running and supporting of three sites: Internet, Intranet and NHSnet. We did not have time to apportion equipment costs and post 31 December 2001 they are built into the overall contract price and not separately identified. The costs included prior to 31 December 2001 are for site development using outsourced staff.<P>

<a name="30428w79.html_para18">The increase in hosting and maintenance charges between 2002 and 2003 was caused by the OGC's decision to drop its role as an Internet service provider, requiring MDA to transfer its website to a commercial provider. The current hosting supplier is Interliant.

<a name="30428w79.html_para19">In 2000 a major redevelopment was initiated to prepare the site as the primary mechanism for meeting the e-government target of 2005 for delivery of services electronically. The announcement of the merger of MDA and the MCA to form the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) from 1 April 2003 has resulted in a new site for MHRA, which links to the existing MCA and MDA sites. A fully integrated website for MHRA is planned.
<P>

<a name="30428w79.html_para20">The OGC provided hosting until the end of February 2002. While its website was hosted at OGC, MDA used page impressions rather than hits as a measure of usage. With the move to Interliant, other statistics have become available but the page impressions statistic is used in the following table to allow comparison. The figures for the five years from 1998 to 2002 are shown.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what percentage of young carers have been assessed for their ability to provide for the person they care for;  [109936]
<P>
<UL>(2) what measures have been taken since January 2002 to improve the conditions of young carers.  [109933]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30428w80.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Young carers are assessed in line with the "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families", in the same way as other potential children in need. The Government's aim is to ensure that young carers are not expected to carry inappropriate levels of caring with emphasis on helping the family as a whole, rather than focussing exclusively on the needs of individuals within it, whether these be disabled adults or young carers.
<P>

<a name="30428w80.html_para0">The Carers Grant, worth &#163;100 million in 2003&#150;04, provides money for local councils to help carers which can include providing short breaks to support them in their caring role. Following my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State's announcement in July 2002, the Grant will continue until 2006, during which time it will more than double to &#163;185 million to provide extended care and 130,000 further breaks to carers.
<P>

<a name="30428w80.html_para1">In addition, we are supporting the development of over 100 young carers' projects across the country to give carers of school age access to appropriate advice, information and support or leisure.
