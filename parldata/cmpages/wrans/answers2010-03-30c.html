 Between 1 March 2009 and 28 February 2010 RAF Lossiemouth was unable to provide search and rescue (SAR) capability on 26 occasions due to crew shortages. All of these consisted of 12 hour night-time closures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_689"><a name="100330w0003.htm_para1"><a name="10033061000102">In the same period Lossiemouth SAR helicopters were unavailable on 147 occasions due to technical problems; these periods vary in length from a few minutes to several days. Details of each occasion and the length of time Lossiemouth was listed as being 'off-state' are shown in the following table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_690"><a name="100330w0003.htm_para2"><a name="10033061000103">The extended closure of Lossiemouth between 26 January and 1 February this year was because both helicopters required major repair work. If a helicopter becomes unavailable for any reason, then the Aeronautical Rescue Co-ordination Centre at RAF Kinloss liaises with other SAR providers to reduce the impact on available cover. This is primarily achieved by ensuring that when one SAR station is expected to be 'off-state' a neighbouring site is fully operational.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proportion of the Defence Academy's budget for 2009-10 is allocated to <i> (a)</i> private finance initiative and <i> (b)</i> public private partnership contracts; what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of each such contract against its objectives; and if he will make a statement.

<i> [holding answer 10 March 2010]:</i> The Defence Academy's budget for 2009-10 currently spends 28 per cent. on private finance initiatives (PFI) with the Joint Services Command and Staff college and Defence sixth form college and 8 per cent. on its public-private partnership contract (PPP) with Serco for the Shrivenham Campus Integrator Contract.</p>

The DSFC is currently achieving this with 98 per cent. of students who left the college in June 2009 securing entry onto an accredited technical course at a Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme Partner university; additionally the college achieved a 100 per cent. pass rate at 'A' level.</p>

An NAO report in 2002 stated that the JSCSC PFI was good value for money. The Customer Executive Board actively examines the rigorous course internal validation process and emerging customer requirements and directs specific changes to courses in order to improve the output in line with the defence mission.

<i> [holding answer 29 March 2010]:</i> Overseas training is undertaken in a number of countries in order to better prepare our armed forces for the tasks they may face, not only in Afghanistan but in other operations where there may be a need in the future, for example humanitarian relief operations. To do so, there is a need to experience different weather conditions and terrain beyond that offered in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, our armed forces benefit from training with foreign forces and coalition partners in order to ensure that we can effectively operate together.</p>

Policies and good working practices are in place to reduce both long term and frequent short term sick absences. These include facilitating timely employee access to occupational health advice, medical or wellbeing interventions. Additionally, managers hold return-to-work interviews to discuss employees' reasons for absence, including any work-related issues connected with their absence. Where necessary, action plans will be agreed to improve employees' attendance at work.</p>

CO: Carbon monoxide, a gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels. In urban areas the predominant source is traffic. PM10: Particulate matter, particles with a diameter of less than 10 microgrammes m-3. PM10 comes from a variety of natural and man-made sources such as sea salt and Saharan dust, and combustion processes. NOx: Oxides of nitrogen consisting of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NO is a product of combustion processes, it reacts with ozone or oxygen to produce NO2. O3: Ozone, a highly reactive oxidising agent that has a range of health and material impacts. A natural background level of ozone exists. Ozone is not directly emitted and man-made sources result from a series of reactions in the atmosphere. CO2: Carbon dioxide is a gas that is produced from the combustion of carbon containing fuels.<br>

The Department's guidelines for drug treatment in the UK recommend that when a person starts receiving methadone to treat their drug misuse, they should take each dose under the supervision of a nurse, doctor or community pharmacist for a minimum of three months, and this supervision should be relaxed only when their compliance is assured.</p>

As a result data from 2006-07 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years. Data have been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

 2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
 3. The "Total proceeded against" statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>

(f) Causing death by careless driving whilst under the influence of drink or drugs.<br>

Notes:<br>
1. Distress actions refer to bailiff actions in England &amp; Wales. This is where, once the debt has been legally recognised, the agency has passed the debt to a bailiff company for collection (or equivalent).<br>
2. Judgement orders apply only to England and Wales. This registers the person with a County Court Judgement Order, which remains on their credit record for six years.<br>
3. Third Party Debt orders in England and Wales instruct a third party to pay any funds owed to, or held on behalf of, the non-resident parent to the agency instead. In practice this is typically used for banks and building societies.<br>
4. Charging orders in England and Wales are where a County Court Order for the legally recognised debt is attached to the equity in the non-resident parent's property.<br>
5. Attachments refer to actions taken by Sheriff Officers in Scotland on the agency's instruction to attach certain goods and remove for auction if the debt is not settled.<br>
6. Arrestments refer to actions taken by Sheriff Officers in Scotland on the agency's instruction to serve an arrestment on a third party holding funds owed to, or held on behalf of, the non-resident parent to pay to the agency instead. In practice this is typically used for banks and building societies.<br>
7. Bills of Inhibition in Scotland do not attach directly to the non-resident parent's property, but are a personal prohibition preventing heritable property being transferred, alienated or disposed of by the non-resident parent.<br>
8. The number of new Deduction from Earnings Order/Requests showed a marked increase in January 2007. This was due to a fix on the CS2 system in December 2006 to suspend 8,500 ineffective Deduction from Earnings Orders on cases where employers had informed the agency that the non-resident parent on that case was no longer in their employment. Many of these were reinstated as Deduction from Earnings Order/Requests in January 2007 resulting in a large increase that is in effect not real. In order to allow more consistent comparisons, figures for January 2007 have been removed and therefore figures for April 2006 to March 2007 and August 2006 to July 2007 are underestimated by around 6,000 requests.<br>
9. Figures are rounded to the nearest 5.<br>

Our public facing network is designed to provide reasonable access to our services throughout England and Wales.

At the time of merger the two organisations had many offices which were geographically close to each other, often in the same street. We have modernised our Jobcentre network to improve customer service, rationalising our estate to provide excellent high street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer. We remain the largest office network in Government with 741 modern Jobcentres. This high street presence is supported by 31 modern contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres.</p>

For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have almost half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. In order to make our services more accessible to customers we are providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners' premises This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 March 2010]:</i> Between 1998-99 and 2007-08 some 500,000 children were lifted out of relative poverty as measured using the EU standard definition based on 60 per cent. of median income. Measures announced in and since Budget 2007 are expected to lift around a further 550,000 children out of poverty. Absolute poverty has been halved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_892"><a name="100330w0028.htm_para5"><a name="10033088000803">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty.

Such data for households with an income lower than 50 per cent. of median are not considered to be accurate as an indicator of living standards. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the Family Resources Survey, (the underlying data source for the Households Below Average Income series) may not actually have the lowest living standards.

 School capital allocations are allocated at local authority level and no central records are maintained which distinguish between parliamentary constituencies. None of the authorities in Berkshire, including Reading, have yet entered the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. Therefore no BSF funding has been allocated to schools in these authorities. BSF projects are prioritised based on educational and social need and on a local authority's ability to provide robust evidence of their readiness to deliver. We are not yet able to say when the authorities will be invited to join the programme. However we are committed to seeing all local authorities enter the programme as soon as is practicable.</p>

The financial information used in the answer to this PQ is taken from the Department's section 52 data collection.  2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by CLG (formerly ODPM) to the section 52 form (now section 251 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009) from the DCSF. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row. From 2002-03 school-based expenditure is taken from section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously.  3. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.  4. School-based expenditure in LA-maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.  5. Figures are rounded to the nearest £1,000. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 26 March 2010.<br>

<i> [holding answer 29 March 2010]:</i> The Secretary of State has received a representation from the head teacher at St. Thomas More Catholic primary school in Cheltenham and others in connection with broadband internet costs and the Harnessing Technology Grant. Inquiries have also been made by schools and other representative groups to Becta, the Government's educational technology agency which covers these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_949"><a name="100330w0034.htm_para6"><a name="1003311000886">Becta have replied to correspondents on these issues, on behalf of my Department, both in Gloucestershire and in relation to other counties affected by high internet charges. We sympathise with this situation, particularly with small schools that have faced increased costs. The Harnessing Technology Grant is a capital grant and can therefore only be used for capital expenditure. Broadband connectivity costs are a revenue cost, therefore the Harnessing Technology Grant cannot be used for this purpose. This has always been the case since the Harnessing Technology Grant was introduced and no changes to rules around the capital of the grant have been made. Unfortunately it is not possible to reclassify this capital funding as revenue, as some schools have requested. Broadband costs should be taken from the revenue funding that is provided for ICT in schools, but we do appreciate that there can be pressures on these budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_950"><a name="100330w0034.htm_para7"><a name="1003311000887">Becta continues to offer advice to all local authorities in the regions on these issues, and have specifically said that their regional delivery team colleague would be happy to meet representatives of schools in Gloucestershire, together with local authority officers to explore ways of addressing the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_951"><a name="100330w0034.htm_para8"><a name="1003311000888">The Harnessing Technology Grant itself is based on a funding formula which includes a built-in sparsity element, which helps schools in rural areas in acquiring technology, but as described above this is a capital grant and should not be used for revenue costs. £603 million has been made available through the Harnessing Technology Grant in each of the three years of the current spending review period. £201 million will be available in the 2010-11 financial year. Provision after that will be subject to the usual discussion around the next comprehensive spending review period.</p>

 Georgia is making some progress towards necessary reforms in these areas. Public trust in the media is low and there are concerns about a lack of transparency surrounding ownership of the media. Georgia has taken steps to improve human rights and detention conditions, but can still do more to investigate the alleged harassment of opposition activists and take action against security forces responsible for such harassment. Georgia has improved its electoral code, with support from the Venice Commission but May's local elections will be an important test for the new arrangements.

 The supplier obligation (now termed the carbon emissions reduction target) has been set over three year cycles to allow Government to evolve the scheme so that it only pulls through products with the most potential to provide for household sector carbon emissions reductions. An independent assessment is commissioned at the end of each three year phase, building on the cost-benefit assessment undertaken and published at the launch of each scheme. Independent analysis of the three year supplier obligation scheme ending March 2008 showed it to have been extremely effective in delivery-that for every £1 added onto GB household bills to pay for the obligation, benefits equate to an average saving of £9 per household bill over the lifetime of the measures. The carbon emissions reduction target which ends in March 2011, is also believed to be highly cost-effective. We know for instance, that insulation measures make up over 60 per cent. of savings to target-equivalent to some four million households receiving insulation measures.</p>

 This question was considered in the recent CERT extension impact assessment, which can be accessed via the link provided<sup>(1)</sup>. The cost per kilogram of carbon dioxide saved can be determined for a range of technologies from the information provided in tables 1 and 2. The cost per kilogram can be determined by dividing the total cost for the measure, shown in table 2, by the relevant life time carbon dioxide savings shown in table 1 (multiply the figures shown in table 1 by 1,000 to obtain kilograms of carbon dioxide). The Department does not hold this information for circulator pumps.</p>

 No. One of the strengths of the British gas market-demonstrated in the coldest winter for some 30 years-is the resilience provided by its diverse and over-sized gas supply infrastructure. Arbitrarily constraining the use of one kind of supply infrastructure could have harmful unintended consequences-for example, in forcing the gas market to use more expensive supplies from time to time, and, in the longer term, in damaging the commercial incentives to construct gas supply infrastructure. Ultimately this could mean higher prices, and less reliable supplies, for consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1113"><a name="100330w0050.htm_para2"><a name="10033134000189">The growth in expenditure on press officers and communications officers reflects the significantly increased size and remit of MOJ compared to its predecessor, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and a consequent need to increase the number and capability of staff employed. To meet the challenge, a number of communications-led projects were undertaken which required the employment of specialist contractors by the MOJ HQ Communications Directorate, for a limited period of time which further increased costs in 2008-09 on a one-off basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1114"><a name="100330w0050.htm_para3"><a name="10033134000190">A minor proportion of these costs have been estimated where separate records had not been kept at the time.</p>

Furthermore, 2007-08 figures exclude the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This is due to reorganisation within the Department between the two financial years.</p>

 It is possible for a parish warden to be accredited under the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. In granting accreditation, the chief officer of the local police force may also grant powers that include a power to issue penalty notices for disorder.</p>

The Act gives the power to parish councils to authorise staff to issue fixed penalty notices to alleged offenders as an alternative to prosecution.</p>

 Work is now well under way to sustain this approach. Directors of Offender Management (DOMs) are currently working to support the Women's Community Projects (WCPs) in their future sustainability efforts and to demonstrate their effectiveness at providing effective interventions for women offenders and women at risk of offending. DOMs, in conjunction with probation trust/boards, will have a lead role in ensuring appropriate commissioning and joint commissioning of services for women offenders to draw in the services of a range of local agencies. Every one of the DOMs new commissioning plans includes a focus on women and they now manage all of the contracts for the WCPs.

The count process might take longer in some cases, where no candidate wins outright on the first round; however, recounts may already extend the time taken to count under the existing system.</p>

The cost of the delivery of candidates' election communications to UK addresses by the universal service provider is met by the Consolidated Fund.

 The Government are committed to reducing the number of mobile phones in prisons. We have already strengthened the law through the Offender Management Act 2007, which made it an offence with a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment to bring a mobile phone or component into a prison. We are also taking forward legislation through the Crime and Security Bill to criminalise. the possession of devices, including mobile telephones within a prison without authorisation.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) withdrew the mother and baby unit (MBU) database from service in April 2009, as over time the data collected and the database itself had become distorted.</p>

This data continues to be recorded locally for operational purposes. Given the level of public and parliamentary interest in this field, further work is being undertaken to examine the feasibility of developing a new central collection system. This work will not be completed until later this year, but a significant amount of the data should be available from early summer. Every effort will be made to consolidate historical data as far as possible.</p>

Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

<i> Note:</i><br>
Wireless Telegraphy Act offences (mainly television licence evasion) prosecutions increased by 75 per cent from 1999 to 2000. These figures fluctuate from year to year depending on the level and manner of enforcement by the licensing authorities. The increase in prosecutions in 2000 was largely due to changes in visiting practices so that enforcement visits to households took place at times when TV was more likely to be watched.<br>

At the end of June 2008, there were 3,029 young people in custody. Since then, the population has fallen by 31 per cent. In the light of this developing trend, the Youth Justice Board has acted to remove spare capacity in the under-18 estate, beginning with the decommissioning of under-18 places at Brinsford YOI. In addition, we have recently announced the decommissioning of places at Castington YOI. We will continue to keep the under-18 population under review and to ensure that the capacity of the estate is adjusted to take account of the number of young people it needs to accommodate.</p>

 The Design for Manufacture competition launched in April 2005 is run by the Homes and Communities Agency (formerly English Partnerships) on behalf of Communities and Local Government. The competition was the Government's challenge to the housebuilding industry to build high-quality, well-designed homes for £60,000. The figure of £60,000 relates to a target cost for building a two bedroom home and does not reflect the sale price. Developers are responsible for final sales for individual homes setting prices in accordance with local market conditions. The programme comprising ten sites is currently on track to deliver the target of building 30 per cent. of the homes on each site for £60,000 The Homes and Communities Agency will report back on the exact number of £60,000 homes built on each site following completion of the programme. The sites and target number of £60,000 homes to be built are listed in the following table.</p>

The overall assessment was that these costs can be controlled whilst at the same time improving the quality of homes being developed.</p>

Due to substantial changes to broad rental market area boundaries and local housing allowance rates since April 2009, and potential for further changes in the near future, it is not appropriate to break these figures down to identify impacts on specific areas.</p>

The average loss for these customers is £24 (at April 2009 prices) although there is large variation on this from area to area and customer to customer. A few customers, such as those in five-bedrooms in Central London, could see their awards decrease by significant amounts, while others would see their benefit change marginally.</p>

 The English Indices of Deprivation have, since 2004, been produced at Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) level. LSOAs are smaller than constituencies and are designed to remain consistent in size, and over time, to allow more detailed identification of pockets of deprivation. This also overcomes difficulties in producing statistics for electoral wards and parliamentary constituencies which are associated with frequent boundary changes. There are 32,482 LSOAs in England with an average population of 1,500 people.</p>

Recent figures indicate that actions taken to help families avoid repossession are having some impact-more families are getting help to stay in their home. Total repossessions in 2009 were 46,000-39 per cent. fewer than originally predicted by the CML and around half the rate of repossessions in the last recession in 1991.</p>
