 <i>[holding answer 25 November 1997]:</i> The vast majority of around 3 million calculations so far issued are correct. However, errors can occur if the taxpayer provides incorrect information, or information is not properly keyed into Inland Revenue systems by staff. Inland Revenue offices have quality assurance processes in place to minimise the latter form of error, and these will be enhanced as experience is gained of the new system. Where an error is pointed out to the Inland Revenue, or where one is picked up during the inquiry process, it will be corrected.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to change the rules used to value North Sea gas for tax purposes. [19570]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government intend to introduce legislation which will ensure that the rules used to value North Sea gas for tax purposes will continue to operate in the way that the industry and the Inland Revenue have until now applied them. This will remove some doubts, arising from recent legal advice, about the current interpretation of the rules. The legislation will be included in the next Finance Bill and will apply to all gas disposals which have to be valued, including disposals which have already taken place. The Inland Revenue is issuing a Press Release today which contains details of the changes and draft legislation on which it will be consulting the North Sea oil and gas industry.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list those assets listed in the National Assets Register which are located in the City of Norwich.[18148]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The National Asset Register was put together within five months, in order to meet the Government's promise to produce it by the end of November, from the data currently available to departments. And, as a result, the information is at a relatively high level of aggregation which does not easily allow a full geographic analysis to be undertaken. However, in order to increase openness and accountability, the Government will consider how to improve the information on the assets owned by the nation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if dedicated telephone links exist between all Railtrack zonal controls; and if he will make a statement. [18206]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate understands that all Zonal Controls are connected to the internal railway telephone system and have separate BT numbers. In addition, after the Ais Gill accident on 31 January 1995, the telephone access between the controls was enhanced by the installation of a number of auto diallers and emergency lines at some controls including York and Manchester. A further enhancement is currently being implemented by Railtrack so that there will be designated lines at each control centre for exclusive use by adjacent control centres.

 The Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate understands that all Railtrack Control Offices, except one located at Derby, have direct access to the National Radio Network. The Derby control is a satellite office of the Birmingham control and there is a direct hot line between the offices. HM Railway Inspectorate is satisfied with these arrangements.

Eurotunnel also holds annual exercises to test its emergency procedures which would apply in the event of any incident in the Channel Tunnel. Eurotunnel's express permission must be sought before any shipment of radioactive material is transported via the Channel Tunnel and it may obtain advice/assistance via NIREP should radioactive material be present on a train involved in an accident.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what amendments the United Kingdom proposed to the draft code covering the safe carriage of nuclear materials on board ships, as adopted by the International Maritime Organisation; and what mechanisms his Department has in place to monitor the application of the code to the sea transport of nuclear materials to and from the United Kingdom. [18405]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on board Ships (INF Code) was adopted by the Assembly of the International Maritime Organisation in 1993. The Assembly adopted amendments to the Code last month. The United Kingdom participated fully in the negotiations leading to the adoption both of the original Code and these amendments. While compliance with the INF Code is currently voluntary, UK registered ships engaged in the trade have documents of compliance issued by my Department's Marine Safety Agency. UK companies involved in transporting materials covered by the INF Code use ships complying with the Code. The UK is currently participating in work to make compliance with the Code mandatory. This will enhance our enforcement powers.

 Officials from my Department participated fully in the meetings of the International Atomic Energy Agency during the development of Safety Series Number 6, Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material 1985 Edition (As Amended 1990). These multi-modal recommendations provide the basis for the mandatory requirements for air transport as incorporated into the current edition of the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. The Department similarly supported the IAEA's continuous review and revision procedures leading to the latest edition of "Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material 1996 Edition", now known as Safety Standards Series No. ST-1. The transport of radioactive material in large quantity by air, including that of mixed oxide fuel, was considered in great depth and detail during the development of ST-1. The UK will continue to

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to encourage the building of properties within the Greater London Authority area for low cost rent. [18587]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government recognise that the building of properties for low cost rent within London raises particular issues because of the scarcity of land for new social housing developments and the high cost of acquisition in what is a global property market. The Revised Strategic Planning Guidance for London Planning Authorities (RPG3) and the proposed revisions to circular 13/96 which details how the delivery of affordable housing may be assisted through negotiations with developers, both send out a clear message that the Government wish to ensure greater allocation of land for low cost rent properties in the capital than has been provided in recent years.
<P>

<a name="71204w02.html_para0">The main mechanism for the delivery of affordable housing is through the Housing Corporation of Local Authority Social Housing Grants. In 1997/98. some &#163;161 million representing 65 per cent. of the Housing Corporation's London Region programme, is being directed to new build housing for rent.
<P>

<a name="71204w02.html_para1">Our early action to release capital receipts from council; house sales has injected an additional &#163;53 Million into London's housing in 1997-98. Allocations for 1998-99 will be announced shortly. A significant proportion of this will be used by the London Authorities in enabling the provision of new or rehabilitated social housing partnership with registered social landlords.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the gross cost to public funds of a reduction in housing association rents of <i>(a)</i> 10 per cent., <i>(b)</i> nine per cent., <i>(c)</i> eight per cent., <i>(d)</i> seven per cent., <i>(e)</i> six per cent., <i>(f)</i> five per cent., <i>(g)</i> four per cent., <i>(h)</i> three per cent., <i>(i)</i> two per cent. and <i>(j)</i> one per cent.; and what would be the cost net of savings in (i) housing benefits and (ii) public expenditure linked to the RPI. [18595]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There are no powers under which the Government could impose a general reduction in housing association rents. The calculations below are on the hypothetical assumption that the cuts in rent could be achieved and that housing associations would be fully compensated for their loss of revenue. The estimated gross cost and the cost net of savings in Housing Benefit are as shown. The figures represent the annual costs calculated on the basis of average housing association rents in 1996-97. The Department does not have a model for calculating the RPI-related savings in public expenditure arising from reductions in housing association rents.

 The Rail Regulator has imposed financial penalties totalling &#163;350,000 on rail operators for failing to meet his standards for the National Rail Enquiry Service (NRES).
<P>

<a name="71204w02.html_para2">The Franchising Director has imposed financial penalties totalling &#163;141,000 on two train operating companies for trains being run with fewer seats than required under the franchise agreements. The Franchising Director has also operated financial incentive regimes under franchise agreements which reward or penalise operators according to performance compared with historical benchmarks. Details of these appear in the Franchising Director's quarterly bulletins and in his Annual Report which are in the Library of the House.

 The closing date for responses to the consultation on an integrated transport policy was 14 November. We have received a large number of responses which we are in the process of analysing. It is too early to give details of representations on individual subject areas although a number of respondents have mentioned specific journey purposes including commuting in their responses. The importance of encouraging "Green Commuting" was a major theme in the regional consultation meetings held to discuss the consultation document.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 1997]:</i> Local authority building control officers are answerable to the chief officers of the authorities for which they work, and through them to elected members. As regards private sector approved inspectors, the appointing body also has the power to withdraw approval. In the case of corporate bodies, approval is given by the Secretary of State, and, in the case of individuals, it is given by the Construction Industry Council. I am currently consulting the Local Government Association, the Construction Industry Council and the Association of Corporate Approved Inspectors on ways of securing consistent building control standards and better conditions for competition across the public and private sectors of building control.

<a name="71204w03.html_para4">We have concluded that further Regional Planning Guidance on housing provision in the West Midlands is required. We expect to issue this early in the new year. I will write to the hon. Members at that time and place a copy of the amendment in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="71204w03.html_para5">We have concluded that provision should be made for 335,000 dwellings in the region between 1991 and 2011 including replacements and conversions to be redistributed as set out below. This is broadly in line with the advice received from the Forum but we take the view that the metropolitan area has the capacity to make slightly higher provision than they proposed. This would have benefits both for urban regeneration and protection of the countryside. In amending the guidance we will want to set out clear policies that authorities should pursue in their development plans to increase the amount of housing on previously developed land, to make provision for affordable housing and to ensure sustainable locations for housing development within transport corridors.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proportion of the speed cameras on the motorway system are active over a 24 hour weekday period. [18844]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71204w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para0">The information is not available centrally. The use made of speed cameras on motorways is an operational matter for each individual chief officer of police to decide, taking account of local priorities and resources. It is important to bear in mind that, even when the cameras are not taking photographs, their signs and presence are influencing driver behaviour. It is the driver's perceived risk of detection which makes him comply with the speed limit now. Prosecution may make him do so in future. The police do not want to detect and prosecute all speeding motorists. Their aim is to achieve driver compliance with speed limits with the minimum necessary prosecutions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gunnell: </B>

<P>
<a name="71204w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para1">Information broken down by motorway systems and trunk roads is not collected centrally but I understand from the Chief Constable that provisional figures for West Yorkshire Police for 1997 so far indicate that some 9,400 offences have been detected by automatic cameras and dealt with either by fixed penalty or prosecution. Of these, I understand that some 5,300 arose from speed cameras on the motorway systems and 4,100 on trunk roads. Official, verified statistics for police action against speeding offenders detected by automatic cameras in England and Wales for 1997 will be published in the usual way next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will announce the United Kingdom Bathing Water Compliance results for 1997; and if he will make a statement. [19301]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The quality of UK bathing waters fell slightly this year, with 88 per cent. of identified waters meeting EC mandatory coliform bacteria standards. This 



<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 1997 : Column: 290</I><P>
compares with 90 per cent. of UK bathing waters meeting the standards in 1996. The proportion of bathing waters complying with the standards in England and Wales remained the same at 89 per cent.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para2">The UK results are around the average for the EU but I want us to be among the leaders. We will only get there by urgent and targeted action on the small proportion of bathing waters which fail persistently. No Member State achieves 100 per cent. compliance consistently but I shall not be satisfied until we are achieving close to 100 per cent. regularly. There is still some way to go.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para3">It is very disappointing that compliance with the Directive is not better than last year, as more improvement schemes have come on stream.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para4">The results in the North-West are especially poor, with only half the bathing waters there passing the mandatory bacteria standards, compared with 61 per cent. last year. This is particularly disappointing when major bathing water improvement schemes have been completed in the area. I am asking North West Water to work with the Environment Agency as a matter of urgency to help to sort out the remaining problems, particularly in the Blackpool, Fylde coast area.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para5">I am also writing to the Chairman of the Environment Agency for a detailed report on the prospects for compliance and the action needed on persistent failures. I know that only last month the Agency warned water companies that delays in programming major investments were putting Britain at risk of failing to meet EC deadlines for improved sewage treatment under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. In addition to speeding up work to implement the UWWTD, I want to see concerted action by the Agency and the water companies to identify the causes of failure of bathing waters under the Bathing Water Directive, and give priority to tackling them in order to raise the level of compliance. However there is also good news in the results I am announcing today. I am encouraged to see that 180 UK bathing waters reached the higher guideline standard this year which is needed for a "Blue Flag" and I hope more local authorities than have done so in the past will be encouraged to apply for this prestigious award.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para6">Furthermore, 397 is a record number of bathing waters meeting the required standard and nearly two-thirds of the 50 failures in England and Wales missed compliance by only one of the 20 samples. Some regions performed particularly well this year and Anglian region deserve to be congratulated for achieving 100 per cent. compliance.
<P>

<a name="71204w04.html_para7">The main results for the United Kingdom are summarised below. This information, together with details of English and Welsh bathing waters, will be placed in the Libraries of the House today. This will be supplemented by a report with more detailed results in due course.

<P>
<a name="71204w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to review sentencing procedure for lower level motoring offences resulting in death and injury. Sentencing procedure in individual cases is a matter for the courts. A range of offences exist to deal with those who commit motoring offences, with severe penalties available for serious offences. For example, causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs and causing death by dangerous driving carry maximum penalties of ten years' imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="71204w05.html_para4">The North Report in 1988 considered, but rejected, the creation of a new offence of causing death by careless driving. It concluded that it would be wrong to visit on a driver severe penalties for the tragic consequences of an act which amounted only to carelessness.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1997]:</i> The Home Office is currently considering whether new central guidance to the police on relations with the media would be valuable. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has been asked for its views.

<P>
<a name="71204w05.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Parole Board is facing a continuing and significant increase in its work load. A very important element of that overall work load is the task of advising Ministers on the progression and release of adult life sentence prisoners convicted of murder. At present, the panels considering these cases comprise four members of the Board, always including a judge and a psychiatrist.
<P>

<a name="71204w05.html_para6">By contrast, the panels that consider the release of discretionary life sentence prisoners and those sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure, and those that decide or advise on the release of long term determinate sentence prisoners, comprise only three members. The additional member in mandatory cases incurs costs to the Board of around &#163;25,000 annually, and complicates the listing of cases, leading to delay.
<P>

<a name="71204w05.html_para7">I am satisfied, on the advice of both the current Chair and recently retired Chairman of the Parole Board, that the size of mandatory panels can now safely be reduced from four to three, without risking in any way the quality of advice which Ministers receive.

 Certain provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1911 were repealed by the Official Secrets Act 1989, which came into effect on 1 March 1990. Prior to that date, it had been the practice to require Government Ministers and members of the Civil Service and of the armed forces to sign a declaration certifying that they were aware of the provisions of the legislation. Information about the numbers of those who signed such declarations is not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="71204w06.html_para3">Current practice is to draw the relevant provisions of the Official Secrets Acts to the attention of those most likely to have access to the sorts of information covered by them.

During the period of consultation, which ended on 24 October, the Green Paper was freely available to any interested individuals or organisations, including residents of the MPD. The Government Office for London received over 1,200 written responses, including ones from Hertfordshire County Council, the Boroughs of Broxbourne and Reigate and Banstead.

 The Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 gave legal force in the UK to the Vienna Convention concluded in 1962. However, as a result of the 1985 Government Report on the Abuse of Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges (Cmnd 9497), the Government's requirements and procedures were tightened. Stricter standards are applied, in particular on: size of diplomatic missions; notification of new staff; use of diplomatic premises; handling of diplomatic bags; breaches of criminal law and illegal parking.
<P>

<a name="71204w07.html_para0">Protocol Department within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is responsible for implementing these requirements and monitoring any breaches. To this end, the Department issues a comprehensive memorandum on privileges and immunities to every Diplomatic Mission. A section of the memorandum states the action we will take in the event of any breach of privileges or abuse of diplomatic immunity. This section is given to each newly appointed diplomat with their identity card. All Heads of Mission are reminded regularly of their obligations by the Head of the Diplomatic Service and the Director of Protocol. Protocol Department also controls the duty-free privileges of each mission in relation to alcohol, tobacco and vehicles.

All figures relating to alleged serious crimes committed by diplomats and unpaid parking fines are submitted to Parliament annually and published in <i>Hansard</i>.

The key principles of planning policy are contained in Planning Guidance (Wales): Planning Policy (May 1996) (PG(W):PP): that document is currently under review and a revised version is likely to be published in early 1998. PG(W):PP is currently supplemented by thirteen Technical Advice Notes (Wales) (TAN(W)s) covering particular subjects: a further ten TAN(W)s are planned for publication in 1998.

 I am advised that the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Alkemy and Business Advance companies is shortly to be completed, and the staff who transfer will then be integrated into the TEC. Following this transfer CELTEC will be undertaking a detailed review of all its resources against its prospective business requirements for the 1998-99 financial year. The outcome of this review will be presented to the CELTEC Board in the New Year, at which time the TEC will be able to finalise its business plans and staffing needs. I will write to my hon. Friend at that time with further details, and place a copy of my reply in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="71204w08.html_para5">The cost of any redundancies of staff currently employed by the Hightown Holdings Group of companies which are not transferring to CELTEC is a matter for Hightown Holdings to determine.

 Following the publication of the Government of Wales Bill, which makes provision for the winding up of Tai Cymru, I am pleased to announce that Tai Cymru and Welsh Office Housing Division will be merged to form an integrated Housing Department of the Welsh Office. This will initially be accountable to my right hon. Friend and ultimately to the Assembly.

<a name="71204w09.html_para0">Subject to the enactment of the Government of Wales Bill we propose that the new Housing Department will be formed on 1 January 1999 and will cover all the existing functions of the two organisations. I estimate that the staffing structure of the new organisation will produce long-term pay bill savings of approximately &#163;55,000 per annum, about 20 per cent. of the current pay costs of the two organisations. There will be some short-term setting up costs.
<P>

<a name="71204w09.html_para1">I have today published a consultation paper on the organisation and role of the Housing Department and its relations with other bodies including an enhanced role for local authorities in planning the provision of housing in their areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales which local authorities in Wales will be involved in the Wales evaluation study to test the duty of best value; and if he will make a statement. [19571]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I have received a report from the Best Value Project Group which I asked to evaluate the 26 proposals sent in by Welsh authorities. The Project Group concluded that 23 proposals had reached the stated quality threshold set out in its report and should be used to evaluate the impact of Best Value in Wales. There are 21 proposals from local authorities in Wales, one from a police authority, and one from a fire authority. The Project Group felt this would allow Best Value to be vigorously tested across the whole range of public services in Wales. I am happy to accept the Project Group's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="71204w09.html_para2">Three of the Welsh proposals have also been chosen to participate in the Best Value research programme commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="71204w09.html_para3">I am writing to all those who brought forward proposals and I will arrange for a list of those authorities accepted for both the Welsh and the English studies to be placed in the Library of the House.

<P>

<a name="71204w09.html_para5">Ahead of this there is a need for a wide-ranging debate on Best Value involving local government, the private sector, trades unions and, most importantly, local people. I therefore propose to issue a consultation paper early in the New Year which will seek comments on this and other issues affecting local government in Wales.

The Trust has also been permitted to draw on &#163;200,000 of its 1998-99 capital allocation to supplement those resources. In addition, the Trust is presently drawing up proposals for a major ambulance replacement programme to be tested for a private partnership under PFI. These measures should make a significant difference to the state of the ambulance fleet but I will keep the matter under review.

 As noted in its annual report for 1996-97, the National Disability Council (NDC) advised Government both before and after 3 May of its concerns that the Treaty did not sufficiently protect the interests of disabled people. It urged support for an amendment to Article 6a which had been proposed to combat discrimination based on various grounds, including disability. The NDC also encouraged amendment of Article 100a to ensure that measures designed to harmonise the single market did not inadvertently damage the interests of disabled people.

The NDC subsequently welcomed these positive steps forward for disabled people.

 Local education authorities have a duty to arrange suitable education for pupils who cannot attend school.

We estimate that around half of these children were out of school following an exclusion. The majority of such pupils are of secondary school age. Additionally, it has been estimated that around 10,000 children are educated otherwise than at school under arrangements made by their parents.

 For 1995-96, it is estimated that in Great Britain, 0.8 million children under the age of five years and 2.0 million children aged five-years-old or over were living in lone parent families. A child is defined as an individual aged under 16 or an unmarried 16 to 18 year old on a course up to and including "A" level standard (or up to and including "Highers" in Scotland). A lone parent family is a non-pensioner single adult aged 16 or over with children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he intends reviewing Queen's Regulations and the system of service courts martial; and if he will make a statement. [19115]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w16.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The court-martial system was reformed on 1 April 1997 by a series of measures included in the Armed Forces Act 1996. The reforms were wide ranging and affected the pre-trial, trial and post-trial stages of the court-martial system. The purpose of these reforms was to reinforce the independence of the court-martial, principally by reducing the apparent influence of the chain of command, whilst preserving its necessary involvement.
<P>

<a name="71204w16.html_para2">The reforms meet the European Court's concerns about the shortcomings of the system. The ECHR has recognised our actions, noting

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with satisfaction that the UK authorities had made changes to the court-martial system with a view to ensuring the observance of their Conventional commitments".</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71204w16.html_para3">Although we are not taking any further steps at present to improve the procedures, we are aware that we cannot afford to be complacent. The system is kept under review and will, of course, be looked at as part of the process of preparing for the next quinquennial Armed Forces Bill.
<P>

<a name="71204w16.html_para4">Queen's Regulations are a form of secondary legislation which contain much of the detail relating to provisions in the primary legislation. They also contain other administrative and disciplinary measures to assist with the overall command and administration of the armed forces. As with the primary legislation, these regulations are kept constantly under review and amended when necessary.

<P>
<a name="71204w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No formal directions to MOD accounting officers have been sought or given since 1 May 1997. Under the previous administration, one direction was given within the past five years, in March 1995 in the context of the procurement of medium support helicopters for the Royal Air Force.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The function of the Defence Intelligence Staff is to provide timely and accurate intelligence warning, assessments, and intelligence and geographic support in the most cost-effective manner to MOD Ministers and Central Staffs, the Permanent Joint Head Quarters, NATO and other Government Departments as directed. It employs 4,589 in the headquarters, the Agencies and other parts of the Armed Forces.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w16.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The number of flights carrying special nuclear material each year between UK and US depends on programme requirements which are confidential between the two governments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w16.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 To the best of our knowledge, no Defence Minister has met Major Eric Joyce since 1 May 1997. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my noble Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State have never knowingly met him prior to that date.
<P>

<a name="71204w16.html_para5">Over six years as an Opposition Defence Spokesman prior to 1 May 1997 I met a great many Members of all three Services at all ranks. To the best of my recollection, I met Major Joyce twice: once during the second half of 1995 and again in May 1996.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The MOD owns the freehold i<i></i><i></i>nterest in the site of the former RAF Watton, Norfolk. The former airfield is under the management of the Army and used as an Army Training Area; the two areas for disposal namely, the former Technical and Border Radar Sites, are in the stewardship of the Defence Estate Organisation.<i></i>
<P>

<a name="71204w16.html_para6">The two sites in disposal have been offered for sale on the open market through local marketing agents. An agreed Planning Brief provides for residential use on the Border Radar Site and part residential use on the technical site. Unfortunately these proposed uses cannot be confirmed until the outcome of the Public Planning Inquiry into the Breckland District Local Plan is known sometime in mid-1998.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what monitoring she has instigated concerning whether undertakings received from providers of funeral services following recommendations by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission <i>(a)</i> have been and <i>(b)</i> have not been carried out; and what further action she intends to take to ensure that such undertakings are carried out.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 1997]:</i> Following the MMC's report on the acquisition by Service Corporation International (SCI) of Plantsbrook Group plc, SCI gave an undertaking on 18 December 1996 to divest individual funeral directors' businesses in 10 specified localities, together with undertakings about the future conduct of its business. SCI sold the funeral directors' businesses on 4 April 1997. On 3 November 1997, I accepted a variation to the undertakings given by SCI to allow it to acquire Birkbeck Securities Ltd. (Birkbeck) on condition that SCI disposed of the funeral directing business of Birkbeck's subsidiary, H. Copeland and Son Ltd. within six months. That business has now been sold by SCI.
<P>

<a name="71204w17.html_para0">The task of monitoring the continuing behavioural undertakings is a matter for the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT). His duties in this respect are set out in Section 88(4) of the Fair Trading Act 1973.

<a name="71204w17.html_para1">It is now about one year since the undertakings were given by SCI.

The Commission's proposals met with general approval. However some member states suggested that an independent foundation should be established to manage the assets and the research programme. Another suggested that further work was needed on the roles of the Commission and member states in managing the funds with further reflection on the impact of future Community enlargement.

So far, over 1.5 million copies of the leaflet have been sent to parents, teachers and health professionals. The Department's publication, "Child Health in the Community: A Guide to Good Practice", issued to health and local authorities in September 1996, includes guidance on best practice in dealing with head lice in schools. We shall continue to work with the Department for Education and Employment to promote best practice, focusing on a "whole school approach"--where action is taken at the same time to detect and treat every case of head lice within the school thus minimising opportunities for re-infestation. This approach is actively promoted by the voluntary organisation, Community Hygiene Concern, whose efforts we support through grant aid. In addition Consultants in Communicable Disease Control, who have local responsibility for public health programmes, are currently working on a review document on head lice.

 Good, effective, modern and reliable communication, including the provision of a good, effective, modern and reliable press office, is an essential duty of Government. The Department's Press Office is always looking for ways to improve its services to Ministers. Ministers are always looking for ways to improve communication and the provision of information to the general public and with hon. and noble Member of both Houses. Since 1 May, Ministers and the press office have been constructively working together to deliver the best possible service to both. They will continue to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w19.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to increase public awareness of meningitis; [18879]
<P>
<UL>(2) what sums his Department has spent in each of the last three years on increasing public awareness of meningitis. [18880]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) holds an annual press briefing for journalists to raise public, professional and media awareness of meningitis. CMO also writes to all doctors each year giving advice on the early diagnosis of suspected cases of meningococcal infection and stressing the need for immediate antibiotic treatment and urgent referral to hospital. The Department of Health contributes to the many articles in newspapers and the medical press, and television and radio programmes that appear during the winter increase in cases.
<P>

<a name="71204w19.html_para0">This year's briefing took place on 3 November. This year, we have also revised the Department's information leaflet entitled "Knowing about meningitis and septicaemia" available to the public from GPs' surgeries. Meningococcal infections peak with most cases in children under one year, and there is a second smaller peak in late teenagers. Extra information is, therefore, targeted in these areas. The Health Education Authority (HEA), funded by the Department, produces the leaflet "A Guide to Childhood Immunisations", which includes advice on recognising the signs and symptoms of meningitis and is provided to new parents. The HEA also produce a leaflet targeted at students, "Look out for your mate", which is distributed to colleges and universities. The Department provides funding to both the National Meningitis Trust and the Meningitis Research Foundation to support their valuable information work. Both organisations took part in this year's press briefing.
<P>

<a name="71204w19.html_para1">It is not possible to identify the amount spent on public awareness of meningitis separately as it is a key theme of the Department's, the HEA's and the meningitis charities', information campaigns at this time of year. The costs of preparing, printing and distributing leaflets and posters such as "A Guide to Childhood Immunisations" and "Look out for your mate" are subsumed within the HEA/DH contract covering immunisation awareness. Around one million copies of "A Guide to Childhood Immunisations", which is updated annually, are produced each year and around 1.2 million "Look out for your mate" leaflets and posters were distributed this year. 250,000 copies of the Department's leaflet were printed this year.

<P>

<a name="71204w20.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Provisional figures indicate that last year the UK was 69 per cent. self-sufficient in terms of food and feed products or materials that could be grown in season, in the UK. This figure shows a reduction of about 4 per cent. on the average in recent years, mainly as a result of reduced output and exports of beef and higher levels of imported meat and meat products.

<a name="71204w20.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Samples of cows' milk from farms in the north-east Derbyshire area have been analysed regularly since 1991, when elevated levels of dioxins were first discovered. Samples taken in July 1997 from 19 farms in the Bolsover area showed that levels of dioxins in the milk have fallen and are now generally similar to those found in other parts of the UK. The need for further surveys will be reviewed next year in the light of the results from samples taken in October this year and the next survey planned for July 1998.

 The Government are working with conservation and farming organisations to improve the efficiency and targeting of agri-environment schemes. Existing schemes are regularly reviewed and, where appropriate, we are also developing new initiatives. The pilot Arable Stewardship scheme, which will be introduced next year, is aimed at restoring the wildlife interest of arable farmland areas and includes measures for reversing the loss of plant and animal species which are largely dependent on arable crops. We have also established, through the National Agri-Environment Forum, a working group to address the environmental issues associated with the uplands.
<P>

<a name="71204w20.html_para3">In addition, the Organic Conversion Information Service helps farmers decide whether organic farming would be appropriate for them, as well as providing more detailed advice for those considering conversion. We are reviewing the rates and structure of aid, under the Organic Aid Scheme, for those considering conversion to organic farming. We are also considering, in consultation with farming and conservation organisations, the practicality of drawing up a Code of Good Agricultural Practice for Wildlife and Landscape.
<P>

<a name="71204w20.html_para4">For the future, the Government see a continuing and increasing role for environmental incentive schemes as part of a reformed CAP.

 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the provision of abattoirs. [17688]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71204w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There are currently 29 abattoirs operating the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) in the UK. These were awarded contracts in July 1997 following a competitive tender exercise run by the Intervention Board. It was necessary to reduce the number of abattoirs participating in OTMS as numbers of cattle entering the scheme diminished.
<P>

<a name="71204w21.html_para0">The plants were chosen on the basis of objective criteria, principally proximity to the main production areas, hygiene standards and value for money. Together, they provide more than enough capacity to handle the number of animals now expected to come forward under the OTMS, with an allowance which can be factored in to cope with seasonal fluctuations.
<P>

<a name="71204w21.html_para1">Some journey times may have increased, but in general, all cattle are travelling no further to abattoirs than they were prior to the OTMS and in many cases the distances are shorter. Also, the number of livestock markets participating in the scheme has not changed, so access for farmers should not have been seriously affected.
<P>

<a name="71204w21.html_para2">Although there are no OTMS abattoirs in Sussex, sufficient capacity is available in the South East to handle effectively all cattle presented under the scheme in the area.
