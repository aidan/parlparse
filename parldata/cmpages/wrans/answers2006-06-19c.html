 The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Company Law Reform Bill was updated after the Bill was brought from the House of Lords (24 May 2006) to reflect the amendments that had been made to the Bill since introduction. The Bill is expected to bring savings for business of some &#163;250 million a year, of which &#163;100 million will be for small businesses. As well as the direct savings, the Bill is also expected to lead to indirect benefits, through improved performance, for example through encouraging good practice in company decision-making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="60619w0001.htm_para5"><a name="06061940000015">The direct costs associated with the Bill are expected to be in the range of &#163;8 million to &#163;47 million. The majority of these costs (&#163;6 million to &#163;36 million) are associated with opposition amendments to the "Exercise of Members' Rights" provisions made in the House of Lords. The Government intend to reconsider these during the consideration of The Bill in the House of Commons.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had no discussions with her US counterparts regarding proposals to crop-spray in Afghanistan. The Government of Afghanistan&#146;s eradication policy, as set out in the National Drug Control Strategy, is based on ground based eradication targeted where there is access to legal rural livelihoods. The UK has no plans to undertake or support aerial eradication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="60619w0004.htm_para5"><a name="06061946000042">Eradication on its own will not solve the drugs problem in Afghanistan. It is a useful deterrent where there is access to legal livelihoods. But tackling the drugs trade requires a range of activities including arresting and convicting the traffickers who profit from the trade, and putting in place the development programmes which enable farmers to move away from growing poppy. That is why the UK is spending &#163;270 million over a three-year period on supporting the Government of Afghanistan&#146;s National Drug Control Strategy.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has a number of programmes which seek to provide economic alternatives to farmers who grow poppy in Helmand Province. When in Afghanistan last week, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development announced a UK contribution of &#163;30 million over the next three years in Helmand. However, whether farmers choose to pursue alternative livelihoods to poppy in Helmand also depends on effective law enforcement and a credible threat of eradication. That is why the UK is supporting the multifaceted approach set out in the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy. We believe that the focus on the four key priorities&#151;targeting the trafficker, strengthening livelihoods, reducing demand and developing effective institutions will together have a greater impact on the drug trade.</p>

 The Fire and Rescue National Framework set out the Government's commitment to achieve greater diversity within the fire and rescue service. We are supporting the service to build a more diverse work force, including women, ethnic minorities and other under-represented groups.</p>

We have developed national firefighter selection tests with the aim of ensuring fairness and consistency in selection procedures across the service. The new process will require all applicants to be asked to demonstrate their commitment to equality and diversity in their responses to questions at the application form, written test and interview stages. These are designed to identify that they understand and respect diversity and have a fair and ethical approach to others.</p>

 The cumulative impact of multiple licensed premises on crime and disorder has always been, and continues to be, a matter which licensing authorities are entitled to take into account when representations are made to them about applications for the grant or variation of a premises licences or club premises certificates. This was confirmed by the decision of Mr. Justice Beatson on 11 April 2006 in the unreported case of R (J D Wetherspoon plc) <i> v.</i> Guildford borough council.

 Primary legislation is not required to delist Grade II* listed buildings. Buildings can be removed from the statutory list if the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport considers, having consulted with her statutory advisers, English Heritage, and others as appropriate, that the building no longer has special architectural or historic interest. This is not the case with the Commonwealth Institute. Due to the unique and wider considerations which apply to the Commonwealth Institute, the Government are considering whether special measures are appropriate in this case. No decisions have yet been taken.</p>

 Overall responsibility for installing safety equipment lies with the Employer, under the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act, 1974. In the case of community schools, community special schools, maintained nursery schools, pupil referral units and voluntary controlled schools the employer is the local authority. For foundation schools, foundation special schools, voluntary-aided schools and some independent schools, the employer is usually the governing body of the school.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to the answer of 25 May 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1977W, on departmental staff, what criteria for the award of non-consolidated bonuses were used in <i> (a)</i> 2004-05 and <i> (b)</i> 2005-06; and what assessment he has made of the (i) average size and (ii) number of such awards in those years.

 The criteria for the award of all non-consolidated bonuses used between <i> (a)</i> 2004-05 and <i> (b) </i>2005-06 were unchanged in that they were entirely performance related.

 There is no legal requirement for those entering long-term care to sell a family home to fund their care. Following an individual financial assessment to calculate how much each individual can afford to pay towards the cost of their care, it is entirely a matter for each individual and their advisors to decide how best to meet any charges. Current Northern Ireland legislation provides a 12-week disregard of the value of a residents home following permanent admission to a care home. I am not, however, proposing to promote amending legislation to exclude totally the value of a resident's family home from the assessment of each individual's resources.</p>

 The retirement age for magistrates is 70, with two exceptions.

Second, if a magistrate is adjudicating in a case which is in progress on the day he/she reaches 70, the Lord Chief Justice may, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, direct that the magistrate need not retire until the case has ended.</p>

antisocial behaviour and disrespect is an important part of sustaining these changes. It is essential that the public feel empowered to play their part in tackling antisocial behaviour through greater awareness of the powers available to them and their local agencies. We want to encourage people to come forward, complain and take a stand. The Respect "Taking A Stand" awards and action days held nationwide will continue to stimulate public debate about acceptable behaviour and inform antisocial behaviour practitioners about local activities. We will also ensure that public services can be held to account and deliver on local priorities by introducing regular and systematic "face the people" briefing sessions, involving senior representation from the police and local authorities. Dudley metropolitan borough council (MBC) has taken a number of steps to ensure that action to tackle antisocial behaviour is well publicised throughout the borough. Dudley Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) publishes and distributes two quarterly newsletters, "Dudley Together" and "Home Affairs" to all households and tenants. The local press also publicises details of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) and dispersal notices and most Dudley MBC Neighbourhood Managers hold local community safety forums to inform the community about initiatives and on-going action to reduce antisocial behaviour.</p>

The evaluation is expected to show that benefits have accrued as forces gain experience of operating ANPR in conjunction with the National Intelligence Model to target the detection and prevention of crime. Evidence from the previous &#145;Project Laser&#146; pilot evaluations concluded that officers involved in ANPR achieve more arrests and contribute more offences brought to justice than those involved in general policing.</p>

 The Home Office has taken a number of steps to benefit biodiversity. A national Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) has been introduced across the public sector operated prisons estate, primarily an overarching document covering its designated sites, which encompass seven SSSIs, one NNR and RAMSAR site and a site within a National Park (HMP Dartmoor). There are now six individual designated sites which have their own BAPs, a further 11 locally biodiversity significant sites also have BAPs and a pilot scheme for eight inner-city/urban BAPs is being implemented. Further plans are now being incorporated that will see biodiversity management plans rolled out across the remaining public sector prison estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="60619w0021.htm_para2"><a name="0606206000211">As well as a BAP network the public sector Prison Service has in place a Statement of Commitment for biodiversity and a Statement of Action for biodiversity which were signed by the director general Phil Weatley in March 2003. Also supporting this the Prison Service has set up a strategic biodiversity group which involves a "central partnership" incorporating representatives from English Nature, the Wildlife Trusts, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="60619w0021.htm_para3"><a name="0606206000212">In support of this work the Prison Service has carried out biological surveys at 21 biodiversity significant sites to identify local flora and fauna for action. The service has now put in place over 43 habitat and species action plans involving over 20 separate lead partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="60619w0021.htm_para4"><a name="0606206000213">In recognition of the work that has been carried out on the prison estate operated by the public sector, in 2005 the Prison Service won the Liveable City award for biodiversity. The Sustainable Development Commission has commended these examples of biodiversity good practice.</p>

 The Government are currently considering the responses to its consultation on its proposal to publish a National Action Plan for Tackling Human Trafficking.

Whilst a range of views were presented on tackling issues around child trafficking, the Government will fully consider these responses before it decides whether additional safeguards to protect trafficked children are needed.

<i> [holding answer 15 June 2006]: </i>We are not aware of there being any safe houses specifically for accommodating victims of child trafficking. However, there are accommodation facilities in many locations that will cater for children in need who it is believed may have been trafficked. Planning for children's services is carried out on a locality basis throughout the UK. It is the statutory duty of local authorities under the 1989 Children Act to ensure that safe arrangements are in place to look after individual children at risk, including children from abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="60619w0023.htm_para0"><a name="0606206000541">It is also the responsibility of the local authority to assess any risk of harm and to arrange for the provision of a suitable range of accommodation for all the children in their area. Any lone child in the UK in contact with any statutory or child welfare agency will be urgently referred to the appropriate local authority. The Home Office National Asylum Support Service (NASS) reimburses local authorities who receive unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC) into their care with a total of &#163;140 million p.a. Partnership plans to provide safer arrangements for children who have been trafficked are being incorporated in a Home Office/DfES joint review of how local authorities accommodate children from abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="60619w0023.htm_para1"><a name="0606206000542">The review will aim to deliver improvements by ensuring UASCs are placed in local authority areas where specialist services are in place&#151;including local authority social workers who can recognise and deal appropriately with UASCs who may have been trafficked to the UK. The review is also designed to increase specialisation, end inconsistencies in treatment and enable the retention and development of expertise.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 June 2006]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has no current plans to visit any Invest to Save Budget (ISB) projects or to make a statement. However, he strongly supports the objectives of the ISB programme to create sustainable improvements in the capacity to deliver public services in a more joined-up manner. An example of a project that has continued to receive funding from the Home Office is the joint working pilot between the National Missing Persons Helpline and the Metropolitan police from ISB round four.</p>

 On 24 May, working closely with ACPO, we launched the first nationwide knife amnesty in 10 years. Cambridgeshire Police are participating in this amnesty, which provides an opportunity for the safe disposal of unwanted knives and sharp instruments. The amnesty highlights the dangers of carrying knives particularly to young people. The amnesty runs until the end of June, following which police will undertake robust enforcement as well as educational and other programmes.</p>

We are also working closely with community organisations, providing support through the Connected Fund for gun, knife and gang related projects and supporting organisations such as Be Safe, which runs a programme of education for young people on the risks of carrying knives.</p>

 No central guidance was in operation in 1994 concerning the storage and destruction of information relating to detected crimes. Forces were, however, subject to the relevant legislation that was in place at that time and may have issued their own internal guidance. A Code of Practice on the Management of Police Information (MOPI) was published in July 2005 and came into effect in November 2005. This requires police information to be periodically reviewed and consideration given to its disposal or retention in line with criteria set out in guidance. Guidance to accompany the Code of Practice, agreed with the Information Commissioner, was published in March 2006. This requires that information be deleted where there is no longer a policing purpose for retaining it, i.e. it is no longer necessary; it is no longer adequate or up to date; or it is excessive or not proportionate to the risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="60619w0024.htm_para0"><a name="0606206000628">The guidance states that all records will normally be held for a minimum of six years, but lists a number of issues that forces should consider when deciding whether to retain records for longer. The MOP guidance states that historical data&#151;which it defines as anything recorded prior to the date that the guidance came into effect&#151;must be reviewed when the subject of a record comes to police attention, and that resources dedicated to reviewing other historical records should focus on information relating to certain public protection matters.</p>

The Home Office has supported the work of the British Retail Consortium in developing business crime reduction partnerships, and has provided over &#163;900,000 of funding for them to set up and run the Action Against Business Crime (AABC) Group. This group provides central co-ordination and support for a national network of business crime reduction partnerships in town centres, shopping centres and industrial estates across England and Wales in their work to prevent business crime. The Home Office also encourages businesses to set up &#145;Business Watch&#146; schemes in their area, or to consider involvement in the business improvement district (BID) scheme. There is an accredited Business Crime Partnership in the &#145;Safer Swansea&#146; Community Safety Partnership. One of the first actions of the partnership was to set up a panel which included local businesses and independent members to consider whether those caught shoplifting should be banned from the city centre shopping area.

 Since its introduction in April 2000, the only significant change that has occurred to New Deal 50 plus funding was in April 2003 when the New Deal 50 plus Employment Credit, paid by Jobcentre Plus, was replaced by the 50 plus element of the Working Tax Credit, paid by H.M. Revenue and Customs. Incorporating the in-work incentive for over- 50s into the tax credit system ensured that those households on the lowest income received the most support, rather than flat-rate payments being made regardless of personal circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="60619w0026.htm_para6"><a name="06062014000113">Until March 2003, Employment Credit payments formed the bulk of the New Deal 50 plus programme spend, together with the New Deal 50 plus in-work Training Grant. In 2003-04 the programme spend for New Deal 50 plus still included the remaining Employment Credit payments but, by the 2004-05 financial year, all the New Deal 50 plus Employment Credit starts had completed and all that remained was the spend on the training grant.</p>

 Legislation provides that, when a salary-related occupational pension scheme winds up, any deficiency in the pension fund becomes a debt on the employer. This is designed to improve the protection offered to scheme members when these events occur. It provides a mechanism for the trustees to be able to take action to pursue the debt. It also means that employers will be liable for a debt should the scheme be underfunded. The legislation is not intended to prejudice any other remedy the trustees may have in respect of any deficiency in the scheme's assets.</p>

Regulations came into force on 15 March 2004 that introduce a &#147;full buy-out&#148; requirement to ensure that where a scheme is wound up and its sponsoring employer is solvent, the scheme members are more likely to receive the pensions they expect. Trustees can utilise the regulations if their scheme started to wind up on or after 11 June 2003. From 15 February 2005, regulations introduced a "full buy-out" requirement for schemes whose sponsoring employer became insolvent.</p>

The South West region is planning to centralise Social Fund processing in Bristol. Some limited centralisation has already taken place, including moving the processing of Social Fund claims from customers living in Gloucestershire to Bristol.</p>

Staff at the Jobcentre will then telephone the Social Fund team in South Bristol. There are 10 extensions available for Jobcentre Plus staff to call, however if staff have problems getting through the customer may be given the direct telephone number to try again later.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 June 2006]: </i>Since 1997, claimant unemployment in Liverpool Riverside has fallen by 38 per cent. the number of lone parents on benefit has fallen by 24 per cent and the number of incapacity benefits recipients has begun to fall. The New Deal has helped nearly 5,000 into work. However we recognise that there is more to do, in Liverpool Riverside and the country as a whole.</p>

Each area will be asked to develop a consortium with a shared interest in working together to raise employment rates and improve the economy. This may include local authorities, employers, learning and skills councils, regional development agencies, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus. The key aim of this initiative will be to provide solutions that offer the maximum degree of flexibility, so that local areas can provide local solutions to local problems.</p>

 Our welfare to work programmes have been successful in substantially reducing youth unemployment and, since 1997, long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated. In addition, youth claimant unemployment is close to its lowest level for 30 years. In Hartlepool, youth unemployment has been cut by 32 per cent. since 1997 and long-term youth unemployment by 75 per cent.</p>
