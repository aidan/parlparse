<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51122w01.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Under the new arrangements for local commissioning of national health service dentistry from April 2006, units of dental activity (UDA) refer to courses of treatment that are weighted to reflect their relative complexity. The three main categories of courses of treatment correspond to the three bands in the proposed new patient charging system, which was published for three months consultation over the summer. The proposed weightings for different courses of treatments, that is the number of UDA to which they correspond, were set out in the draft general dental services (GDS) and personal dental services (PDS) contract regulations, which were published in August 2005. The final version of those proposed regulations will be laid before Parliament shortly.

Primary care trusts (PCTs) and dentists will use this as the basis for agreeing new annual contract values and the number of UDA that the dentist is expected to carry out over the course of the year in return for this annual contract value. GDS dentists will be guaranteed an annual contract value based on their reference period earnings, uplifted to reflect 2006&#150;07 pay and prices, provided the dentists agree with their PCT an annual level of UDA to be carried out during 2006&#150;07 equivalent to 95 per cent. of their activity during the reference period.

The tariff will set the price for out-patient attendances and will exclude the additional cost of anti-TNF drugs, for which funding will continue to be negotiated locally.

<a name="51122w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">In January 2004, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on the care of people with eating disorders. The guideline makes specific recommendations for the treatment of adolescents and young people in recognition of their unique needs. Some of the recommendations are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Effective assessment of people with eating disorders, which includes co-ordination of care, the involvement of patients and their carers, providing good information, moral support and getting help early;</p>

This information was obtained from the prescribing analysis and cost tool (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by general practitioner (GP) practices in England and dispensed in the community in the United Kingdom. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a GP practice located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included.<br>

Prescriptions written in hospitals or clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some BNF sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community.<br>

<a name="stpa_87">We have been quite clear since launching our Olympic bid three years ago that Lottery proceeds would form a key part of the public funding package. We have allowed for up to &#163;1.5 billion to be raised in this way, some of which will be raised by new Lottery games solely for this purpose. We expect the non-Olympic good causes to receive up to 5 per cent. less in income, as a result of sales diversion, over the eight-year period from 2005 to 2013. In addition, up to &#163;410 million will be redirected from the proceeds of non-Olympic Lottery games after 2009.

 There is little robust data on the numbers of new entrants by type of farming.

<p>
<a name="51122w14.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">Figures from the June Agricultural and Horticultural Survey indicate the number of holdings in England by farm type in June each year. These figures show the net change in the number of holdings but it is difficult to infer specific information from the figures in terms of new entrants. Please see the following table.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122w14.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">A recent source of information about new entrants to farming is the report into Entry to and Exit from Farming in the UK that was commissioned by DEFRA in 2003. This is available on the DEFRA website at http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/entrvexit/default.asp. Among the more significant findings from this research were that the rate of entry into farming was lower than the rate of exit and that both the rate of entry and the rate of exit were lower than in other sectors. The research found that some 2 per cent. of farmers had entered the industry in the five years up to and including 2003, while up to 18 per cent. of farmers had retired over the same period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122w14.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">Although the study did not look at rates of entry by farm type, there were indications from the research that the proportion of decision makers who have been farming for 20 years or less was highest in the poultry, horticulture and dairy sectors and lowest in the pig and cereals sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122w14.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">Broader information about new UK businesses in the agricultural sector registering for VAT is given in table 2. VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2004. Therefore, although the figures show an overall decline in the numbers of businesses registering for VAT in the agricultural sector between 1997 and 2004, this does not necessarily mean that there was a decline in the numbers of new entrants over the same period.

 Our food security policy ensures consumers have access to a stable and adequate supply of food. Our domestic agriculture industry has an important contribution to make to the continuity of food supply by improving its ability to produce what the market requires. The reformed CAP, in breaking the link between subsidy and production, is encouraging farmers to produce what the market requires, rather than what subsidies dictate. Our farmers are well placed to produce foodstuffs that Europe&#039;s climate is suited to, but we cannot grow all the agricultural products our consumers might want to buy.

 The Highways Agency carried out a Route Management Strategy, on the A19 in 2003 that included an assessment of accident rates and identified specific lengths of carriageway where there was an increased risk of personal injury accidents. While this road is better than the national average for &#039;A&#039; roads in terms of personal injury accidents, a number of improvement schemes were carried out in 2003&#150;04. These included improved lighting, road markings and safety fencing schemes. The Highways Agency will continue to monitor accident trends regularly.

DTI, studied the options for potential renewable fuels for civil aviation. The study examined a whole range of alternative fuels and energy sources including bio-ethanol. Bio-ethanol was found to be inherently unsuitable as it does not contain sufficient energy for a jet fuel, in either mass or volume terms. The practical implications of these two factors are that aircraft range would be reduced compared to conventional fuels, and even if air-frames were redesigned with significantly larger fuel capacity, their take-off weight would be too high.

 The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (as amended) require new buses first used on or after 31 December 2000, with a capacity of more than 22 passengers, used on local or scheduled services to be accessible to disabled people including wheelchair users. The regulations allow operators to provide access for wheelchair users by means of a lift or a ramp, and regulated vehicles also require improved access for all passengers through better step dimensions, provision of handrails and colour contrast markings. The end dates by which time all such vehicles are required to meet the regulations depends on vehicle type and range from 2015 to 2020.

 The next generation of trains must aim for improved energy efficiency and reliability, without compromising safety and comfort.

However the independent 3-year evaluation report of the programme covering all cameras operating between April 2000 to March 2003 concluded that there had been a 33 per cent. reduction in personal injury collisions and a 40 per cent. reduction in fatalities at camera sites Assessment of the programme over the period April 2000 to March 2004 will be contained in the 4-year evaluation report which will be published shortly.

<p><a name="st_179"><a name="51122w20.html_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Government do not intend to install any fixed speed cameras in England in each of the next five years. Speed cameras are installed by the local highway authority as the appropriate solution to a road casualty problem following their investigation of that problem. It is not possible to predict in advance where these road casualty problems may arise. Any speed cameras proposed as part of the national safety camera programme will need to meet the site selection rules that apply at the time before being considered for approval as part of the programme.

<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51122w20.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Department receives occasional representation from road safety groups in support of reduced speed limits, including in villages and outside schools. No such representations have been received from the police at the national level, although we are aware that many police authorities support these measures at the local level.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1866W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122w20.html_para9">
The Department has not undertaken specific assessment of the reduction of speed limits in villages and outside schools. However, research shows a clear link between reducing vehicle speed and accident reduction, with a 1 mph reduction in average speed expected to lower accident frequency by 5 per cent. It also shows that 20 mph zones and 20 mph speed limits can be effective at reducing collisions and injuries in the right situation, in particular when accompanied by traffic calming measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122w20.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_181">Local authorities already have the powers under section 84 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to introduce local speed limits, including 20 mph, if they believe it appropriate to do so. The Department encourages their implementation in areas where vulnerable road users are present, particularly around schools.

 The independent 3-year evaluation report of the national safety camera programme assessed the effectiveness of both fixed and mobile cameras using the criteria of reductions in speed and casualties at camera sites. The evaluation concluded that both types of camera were effective in both respects. Fixed cameras had, on the whole, a greater effect in reducing speeding than mobile cameras, reflecting the fact that fixed cameras affect driving behaviour all the time, whereas mobile cameras operate periodically at each location.

 The Government recognise the concerns of many pensioners, particularly those on low or fixed incomes, about council tax. This Government have already taken action to improve pensioner incomes, spending nearly &#163;11 billion extra on pensioners in 2005&#150;06 compared to 1997 as a result of measures we have introduced since then. On average, after allowing for inflation, pensioner households are about &#163;1,500 better off this year than they would have been under the system which operated in 1997. The least well-off third of pensioner households are, on average, &#163;2,000 better off.

 Firefighters enjoy the same legal protection from violence as anyone else. The criminal law already contains a wide range of power to deal with violent behaviour.

2. Average gross annual earnings for employees on adult rates who have been in the same job for more than a year.<br>

3. Northern Ireland unit level data are collected by DETINI under the same criteria as ASHE. The dataset is then passed to ONS.<br>

4. The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

Since 1 April 2003, all fire and rescue service authorities have been statutory partners in local crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs). This is helping to ensure that the fire and rescue services play a full role in community safety and help local communities to tackle arson and the associated areas of crime.

<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51122w34.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Section 9 enables NASS support to be withdrawn from failed asylum seeking families who are failing without reasonable excuse to take reasonable steps to leave the UK voluntarily, or to place themselves in a position in which they can do so. A lengthy process has been developed which provides oral and written warnings that families&#039; support may be withdrawn if they fail to take steps to leave. Whether support is actually withdrawn depends on the families&#039; reactions, and it is not therefore possible to provide a realistic estimate of the number of families which might be affected by any national roll out of section 9.

The strategy set out a range of measures to strengthen our border controls and reform our asylum system. We expect that the deterrent effect of these measures will further reduce the number of unfounded asylum applications in the United Kingdom. The &#039;New Asylum Model&#039; will introduce faster tightly-managed processes for all new asylum claimants, including: a new screening process for asylum applicants that enables us to put them through a processing track tailored to the characteristics of their claim; a clear contact management strategy for each processing track including compulsory contact management for those not detained; and the introduction of specialist case managers who will manage each asylum case from application right through to integration or removal. Measures to strengthen our border controls include; the roll-out of fingerprinting of all visa applicants; expanding the network of airline liaison officers who advise check-in staff on forged documents; introducing electronic checks on all those entering and leaving the country; and the roll-out of new technology, including the e-borders programme, to create a fully integrated system of immigration control.

<sup>(32)</sup> When considering the number of domestic violence incidents for Wales as a whole, there is a discrepancy between the 2000&#150;01 figures for the number of domestic violence incidents provided by HMIC for this PQ and figures generated by HMIC for a PQ in 2002 (Hansard No. 56175 16/05/02). HMIC has advised that this may be due to the changes in the definition of a &#039;domestic violence incident&#039; over this period which could have led to subsequent changes in the HMIC data.<br>

The Act will also give the police further powers to tackle alcohol related disorder, for instance through allowing temporary or permanent reductions in trading hours.

Notes:<br>

1. Framework changes occurred in January 2000 and September 2003. Changes in the way groupings in lessons were recorded may mean that data are not directly comparable from periods of one framework to another.<br>

2. From January 2000 to July 2003, the inspection arrangements included full and short inspections. The majority of lessons observed will have been in full inspections. The most effective schools had short inspections.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 7 November 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 108W, on Bridgewater primary school, Northamptonshire, in what circumstances departmental school design and funding guidelines provide funding for kitchen facilities; in what circumstances departmental guidelines judge kitchen facilities to be required by the school or local authority; and if her Department will provide funding for kitchen facilities at the Bridgewater primary school. [29186]</p>








<p><a name="st_374"><a name="51122w42.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Departments area guidelines are applicable to any school but are particularly aimed at new school buildings. The Department bases its allocations for specific central programmes such as Building Schools for the Future on these guidelines and so these allocations will be sufficient to enable kitchen and dining facilities to be included.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122w42.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">It is not a legal requirement for a school to have a kitchen. Schools and local authorities are expected to provide nutritious and freshly prepared meals. It is the Government&#039;s view that this would ideally be from an on-site kitchen, but it can be achieved off-site if the appropriate arrangements are in place.
</p>

<a name="51122w42.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_332">Over the current three years, 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, the Department is providing direct capital grants to Northamptonshire schools of some &#163;32 million, also formulaic funding allocations of &#163;49 million. In addition, during this period, there was an allocation to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1944W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the local authority of &#163;100 million in respect of a Private Finance Initiative, and nearly &#163;5 million in respect of the Targeted Capital Fund programme.

<sup>(45)</sup> The combined LEA and school-based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school-based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>





<sup>(46)</sup> Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under-fives funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under-5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only available since 1999&#150;2000. Other LEA maintained pupils includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from the form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(47)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to the section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting to schools.<br>

<sup>(48)</sup> 2004&#150;05 data is regarded as provisional and is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

Figures are as reported by Wolverhampton LEA and are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

The figures are inclusive of the funds that will transfer to Wales from September 2006 when HE student support devolves to the Welsh Assembly Government; the Access to Learning Fund (which can be paid as grant or loan); and the tuition fee grant which is paid directly to the institution. The tuition fee grant will be replaced by the tuition fee loan over the period. <br>
