 A consultation on the use of wild animals in circuses came to an end earlier this year. We are currently considering the 13,000 or so responses before we publish a summary. In the meantime, Lord Henley has been meeting with representatives of welfare groups and the circus industry. An industry body has proposed a self-regulatory system but no decisions have been made.</p>

 Earlier this year, DEFRA and the Home Office published a public consultation on dangerous dogs and how to encourage responsible dog ownership. A number of proposals were raised during the consultation, including the issue of whether to extend the criminal offence of allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control to private places. The consultation closed on 1 June and received 4,250 responses. We are currently analysing these responses and will publish a summary of the responses to the consultation very soon.</p>

 There are no current plans to ban the use of electronic training aids for animals. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 already makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal and to treat an animal in a way that fails to meet its welfare needs. It also provides additional powers to prohibit the use of any such equipment through secondary legislation if considered necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="101124w0001.htm_para0"><a name="10112461000025">However, we recognise the need for further research into this issue. DEFRA is currently carrying out a study into whether electronic training collars cause unnecessary suffering, and this is expected to be completed next year.</p>

 The Beak Trimming Action Group, comprising representatives from industry, welfare groups, DEFRA, scientific and veterinary professions will be reconvened at the start of next year. It will be tasked with establishing an action plan to work towards a ban on routine beak trimming of laying hens in 2016. The review will consider results of on-going research projects that are investigating practical and realistic ways to rear laying hens without the need for beak trimming and will consider the outcome of industry study tours to those European countries where they do not beak trim. As the impact of feather pecking is greatest in systems of management which do not house birds in cages, the risk to the welfare of laying hens from injurious pecking is likely to increase after the ban on conventional cages comes into force on 1 January 2012. A review in 2015 will allow producers time to increase their experience of managing flocks in alternative systems.</p>

 The Parliamentary Outreach service aims to spread awareness of the work, processes and relevance of the institution of Parliament, encouraging greater engagement between the public and the House of Commons and House of Lords. Since its launch, the level of demand for outreach sessions has increased continuously. Parliamentary Outreach now employs two main methods of increasing levels of public understanding and participation: (a) regional parliamentary training sessions, and (b) sessions explaining how to engage with select committees and the process of public bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="101124w0002.htm_para1"><a name="10112471000208">Over the past 12 months, the Parliamentary Outreach team has run 456 events, of which around 4.39% (20) were run in partnership with local authorities and non-departmental bodies. The majority of events are run in partnership with organisations in the voluntary and community sectors, ensuring maximum reach and value for money. Some 13,000 people have attended outreach events during the past 12 months. The vast majority of attendees are from organisations which have either a strategic remit to increase civic engagement or a direct objective to engage with parliamentary processes. As the partner organisations organise the attendance at the regional events, it is not possible to give an accurate figure of the percentage of attendees who are employed by local authorities or non-departmental government bodies. Analysis of the attendees at the Public Bill workshops in the last two months shows that 9.4% of those who registered to attend are employed in these fields.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State announced our intention to reform and reinvigorate informal adult and community learning. We are currently at the stage of planning the reform programme and I am considering proposals for the process and timescales. You will know already that we place a high value on the views of our partners in the sector. We will work closely with a wide range of organisations to maximise the potential of informal adult and community learning to support the development of the Big Society and create progression routes into further learning, training and employment for people who are disadvantaged.</p>

 This Department has been having ongoing discussions on the principles and process for the disposal of all regional development agency (RDA) assets and liabilities. Detailed guidance to RDAs is still being prepared and this will enable plans to be developed for transition.

 'Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth' (16 November 2010) sets out our funding strategy for post 19 further education (FE) and skills for the spending review. We have been clear that it is only fair that those who benefit the most from training make a greater contribution towards the costs of their course, but also only fair for them to make this contribution when they are indeed realising those benefits and earning a good salary.</p>

 To support the Browne Review and the Government's response, we commissioned research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) to explore how changes in fees, grants and loans impact on participation. This research drew on variation in grants, fees and loans over the period 1992-2007, and indicated that a £1,000 increase in fees results in a 4.4ppt decrease in university participation, while a £1,000 increase in loans results in a 3.2ppt increase in participation, and a £1,000 increase in grants results in a 2.1ppt increase in participation; therefore offsetting any effect from an increase in fees.</p>

The Government are also due to consult on the details of the National Scholarships programme aimed at providing further targeted support for students. The more progressive repayment system of graduate contributions to the cost of university education will also protect any low-earning graduates.</p>

Since 2006, in response to consumer concern, Ofcom has introduced a range of measures that has made 0870 and 0845 calls cheaper for calls from landlines, although this has not been possible for calls from mobile telephones due to the additional costs, which are usually involved in transmitting and connecting the call from the mobile network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_562"><a name="101124w0002.htm_para79"><a name="10112476000579">Earlier this year, Ofcom started a review of the consumer experience of non-geographic numbers to consider whether they need to restructure the regulations that control the delivery of non-geographic calls services to consumers. These are telephone numbers beginning with 03, 05, 070/076, 08, 09, 116 and 118. They expect to publish their consultation shortly, and full details of its proposals will be available on its website:</p>

The principal function of the Board was to advise One North East on applications for regional selective assistance under the Grant for Business Investment (GBI) scheme and its predecessors of over £250,000 and less than £2 million.

 This Department has been having ongoing discussions on the principles and process for the disposal of all regional development agency (RDA) assets and liabilities. Detailed guidance to RDAs is still being prepared and this will enable plans to be developed for transition. Until these plans are completed there will be no decisions on the sale or transfer of assets (outside ordinary course disposals) unless there are compelling time pressures which require an early decision be made. The plans will aim to secure maximum value for money for the taxpayer and optimum benefits to the region in question.</p>

 Table 2.9 of the supplementary material to the June Budget 2010 (see p. 27) provides the latest projections for the UK's net contribution to the EU budget for the fiscal years 2008-09 (outturn) to 2015-16 (forecasts). New projections will be provided by the Office of Budget Responsibility in their autumn forecast at the end of November.

The EU budget for the period 2007-13 was agreed by the previous Government in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_636"><a name="101124w0003.htm_para72"><a name="10112476001373">The Government are very concerned about the UK's growing contributions to the EU budget and is working hard to reduce them. In particular, in the negotiation of the 2011 EU budget, the Government have not reached an agreement with the European Parliament given their wider demands beyond the 2011 EU budget. The Government will continue to engage constructively in further negotiations aimed at securing taxpayers a fair outcome for the 2011 EU budget.</p>

From now on the EU budget will reflect the spending cuts being made by national governments, including in the crucial 2014-20 EU spending round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="101124w0004.htm_para1"><a name="10112476001455">The data provided are, therefore, not fully comparable.</p>

 Making an accurate estimate of the amount of yield from a graduate tax of 2% of a graduate's income over 20 years is dependent on a variety of criteria and behavioural impacts. We are therefore unable to provide an estimate of the yield as requested. To do so would be misleading on the basis of the evidence we have available at the present time.</p>

The data are sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS)<sup>(1 )</sup>which collects detailed financial information across a range of income streams including income from the education maintenance allowance. There are concerns as to the reliability of EMA data on the FRS with a small number of relevant cases and amounts received being, in some instances, inconsistent with the implied entitlement. Therefore estimates of the impact of the removal of EMA on child poverty rates should be treated with some caution.

 Schools, and for children with special educational needs (SEN) statements, local authorities have responsibilities to ensure that children with SEN, including children with autism, make successful transitions between primary and secondary education. There is statutory guidance on this transition in the SEN code of practice. Advice is also available from other schools and local authorities, autism specialists, guidance previously published by the Department, such as 'Supporting pupils on the autism spectrum', published as part of the Inclusion Development Programme, and from the Autism Education Trust, which the Department funds and which has published a Transition Toolkit. The Department is aware that the transition from primary to secondary school can be particularly difficult for children with autism because of their resistance to change and will monitor research which is being conducted on this issue, such as that which is being carried out currently by the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 October 2010]:</i> Innovation, diversity and flexibility are at the heart of the Free Schools policy. We want the dynamism that characterises the best independent schools to drive up standards in the state sector. In this spirit we will not be setting overly prescriptive requirements in relation to qualifications: instead we will expect business cases to demonstrate how governing bodies intend to guarantee the highest quality of teaching and leadership in their schools. No school will be allowed to proceed unless its proposals for quality teaching are soundly based. Ensuring each Free School's unique educational vision is translated into the classroom will require talented people with a diverse range of experience. As is the case with all schools, Free Schools will be subject to employment law and the Equalities Act 2010 with regard to age requirements.</p>
