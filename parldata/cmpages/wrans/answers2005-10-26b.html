 We have worked hard with the LSC to simplify funding arrangements including reducing the number of separate budgets for further education. This has reduced bureaucracy and has made college funding more simple and transparent. We would be reluctant to reverse this process, which has been welcomed by colleges and their staff. Success for All&quot;, the strategy for reforming further education and training, makes clear that the Government&#039;s approach to pay is to enable local flexibility to meet local needs and to encourage a clear link between pay and individual performance. FE colleges and sixth form colleges are autonomous bodies, which negotiate pay and conditions with staff and their unions without Government involvement either nationally or locally.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51026w09.html_spnew9"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Provision for the costs of administering student finance applications is made within the overall funding for education provided to local authorities (LA). It is for LAs to determine how much they spend on student finance administration within that settlement. Some LAs have claimed that their costs increased as a result of the introduction of the national Protocol IT system in 2004&#150;05. We are therefore investigating this issue but do not intend to make a decision on reimbursement until the costs for the 2005&#150;06 financial year are known. This work will be completed around early summer 2006.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51026w10.html_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 In July 2004 the Government restated its commitment to tackling crime and disorder through the publication of the 2004 spending review, which included a Home Office target to bring crime levels down by a further 15 percent. between 2002&#150;03 and 2007&#150;08, and more in those areas with the highest crime. The crimes covered by this target include vandalism. Through the Government Offices for the regions and the Welsh Assembly Government, we have negotiated three year targets with each crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) in England and community safety partnership (CSP) in Wales as their contribution to the delivery of the national target.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51026w10.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">In the south-east, the Government Office has taken forward these arrangements via a series of communications with partners, including a regional target-setting event. They also spent time with Gravesham CDRP discussing the targets to be achieved by 2007&#150;08. In terms of volume, criminal damage was the largest contributor and the importance of reducing this type of crime was therefore stressed. Gravesham subsequently set a target to reduce criminal damage, including vandalism, by 30 percent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51026w10.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_66">As part of the TOGETHER campaign, we have also published a range of step-by-step guides on tackling various aspects of antisocial behaviour, with two more in preparation. Much of the advice in these documents is applicable to vandalism. We are also currently collecting examples of good practice that will be disseminated to all partnerships later this year to help them drive down vandalism in their areas.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">Wastewater from Bangor receives mechanical screening before discharge to the Irish Sea via a marine outfall at Briggs Rock. The screening plant originally comprised two automatic rotating screens which removed most solids and materials from the sewage before discharge to sea. The screens became increasingly difficult to maintain and repair due to difficulties in sourcing replacement parts, and as a result became more expensive to operate. The condition of the screens continued to deteriorate and they were replaced by fabricated bar screens in late 2004. These screens had to be cleaned manually twice per day and were not as effective as the automatic rotating screens. This unfortunately led to some pollution on the adjourning coastline which Water Service cleaned up.</p>

During commissioning of the plant in late September 2005, Water Service became aware that this new water supply to the screening plant was causing water pressure problems in the Groomsport area. Water Service responded quickly with temporary measures to return the water pressure in the area to acceptable levels. These measures included reducing water usage at the screening plant to a minimum. However, this means that the new screens cannot operate effectively at all times and new instances of pollution may result under flood conditions. These will be cleared up by Water Service if they occur.</p>

 No official estimate has been made of the number of people in Northern Ireland who will take advantage of the new status of civil partner. The regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the Civil Partnership Act 2004 attempted to estimate the proportion of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population in Great Britain who will be in a civil partnership in 2050. It proceeded on the assumption that 5 percent. of the adult population in Great Britain is lesbian, gay or bisexual. It then examined evidence of take up of comparable partnership schemes in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands and concluded that the take-up would be small, possibly in the region of 5 percent. to 10 percent. of the proportion of the heterosexual population who choose to marry. The legislation, however, has implications for same-sex couples who choose not to form a civil partnership but to live together as if they were civil partners.

 The information is not available in the format requested. The rate of unfitness for all housing tenures at the Northern Ireland level was 4.9 percent. in 2001 and 3.8 percent. in 2004. The rate of unfitness in the Housing Executive and housing association sectors is around one per cent. Whilst it is not possible to provide a robust and precise figure below the Northern Ireland level because of the sample size, it is unlikely that there is any significant variation across Housing Executive districts.

<a name="51026w16.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_98">With the majority of stock built since 1970, and the relatively high level of resources committed to the maintenance and improvement of social housing, levels of unfitness in both the Housing Executive and housing association sectors has remained minimal. Across all tenures, the unfitness rate remains much higher in isolated rural areas and some inner city areas of Belfast and grant aid and urban renewal will continue to play important roles in reducing unfitness.

 Credible independent estimates suggest that between three and five million people will face serious food shortages over the coming months. This is mainly as a result of bad governance by the Government of Zimbabwe, combined with erratic rains and the impact of HIV/AIDS which are also affecting neighbouring countries. The World Food Programme, with support from DFID and other donors, is presently providing food aid for one million vulnerable Zimbabweans, mainly children. Operations will be scaled up as hunger becomes more widespread in the months before the next harvest.

The Zimbabwe Government&#039;s own efforts to mitigate the suffering caused by their mass evictions have been limited, and in some instances, the Government has obstructed the wider humanitarian effort, for example by refusing to accept the provision of tents and other temporary shelters for those without shelter. Despite these difficulties, a range of UN and non-governmental agencies are operating relief programmes reaching 40,000 affected households, including those affected by HIV and AIDS, with supplies of food, blankets, medical care and other essential items.

 The Government&#039;s modelling assumption is that around 10 per cent. of treatment orders will be community based in the early years of the new Mental Health Act. In preparing for the introduction of the new Act, the focus should be on ensuring the appropriate use of community-based treatment by professionals, rather than arbitrarily defining numbers of those who should be subject to it.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will extend the powers of the Local Government Ombudsman to include complaints made against the actions of a local authority monitoring officer.  [21825]</p>








<p><a name="st_218"><a name="51026w25.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Section 26 of the Local Government Act 1974 provides that the Local Government Ombudsman may investigate complaints of injustice caused by maladministration in connection with action taken by or on behalf of a local authority. While it is for the Courts to interpret the statute, an allegation of maladministration in respect of an action by an officer of the authority such as the monitoring officer would already appear to fall within the Ombudsman&#039;s remit.

 Under the first dome sale competition, which ran from March 1999 until February 2001, there were six firm final proposals, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Oct 2005 : Column 448W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
which culminated in preferred bidder status being given to two bidders in succession. When neither of those proposals could be brought to completion, the second sale process invited expressions of interest for both a future use for the dome and compatible uses for associated land on the Greenwich Peninsula. Three substantive proposals were received, although only two of these offered specific uses for the dome itself. Subsequently, the Meridian Delta Ltd. consortium with the Anschutz Entertainment Group was selected as best satisfying the assessment criteria, and negotiations were concluded with that consortium in May 2002. The commercial contracts went unconditional in June 2004 and work is now well under way on the new arena inside the dome.

<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51026w25.html_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 In the last year for which an assessment was made, 2003, it was estimated that fees covered on average between 72 per cent. and 87 per cent. of the costs of handling planning applications depending on how overheads are measured. Since then fees for handling planning applications in England have been increased. These increases came into effect on 1 April 2005. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates that these increases will generate an additional &#163;68 million of extra resources for LPAs in England in 2005&#150;06 which should lead broadly to full cost recovery.

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51026w25.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 October 2005]:</i> The former Property Services Agency (PSA) was responsible for the provision of property management services, building construction and maintenance and appropriate related supplies to Government departments. The Office for the Deputy Prime Minster has responsibilities for residual matters relating to the former PSA in respect of (1) the parts of civil estate for which the former Department of the Environment was responsible and (2) any outstanding financial liabilities of the PSA. In practice these responsibilities mostly relate to residuary liabilities for former PSA employees. ODPM does not maintain a registry of former employees of the PSA.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

2. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3. From November 2003 IS figures are severely affected by the introduction of pension credit, which replaced MIG on the 6 October 2003 and extended IS entitlement to customers aged 60+. Pension credit cases are not included in the figures in the table. It is not possible to produce comparisons across 6 October 2003 on a consistent basis, whether pension credit cases are included or not.<br>

4. &#039;Lone parents&#039; are defined as single parents aged under 60 and not in receipt of a disability premium.<br>

5. &#039;Others&#039; are defined as everyone who isn&#039;t a lone parent.<br>

6. There is a small overlap between jobseeker&#039;s allowance (income-based) (JSA(IB)) and jobseeker&#039;s allowance (contribution-based) (JSA(C)) caseloads&#151;claimants in receipt of income-based JSA who would also be entitled to the contributory element are counted in both categories.<br>

7. Incapacity Benefit figures include credits only cases.<br>

 The information is not available. The Government are currently inviting notifications of affected pension schemes to the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), and are therefore obtaining some information on the number of members facing pensions losses due to company insolvency. In due course, information will also be collected on individual members in schemes qualifying for FAS, including their addresses, at which point it may be possible to make some estimates of numbers affected in particular areas.

 Voice stress analysis is one technique we are considering to help improve customer service and eliminate fraud and error in telephone claims for benefits.

We will not be piloting voice stress analysis on telephone claims to disability living allowance.

 The UK Presidency has not put forward any detailed proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). What we have asked for is a proper debate on the future of the EU budget, including the CAP, and we have seen public contributions from politicians, political commentators, economists and fanners across Europe. As Presidency, we have also held formal consultations with each of the member states, as well as Romania and Bulgaria, in order to ensure that we understand their views and concerns on the EU budget for 2007&#150;13, including the fundamental review of Community spending that we 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Oct 2005 : Column 463W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
have proposed. The purpose of such a review would be to ensure that EU expenditure is focused on areas where the EU can add the most value in comparison with spending at the national or regional level, taking into account the global economic and political challenges faced by the EU. The UK Presidency believes agreement on the 2007&#150;13 budget can and should be reached in December, and we will have to reflect, in the light of member states&#039; views and the proposals published by the European Commission on 20 October, how best to do this. We have also made good progress towards an agreement to reform the CAP sugar regime. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will update Parliament on these negotiations in due course.

The size of UK missions overseas is determined by a range of factors including changes in demand for consular and visa services; reductions due to efficiency measures; and reprioritisations in line with changed UK priorities. Data are not held centrally for non-FCO staff, eg Ministry of Defence or the Department for International Development, in British missions overseas. The following embassies and High commissions are therefore those that have expanded or contracted FCO staff numbers in the last two years. Comparable data are not held centrally for earlier years.

<p><a name="st_257"><a name="51026w30.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 The UK Presidency tabled two discussions by Deputy Permanent Representatives to the EU on this issue in early July. Among other things, it was agreed to hold fewer, more focused debates and to limit the length of interventions by Council members. We think this has made Council meetings more efficient. These discussions were based on the guidelines set out in Annex IV of the Council Rules of Procedure, which were agreed by all member states in 2003 in preparation for the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 member states. The Rules of Procedures seek to focus Council meetings on the key decisions to be taken by Ministers.

<p><a name="st_259"><a name="51026w30.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 The Government welcomed the proposals to create a European External Action Service (EEAS) designed to support the proposed new EU Foreign Minister role, as part of the Constitutional treaty. The Constitutional treaty proposed that the Service would be established by the Council, which is made up of member states, on the basis of a proposal by the EU Foreign Minister, and not by the Commission, although the Commission would have to give their consent to the proposals. As the hon. Member is aware, the future of the Constitutional treaty, and hence the possibility of an EU Foreign Minister, is uncertain following the June European Council. We do not believe that an EEAS, as envisaged in the treaty, can be introduced without treaty change.

 Due to the political climate in Zimbabwe, the meetings with some of the sources were conducted on the basis that their identities would not be revealed except in relation to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) proceedings. The AIT decided to make an order under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 by which those sources which had requested anonymity were protected, and accordingly the team&#039;s summary of their evidence was not made public. However, the team&#039;s evidence is noted in detail in the determination of the AIT, which can be viewed on the AIT website at http://www.ait.gov.uk/determinations.do
