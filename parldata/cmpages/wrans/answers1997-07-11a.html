<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Results of the key stage 3 English tests were due to have been returned to schools by 27 June. The majority were returned by that date; the remainder were returned during the first two weeks of July as the scripts were cleared through the final checks put in place by the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority. The test results are returned to the national data collection agency by the markers and not by schools.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Collins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the abolition of the binary divide in higher education and its performance. [7459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Our policy is to foster diversity of missions among institutions within a unified higher education sector so that they can offer a range of choice, meet a variety of needs among students as participation widens, and be genuinely responsive to students, staff and wider community interests. We shall of course wish to consider carefully any relevant recommendations of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education under Sir Ron Dearing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement about the future of the modern apprenticeship scheme. [7214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 We have no doubt that the training of young people in the workplace to meet the needs of employment has a vital and increasing role to play in sustaining competitiveness to 2000 and beyond. Modern apprenticeships are a key component of this and are making a vital contribution to raising skills. Evaluation studies have consistently shown that Modern apprenticeships are highly popular, of high quality, and meeting the expectations of both employers and young people.
<P>

<a name="70711w01.html_para0">We want to sustain and build on this success and intend to develop modern apprenticeships in every sector where there is a demand. There are currently 70 sector frameworks approved with more expected in the next 12 months. Since modern apprenticeships began, over 100,000 young people have started training. There is every sign that employers' demand for Modern Apprentices will continue to grow and we and Training and Enterprise Councils will work together on how best to respond to that demand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Geraint Davies: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will make a statement concerning Government policy on public interest immunity. [8777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 In accordance with the approach adopted by the last Government and set out in the paper placed in the Libraries of the House on 18 December 1996, public interest immunity will not be asserted by the Government unless the relevant Minister believes that disclosure of a document or piece of information will cause real damage to the public interest. The test will be applied rigorously.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 1997 : Column: 617</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70711w01.html_para1">Where public interest immunity applies, Ministers will nevertheless make voluntary disclosure if they consider that the interests of justice outweigh the public interest in withholding the document or information in question. In all cases, a Minister's claim for public interest immunity is subject to the Court's power to order disclosure.
<P>

<a name="70711w01.html_para2">The approach will be followed in both criminal and civil cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many 16 and 17-year-olds have received severe hardship allowance in each year since their entitlement to benefit in respect of unemployment was withdrawn. [7891]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Our objective is to reduce poverty and welfare dependency and to promote work incentives. We will develop a system that supports work, savings and honesty. One of our first steps is to focus on helping people off welfare and into work.
<P>

<a name="70711w01.html_para6">Unemployed 16 and 17-year-olds who register for work and training can exceptionally apply for benefit if they would otherwise face severe hardship. The number of such young people receiving benefit fluctuates throughout the year but the latest estimate is that some 12,000 receive it at any one point in time.

 Modernising the Social Security system is a key priority of this Government. We will streamline services to provide better, simpler more efficient services to claimants and other customers. There are no plans to restore the Benefits Agency Freeline service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how much child support maintenance has been assessed to date but not paid; and what proportion of this is currently assessed to be collectable. [5437]<P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amount of child support maintenance where a full maintenance assessment is in place, that had not been paid at the 23 June 1997, was &#163;557,493,252.
</FONT></UL><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The proportion of child support maintenance that is currently regarded as collectable is 48%, taken from the last published Debt Analysis Exercise which was carried out in September 1996. Using this proportion the amount deemed to be collectable is &#163;267,596,761. A further Debt Analysis Exercise has been undertaken this year, and the findings, (once signed off by the National Audit Office), will be published in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts.

<a name="70711w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Standing Committee of The European Convention on the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes is currently reviewing its 1991 recommendation on the welfare of animals farmed for fur. We shall be pressing for adoption of the highest possible standards, paying proper regard to the welfare of the animals concerned. We will not support any convention that weakens present welfare standards. This does not affect the Government's commitment to bringing an end to fur farming in this country: we are urgently considering how this is to be achieved.

 The Environment Agency (and in areas where they exist, Internal Drainage Boards) provide advice to local planning authorities on risks of flooding from rivers or the sea when they are consulted in connection with development plans or planning applications. They also determine the design flood levels for new and improvement flood defence works that they are themselves empowered to construct on rivers or on the coast.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Cormorants are protected by the 1979 EC Birds Directive, implemented in the UK by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This Act provides for them to be shot under licence in strictly limited numbers in cases where they are causing serious damage to a fishery and where there is no other satisfactory solution. There are no powers to undertake a general cull.
<P>

<a name="70711w02.html_para1">As a licensing authority under the 1981 Act, the Ministry must issue licences in accordance with the requirements of the Act and I cannot, therefore, relax the conditions under which they are issued.

No information is available by type of court for persons committed to custody for non-payment of council tax or community charge, as in nearly all cases no court code had been recorded centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many mandatory drugs tests have been made on prisoners since the inception of the scheme; how many tests have proved positive; in how many cases where a positive test has arisen the prisoner has challenged the findings with legal aid; in how many cases the prisoner has been discharged from prison before his challenge to the positive test has been processed; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="70711w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 Between April 1996 and March 1997, the first year in which all establishments undertook mandatory drug tests, almost 57,700 samples were taken under the random testing programme. Of these, some 24 per cent. tested positive for drugs. Information on the number of cases in which legal aid has been granted pursuant to challenging a mandatory drug test result, and on the number of prisoners discharged before a challenge is completed, is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="70711w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We intend to introduce statutory regulation of the private security industry. We will not be able to bring forward legislation in our first year of office, but will use the time to consult with the industry and others on the best way to provide a comprehensive, effective and streamlined system. We want to look beyond the narrow proposals put forward by the previous Government, which focused only on licensing for the contract guarding sector of the industry. In Opposition, we welcomed the recommendations of the Home Affairs Select Committee on regulation. However, the Committee did not offer a detailed blueprint and we will therefore consider the industry as a whole to decide what action is needed. Recruitment of guards and bouncers will certainly be considered as part of this process.

Figures for the cost of resolving the Year 2000 problem will, therefore, be available in October.

<P>
<a name="70711w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Sharing information about health and healthcare is central to the National Health Service Executive's Information Management and Technology Strategy for the NHS. The establishment of a networking infrastructure makes it possible to examine the potential for telemedicine and online booking of appointments, together with the electronic transfer of test requests and results. The network can also be used to deliver multimedia training material to clinicians, together with health educational and informative material that can be targeted at specific groups of patients and the public--for example, on smoking--that could be made available through general practitioner surgeries and clinics.
<P>

<a name="70711w06.html_para0">Scope for direct public access to health information is clearly more limited--it is paramount that there should be no compromise to the security and confidentiality of clinical information systems. Nevertheless there is considerable opportunity for the Department, the NHS Executive, and the NHS to make available generic health information and information about the NHS; an increasing number of trusts and health authorities are already creating publicly accessible websites on the Internet. There is interest within the Department and the NHS on extending these as communications possibilities open up through public library networks and the proposed public access kiosk.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you know, the Minister of Transport in London, Miss Glenda Jackson, has asked the Agency to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning road schemes under construction. Lawrie Haynes, Chief Executive, has asked me to reply as he is away from the office at present.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked for details of projected costs for each of these schemes together with actual costs. As these schemes are currently under construction and consequently final accounts have not been agreed with the contractors concerned, it is not possible to supply the actual costs. To publish estimates of the final outturns would pre-empt discussions still in progress with the contractors concerned. I therefore enclose a list of all schemes currently under construction with details of their tender costs.

<a name="70711w08.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Collins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department <i>(a)</i> is undertaking, <i>(b)</i> has evaluated and <i>(c)</i> has conducted into the effects on pedestrians of the positioning of exhaust outlets of heavy goods vehicles and public service vehicles at ground level; if he will introduce legislation to require repositioning of exhaust outlets at the top of vehicles, along the lines of that introduced in the United States; and if he will make a statement. [7460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w08.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government is not aware of any research into the effects on pedestrians of the positioning of exhaust outlets of heavy goods and public service vehicles and has not considered making it mandatory to reposition exhaust outlets at the top of vehicles. It is however a requirement that buses have their exhaust pipes at the rear or on the off side of the vehicle.
<P>

<a name="70711w08.html_para1">Exhaust emissions from heavy vehicles are being addressed through a series of improvements in vehicle design and exhaust after-treatment systems, together with in-service enforcement measures, which are aimed at achieving a general standard of air quality. Although, against this background, it would not appear that the position of the exhaust pipe will have any significant impact on health, it is nevertheless a factor which we shall take into account as we explore with industry how even cleaner and more efficient vehicles may be produced.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his policy for reducing the noise of traffic on motorways and trunk roads which pass through residential areas; and if he will make funds available for noise-reducing programmes. [8122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The policy towards the mitigation of the noise of traffic on motorways and trunk roads near to residential properties derives from the Land Compensation Act 1973 and the associated Noise Insulation Regulations. On roads or motorways constructed or improved since 17 October 1969, appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of traffic noise have been provided and owners of affected properties have been able to claim additional compensation for the consequential lowering of the value of their property. It is not our policy to provide further measures to reduce the noise of traffic on trunk roads and motorways after the works have been completed and there are no plans to allocate funds for this purpose. In exceptional cases, where a trunk road was built before 17 October 1969 and not subsequently improved, noise barriers have been provided where it could be shown that

<P><I>11 Jul 1997 : Column: 644</I><P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if drivers of private buses are entitled to refuse to carry a pupil they believe will cause dangers to safety on the bus. [7821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w09.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Public Service Vehicle (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990 entitle a bus driver both to remove any passenger who puts at risk or unreasonably impedes or causes discomfort to any other passenger or to operating staff, and to request a police constable to remove such a person. The driver also has responsibility under general legislation to exercise proper control of the vehicle, and to ensure that the vehicle does not exceed its legal carrying capacity.
<P>

<a name="70711w09.html_para1">If the vehicle is operating under contract, any additional grounds on which drivers may refuse the right of carriage are a matter for the operator and the body hiring it under the terms of the contract. A relevant factor in the case of a vehicle hired by a school may be whether the pupils are accompanied by a supervisor or not.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 9 July 1997]:</i> Export licences were granted in November 1996 to British Aerospace for 16 Hawk aircraft and equipment for Indonesia. These covered a contract signed in 1996, and represent the second phase of Hawk sales to Indonesia agreed in principle in 1993. They cover the 16 aircraft subject to the second of the contracts referred to in the then Minister for Defence Procurement's answer on 5 February 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>621</i>, to my hon.

<P>

<a name="70711w10.html_para0">My predecessor had been wrongly advised when, in announcing the grant of these licences on 21 November 1996, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>676</i>, he referred to them as covering the second consignment of Hawk aircraft in respect of the 1993 contract.

the 1993 contract had already been granted as announced by the then Minister for Trade on 19 December 1995, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1081.
<P>

<a name="70711w10.html_para1">The error arose from a mistaken interpretation on the part of officials that the 1993 contract covered both the original order of aircraft and equipment licensed in 1995, and the second phase to follow. This second phase had, however, separate contractual arrangements.
<P>

<a name="70711w10.html_para2">Thus, export licences have been issued on two occasions, first, covering 24 aircraft and equipment (announced 19 December 1995) and secondly covering 16 aircraft and equipment (announced 21 November 1996).

 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> The Information Society is a concept encompassing the converging information technology, electronics and communications industries, their products and services and the infrastructure of the connecting networks. It involves the ability electronically to access very large quantities of information and entertainment on demand, to interact with and manipulate large quantities of data, to transact remotely and to communicate while on the move. It is a society where interactions and events are no longer determined by geographical position or physical separation. It will have a major impact on the economic and social fabric of our lives, and should be developed to create opportunities and benefits for all citizens.

 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> The Comprehensive Spending Review will look at all aspects of public expenditure to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent so as to fulfil the Government's manifesto commitments. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual areas of expenditure prior to its conclusion. Within the DTI, the Review will include the work of the Insolvency Service and of Investigations and Enforcement Directorate and the resources devoted to these areas.

<a name="70711w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> Following the making of a disqualification order the court concerned must notify the Registrar of Companies so that the details can be entered of the Register of Disqualified Directors. My officials in Companies House and the Insolvency Service are considering what further information relating to disqualified directors could be made available and in what form. When a disqualification order is made a local press release is issued which gives the full names of the directors disqualified, the name, trading style and address of the company (or companies) which failed together with summary of the unfit conduct found by the court.
 
<P>

<a name="70711w10.html_para5">The Department also issues a quarterly press release to the main media outlets covering disqualification statistics and notable disqualification cases which occurred during the period. This release is also copied to number of accountancy, legal and business journals which follow up particular cases which interest them. I am concerned to ensure that the profile of this area of the Department's activities remains as high as possible and that the public generally are made more aware of the steps which are being taken to deal with directors who abuse the privilege of limited liability.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what plans he has to develop a system of consumer education; and what budget will be allocated to the project. [7786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70711w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> A wide range of current activity on consumer education and information is supported by the Government. This ranges from our support for advice and information from the Citizens Advice Service to specific advisory campaigns such as those on fireworks safety. We are placing increasing emphasis on providing consumers with information on their rights under new legislation, such as that on Timeshare, from the point of introduction of the legislation. Consumer education will be subject to review, as will all policy areas, under the comprehensive spending review of my department.
