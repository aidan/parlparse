<a name="11128w01.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, for what reason <i>(a)</i> the hours required from and <i>(b)</i> the salary paid to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards are being reduced.  [15535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kirkwood </B> 
 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 23 November 2001, c. 484w]:</i> The time commitment established for the first Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards was four days a week not three. However, the first Commissioner expressed the view towards the end of his appointment that the Commissioner's contribution could be reduced to two to three days a week, provided that some work could be delegated to the Registrar of Members' Interests. Three days a week was then established as the time commitment for the present Commissioner, and it was on this basis that she was offered the appointment.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations she has made to the Government of Uzbekistan regarding their policy on British and French humanitarian aid entering Afghanistan.  [18195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have not made any personal representations to the Government of Uzbekistan on UK or French aid entering Afghanistan. However, the UK is fully supportive of the representations made by the humanitarian agencies of the United Nations to the Government of Uzbekistan with regard to the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the outcome was of the international meeting held in Washington on 20 November on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan; and if she will make a statement.  [18194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The USA and Japan co-chaired a conference on Afghanistan's reconstruction in Washington DC on 20 November. It was attended by senior officials from over 20 countries, including the UK, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 2001 : Column: 872W</I><P>
as well as the United Nations, international financial institutions and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para0">The conference agreed the need for long-term international support for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, the need to involve Afghans&#151;in particular Afghan women&#151;in all phases of the recovery and reconstruction effort; the importance of recovery intervention that demonstrates a quick impact; and the central role of the United Nations. A steering group has been established to guide reconstruction, co-chaired by the US, Japan, the EU and Saudi Arabia. The first meeting of the steering group will take place in Brussels in December.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what plans she has in place to assist Afghan refugees when they return to their home towns inside Afghanistan; and what plans she has to take account of the needs of women and children in planning and implementing refugee assistance activities.  [18196]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We fully support the UN's efforts under Ambassador Brahimi to help with the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan, including that which will support returning refugees. This will involve such measures as expanding basic health services, carrying out emergency repairs to infrastructure, de-mining and the reopening of education facilities.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para1">We also strongly support Ambassador Brahimi's commitment to addressing human rights issues and his commitment to the involvement of women in discussions. As recovery activities begin, the programmes that we support will be designed and monitored to ensure that women and children benefit.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para2">The principles and priorities guiding our approach are outlined in our paper entitled 'Afghanistan&#151;Recovery: An emergency plan for the first 100 days'. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her work with <i>(a)</i> serving and <i>(b)</i> former child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  [16074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We continue to work for the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation of the negative forces in the DRC in line with the Lusaka peace accord and are closely monitoring the situation.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para3">During the period June 2000&#151;April 2001 we provided a grant of &#163;150,000 to Save the Children for their demobilisation project in the provinces of North and South Kivu. This aimed to provide child soldiers with the social and economic support they required in reintegration into their families and respective communities. We have also provided &#163;400,000 to Rwanda to assist with the DDR programmes for fighters recently from the DRC. This DDR programme includes a special component to provide immediate care for 500 former child soldiers captured in poor physical condition and re-integrate them with their families and communities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_wqn6"><B> Tony Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action she is taking with respect to Africa to prevent global patent rules having a negative effect on health.  [16070]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement includes flexibilities which should enable developing countries in Africa and elsewhere to protect their public health in situations of crisis or national emergency. Until now, a lack of clarity around these flexibilities had been a source of concern.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para4">The Government, with the European Commission, worked hard to ensure that the Doha Ministerial produced a meaningful declaration on TRIPS and public health. We welcome and fully support the proposals in the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health and the World Trade Organisation's (WTO's) efforts to ensure the TRIPS Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' rights to protect public health.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para5">The Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, which I established earlier this year, is looking at how international intellectual property rules might need to develop in future best to take account of the interests of developing countries. It is due to report in June 2002.
<P>

<a name="11128w01.html_para6">There is of course more to improving access to medicines in developing countries than global patent rules. The World Health Organisation recognises four key factors. These include sustainable financing, affordable pricing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs. My Department remains committed to working with our developing country partners and other international organisations to address all these issues, which are particularly pertinent in Africa. To this end we have pledged US$200 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria; set up a Working Group on Access to Medicines to look at options on differential pricing and increasing research and development; and committed over &#163;1 billion since 1997 to help developing countries put in place effective health care systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what financial assistance has been given to Turkey by her Department in each of the last three years; what was the amount of funding; what the projects were for which the funding was allocated; and what supervision her Department has undertaken of the development of these projects.  [17881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Given Turkey's relative wealth and development we do not have a bilateral development assistance programme. We did provide Turkey with over &#163;1.4 million in response to the 1999 earthquake disasters, in the form of tents, medical supplies, blankets and a variety of other humanitarian assistance. Turkey also receives substantial assistance from the EU MEDA programme and through the international financial institutions to which DFID is a major contributor. Our share of EC commitments to Turkey during the last three years has been over &#163;50 million.

<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what actions her Department is taking to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe; and what assessment she has made of the impact of President Mugabe's decision not to allow aid agencies to distribute emergency food supplies.  [18633]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are closely involved in the development of a humanitarian assistance plan by the United Nations Development Programme in Zimbabwe in which UN agencies and NGOs are expected to play a key role. This plan is presently being discussed by UNDP with the Government of Zimbabwe on behalf of all potential providers of funds. We have also begun an initial supplementary feeding programme for 280,000 people (predominantly children) in the worst hit areas. We have not been informed of any decision not to allow agencies to distribute emergency food supplies.

 It is important that departments mainstream women's issues into policy making and delivery. The Women and Equality Unit has developed a framework to encourage policy-makers to challenge each stage of policy making. It asks a series of questions to help ensure that policies meet the different needs of women and men. It has been piloted in the Departments of Health and Lord Chancellor's Department and will be reviewed in the New Year.

 The Mandelkern Group has met five times since March 2001 and at its last meeting on 12&#150;13 November adopted its Final Report. This report was presented by the group's chairman, M.

the Presidents of the European Commission, European Parliament and Council of Ministers. I have placed a copy of the report in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="11128w05.html_para6">The report represents a significant achievement. For the first time, representatives of all fifteen member states have signed up to a document setting out in detail the actions that need to be undertaken in order to improve Europe's regulatory environment. It contains a number of concrete, practical recommendations and an Action Plan with realistic timings. In particular, the Action Plan asks the Commission to:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Establish a new, comprehensive impact assessment system, covering all Commission regulatory proposals, by June 2002;
<P>
<BR>
Establish a central web-based consultation register for all EU consultations by June 2002;

<BR>
Adopt a standard minimum 16-week consultation period from March 2002;
<P>
<BR>
Spearhead a 40 per cent. reduction in the volume of Community acts by June 2004, arising from concerted codification of European legislation by the institutions;
<P>
<BR>
Launch a new targeted simplification programme by June 2002 of existing European legislation in all areas; and

Create throughout the Commission a centrally supported, effective network for better regulation by June 2002.

 Civil partnership registration and associated rights and responsibilities raise a number of complex issues, which have prompted a growing debate within society. The Government are watching this debate with interest; however, it does not have a settled view.

 The core opening hours for the tri-service armed forces careers offices (AFCOs) and their satellite recruiting offices are from 09.00 to 17.00 Monday to Friday. Trials of Saturday opening were carried out in 1988, 1993, 1996 and 2000. During the 2000 trial the level of recruiting activity was monitored but the result from many areas was found to be disappointing. From autumn 2000 the AFCO staffs were authorised to open or close offices on Saturdays based on local conditions, resources and priorities.

 Exercise Saif Sareea 2 finished on 29 October. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State announced on 26 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 549&#150;64, that a force drawn from the exercise would be retained in the region to provide the operational flexibility to deal with a wide range of contingencies.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para0">This force comprises an Amphibious Task Group based around HMS Illustrious and HMS Fearless, including 200 men of 40 Commando Royal Marines (with the rest of 40 Commando held at high readiness in the UK), and Nimrod maritime patrol and Hercules transport aircraft. A Tomahawk-armed submarine presence and a number of reconnaissance and air-to-air refuelling aircraft are also in the region.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para1">Following the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, a number of units from 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines that had taken part in Exercise Saif Sareea 2 were placed on reduced notice to move in case they were required to support humanitarian or other missions in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para2">Royal Marines from 40 Commando have subsequently been deployed to Bagram airfield. The deployment to Afghanistan of other units or personnel which took part in Exercise Saif Sareea 2 remains under review: no decisions have been taken.

 NATO's response to the 11 September attacks included the invocation of Article 5 of the Washington treaty, which states that an attack on one Ally is an attack on all, for the first time in the Alliance's history. This has been supported by a series of specific actions, including deployment of NATO's Airborne Early Warning Force and the Standing Naval Force Mediterranean. The longer-term implications of the events of 11 September, including for the Alliance's force structures and for relations with Russia, are currently under discussion within the Alliance.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para3">The EU Special Council on 21 September agreed to co-operate with the US in bringing to justice and punishing the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks, and approved a set of measures to combat terrorism, including enhancing police and judicial co-operation, developing legal instruments, putting an end to the funding of terrorism and strengthening air security. The General Affairs Council on 8 October, and again on 20 November, confirmed that all partners strongly support the US and UK military action.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para4">The attacks have reinforced the need to build and maintain defence relationships with partners throughout the world. The unprecedented level of international support in the fight against terrorism demonstrates clearly 



<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 2001 : Column: 911W</I><P>
the value of having strong defence relationships. As part of our work on a further chapter to the Strategic Defence Review, we are looking very closely at the impact of 11 September on international organisations, including NATO and the EU, and on our regional interests, not least given the need to sustain long-term coalitions against international terrorism. I expect to publish conclusions in the early summer of next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many <i>(a)</i> pensioners, <i>(b)</i> widows of pensioners and <i>(c)</i> their estates were identified as entitled to tax free pensions under the pre-1973 Attributable Tax Exercise of 1999; and how many fell into the same categories in cases arising from aggravated invaliding.  [18006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w07.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We do not have available figures for the numbers of pre-1973 Royal Navy and Royal Air Force pensioners, widows of pensioners or estates entitled to tax free attributable pensions. This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, tax exemption was applied as appropriate in these cases.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para5">The number of pre-1973 Army pensions, widows of pensioners or their estates identified as entitled to tax free pensions is as follows:

 We are continuing to upgrade the RAF's fleet of Tornado GR1 aircraft to GR4 standard. The GR4 has been in operational service with the RAF since June and to date 104 GR4s have been delivered.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para7">The GR4 upgrade includes: Hand on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS); Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR); improved navigation and warning systems (LINS/GPS/GPWS). In addition, the GR4 is now able to deploy the all-weather interim precision guided bomb, as well as laser guided and unguided bombs. The upgrade also paves the way for the eventual integration of Storm Shadow, Brimstone and the Raptor reconnaissance pod on to GR4.

<a name="11128w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no standing EU rapid reaction force. An EU-led crisis management operation would take place only where NATO as a whole is not engaged. The decision to proceed on a particular operation would be taken on a case by case basis, but the types of operation the EU might undertake could include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. These are commonly known as the Petersberg Tasks. The European Security and Defence Policy does not cover war-fighting operations.

<P>
<a name="11128w07.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not monitor the number of rough sleepers. However, MOD has been working in partnership with the Rough Sleeper's Unit (RSU) to put in place preventive measures to reduce the ex-service component of rough sleeping, against the target of making an overall reduction in rough sleeping of at least two-thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para9">The Social Exclusion Unit Report published in December 1999 highlighted that between a quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the armed forces at some stage, predominantly as national service men. Since then the RSU in partnership with the MOD has set up schemes to help those vulnerable to rough sleeping, before, at the point of and after discharge.
<P>

<a name="11128w07.html_para10">Figures published in August by the RSU showed that as of June 2001 there had been a 62 per cent. reduction.

 NATO's Defence Capabilities Initiative was launched at the Washington Summit in April 1999 with a view to addressing shortfalls in military capabilities across the Alliance.

The next report is due to be presented at the December Ministerials, with the HLSG's final report at the Prague Summit next year.

<a name="11128w08.html_para0">Since 1999 NATO nations have been working hard to implement the DCI. Progress has been made in many capability areas, including interoperability; logistics co-operation; air to air refuelling; air and sealift; and acquisition of precision-guided munitions. The UK's own performance within the Defence Capabilities Initiative compares very well with the Alliance average.

For example, a number of seminars were held with learning providers in 2000, prior to the introduction of the national framework for individual learning accounts, and these continued into 2001. At these events providers expressed a wide range of opinions. In September 2000 James O'Brien, Managing Director, Pitman Training, wrote to Ministers to express concern that the programme was open to abuse but that the cap on public support for each individual's ILA account introduced to help control such abuse had been set at too low a level. We have not yet been able to trace any earlier correspondence on the specific topic of potential abuse of the ILA scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in relation to youth services in each local education authority how many hours of provision are made <i>(a)</i> directly by the LEA <i>(b)</i> on behalf of the LEA and <i>(c)</i> independently of the LEA.  [18623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Under the Learning and Skills Act 2000 the provision of the youth service is the responsibility of local education authorities (LEAs). The Department for Education and Skills does not collect information on youth service hours of provision that are made directly by the LEA, on behalf of the LEA or independently of the LEA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how she proposes that the work of rural education action zones be carried forward following the transfer of responsibility for EAZ schools to the Excellence in Cities programme.  [18624]<P>

<P>
<a name="11128w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Wherever possible, we aim to find ways of continuing to support ex-zone schools following the end of each zone's statutory term. My officials are starting discussions with each zone on the future of the zone, with a view to having firm proposals well before the end of its statutory term.

<P>
<a name="11128w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilots are being evaluated over a three-year period, and we will be basing our decisions about any national roll-out on the evaluation evidence. From the beginning, we have made clear our commitment to publishing reports which set out the independent evaluators' main conclusions. The first reports were published in March this year and the next report is due for publication early in 2002. The quantitative analysis which is being carried out compares performance in the areas where we are piloting EMAs against "control areas" where EMA is not available.
<P>

<a name="11128w10.html_para0">Early findings from the evaluation show that EMA appears to have raised participation in education. The statistical analysis estimates an average gain in participation in pilot areas compared to control areas, among EMA eligible young people, of around five percentage points.
<P>

<a name="11128w10.html_para1">Although we do not yet have figures on attainment, the qualitative aspect of the evaluation has found some evidence of a positive effect on young people's performance and commitment to study.

 The Department is not aware of any issues regarding the ability of part-time lecturers to offer quality support to their students. NATFHE recently published a report 'in From the cold' about part-time lecturers in higher education, which did not uncover any problems in this area. Membership of the ILT helps lecturers to ensure that they are equipped with the skills necessary to be able to give a high standard of teaching to their students. The ILT encourages membership of part-time staff.

 It is not possible to give a breakdown of costs of the works in Hertfordshire alone. We know from our discussions with the Strategic Rail Authority, Railtrack and Virgin Trains that the project is facing problems in terms of cost increases and uncertainty about the timescale for delivery. Works in Hertfordshire will include major track, signalling and power supply replacement. There are major packages planned for the summer of 2002 and spring 2003 in the Hemel-Tring area, and major resignalling works planned for the Watford area in 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government are committed in the 10-year Plan for Transport to tackling the maintenance backlog for local authority roads, bridges and street lighting. Over &#163;30 billion is being provided for local road maintenance over the next 10 years, an extra &#163;9 billion (27 per cent. in real terms) above the funding levels in the previous 10 years. Capital expenditure on maintenance, which is used to tackle deterioration, will increase by nearly &#163;7 billion over the 10 years.
<P>

<a name="11128w11.html_para0">Funding for the maintenance and renewal of street lighting is currently made through the Highways Maintenance Standard Spending Assessment element of Revenue Support Grant. No specific provision has been made in the 2002&#150;03 capital maintenance settlement for renewal of street lighting. The first priority in the 10-Year Plan is to halt the deterioration in carriageways and footways and to continue the bridge strengthening programme. Additional provision for street lighting renewal may be made through the LTP system in later years. For the present, authorities have discretion over the funding provided for maintenance and smaller integrated transport schemes and may use this to fund capital works on street lighting where this is a local priority.
<P>

<a name="11128w11.html_para1">DTLR is aware that street lighting columns in a number of authorities are failing structurally, but does not have sufficient information to determine the number of columns that are unsafe. Local authorities have agreed with DTLR that a national condition survey for street lighting should be introduced, and that information from this should be used to compile a national inventory. In future years the inventory could be used to target funding for tackling the street lighting backlog.

 The Government's spending plans for public transport in London and elsewhere were set out in "Transport 2010: The 10 Year Plan", issued in July 2000. The 10 Year Plan provides over &#163;25 billion of public and private investment between 2001&#150;02 and 2010&#150;11. In addition, London will also benefit from some national rail schemes.

 In order to obtain and retain a Public Service Vehicle (PSV) Operator's Licence, the bus operator must satisfy the relevant Traffic Commissioner that he is of good repute, professionally competent, of appropriate financial standing, and is able to maintain his vehicles properly.
<P>

<a name="11128w12.html_para5">In cases where it appears to the Commissioner that appropriate vehicle safety standards are not being maintained, he can call upon my Department's Vehicle Inspectorate to investigate.

 The Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995 and the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Northern Ireland Order 1998 introduced probationary periods for newly qualified drivers. Under these provisions, the licence of any driver who accumulates six or more penalty points in the first two years after passing their first driving test will be revoked automatically. To regain a full licence, a provisional licence must be obtained and the theory and practical tests taken and passed again. In accordance with the Government's Road Safety Strategy, we intend to consult shortly on a wide range of issues regarding newly qualified drivers.

 Over the last three years, London local authorities have been free to install traffic calming features complying with regulations, and no information is held centrally on such features. The Secretary of State's authorisation was required for "non-complying" features up to April 1999, when this requirement was replaced in London only by a requirement to notify the Secretary of State of such features. No applications for authorisation were received from London local authorities in the two years to April 1999, and no notifications have been received since.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate he has made of the average cost to local authorities of introducing 20 mph zones in residential areas.  [18481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The design and implementation of 20 mph zones is a matter for each local traffic authority and therefore estimates have not been prepared centrally. Costs will vary according to the size of the zone, the type and number of the speed controlling measures used and the quality of the materials. From past experience costs of typical schemes are likely to be in the order of &#163;100,000 to &#163;200,000.

 The introduction of traffic calming measures is a matter for local highway authorities. We have no details of the amounts spent by authorities since 1992.

<a name="11128w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The concept of a hierarchy was considered as part of the Speed Review and the Government's Road Safety Strategy, both published last year.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para1">The Transport Act 2000 committed the Government to consider the development of a rural road hierarchy for speed management purposes. Following Royal Assent the DTLR set up a Working Group of professionals and the main interest groups. The Group has prepared a thorough report that raises some interesting points and recommendations. As required by the Act, the Secretary of State has today laid copies of this report before each of the Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para2">I commend the Working Group for the excellent job they have done in identifying the benefits of a hierarchy. I am also grateful for their frank assessment that currently, if it were developed as a system of different speed limits, a hierarchy would be costly both financially and in terms of environmental intrusion. Also, given the necessary infrastructure and behavioural changes required, the road safety and quality of life benefits could take too long to realise.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para3">I am grateful to the Group for identifying the clear links between the development of a hierarchy and several other Road Safety Strategy initiatives. Above all, I agree that the DTLR's assessment framework would be the best place to carry out the work to determine criteria for assigning roads within the hierarchy. As such, I fully accept their recommendation to incorporate the speed limit setting element of the hierarchy within the development of the assessment framework.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para4">They rightly identify the signing issues as a big obstacle to progressing the hierarchy as they have proposed it. The DTLR will shortly be commencing work on the Road Safety Strategy commitment to review speed limit signing regimes. I have instructed officials to consider the signing elements of the hierarchy report as part of this work.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para5">The Group recognised the need for traffic calming measures to support speed limits in order to achieve changes in vehicle speeds. The forthcoming DTLR project to develop practical speed management measures on rural roads will be the best vehicle for testing such traffic calming treatments.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para6">Of course, there are innovative measures that have already been tried by my Department, like vehicle activated signs, that will in future be more widely applied where suitable. Detailed guidance on the use of vehicle activated signs will be produced next year.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para7">Both the Working Group and the Speed Review identified the need for more information before we can properly assess the case for lower rural speed limits. I am therefore committing the DTLR to undertake a survey of vehicle speeds on a representative sample of rural roads to ensure that decisions are evidence based.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para8">With the package of measures I have outlined here, and those in the Road Safety Strategy, I am convinced that we will be able to build on this report and deliver real benefits to those who live, work and travel in rural areas.

 Local strategic partnerships (LSPs) are not executive bodies. Their purpose is to co-ordinate the activities of their members in order to tackle local problems. Those members will include representatives 



<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 2001 : Column: 945W</I><P>
from the public, private, voluntary and community sector. Recent legislation has extended the ability of public sector bodies such as health authorities and local authorities to work in partnership with organisations in other sectors. Executive responsibility for implementing the partnerships' strategies rests with the partner organisations.

<P>
<a name="11128w15.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions by what methods the local strategic partnerships assess needs of the local people and find those who are often excluded.  [18666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w15.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) will involve the public, private, community and voluntary sectors to ensure that initiatives and services work together locally. LSPs will devise and implement community strategies and local neighbourhood renewal strategies, which will improve the delivery of local services generally, with a specific focus on deprived areas. These strategies should build on information from local people on what they need and want, rather than working from the top down. The statutory guidance, Preparing Community Strategies, refers to an analysis of needs which should be carried out by the various partners on the LSP. Considerable background information will already exist.
<P>

<a name="11128w15.html_para11">LSPs must include local people, especially those from deprived neighbourhoods and from excluded groups, such as black and minority ethnic groups and older people. LSPs will need to provide them with training and support so they can be fully involved from the start. The Government have established the Community Empowerment Fund, which will provide &#163;36 million over the next 3 years to create 'Community Networks' in the 88 most deprived English areas. In each area, CEF moneys will be given direct to a local voluntary organisation chosen by the regional Government Office. This 'lead organisation' will form a Community Network to ensure a high level of community representation on the LSP.

 Accessibility regulations for new trains, buses and coaches have been introduced under Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what guidelines govern the eligibility of local authorities for neighbourhood renewal funding.  [18667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w16.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The list of authorities eligible for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund has been determined by taking those authorities that are among the 50 most deprived on any of the six measures in the Indices of Deprivation 2000. On this basis 81 authorities would be eligible. In addition, there are transitional arrangements for those authorities that were within the 50 most deprived areas on any of the four measures under the old Index of Local Deprivation, but are not in the list of 81 authorities that qualify using the Indices of Deprivation 2000. Therefore, a further seven local authority areas are eligible for the Fund.
<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para2">The funding each authority receives is intended to be related to the severity of the deprivation within its area. The sum they receive is based on a standard amount per head of population that live in wards in the most deprived 10 per cent. on the Indices of Deprivation 2000. This is underpinned by a minimum allocation of &#163;200,000 in 2001&#150;02 for authorities with no wards in the most deprived 10 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w16.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There are 39 New Deal for Communities (NDC) partnerships. The performance of each partnership is currently assessed through an annual review in February each year. The 17 Round 1 Pathfinder partnerships were assessed in February 2001. The Round 2 partnerships were not assessed, as their delivery phase did not begin until April 2001.
<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para3">The NDC Programme has begun to have some positive impacts. For example, in the Sandwell NDC area in the West Midlands there has been an overall reduction in robberies of 48 per cent. since April 2001. East Manchester NDC has recorded a 30 per cent. reduction in crime following implementation of a crime reduction strategy. In the Haringey NDC area between April and August 2001 soliciting and loitering were down 57 per cent. on the same period last year.

<a name="11128w16.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Social Exclusion Unit published a report on rough sleeping in July 1998 in which the Prime Minister set the tough target of reducing the number of people sleeping rough in England to as near to zero as possible and by at least two thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para4">The Rough Sleepers Unit (RSU) was subsequently set up to deliver the Prime Minister's target and published it's strategy "Coming in from the Cold", in December 1999, which outlined a raft of new policies and services:

 I have today made a direction that all safety reports provided under the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 should be excluded from the public registers maintained by the Competent Authority, that is the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agencies.




<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 2001 : Column: 948W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para8">This is a sensible precautionary step taken on security grounds in the light of the current situation following the tragic events of 11 September. It is a temporary measure which will give time for sensitive information to be removed from existing safety reports, and the amended reports restored to the public register.
<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para9">Hazardous facilities, with the potential for causing major off-site accidents are registered with the HSE, the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, under the COMAH Regulations. These include major chemical works, petrochemical and gas installations and high quantity users of flammable/ explosive/toxic substances (e.g. chlorine at water treatment works).
<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para10">The 430 most hazardous ("top-tier") sites have to prepare a detailed safety report describing the hazards presented and safety precautions taken. The regulations require safety reports for top-tier sites to be placed on public registers. The registers are maintained by Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency
<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para11">At present only a small number of the safety cases are on the public register. The remainder would have been put on over the next few months.

<P>

<a name="11128w16.html_para12">It is important to note that the action on removing safety reports would not affect the arrangements in place to give the public vital safety instructions on such sites. People who are liable to be affected by an accident at a COMAH site are given specified information about the establishment, the major accident hazards and the safety measures that are in place. It is the site operator who has to provide this information independent of the safety report. This will ensure that the emergency services and the public know how to react in the event of an accident.

 We are in the process of reviewing progress against all the drugs strategy targets. Progress on the public service agreement target to reduce levels of repeat offending among drug misusing offenders by 25 per cent. by 2005 and by 50 per cent. by 2008 is currently measured by the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme which provides estimates of repeat offending drug misusing offenders (defined as the proportion of arrestees using heroin and/or cocaine/ crack at least once a week and who have offended at least twice a month in the last twelve months). The proportion of arrestees falling within this category for the financial year 1999&#150;2000 was 15 per cent. This will provide an interim baseline against which progress can be tracked.

 The public service agreement targets for the evaluation and significant expansion of probation and court referral schemes were achieved through the evaluation of the Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTO) pilots and the roll-out of the DTTO to courts in England and Wales on 1 October 2000 respectively. 2,288 DTTOs were made in the first six months of 2001&#150;02, against the full year target of approximately 6,000 orders. Under the comprehensive spending review settlement, the Government provided &#163;20 million for the implementation of DTTOs in 2000&#150;01 (the first six months after roll-out) and &#163;40 million for 2001&#150;02, ring-fenced for the purpose.

 Direct Government funding for tourism in England is now based on a three-year funding agreement with the English Tourism Council (ETC). Grant in aid is budgeted in terms of annual allocations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the impact of the foot and mouth crisis on tourism in the south-west.  [18417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w20.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 For the English tourism industry as a whole, our best estimate to date is that the loss of revenue in 2001&#150;02 due to the foot and mouth disease outbreak is likely to be about &#163;3.3 billion in value added terms over the eight-month period (March to October). We have no comparable figure for the south-west at this time.
<P>

<a name="11128w20.html_para1">The west country enjoyed an Indian summer, which has extended the tourist season. This is helping to alleviate the loss of business due to the foot and mouth outbreak. In particular, it appears that senior citizens who would usually be heading for holidays in North America are cancelling and instead taking holidays at home.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The London to South Wales and the south-west multi-modal study (SWARMMS) which is currently in progress is looking at solutions to problems on the main transportation corridors in the study area. Completion is expected by April 2002. Two of the main road and rail corridors pass through east Devon. Comments have recently been sought from stakeholders and the public on a provisional strategy which addresses both existing and future problems. The next stage, which is developing individual plans in more detail, is under way for the multi-modal corridors in the study area and four study-wide theme plans.
<P>

<a name="11128w20.html_para2">One of the study's theme plans addresses tourism and is considering the numbers of tourists, their movements and characteristics and identifying schemes and measures that cater for their needs in a sustainable manner. This will provide the more detailed information needed and develop the overall strategy.

<a name="11128w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made as to the effect on tourism in east Devon of <i>(a)</i> the foot and mouth disease outbreak and <i>(b)</i> the terrorist attacks on 11 September; and if she will make a statement.  [18284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Our best estimate is that the revenue loss to the English tourism industry as a whole for March to October due to foot and mouth disease is likely to be around &#163;3.3 billion in value added terms. We have not attempted to assess individual regions, such as the east Devon constituency, since the available data do not enable this to be done with a sufficient degree of reliability.
<P>

<a name="11128w20.html_para3">Reports suggest that the main impact of the drop in overseas tourists since the terrorist attack of 11 September has been felt in London rather than in the regions and some south-west businesses have reported a good autumn, possibly the best in the last 20 years. However, it is too early to predict with any accuracy what the effects of the war against terrorism are likely to be on tourism in the south-west.

<P>
<a name="11128w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has from time to time received representations about the accountability of the lottery distributors and their application processes. The accounting officer of a lottery distributor is accountable to both the Department's Permanent Secretary and to Parliament for the proper and prudent expenditure of funds, and distributors' activities are subject to external audit by the National Audit Office. As lottery proceeds allocated to distributors are public money, the general principles of Government Accounting must be applied in the design and implementation of systems for the distribution of that money.

<P>
<a name="11128w20.html_wqn6"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent assessment she has made of the variation in expenditure, relative to revenue received, of the lottery income distributing bodies; and if she will make a statement.  [17947]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Lottery distributing bodies do not hold the same level of cash balances due to the differing nature of schemes or programmes operated. Funds are committed to a broad range of projects and money is drawn down when it is needed and not before, in compliance with Government Accounting procedures. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport continues to work closely with the lottery distributors to ensure that people see the benefits of Lottery awards as quickly as possible.

The fund would expect LEAs to consult, for example: other local authority departments; sports governing bodies; the NHS; primary care groups; and the voluntary sector.

 Studies looking at the suitability of the pneumococcal vaccine for introduction into the United Kingdom routine childhood immunisation programme are currently being undertaken by the Public Health Laboratory Service. These studies were commissioned in 1996 by the Department as part of a three-year research programme. Because of the unavailability of the pneumococcal vaccines it was not possible to begin these studies until 2000.
<P>

<a name="11128w24.html_para5">The key question being addressed in these studies is how the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine performs under the two, three, four-month UK programme, in particular assessing whether a booster dose, or all three primary immunisations, are necessary. Information on potential catch-up immunisation schedules in older age groups is also being sought. The final results for these trials are expected to be available in early 2003. The effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the presence of bacteria naturally occurring in the population (carriage) will also be studied.

 Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) the overall resource Departmental Expenditure Limit for 2001&#150;02 will be increased by &#163;10,911,000 (of which &#163;4,274,000 is administrations costs) from &#163;111,243,000 to &#163;122,154,000.
<P>

<a name="11128w25.html_para2">The increase is the net effect of the addition of the FSA's End Year Flexibility (EYF) entitlement. Delays in appointing external Board Members meant that the overall FSA strategy, and hence certain projects, were also delayed. This amounts to &#163;6,637,000 programme and &#163;2,867,000 administration costs. Additionally, transfers from Scotland (&#163;783,000) and Wales (&#163;609,000) are needed to cover the estimated fall in Meat Hygiene Service income in these countries resulting from the revised charging methodology recommended in the Maclean report. A transfer of &#163;15,000 administration costs from the Department of Health is needed as contribution towards the cost of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. Finally, the FSA's EYF capital entitlement needs to be incorporated. The move of the FSA to a new office in central London was later than anticipated, caused by building delays. This has resulted in the need to incorporate &#163;433,000 EYF capital expenditure.
<P>

<a name="11128w25.html_para3">As a result of these changes the gross administration cost limit for the FSA has increased by &#163;4,274,000 from &#163;48,908,000 to &#163;53,182,000.

 This target is to reduce deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke and related diseases in people under age 75. The latest available data (for the three years 1998&#150;2000) overlap the start of the Our Healthier Nation health strategy in July 1999 and the publication of the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease in March 2000. It is too early yet to assess the effects of these strategies. However, movement to date is towards the target. Data for 1998&#150;2000 (three-year average) show a rate of 120.5 deaths per 100,000 population&#151;a reduction of 13.7 per cent. from the baseline (1995&#150;97).

 The UN "oil for food" programme, which enables Iraq to use the revenue from its oil sales through the UN to buy goods worth billions of dollars each year to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and to rehabilitate Iraq's infrastructure, has led to significant growth in Iraq's trade with its neighbours. We have no objection to agreements to promote this trade to benefit the Iraqi people, provided that such agreements neither breach UN controls, for example by promoting the export from Iraq of goods other than crude oil, nor contribute to the Iraqi regime's aim to engineer the lifting of UN controls without having to meet its international obligations, particularly on disarmament.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> Under the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria the Government are obliged to take into account whether or not a proposed arms export would seriously undermine the economy or seriously hamper the sustainable development of the recipient country. Under clause 8 of the Bill, these criteria are to be treated as published guidance that the Government must have regard to in making licensing decisions. As the Bill requires the Government to continue to take the criteria (which include criterion 8 on sustainable development) into account in licensing decisions, it is unnecessary to mention sustainable development on the face of the Bill.

<P>

<a name="11128w29.html_para0">The new Renewables Obligation, to come into effect next year, together with exemption of renewables from the climate change levy, will create a long-term market incentive for renewables which will be worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010.

<a name="11128w29.html_para1">The introduction of the Obligation will be underpinned by direct Government funding for renewables worth over &#163;260 million between 2001 and 2004. This will include an extensive capital grants programme for the early development of offshore wind and energy crops, the initial stage of a major photovoltaics demonstration programme and a boost for research and development.

<BR>
Initiation of studies of each UK region's capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. Once all these assessments are completed, it is expected that specific regional targets for renewable energy will be adopted across the UK.

<a name="11128w30.html_para4">The National Enterprise Campaign, now known as Enterprise Insight, is a 10-year private sector-led national campaign for enterprise. The campaign has strong support within Government and works in partnership with enterprise programme providers including Young Enterprise, Shell LiveWIRE and the Prince's Trust to promote enterprise by fostering an entrepreneurial sprit across the UK through four key initiatives: Enterprising Education; Enterprising Communities; Enterprising Media; Enterprising Business.
<P>

<a name="11128w30.html_para5">The campaign has made steady progress over its first 18 months. Since the launch of the Enterprising Education Campaign in July 2001, 246 business have registered their interest in promoting enterprise within schools with a further 750 expected by 2002. The aim over the next two years is to get 40,000 more young people engaged in enterprise learning in schools and 5,000 new business people to support its delivery. This will be done through a number of activities including hosting road shows and the development of a website which will enable businesses to register their interest on-line. In addition, the Entrepreneurs in Residence scheme, which matches businesses to local enterprise projects, is also well under way&#151;so far the first five matches have already been made. Enterprise Insight also aims to promote enterprise more positively across society and, in particular, plans to work with the media using case studies and role models to help spread more positive attitudes about entrepreneurship and business.

 Table C4 is consistent with the Office for National Statistics methodology for Public Finance Statistics. The assumptions mentioned in paragraphs C17&#150;19 of Budget 2001, together with those in Box C1, are used as the basis for the projections by the Inland Revenue, and Customs and Excise for taxes, on a tax by tax basis, and the Treasury for other receipts. Details of how these assumptions are converted into forecasts for revenues are given in Forecasting the Public Finances in the Treasury, by Tim Pike and David Savage, Fiscal Studies, 1998.

 Like any other borrowers, local authorities have a contractual obligation to comply with the terms of repayment specified in their agreement with the lender. The local government capital finance system requires English and Welsh authorities each year to set aside amounts out of their revenue resources to meet debt and other credit liabilities. This helps to ensure that, whenever a debt falls due, the authority has enough money to make the repayment. The Government have no immediate plans to change these arrangements.

 The Countryside Agency has adopted an indicator on business health. This necessitates the collection of a range of business data including business registrations and de-registrations (business registrations only include those businesses above the VAT threshold). The Countryside Agency use the number of business registrations as a proxy indicator of total business start-ups. However, in their 2001 State of the Countryside report they presented data from the Office for National Statistics on the total number of businesses, proportion of business by employee sizeband and VAT registrations and de-registrations.
<P>

<a name="11128w33.html_para5">The Countryside Agency are working with the Office for National Statistics to procure accurate and up-to-date information from the Inter-Departmental Business Register for 2001. In addition they are working with the Small Business Service in looking at the broader picture of "business health" in England, in particular those businesses beneath the VAT threshold. For the 2002 State of the Countryside Report they will again publish data for rural areas on business start-ups as measured by registration and de-registration to give an accurate picture of business activity in the Countryside. This may be supplemented by data collected from a local research project.

 The Countryside Agency's Rural Services Survey in 2000 researched the geographical availability of a range of services. This was the first year that a survey of this type had been undertaken at the household level across rural England. Full postcoded lists of services were used in the survey to calculate their availability to rural households within specified distances. The survey provides information on services available at a point in time. Future surveys will therefore provide a comparison with the base figures rather than reflecting the number of the openings and closings of services.

 The Research Project was let in January 2001 and progress to date has been towards a methodological approach to developing a national headline indicator. The broad scope of the work has been to focus on the key influencing attributes of market towns including: size and spacing of market towns; urban/rural shift of economic activity; the economic base of market towns; and the clustering of economic activity. In addition, considerable work has gone into examining market towns in relation to the Index of Deprivation 2000.

 Waste has been deposited at Pitsea landfill site at least since 1935 and since that time it is estimated some 30 million tonnes of waste have been deposited from a range of sources.
<P>

<a name="11128w34.html_para0">Between 1967 and 1994, there were requirements to submit records of the waste deposited at the site under various waste and planning controls. This information was collected by the relevant local authorities at the time. Some of these records were passed to the Environment Agency, though full records do not exist for the complete period that the landfill site operated.
<P>

<a name="11128w34.html_para1">The situation changed in 1994. Under paragraph 14 of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, operators are required to keep a record of the quantity, nature and origin of the waste disposed of at each site; and to make that information available, on request, to the Environment Agency. However, the agency must act reasonably in its use of this power. The agency would be open to legal challenge in the event of unreasonably seeking detailed information on all the substances, and the source of those substances, disposed of at the Pitsea landfill site since 1994. Nevertheless the detailed licence for the site which specifies the quantities and types of waste able to be deposited at Pitsea is available for inspection at the local Environment Agency office.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the Food and Agriculture Organisation's recent paper, "State of the World's Fisheries and Aquaculture", concerning genetic modification of aquatic species and their potential to increase the quantity and quality of aquaculture products.  [6640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w34.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The paper published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2000 recognises the potential for genetic modification to increase the quantity and quality of aquaculture products. It goes on to consider the areas of concern with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These include possible adverse side effects on human health and the environment, trade impacts, intellectual property rights, labelling and ethics. It outlines possible solutions including the adoption of suitable legislation, codes of conduct or guidelines, and possible technical answers. The paper says that solutions will come only from addressing all sides of this complex issue. It also notes that technically there must be good scientific support with adequate testing and monitoring to reduce the uncertainties of environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="11128w34.html_para2">The Government note the potential of genetic modification but at this stage of development GM technology has yet to demonstrate any proven benefits in relation to aquaculture. It is feasible that the technology could be used to increase yields from fish farms or make farmed fish easier or cheaper to produce, but this is unlikely in the short term. There have been no environmental releases of GM fish in the UK and none is expected to be proposed in the foreseeable future.

 The Government consider it important that all Ministers in Home Departments are alert to the implications of their policies and programmes for people living in rural areas rather than introducing such a specific designation.

This includes proposals on land adjacent to the river Thames.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w36.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> The Landfill Directive was due to be transposed into domestic law by 16 July 2001. Consultation on a set of draft Regulations to implement the technical and regulatory requirements of the Landfill Directive in England and Wales closed on 26 October 2001. The Government will be laying regulations before Parliament shortly. In advance of the regulations coming into effect the Environment Agency is using its existing powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Pollution and Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 to apply the Directive's requirements to any permits issued in the interim.
<P>

<a name="11128w36.html_para0">We have also consulted on a tradeable landfill permit scheme to implement the targets in Article 5 of the Directive for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill and will bring forward primary legislation to introduce such a scheme as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="11128w36.html_para1">Enforcement of Directives is a matter for the European Commission and any infraction proceedings for not implementing the Directive fully or on time would be between the member state concerned and the Commission.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w36.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to develop central monitoring of the amount of waste collected for recycling which ends up in landfill sites.  [17636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w36.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> In theory all material collected for recycling should be recycled, but inevitably there will be losses. Some mixed material may be lost in the sorting process (for example at Material Reclamation Facilities). Material may also be rejected due to contamination, or sent for disposal due to the lack of a suitable market for the recycled material.
<P>

<a name="11128w36.html_para2">There are no current plans to centrally monitor the amount of waste collected for recycling which ends up in landfill. However, in the case of local authorities, we are looking at the way we measure household recycling rates in the Municipal Waste Management Survey to try to ensure that the rates reflect material that was both collected for recycling and actually sent for recycling. In the current 2000&#150;01 survey we are asking for the percentage of materials collected for recycling and composting which were rejected at Material Reclamation Facilities. To ensure that such losses are minimised it is important to support markets for recycled materials 



<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 2001 : Column: 1029W</I><P>
through initiatives such as WRAP. It should also be noted that the best value statutory standards for household recycling rates are on the basis of material sent for recycling, not that which is collected.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she is taking to enable each local authority to provide doorstep collection of recyclable waste.  [17639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w36.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> It is a matter for local authorities to decide how best to meet their Statutory Performance Targets on recycling. To enable them to meet the challenging Statutory Performance Standards for recycling, we are however, providing major extra funding. By 2003&#150;04 revenue support in the relevant Standard Spending Assessment area will have risen &#163;1.1 billion over 2000&#150;01 provision. Spending Review 2000 also provides &#163;220 million for PFI waste schemes over the spending review period and a &#163;140 million ring-fenced fund for waste and recycling. &#163;50 million of New Opportunities Fund moneys will also be available over the next two years to support community sector work on recycling work in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w36.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> Our record on managing industrial and commercial waste is already better than on domestic waste. Nevertheless in order to encourage businesses further to reduce waste and to put to better use any waste that is produced the Government in Waste Strategy 2000 have set the target to reduce by 2005 the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998.
<P>

<a name="11128w36.html_para3">There are initiatives already in place to help industry. The Envirowise Programme aims to demonstrate the benefits of managing resource use and reducing the environmental impact to companies across the whole of the UK.
<P>

<a name="11128w36.html_para4">The programme encourages the establishment of waste minimisation clubs. The clubs offer a means by which businesses can make environmental improvements.
<P>

<a name="11128w36.html_para5">The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime will also have a role to play. Those regulated under the regime will be required to abide by the general principle that waste production should be avoided and that where waste is produced it should be recovered unless technically and economically impossible.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> The principal sources from which water is abstracted in the UK are surface waters (rivers and reservoirs) and groundwater (eg chalk aquifers). The main source in any given area depends on its geology though water resources can be, and are, transferred from one region to another where it is necessary to do so. Desalination is not seen as a necessary option in terms of public water supply at the present time.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> The effect of the moratorium on present day emissions is likely to be small, given the time lags involved in constructing new plants. There could, in principle, be a small and temporary effect on emissions over the next few years. It is however difficult to make an estimate due to many other influences that could also affect new build decisions, for example, changes in energy prices, the New Electricity Trading Arrangements, and other Government policies on energy and the environment. We would expect any effect from the moratorium to have died away before the end of the decade.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> The table shows carbon dioxide emissions recorded in the UK's greenhouse gas inventory from transport, the domestic sector and industry in 1999, which is the most recent year for which complete information is available. Industrial emissions are divided into manufacturing industry and energy industries. The latter include power stations and refineries, and produce the electricity, refined petroleum and other energy products used elsewhere in the economy. Emissions from energy industries amounted to 48.8 million tonnes of carbon equivalent (MtC) in 1999, of which 5.2 MtC and 16.6 MtC were attributable to demand in the transport and domestic sectors. Emissions from fuels loaded in the UK and used by international aviation and shipping are not included in the UK's inventory under agreed reporting guidelines used by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These emissions amounted to a further 8.7 MtC in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on current station lifetime plans, what projections have been made of the production of greenhouse gases if electricity produced from nuclear power stations is replaced with electricity produced from gas-fired power stations.  [17368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11128w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 On central assumptions, electricity generation from UK nuclear power stations is projected to fall from 86 terawatt hours in 2005 to 27 terawatt hours in 2020, as existing power stations reach the end of their licensed lifetimes (see table). Were it physically possible to replace all nuclear capacity by gas-fired power stations similar to the type presently being installed by 2005, the related greenhouse gas emissions would be about 8.3 million tonnes of carbon per year in 2005, falling to 2.6 million tonnes of carbon by 2020. This includes the effect of carbon dioxide arising from combustion plus minor associated emissions of methane and nitrous oxide.

 Slaughter premium is not payable on cattle slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak but if the market value for such animals would have been influenced by expectation of slaughter premium then the valuation for compensation should reflect this. Standard valuations, which operated between 22 March and 29 July, took account of slaughter premium.
