To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the benefits of Bayer GM rice approved by her Department as animal feed on 7 January.  [148610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> The application by Bayer for the importation of herbicide tolerant rice (event LLRICE62) into the European Union is being considered under the procedures set out in Directive 2001/18/EC. The Directive requires each application to market GM crops for commercial importation or cultivation to be assessed on a case-by-case basis on the scientific evidence of any risks it may pose to human health or the environment. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment concluded that, "This GM rice does not pose a risk to human health and the environment. The marketing of this product for importation and processing in the UK will be no different from that of other rice imported for processing and animal feed purposes." No assessment is required or made of comparative advantages with other products. The full UK assessment of Bayer's application is available on the Defra website at: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/regulation/euconsent.htm.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para0">The UK is the lead member state on the application and therefore undertakes the initial assessment. The application and the UK's assessment will now be assessed by other EU member states and the Commission before a collective decision is made. Consent, if granted, would not permit cultivation of the rice in the EU nor, without separate approval, could it be used in human food.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to <i>(a)</i> conduct and <i>(b)</i> commission further research on how GM plants might invade new habitats.  [148903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr Morley:  </B> 
The Department has commissioned research on the potential invasiveness of GM crops. An example is "An Investigation of Feral Oilseed Rape Populations" the report of which was published in February 1999. Details of this and other Defra-funded research projects that have included a consideration of the invasiveness of GM crops are available on the Defra website at www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para1">In addition to work funded by the Department there has been a large body of research on the invasiveness of GM and other plants conducted elsewhere. This body of research was recently reviewed by the GM Science Review (details available from www.gmsciencedebate. org.uk). Chapter 6.2 of the their final report specifically considered research on the risks of invasiveness of GM crops.

<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1366W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para2">The risks of invasiveness of GM crops are carefully assessed prior to any release. The Government's statutory advisers on GM crop releases&#151;the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE)&#151;have advised that in the case of all previous releases, that the risks of invasiveness have been low. This view was supported by the Science Review. However both ACRE and the Science Review highlight the need to continually monitor developments and we are currently considering future research requirements in this area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the evaluation of the costs and benefits of the commercial cultivation of GM crops in the UK over the next 10 to 15 years.  [148905]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As part of the GM dialogue the Strategy Unit carried out a study of the costs and benefits of GM crops. This looked at not only the range of GM crops currently available, but also those that might be available in 10&#150;15 years.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para3">The unit concluded that GM crops could offer some cost and convenience advantages to UK farmers, although any economic benefit is likely to be limited in the short-term as only a narrow range of existing GM crops are currently suited to UK conditions, and weak consumer demand may limit take-up. In the longer term it concluded that future developments in GM crops have the potential to offer more wide-ranging benefits, to both farmers and consumers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the Government will decide their GM food policy.  [148906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are considering our policy on GM food and crops generally in the light of all the information we have gathered. That includes the reports of the public debate and the science review, the Strategy Unit's costs and benefits study, the AEBC's report on coexistence and liability, and now ACRE'S advice on the FSE results. We will set out our conclusions in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research she has evaluated in which badgers have been systematically removed from an area, and the area kept free of badgers, where the incidence of TB in cattle has declined; and what conclusions she drew from this work.  [148660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Four large-scale badger clearances have been carried out, at Thornbury in Avon (104 sq km), at Steeple Leaze in Dorset (12 sq km), at Hartland in North Devon (about 62 sq km) and in an area of East Offaly in the Irish Republic (738 sq km). All four clearances were followed by a reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para4">However, none of the previous TB control strategies that involved badger culling have been assessed in a properly designed experiment to establish their efficacy. While removal operations may have had an effect on the prevalence of TB in badgers and on herd breakdowns, other factors may also have influenced these. In the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1367W</I><P>
absence of scientific controls, it is not possible to separate out the effects of badger removal from these confounding factors.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para5">A complete assessment of previous TB control strategies can be found in the 1997 Report on Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle and Badgers by Professor John Krebs and the Independent Scientific Review Group (the "Krebs Report"), available in the House Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the resources necessary to ensure that a given area is cleared and kept free of badgers, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> number of visits and <i>(b)</i> personnel employed;  [148651]
<P>
<UL>(2) what <i>(a)</i> financial and <i>(b)</i> human resources are allocated to the (i) clearance of badgers and (ii) the maintenance of badger-free areas in the Krebs proactive areas.  [148659]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As part of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), ten areas are subject to "proactive" treatment. As many badgers as possible within the design of the trial are culled in these areas (each approximately 100 sq km) and badger numbers are kept as low as possible. After the initial cull, the work involves an annual re-survey and cull of all proactive areas. However, the human resources for "proactive" work cannot be separately identified, except at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para6">Information on the costs of trapping as a "proactive" culling method in the RBCT cannot be used to assess the resources required to clear an area of badgers, because this would require the use of snares, poisoning or gassing which have been ruled out by the Government on welfare grounds. The RBCT clears as many badgers as possible from proactive areas using cage traps, but this removes, at best, 80 per cent. of badgers.
<P>

<a name="40122w01.html_para7">The average number of field staff employed by the Veterinary Directorate Wildlife Unit for field operations in the RBCT and the associated costs by financial year are given in the following table:

<a name="40122w01.html_para9">For most of 2001, field staff were reassigned to dealing with the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak. Over the first three years of the Trial, contracts to carry out initial Triplet surveying were negotiated with the Central Science Laboratory and ADAS and additionally small numbers of staff were deployed from elsewhere in the Department to support major proactive cull operations. Badger culling, however, is always carried out by Wildlife Unit personnel.

 Since June last year, the Common Agricultural Policy has been on the agenda at several of the monthly meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, or her ministerial colleagues have attended. At its September meeting, agreement was reached on the Council Regulation implementing the June reform agreement. Since then, there has been discussion of the European Commission's proposals for further reform of the CAP, covering the cotton, tobacco, olive oil and hops sectors and of options for reforming the sugar regime.

<a name="40122w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra agreed the Environment Agency's strategic approach to flood management measures for Cheltenham in 1999 and has since provided grant to the Agency for the first three phases of works. Defra is currently considering the Agency's application for grant on the detailed proposals on the remaining four phases of works but in any event the commencement of works must necessarily await the outcome of the Agency's application for planning permission for these works. I understand that the Agency's proposals would reduce the risk of flooding to over 600 properties and provide environmental and amenity benefits. I also understand that there are local concerns about disruption during construction, the removal of trees (although a major planting scheme is planned in mitigation) and a change in the use that could be made of an area identified by the Agency as a flood storage area. It will be for the planning authority to reach a view on the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed works in the first instance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total supermarket share of the <i>(a)</i> liquid milk and <i>(b)</i> cheese market was in each of the last 10 years for which figures are available.  [148691]<P>

<a name="40122w02.html_spnew8"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The supermarket share of the biggest four supermarkets (Asda, Safeways, Sainsburys and Tesco) of liquid milk in 2001&#150;02 was 36 per cent. If smaller supermarkets are included (excluding town centre and local shops) the share rises to 48 per cent. The corresponding market shares for cheese are 64 per cent. for the big four and 80 per cent for all supermarkets. Figures are from the Expenditure and Food Survey and are only available for the twelve month period ending in March 2002.

 The evolution of farmgate and retail prices over the last three years is tabulated below. Last year, in a Milk Development Council commissioned study by KPMG on "Prices and Profitability in the British Dairy Chain", London Economics undertook an econometric study of various aspects of the supply chain, including price transmission. For the UK, London Economics found that increases and decreases in retail prices for liquid milk are fully transmitted to farmgate prices with a lag of five months. However, price changes at farmgate level are not fully transmitted. A 1 unit increase in farmgate price results in a 0.56 unit increase in retail price, while a 1 unit decrease in farmgate prices results in a 0.71 unit decrease in retail price. For cheese they found no transmission and for butter they found some evidence that a fall in the farmgate price of milk resulted in an increase in the butter price.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the application by the Department for a derogation for <i>(a)</i> 2006, <i>(b)</i> 2009 and <i>(c)</i> 2016 on the biodegradable municipal waste diversion targets of the Landfill Directive.  [148757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Article 5.2 of the Landfill Directive lays down demanding targets for reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill and the timescale for achieving those targets. The targets require the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill to be reduced to 75 per cent. of the total amount (by weight) of such waste produced in 1995 by 2006; to 50 per cent. by 2009; and to 35 per cent. by 2016.
<P>

<a name="40122w03.html_para0">For those member states (like the UK) which landfilled more than 80 per cent. of their municipal waste in 1995, the Directive contains a derogation permitting a delay to the target dates by up to four years i.e. to 2010, 2013 and 2020. If a member state intends to take advantage of this derogation, there is an obligation on it to inform the Commission in advance. The UK will 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1373W</I><P>
meet that obligation by informing the Commission at least a year in advance if it intends to make use of the derogation for a target year. As was made clear in the recent consultation, planning for the Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme assumes that the derogation will be used for all three target years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> There are no plans to require this. However, a full assessment of a company's site to identify potential sources of pollution and the development of a plan to minimise these risks is a central recommendation in the Environment Agency's Pollution Prevention Guidance on Industrial Sites (PPG11).
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> There are currently 27 Pollution Prevention Guidelines jointly published by the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment & Heritage Service for Northern Ireland. These establish best practice for the prevention of pollution for a wide range of sectors and activities. Where appropriate, statutory codes of practice may refer to the standards set in the Pollution Prevention Guidelines. There are no plans at present to change the status of the Guidelines themselves.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> There are no current plans to extend the regulations. Separate regulations are already in place for agricultural fuel oil, waste oil storage is subject to waste regulation controls and statutory guidance is in place for underground oil storage. Large domestic storage tanks are already included in the Oil Storage Regulations and all new domestic installations are now subject to control under building regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> The Regulations are enforced by the Environment Agency and apply minimum prescriptive standards on a blanket basis to all premises storing oil in above ground fixed or mobile tanks or facilities. There are no plans to change the Agency's approach to enforcement which is explained in the Defra guidance note which accompanied

<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1374W</I><P>
the Regulations. The Legislative background in that Guidance states that the Environment Agency will not need to make a special visit to individual sites to assess risks, but will enforce the regulations during routine visits and thus reduce resource burdens.

 The Highways Agency has a programme for handing over responsibility (known as detrunking) for the A565 trunk road to Sefton borough council on 1 April 2004. The statutory process to enable detrunking to proceed is currently ongoing, and includes negotiations with the council. A Grant, calculated to be in the region of &#163;600,000, will be awarded based on a formula for maintenance expenditure. This Grant, uprated for inflation, will be paid in the 2004&#150;05 financial year and will continue until detrunked roads are included in the Highways Maintenance Formula Spending Share.

 This scheme is awaiting the completion of the necessary statutory procedures. We confirmed in the 2004&#150;05 Local Transport Capital Expenditure Settlement, announced last month, that we would provide sufficient resources for completion of the scheme up to a maximum of &#163;11.261 million. However, Wakefield Metropolitan District Council recently notified us of a cost increase of &#163;9.337 million over and above this agreed contribution. I cannot make a decision on the case for additional funding until the statutory procedures have been completed.

The money claimed back by the Essex Safety Camera Partnership to meet the cost of operating cameras for the financial year of 2000&#150;01 was &#163;1,846,480.

JIVE will offer advice and support to SET employers about best practice in recruiting and retaining women and also support and advice for women wishing to work in or already working in SET occupations. This strategy is aimed at increasing the representation of women in all SET occupations at all levels, and will include the provision of a dynamic and content-rich website; good practice guides for SET employers; a 'Good SET Employer' recognition for women wishing to return to SET occupations. Working with their Open University partners JIVE are developing specific ideas about increasing the number of women in IT. Bradford College already trains women to be Microsoft professionals and their experience in this field will be invaluable in ensuring that the new resource centre is effective.

 I have no estimate of the annual economic cost to developing countries of the breakdown of the WTO ministerial conference in Cancun. However, there are a number of studies by academics and international organisations of the benefits to developing countries of a successful round of negotiations. The scale of estimated gains depends on a number of factors including the scale of trade liberalisation implemented, its timing and the product coverage. Most recently, a World Bank study ("Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries", 2004) estimated that significant liberalisation could boost developing country incomes by between $159 billion and $349 billion per annum by 2015.

 The Ministry of Defence has no plans to co-ordinate tri-Service civil emergencies fire training. Dealing with a civil emergency remains the responsibility of the civil authorities. Any assistance provided by the armed forces in the event of such an emergency would be in support of those authorities and at their specific request. It would most likely take the form of general duties support.

Operating Costs for 2002&#150;03 for operations in Iraq total &#163;629.531 million. Expenditure on capital equipment amounts to &#163;217.680 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Night vision goggles (NVG) can be operated only in aircraft that have been specifically modified for this role. Naval helicopters are fitted to allow operation with NVG according to their tactical role in operations. The operational role for the helicopters of 849 Naval Air Squadron involved in Operation TELIC did not require the modifications to the helicopters that are necessary for the provision of NVG.
<P>

<a name="40122w08.html_para4">For RN helicopters, safety is provided by operating procedures such as, air traffic control awareness of hazards through radar detection, communications, lighting and lookout. NVG can, in certain circumstances, enhance these capabilities. But ships operating NVG aircraft need to be compatible. Darkening a ship to allow aircraft NVG operations brings its own safety issues.

 External and on-board security measures put in place during the docking of a non-British naval ship in the United Kingdom waters are closely coordinated between the relevant UK authority and the visiting nation. Jurisdiction, however, is clearly delineated, with the visiting ships' Commanding Officer responsible for security within the confines of the ship while external security measures rest with the local police authority or the Naval Base Commander for visits to a Naval Base.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how compulsory mobilisation of the Territorial Army in Operation Telic affects the continuity of Service calculations for the <i>(a)</i> Territorial Decoration and <i>(b)</i> other longer Service awards.  [149280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Territorial Decoration (TD) was replaced by the Volunteer Reserves Service Medal (VRSM) in 1999, although those members of the Territorial Army (TA) who had already completed a significant period of Service towards the award, can still receive the TD.

<UL>(2) whether the Territorial Army's annual training bounty is payable in the respect of compulsory mobilisation service.  [149282]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 While compulsory mobilisation does not in itself qualify members of the Territorial Army for their annual training bounty, certain aspects of that service can contribute towards the award. For example, mobilised service in theatre can be considered as meeting the requirement for a 15-day camp (or training in lieu).

 The Africa Peer Review Mechanism is a voluntary process. Work by the Peer Review Secretariat and others involved in the technical assessment is ongoing. We will learn more about progress when the results of the first Peer Review have been published.
<P>

<a name="40122w09.html_para2">Sixteen countries have signed up for the Africa Peer Review Mechanism. There is no confirmation yet as to which country will be first, although it has been proposed that Ghana and South Africa may be among the first wave. Currently it appears unlikely that the technical assessments will be published separately, but as part of the overall report on each country. The reports will all be published by the NEPAD secretariat.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w09.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what consideration is given to levels of HIV infection when approving a country for Heavily Indebted Poor Country debt relief.  [149426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w09.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The amount of debt relief a country receives under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is determined by its Debt Sustainability Analysis. A country's debt is compared with its export earnings and government revenue, and relief is provided either to bring the debt to export ratio down to 150 per cent., or the debt to government revenue ratio down to 250 per cent, whichever gives the greater amount of relief. This framework is straightforward and transparent. It also captures all of the factors that could affect a country's ability to service its debt, including levels of HIV infection, as these will affect the export and government revenue figures. Additional relief&#151;or 'topping up'&#151;can also be provided at Completion Point, for those countries that, as a result of exogenous shocks, risk exiting the Initiative with debts above the HIPC sustainability threshold.
<P>

<a name="40122w09.html_para3">Levels of HIV infection are also addressed directly through the development of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which are a requirement for receiving HIPC debt relief. Governments in HIPC countries lead national processes to develop PRSPs. These strategies set out national priorities and include an estimate of the cost of reaching medium-term development targets. The planned use of HIPC debt relief, along with all other forms of assistance for addressing social problems, such as HIV/AIDS, are addressed in these strategies. For many HIPC countries, analysis of poverty trends in PRSPs shows HIV/AIDS is an important factor, and public action plans can be costed within national spending plans. In this way, savings made under the HIPC Initiative are channelled directly towards tackling this issue.

<a name="40122w09.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Ethiopia</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the extent of the food shortage in Ethiopia <i>(a)</i> in absolute terms and <i>(b)</i> by comparison with December 2002; and what measures are being taken to improve the situation.  [148090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w09.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn:  </B> 
In December 2003, the Government of Ethiopia appealed for food assistance for 7.2 million people, amounting to 964,690 metric tonnes of cereal. This is a 45 per cent. reduction from the 13.2 million people requiring relief in December 2002.
<P>

<a name="40122w09.html_para4">However, there is unlikely to be any overall shortage of food in Ethiopia during 2004. Some five to six million people require assistance every year even without shocks such as drought. For this group, we are working with Government to develop a safety net that will provide timely and sufficient resources to not only save lives but help people become more productive.




<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1400W</I><P>

<P>

 DFID provides financial support to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI) and works closely with the partnership to further its objectives. The UK was on the Board of GAVI for two years to July 2003. We remain engaged with GAVI work on the evaluation of its support to country health systems, on the introduction of new vaccines, and on initiatives to overcome health system barriers to increasing immunisation. DFID has supported GAVI since its inception, initially with a grant of &#163;3 million and then a grant of &#163;35 million over five years (2001&#150;05).

 The information readily accessible refers to the percentage of children in developing countries aged under five who are seriously underweight. The data are not collected on an annual basis and very few countries have data more recent than 2000. The table sets out the information on the prevalence of child malnutrition by country for the year which most closely approximates to 1990 and 2000 <sup>1</sup> . Where the reference year is different from these two dates this is specified. The final column sets out the difference in percentage points between the two statistics.

 The response to an international invitation, which had sought outline proposals for private sector participation and investment in possible development of air access, is being considered in consultation with the St Helena Government. An expert assessment of four expressions of interest in the possible venture was received last month. As the next step, we shall soon decide whether any or all of the existing proposals offer a suitable basis for proceeding further.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2004]:</i> Fees for post graduate, part-time and overseas students in higher education are currently unregulated. Such students make up around 50 per cent. of the total. Fees for full-time undergraduates are currently set at a standard rate of &#163;1,125 per year (for 2003&#150;04): the Higher Education Bill contains provisions to allow higher education institutions and further education colleges that provide higher education to vary their fees for these students up to a maximum of &#163;3,000, provided they have an access agreement approved by the Office for Fair Access.
<P>

<a name="40122w10.html_para0">Approximately 80 per cent., of further education provision for adults is subject to variable fees. Public funding through the Learning and Skills Council assumes a learner or employer contribution of 25 per cent. to the basic cost of the course. However, colleges are free to vary the fee charged between 0 per cent. and 75 per cent. of the basic cost. No fees may be charged for the 20 per cent. of provision not subject to variable fees. This comprises provision for adult learners on income based benefits and literacy and numeracy courses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on what amount of debt he has based his estimate of the length of time it will take the average graduate to complete graduate repayments after 2010; and what the change would be in this time if the annual income threshold for repayment was raised to <i>(a)</i> &#163;18,000 and <i>(b)</i> &#163;20,000.

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> The estimate of the length of time to repay is the average across all students who take out a loan. This is different from the length of time it will take for some notional average graduate to repay. The estimate is from a model which simulates student loan repayments, based on assumed distributions of: length of time in Higher Education; size of means-tested loan taken out; size of fee loan, net of any fee remission; and borrower lifetime earnings. Some borrowers will repay more quickly than this estimated average and some less so.
<P>

<a name="40122w10.html_para3">As part of a package of reforms announced with the introduction of the Higher Education Bill, any debt outstanding after 25 years would be written-off. The threshold would increase to &#163;15,000 in April 2005 and be increased with inflation from April 2010 onwards. The average time to repay would be around 13 years. 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1407W</I><P>
Under the same approach to uprating the threshold, the average time to repay would be around 15 years with an &#163;18,000 threshold and around 16 years with a &#163;20,000 threshold.

<P>
<a name="40122w10.html_spnew9"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The introduction of deferred fee loans will have a small effect on the Inland Revenue and the Student Loans Company. Any extra costs will be largely a function of the numbers of graduates repaying loans after 2010. There is also the need to monitor what fees a student is incurring for what courses. There will be one-off development costs to the SLC of introducing the change. DfES would meet the cost. No figures are yet available. Information on the proposals is set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), copies of which are in the House Libraries.

 The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has a Community Safety Strategy in place through which it can take action against perpetrators of racial harassment and intimidation. Until recently such action, which normally would have entailed steps to repossess property, was only possible in situations where the perpetrator was a Housing Executive tenant. With the introduction of the Housing (NI) Order 2003, the Housing Executive now has enhanced powers not only in terms of the action it can take against Housing Executive tenants but also through the use of injunctions to address race hate crimes occurring within its estates irrespective of the tenure of the perpetrator. The Housing Executive also assists victims of racial attacks through the provision of temporary accommodation pending enquiries into the circumstances pertaining to any individual case and permanent rehousing, where appropriate. It will also take measures to protect the properties and belongings of victims, if requested to do so.

The remaining 13 applicants either abandoned their application or were ineligible for assistance under immigration or homeless legislation. While no specific guidance has been issued to staff in respect of racial discrimination, they have been provided with written guidance and training to deal with housing and homeless applications to ensure that all incidents, whether racial, terrorist or sectarian intimidation, are treated with the same degree of urgency and sensitivity.

 Article 308 requires, in order for it to be used as a legal base for action, that a proposal be necessary for the attainment of a Community objective, and have unanimous support at the Council. We have given an undertaking that where the Commission puts forward a legislative proposal citing Article 308 as its legal base, we will provide the Scrutiny Committees with the Commission's justification of this choice of legal base. Any such proposal would need to respect the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 TEC.

 There are varying levels of contact between al-Qaeda and other international terrorist groups either related to al-Qaeda or sharing similar agendas, including sharing ideological ideas and expertise, and co-operating on funding, planning and facilitation. The loss of safe havens such as Afghanistan, and the successful pursuit and arrest of senior terrorists, have made this process more difficult. But terrorist individuals and groups continue to find ways to collaborate and communicate, including through use of the Internet.

The Inland Revenue does not routinely collect data in respect of specific types of employer from either PAYE/NIC returns or in respect of its Employer Compliance Review programme. It is therefore not possible to isolate the increase to the exchequer arising from this legislation.

This, along with the yearly rises in the Carer's Grant, is leading to increases in the levels of provision of short term breaks for parents of disabled children. Direct payments were introduced in the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000; one of the key aims is to give families greater choice and flexibility in how they receive services, including the range of short term breaks. As part of the development of national service framework for children, the Government are considering how best to support the particular needs of families with disabled children, who require flexible services responsive to their particular needs.

<i>[holding answer 20 January 2004]:</i> Early detection of all cancers improves a patient's chance of survival. In March 2000, "Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer" were published and sent to all general practitioners in order to help them identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer, so that they can be referred urgently to a specialist. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is in the process of updating these guidelines. The update is due to be published in February 2005.
<P>

<a name="40122w17.html_para1">In order to ensure that high quality services for cancer patients are provided across the country, the NHS Cancer Plan set out the following broad approach, which addresses the diagnosis process and treatment:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the development of a comprehensive package of guidance ("Improving Outcomes" guidance) on services which are most likely to improve outcomes for different types of cancer;

<BR>
the translation of this guidance into measurable national standards (the "Manual of Cancer Standards"); and
<P>
<BR>
a national programme of peer review to ensure compliance with these standards.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40122w17.html_para2">"Improving Outcomes Guidance on Lung Cancer" was published by the Department in 1998 and lung cancer services were peer reviewed on the resulting standards in 2001. The "Manual of Cancer Standards" is currently being updated and a three-year rolling programme of cancer peer review against this manual is expected to start in autumn 2004. In addition, NICE is preparing clinical guidelines for the national health service in England and Wales for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. This is expected to be published in November 2004. NICE has also appraised four chemotherapy drugs for treatment of lung cancer and is in the process of appraising a fifth.
<P>

<a name="40122w17.html_para3">The work of the Modernisation Agency's Cancer Services Collaborative 'Improvement Partnership' (CSC 'IP') is central to the drive to improve the detection, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. A specific goal of the CSC 'IP' is to promote early diagnosis of lung cancer.
<P>

<a name="40122w17.html_para4">In November 2003, the establishment of a Lung Cancer Advisory Group was announced. This group, which will be meeting in March, will be chaired by Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director and will advise on the development and delivery of lung cancer services, including relevant elements of the NHS Cancer Plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment his Department has made of research undertaken by the US Food and Drug Administration into mercury contamination of tuna; [148591]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w18.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency advises that pregnant and breast-feeding women, and women who intend to become pregnant, should limit their consumption of tuna to no more than two medium size cans (drained weight approximately 140 g.) or one fresh tuna steak per week as a precaution due to the mercury content. Other consumers do not need to limit their consumption of tuna. This is in line with advice issued by the US Food and Drug Administration on fish consumption, based on surveys of the mercury content of fish.

These Guidelines assist the courts in adopting a consistent approach. The new Sentencing Guidelines Council will take on responsibility for these guidelines and for monitoring the way in which the guidelines are used in order to ensure that there is a common approach to sentencing.

<i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]:</i> Any decision to hold an inquest at a particular location is a matter for the coroner concerned. I understand that following the closure of the coroner's court in Bristol the office has transferred to a site in Long Ashton. However, the inquest may be held at other locations subject to the needs of those wishing to attend and availability of accommodation.

 The Home Office does not collect information on the type of location for recorded crimes, except where it is implicit in the crime type (e.g. theft from a shop, or shop-lifting). It also does not collect information on ownership of property stolen. For these reasons, numbers of robberies and thefts involving school property are not collected separately.

Access and communication has been identified as a priority and the Department is establishing a working group to oversee a range of initiatives on access, including the production of sector-specific guidance on good practice, and a programme to promote awareness of the access duties set out in the DDA. The NHSU is also working closely with the Disability Rights Commission and others to develop a framework and programme to address training on disabilities issues in health and social care.

 The operation of the Home Detention Curfew (HDC) scheme is monitored on a weekly basis. Between January 1999, when the scheme was introduced, and 9 January 2004, over 86,000 prisoners have been released under the Home Detention Curfew scheme.

 The Prison Service does not maintain information on the cost of imprisonment of specific prisoners. However, as an alternative it is possible to provide the average cost of keeping a prisoner in the establishments in which the particular prisoners referred to in this question served their sentences. This suggests that the total cost to public funds of the imprisonment of Sally Clarke was in the region of &#163;111,000. The cost of detaining Angela Cannings was approximately &#163;57,000.

 Detailed policies and procedures for the creation and management of all records relating to government business are the responsibility of the department concerned. However, the National Archives has a supervisory role in ensuring the safe-keeping of historical value. In this connection the National Archives has issued 'guidance on the management of private office papers', which is available on those records which, once created, are likely to be of enduring its website at: http://www.pro.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/standards/privateoffice.htm

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w21.html_wqn1"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary Department of Constitutional Affairs what the Appeal Court must conclude for a sentence to be reduced.  [145969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Section 11(3) of the Criminal Appeals Act 1968 provides that an appeal may be allowed against sentence if the appellant may be sentenced "differently'' from the way in which he was sentenced in the Crown Court. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) will always interfere and quash a sentence if it considers it "manifestly excessive". In addition there are a number of other reasons why an appeal against sentence may succeed. Circumstances between the date of sentence and the hearing of the appeal may change. For example, the CACD may be provided with information about help given by the individual defendant to the prosecuting or prison authorities, which justifies a reduction in sentence. The CACD itself often seeks and is provided with reports from prison, which may give grounds for concluding that although the sentence imposed at the Crown Court is not open to criticism, the sentence has had the necessary impact, and is no longer appropriate. This is of particular importance where the offender is young and his rehabilitation may progress more rapidly if, having served some time in custody, a community sentence was now imposed on him. Changes in relation to sentencing policy may also affect the result of a sentence appeal, where, for example, new "guidelines" have been provided after the sentence was imposed. Other circumstances which may affect the decision of the CACD include sentences imposed following procedural errors, or those which may create a justifiable sense of grievance because of sentences passed on other defendants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Judicial decisions are taken and explained in public (save where the circumstances of a case demand confidentiality) and any decision which a judge makes is liable to be scrutinised, and if necessary overturned, on appeal, which is also a public process. Judges are therefore fully accountable for their judicial decisions through the appeal system.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para0">Judges are not, however, accountable through a political process for the decisions they take, as this would not be consistent with judicial independence. The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State therefore does not monitor appeals against decisions made by individual judges, and it is not his role to intervene in judicial decisions or consider complaints about judicial decisions.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para1">A successful appeal to a higher court does not of itself provide a basis for criticism of the trial judge. There are many reasons why an appeal may succeed. Where the Court of Appeal does record criticism of the trial judge, however, the judgment is given publicly and is available to representatives of the media as well as the public. It is always sent to the judge concerned, and where there is any reason for concern about the conduct of the judge it is sent to the relevant Presiding Judges. From time to time where it is thought that judges are not performing adequately they may be given advice and guidance, or training, or different workloads or types of workload by the responsible senior judiciary. Lord Justice Judge, the Deputy Chief Justice, is currently considering improvements to this procedure.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para2">In cases where a judge's personal conduct (as opposed to his decision) is seriously criticised in an appeal decision, the Presiding Judges may decide to refer the matter to the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice to consider. The Lord Chancellor is also able to consider complaints from the public about the personal conduct of judges.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs (1) what plans the Secretary of State has to introduce a system of formal appraisal and scrutiny of circuit judges' performances; [146057]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 A system of formal appraisal has been introduced for holders of certain part-time judicial posts. Consideration is now being given to extending appraisal to the remaining part-time posts including recorders. Formal appraisal is also being introduced for certain full time tribunal judges.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para3">The aim of any appraisal scheme is not to question judicial decisions but to observe the conduct of the judicial process and to consider, positively and constructively with a judge, their approach to and

handling of cases. It is important, in order to maintain the independence of the judiciary and to ensure that appraisal is expert and informed, that it should be undertaken by judges. There are no plans to widen appraisal to include a body or panel which includes non-judges.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para4">The Lord Chancellor has no current plans to extend formal appraisal more widely. In relation to circuit judges, the presiding judges of each circuit are of course in a position to raise with them any concerns about their performance.

<P>
<P>

 In order to ensure their independence judges hold office during good behaviour. Judges of the High Court and above may only be removed by Her Majesty the Queen on an address from both Houses of Parliament. Circuit judges and below may be removed from office by the Lord Chancellor only for incapacity or misbehaviour.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para5">What constitutes incapacity or misbehaviour would be a matter for decision in a particular case. However, the mere fact of having made decisions which had been reversed on appeal could not be said to constitute incapacity or misbehaviour.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 We have no record of receiving such complaints and keep no such records. A wasted costs order is an order of the court, and can only be challenged on appeal, not by complaining to the Lord Chancellor.

<P>
<a name="40122w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 321 circuit judges hold 'private law authorisations' which enable them to deal with child contact and residence and other related matters. Authorisations are granted and withdrawn for a variety of reasons&#151;most commonly they are withdrawn when 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 471 circuit judges and recorders have undergone the additional specialist training that enables them to hear cases of rape and other serious sexual offences.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para6">The authorisation of individual circuit judges to try rape and other serious sexual offences is made by the senior presiding judge on behalf of the Lord Chief Justice. Such judges are identified by the presiding judges of each circuit. The judge must have wide and significant experience of the criminal justice system, and must have demonstrated the necessary sensitivity for these cases. Before dealing with these cases, specialist training is provided for them by the Judicial Studies Board.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para7">The withdrawal of a rape authorisation is decided by the Lord Chief Justice personally. The authorisation was withdrawn when the Court of Appeal criticised the way in which a trial judge had summed up a rape case to the jury. Such cases will no longer be listed before another judge who appears persistently to have ignored sentencing guideline decisions in such cases. For at least the last five years no authorisation has been withdrawn because of general concerns over any authorised circuit judge's ability to handle such sensitive cases. If there were evidence to suggest any lack of appropriate sensitivity it would be drawn to the attention of the Lord Chief Justice either by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or by presiding judges or through the media, or by way of complaint.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor typically receives between 1,000 and 1,200 complaints about judges each year. The majority of these turn out to be complaints 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2004 : Column 1451W</I><P>
against judicial decisions and the complainant is advised that the appropriate remedy is by way of appeal. Those complaints which appear to relate to judicial conduct are investigated and both the complainant and the judge concerned are informed of the outcome. However, the results of this disciplinary process are not normally publicised more widely. Since May 1997, 27 judges have been reprimanded by the Lord Chancellor. These have included one High Court judge, 11 circuit judges, eight district judges, five recorders, and two deputy district judges.
<P>

<a name="40122w22.html_para8">The Lord Chancellor is currently considering the future arrangements for judicial complaints and discipline and hopes to be in a position to announce these shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The set up costs of the Public Defender Service (PDS) were as follows: Birmingham &#163;193,312; Cheltenham &#163;221,054; Darlington &#163;126,867; Chester &#163;175,225; Liverpool &#163;141,663; Middlesbrough &#163;166,479; Pontypridd &#163;108,754; Swansea &#163;254,014; Central &#163;419,346. Total &#163;1,806,714. These costs were reported in the first two PDS Annual Reports. Individual office costs include refurbishment, furniture, some IT hardware, software, office equipment and security systems. Central costs include purchase of case management system, integration into the Legal Services Commission (LSC) IT network, recruitment and induction.
<P>

<a name="40122w23.html_para0">Assessment of the average cost per case in the PDS is one element of an extensive Methodology (the Methodology Paper can be found at www. legalservices.gov.uk or available on request) developed by the independent research team. The researchers began to collect data at the beginning of the second year of the four-year pilot and are due to report in 2005. A full assessment of average case costs will not be possible until all the research has been completed. In part, this is because the offices need to develop foil caseloads in order for the assessment to be undertaken. All offices began with no clients and full case loads can only be developed over time.
<P>

<a name="40122w23.html_para1">The Department monitors the PDS by way of monthly reports from the LSC on the PDS and regularly meets with the LSC and the researchers. In order to better assess the performance of (he PDS the LSC, with the agreement of Ministers, increased the number of PDS offices from six to eight in 2003. Ministers will make a decision on the future of the PDS in the light of

 The latest information available is for the calendar year 2002. The provisional UK figure for the number of deaths in dwelling fires in that period is 443. Of the 443 deaths in dwelling fires reported to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister by Fire and Rescue Services in the UK in 2002, 364 were in accidental dwelling fires. This was 71 fewer than in 2001. Deaths in dwelling fires are now 21 per cent. below the level reported in 1997, and are the lowest on record.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is pleased to say that the seminar held on 19 December achieved a good attendance from those representing landlords, tenants, local authorities and housing professionals. It appeared to achieve a widespread understanding among those attending of the need to steer a course that considered the scope for linking legislation for compulsory measures to protect tenancy deposits to a need for written agreements for all tenants. A need for all tenants to have written agreements was proposed in the Law Commission's report 'Renting Homes' published in November.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is considering in the light of the seminar of 19 December a full response to our consultation a year ago with the results of our consideration of proposals for future measures to provide for tenancy deposit protection that could encompass a range of approved but mandatory schemes.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have considered whether we should recommend that the Secretary of State include in the secondary legislation a default term about whether fixtures and chattels are included in the agreement and whether an inventory must be provided. This issue ties in closely with work ODPM are doing on the regulation of deposits (as disputes are often about the existence or state of items which could have been listed in an inventory to avoid disputes). We do not wish to prejudge that work by proposing that there should be a compulsory minimum term on this issue in the Act."

 Officials at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have briefed Planning Inspectors on the policies dealing with housing and flooding out in Planning Policy Guidance Notes 3 (Housing) and 25 (Development and Flood Risk).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40122w24.html_spnew12"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Problems with sewage and flooding are material considerations in whether nor not to approve new housing applications, and local planning authorities should refuse permission where these cannot be satisfactorily resolved. Guidance on sewerage is given in paragraph 19 of Annex 3 to Planning Policy Guidance Note 23: Planning and Pollution Control. The fact that flood risk is a criterion in allocating land in plans for housing development is stated in paragraph 31 of Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing, and the suitability of land at different levels of risk from flooding for residential development is set out in Table 1 of Planning Policy Guidance Note 25: Development and Flood Risk.

<a name="40122w25.html_para3">Plans are at a different stage in each of the three growth areas. In Milton Keynes South Midlands, regional partners published a draft Sub Regional Strategy on 18 July 2003. This sets out plans for around 133,400 homes in the period 2001&#150;16. These plans will be subject to examination in public and the

consideration of the Secretary of State before incorporation into Regional Planning Guidance. Similarly, in July 2003, the South East England Regional Assembly published their proposed alterations to Regional Planning Guidance for Ashford, including a total of 13,100 homes in the period 2001&#150;16. An examination in public was held in December 2003, and the panel is due to report in February 2004.
<P>

<a name="40122w25.html_para4">In London Stansted Cambridge, plans for the growth area are being considered as part of the development of RPG14 for the East of England, and the London Plan, and its Sub Regional Development Frameworks. A first draft of RPG14 is expected to be produced by the East of England Regional Assembly in February 2004.

<a name="40122w25.html_para5">The Government does not set annual targets centrally for local authorities on either affordable or social housing. Planning policies for affordable housing are set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3, "Housing", and in Circular 6/98, "Planning for Affordable Housing". They advise that where local planning authorities are able to demonstrate a lack of affordable housing to meet local needs, based on up-to-date surveys and other data, they should indicate in their local plan how many affordable homes need to be provided throughout the plan area, and set indicative targets for specific suitable sites (expressed either as numbers of homes or a percentage of the homes on the site). Local planning authorities should be monitoring their performance against their local plan policies and targets, but this information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of how much will be paid back to telecommunications companies in respect of appeals against business rates in England and Wales made since the conclusion of the administrative period for the 2000 list.  [149195]<P>

 None. The 2000&#150;05 rating lists are still open to appeals by ratepayers against their rateable values. It is for the National Assembly for Wales to comment on the position in Wales.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many appeals by telecommunications companies in respect of the <i>(a)</i> 1995 and <i>(b)</i> 2000 list valuations remain outstanding.  [149205]<P>

<P>
<a name="40122w26.html_spnew1"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 At the end of 2003, the numbers of outstanding appeals in England for telecommunication properties on a) the 1995&#150;2000 lists and b) the 2000&#150;05 lists were respectively a) 1,013 and b) 11,248. These figures include both telecommunication properties on the central rating list (in respect of which payments of rates are made direct to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister), and properties such as telecommunication masts, telephone kiosks, telephone exchanges on the local rating lists (where payments are made to local authorities, and then forwarded by them to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister).
