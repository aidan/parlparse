 The Department for International Development (DFID) makes every effort to answer all questions substantively before Prorogation, however, this is not always possible. Where this was the case, hon. Members were issued with a response that followed parliamentary guidelines to notify them of this. Where hon. Members did not receive a substantive response they have the option to re-table the question in this session.

<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="41129w01.html_wqn1"><b> Tony Baldry: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress is being made on each of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) on the basis of existing funding levels; and when each MDG will be met <i>(a)</i> including China and <i>(b)</i> excluding China. [199599]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41129w01.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The latest edition of DFID&#039;s annual publication &#039;Statistics in International Development&#039; which is available in the House of Commons Library, summarises progress towards the MDGs. Globally, progress has been most noticeable in reducing income poverty and that the goal of promoting gender equality has also seen notable improvement. The water and sanitation targets for MDG 7 have also moved in the right direction. The prospects are less good for the goals related to universal primary education, improving child and maternal health and combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, though some countries have seen substantial improvements in these areas, showing what can be done with the right policies and targeted resources. Goal 8 highlights action required by developed countries and progress is being made, although further effort is still needed.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Department for International Development (DfID) have adopted a joint approach to assist Vietnam in becoming a market-based economy, and in developing its domestic and international trade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41129w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_14">Key to this is a common position on Vietnam&#039;s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in particular an insistence on accession on terms that benefits all Vietnamese people, particularly its poor. The European Commission (which negotiates on behalf of EU member states on WTO accession) has been encouraged by the British Government to recognise, in the negotiation process, Vietnam&#039;s low income country status.

<a name="stpa_15">In terms of developing Vietnam&#039;s domestic economy, DFID is working with the World Bank to support reform of state-owned enterprises (SOE). Activities focus on the restructuring of three general corporations to reduce state direct investment, and encouraging the private sector to play a stronger role. This area of reform is crucial to free-up government resources for social service provision and poverty reduction. DFID further supported the revision of key investment and enterprise laws to create a level playing field for business, and to reduce state intervention in company decision-making and the allocation of resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41129w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_16">In the longer term, DFID, in partnership with the Asian Development Bank, is helping the Government of Vietnam to identify and develop policies to make the transition to a market-based economy work in favour of the poor, through improving their access to land and other natural resources, through increased opportunities for employment and income generation, and through linking up the domestic markets within which they supply labour to global markets, for example those that supply supermarkets.

The reforms should however generate administrative savings for the police. The police are currently involved administratively in an average of 1.6 million licensing processes annually in England and Wales across the six existing licensing regimes that are merged into a single regime by the 2003 Act. The number of administrative processes in which the police are involved is expected to reduce to fewer than 200,000 annually once the Act becomes fully operational.

This is because in the future infantry battalions will be fixed by role and, largely, by location and it will be necessary to move individuals between battalions for experience, variety and development.

 The Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954, as amended, includes extensive warrants procedures that a supplier must follow if it wishes to enter premises to disconnect any customer.

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). Due to regional volatility, estimates are based on a three year average from 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03.<br>

2. Figures are based on a total income at 2002&#150;03 prices.<br>





3. The FRS is not designed to collect information on annual income. Earnings figures are based on last usual pay. Annual income is estimated by assuming that the income for the relevant period applied for the whole year.<br>

4. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which align the FRS to Government Office Region populations by age and sex. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.<br>

5. Total weekly household income consists of gross income from all sources before deduction of income tax and national insurance.<br>

6. Total income has not been adjusted for family size.<br>
