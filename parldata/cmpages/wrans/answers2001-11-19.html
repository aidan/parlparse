<a name="11119w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 No such decision has been communicated to us or to NGOs operating in Zimbabwe. NGOs are providing much needed relief to some of Zimbabwe's most vulnerable people. We would hope that any Government who were serious about the welfare of their people would allow such work to continue.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action her Department has taken to tackle discrimination against older people.  [14955]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department's aim is the elimination of poverty in poorer countries. Discrimination and marginalisation is frequently a cause of poverty. We are seeking to ensure that poor people are consulted on policies and decisions that affect them. We are using participatory methods to understand people's perception of their rights and the obstacles they face in accessing entitlements. By adopting such rights approaches, we are promoting social justice, including tackling discrimination against older people.

 Between 9 November 2000 and 9 November 2001, 50 Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and 15 Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) were issued covering the export of goods and technology to Russia.

 We believe that the medium and long- term prospects for the UK telecoms sector remain strong. The current down-turn is part of a global phenomenon, not limited to countries in which there have been auctions of third generation mobile licences. UK mobile operators are continuing to work towards launch of third generation services as rapidly as is practicable.

<a name="11119w02.html_para4">The Government set up a temporary replacement insurance scheme for UK and Isle of Man airlines following the withdrawal of commercial cover for third party liabilities in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the US. The scheme underwrites third party, war and terrorism liabilities above $50 million for the majority of airlines for a commercially based premium, but will waive the premium for airlines that choose to buy $100 million of cover on the commercial insurance market. The scheme was extended for 30 days on the 24 October and will now expire at midnight on the 23 November.

This is in addition to the first two ships in the class which are to be built by Swan Hunter at its Tyneside yard. BAE Systems Marine will build their vessels to Swan's design.
<P>

<a name="11119w02.html_para8">This represents an important enhancement to our Amphibious Capability, as each ALSL has more than twice the carrying capacity of the ships that they will replace. This significantly increases our specialist amphibious lift capacity. The vessels being built by Swan Hunter are due to enter into service in 2004 and 2005. Work at Govan on the further two vessels should commence later this month with a planned in-service date of 2005.

It was noted in the summary of emerging findings of the MQR that responsibility for the management and funding of all medical functions, including secondary care, in Cyprus and Gibraltar should be vested in the respective overseas commands. Consequently the studies into a replacement for the existing hospital will now be taken forward by the Permanent Joint Headquarters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the causes of breakdown in armoured vehicles on exercise Saif Sareea 2; when such breakdowns had been anticipated in advance by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> service staff; and if he will make a statement.  [14809]<P>

<P>
<a name="11119w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Detailed information on the causes of the limited number of breakdowns among the 395 armoured vehicles deployed during the six weeks of Exercise Saif Sareea 2 has not yet been collated but should be available early next year as part of our standard post-deployment assessment. Providing the information at this stage would incur a disproportionate cost.

<P>

<a name="11119w04.html_para0">We did not anticipate any specific causes of breakdown for individual armoured vehicles types although some unplanned maintenance was inevitable given the challenging environment.
<P>

<a name="11119w04.html_para1">Overall the armoured vehicle fleet deployed on Exercise Saif Sareea 2 performed very effectively. The experience gained from the exercise will provide valuable lessons for future deployments.

The recommendation was accepted by the Secretary of State for Defence and subsequently reported to the Cabinet Office Senior Appointments Selection Committee.

<a name="11119w05.html_para1">Defence Ministers had previously decided that, in the overall context of Defence training, the first head of the Defence Academy should be either a senior military officer or a MOD civil servant.

<a name="11119w05.html_para2">Sir Roger Jackling, presently the second permanent secretary of the Ministry of Defence, will take up this appointment in January 2002.

The head of the Defence Academy's budget will be established with effect from 1 April 2002.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to reply to your Parliamentary Question about where the powers of arrest of the Royal Parks Constabulary derive from, because this is an operational matter which is the responsibility of the Royal Parks Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Royal Parks Constabulary originated as park-keepers appointed to maintain order in the Royal Parks. The position of park-keeper was replaced with that of Park Constable with the passing of the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1974, which amended the Parks Regulation Act 1872. Section 7 of the 1872 Act (as amended) gives Park Constables the same powers, privileges and immunities and makes them liable to the same duties and responsibilities, as any police constable in the police district within which the park is located. Park Constables therefore have the same powers of arrest within the parks where they operate as do ordinary police constables in the surrounding police district. These powers of arrest derive from the common law, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and many other statutes.</FONT></UL>

 The United Nations has made several assessment visits to Maluku since 1999.

Many of the Christians evacuated from the province in January are now reported to be voluntarily returning to their homes. Also, many Muslim and Christians who fled their villages to escape the violence are returning, and Muslim leaders in some villages have asked for help in encouraging Christians to return. In Ambon, the two communities remain segregated and there has been very little violence there in recent weeks.

<a name="11119w07.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Foreign Secretary has not discussed with Colin Powell the decision, taken by the Treasuries of the UK, the US and many other UN member states, to freeze the assets of Al Barakat under the terms of UNSCR 1333. Before being made effective or public, the freeze was discussed by Foreign Office and Treasury officials with their US opposite numbers. British Officials approved the freeze and implemented it simultaneously with the US.

<a name="11119w07.html_para3">Al Barakat is a vital part of the Al Qa'ida's financial network. Usama Bin Laden provided Barakat's start-up finance. Al Barakat wittingly provides foreign exchange, banking and international transfer services for Al Qa'ida and Somali organisations affiliated with Al Qa'ida.

 Government planning policies (particularly PPGs 3 and 6) provide incentives by encouraging authorities to prepare town centre strategies, and to promote high quality, safe, attractive developments and places. Planning policies also encourage the provision of a wide range of housing types and sizes in urban areas, so as to meet the requirements of the whole community, including those in need of affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="11119w09.html_para0">PPG3 (Housing) gives priority to re-using previously developed land within urban areas in preference to the development of greenfield sites. This significantly increases the attractiveness of town centre locations to residential developers.
<P>

<a name="11119w09.html_para1">To support the redevelopment of vacant and under-used space over shops and other commercial premises, Budget 2001 introduced 100 per cent. capital allowances for owners and occupiers for the costs of creating flats in these locations for letting, enabling them to obtain up-front tax relief on their spending.
<P>

<a name="11119w09.html_para2">In addition to these national measures, there is plenty of locally targeted activity sponsored by English Partnerships and the regional development agencies. In the centre of Newcastle the city council, English Partnerships and the One North East Regional Development Agency have provided incentives through the "Living Over The Shops" project, supporting creation of new flats in upper floors of commercial buildings. The aim is to double the population of the Grainger Town area of the city centre by 2003. Yorkshire Forward is working with city of York council to redevelop land behind the city's railway station as 'York Central', a mixed use development creating jobs and nearly 3,000 new homes, to provide a new business district for the historic city.
<P>

<a name="11119w09.html_para3">Encouraging people to live in town centres is not just about housing, but also about the services and facilities they will find there. In Manchester city centre for instance the North West Development Agency has invested &#163;1 million to enable the conversion of eight derelict railway arches into a vibrant leisure and retail development at Deansgate Locks.
<P>

<a name="11119w09.html_para4">The renaissance of city centres has taken on its own momentum. Again in Manchester, following the substantial investment by the Central Manchester Development Corporation and the North West Development Agency, new developments now take place without public subsidy, and market-led growth continues.

<a name="11119w09.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Tube modernisation plans are based on infrastructure contracts for maintenance and renewal, which are output driven. As long as key improvements, such as shorter journey times and improved reliability, are made to London Underground's strict specifications, the method of achieving them will be a matter for the infrastructure companies. Moving block signalling is one possible option.

 In September 2000 it was estimated that there were 400 firefighters and fire officers with over 30 years service, with an average of 275 reaching the 30-year mark each year.

 Our policy is to help establish an integrated, sustainable freight distribution system throughout the country to support economic growth and to bring social and environmental benefits. We set out our long term strategy in our 10-year plan and have established the Strategic Rail Authority with a duty to promote rail freight. The SRA's Strategic Agenda and Freight Strategy, published earlier this year, set out its plans for freight, and include proposals for delivering growth on trans-Pennine routes. The SRA will describe further how its freight objectives will be achieved in its soon to be published Strategic Plan.

 There is a wide range of European funded projects running in the Greater London area, some of which are funded through the UK Government and some directly from the European Commission. These include the European Union Framework Programme, Eureka, and LEONARDO.
<P>

<a name="11119w10.html_para3">The largest sources of funding available in London through the UK Government are the Structural Funds&#151;the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. These are worth &#163;570 million to London over the period 2000&#150;06.

 From 1 April 2002, local authorities' capital programmes, including the provision of home improvement grants, will be funded from within a 'single capital pot'. Subject to that overall allocation, it will be for each authority to determine spending priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he has made a cost-benefit assessment of fire services making smoke alarms available free to households in their area.  [15329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w11.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 No specific work has been done to assess the cost-benefit of fire services providing smoke alarms free of charge to householders.
<P>

<a name="11119w11.html_para1">However, we do encourage the fire service to adopt a policy of smoke alarm installation work rather than give-away initiatives when offering free smoke alarms to the public as part of community fire safety activities. This is based on part-Government funded research work undertaken by the Institute of Child Health (now known as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine), which sought to determine whether door-to-door distribution of free smoke alarms to householders was effective in reducing the risk of residential fires, fire related casualties, and serious fire-related injuries.
<P>

<a name="11119w11.html_para2">The evaluation of the work concluded that simply giving smoke alarms to households does not increase ownership of fully operational smoke alarms, nor reduce fire-related deaths and injuries. The research suggested that, in addition, correct installation and positioning is crucial to the effectiveness of initiatives to provide free smoke alarms to householders.

 The various impacts of the redevelopment of the former railway lands around King's Cross/ St. Pancras are being carefully assessed as part of the master planning process being taken forward by London and Continental Railways and their development partner, a consortium of Argent St. George. My Department is very closely involved in this process, which includes extensive community liaison and consultation with business, transport and heritage interests. The process will also involve formal planning applications to the London borough of Camden as the local planning authority. They will closely scrutinise all the impacts of the proposed commercial, residential and leisure development including ease of access, community safety and the employment and housing opportunities offered.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> The two proposed physical agents directives on vibration and noise are based on known health effects. There is an internationally accepted dose-response relationship between exposure to noise and the risk of hearing loss and between exposure to hand-arm vibration and the risk of hand-arm vibration syndrome. There is an association between exposure to whole body vibration and back pain, though the dose-response relationship is not clear.

 Figures for the number of school leavers who go on to higher education are not collated centrally on a constituency basis. The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21 year olds who enter higher education for the first time, are given in the table. The increase in the index in 1997&#150;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&#150;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&#150;99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999&#150;2000. Between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 83,000.

 The only public service agreement target of this nature is that for Sure Start concerning children in Sure Start areas having normal speech and language skills at 18 months and three years. This is related to the previous PSA period 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02, and has now been superseded with a similar target that can be better measured at a local level. The current Sure Start PSA target is:

<a name="11119w13.html_para0">Improved speech and language development is a proxy measure for improving children's ability to learn as there is a strong positive relationship between normal speech and language development and readiness to learn. All Sure Start programmes work towards improving the speech and language skills of children under four. Systems are in place to monitor change in speech and language skills of young children in Sure Start areas and the first information on this will be available later next year.

This shows that EECs have the potential for enhanced cost savings when compared with services that might otherwise have been provided separately. There is also powerful evidence demonstrating that EECs have made a positive difference to the lives of the children and families who use them, and affirming their role in supporting strategies for raising standards, increasing opportunities, supporting families, reducing social exclusion, increasing the health of the nation and addressing child poverty. The second year report is due to be published next spring.

 Information of this type is not collated centrally.

This would involve disproportionate costs and an unnecessary additional burden on school administration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list the total cost of administration of each of the former training and enterprise councils in each of the last three years.  [13336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w14.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Information on the total cost of administration of the former training and enterprise councils is not available. The amount spent by TECs on administration and its disclosure were a matter for individual TECs and varied between them. Some TECs showed no administration costs within their statutory accounts under this heading, while most excluded the costs of staff involved in the direct delivery of their programmes. However, all TECs had to show staffing costs as a note within their accounts. While this understates administration costs, as it does not cover expenditure on premises, information technology and other support systems, it is the only available indicator for the information sought. I have therefore provided figures for the financial years 1997&#150;98, 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 showing spend on staffing costs of each of the former Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England as stated in their consolidated annual statutory audited accounts for the full range of activity TECs undertook. This information is not yet available for 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="11119w14.html_para0">Any direct comparison of staff costs between TECs is misleading, both because there is no statutory definition of staff costs and also because the range of training and enterprise activities differed between TECs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what percentage of school leavers <i>(a)</i> in the Wycombe constituency and <i>(b)</i> nationally entered higher education in each of the last four years.  [14873]<P>

<P>
<a name="11119w14.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Figures for the number of school leavers who go on to higher education are not collated centrally on a constituency basis. The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21-year- olds who enter higher education for the first time, are given in the table. The increase in the index in 1997&#150;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&#150;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&#150;99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999&#150;2000. Between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 83,000.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> 99 per cent. of 15-year-olds have achieved a GCSE pass in English in each of the last three years. However, no separate assessment has been made of literacy rates among school leavers. The Government are committed to raising standards of literacy, particularly through the successful National Literacy Strategy in primary schools and the new Key Stage 3 Strategy in secondary schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidance she gives to <i>(a)</i> schools and <i>(b)</i> local education authorities on the course of action to be adopted where it appears necessary for infants to be taught in classes of more than 30 pupils.  [15384]<P>

<a name="11119w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> Since September 2001 schools and local education authorities have been responsible for ensuring that infant classes for 5, 6 and 7 year olds are limited to 30 or fewer except where permitted by legislation.
<P>

<a name="11119w16.html_para0">How schools organise their classes is a matter for agreement between the LEA and the schools. The Department has issued no guidance to LEAs or schools on how classes which exceed the limit for permitted reasons should be organised.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills takes every opportunity, like the Department for International Development (DFID), to promote fair trade products and also to support ethical trading in mainstream business.

In line with Government procurement policy the evaluation of tenders is based on value for money considerations having due regard to propriety and regularity. We also encourage our current catering providers to offer fair trade products as an option to customers in staff restaurants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply
<P>

<a name="11119w16.html_para1">The National Strategy Action Plan for Neighbourhood Renewal aims to develop common goals including better health, skills, housing and physical environment, and to narrow the gap on these measures between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest of the country. If these aims are to be fulfilled, efforts to provide direct support to deprived neighbourhoods must be combined with efforts to "bend" mainstream programmes that provide funding to ensure that challenges faced by deprived areas can be addressed. To this end the Government will be spending an additional &#163;43 billion a year on core public services by 2004. The costs of implementing the recommendations on neighbourhood renewal are embedded in these and the other billions of pounds spent by Government Departments, and it would involve disproportionate costs to disaggregate this expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w16.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Statistics published by the Department for Education and Skills in October show that 97 per cent. of schools in England are now connected to the internet; significant progress from a position where only 28 per cent. were connected in 1998. Our target is that every school should have access to the internet in 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of Meat Hygiene Service charges on the profitability and operation of small to medium-sized abattoirs.  [9806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following the introduction of revised meat hygiene service charges for abattoirs on 1 April this year there has been no assessment made on their impact to small and medium-sized abattoirs. There is no doubt that there will be positive benefits for small and medium-sized abattoirs but it is too early to assess how the revised charging system will affect their profitability or future operation. Despite the reduction in abattoir numbers over recent years there remains considerable over-capacity in the slaughtering sector and a reasonable spread of abattoirs across most parts of the country. A recent study by the Meat and Livestock Commission found that, while larger abattoirs accounted for over 80 per cent. of the slaughterings of pigs and sheep in 2000&#150;01, small and medium abattoirs increased their share of the numbers of cattle slaughtered. This stood at 46 per cent. in larger abattoirs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w16.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> The United Kingdom has played a full part with the Commission and the other member states concerned in developing the second stage of the cod recovery programme for the North sea and west of Scotland. These revised requirements come into force from 1 January 2002. The UK fishing industry has also been involved closely with the process.
<P>

<a name="11119w16.html_para3">We stand ready to play a similar part in taking forward the Irish sea cod recovery programme on which we expect a proposal from the Commission, shortly, for a repeat of the spring spawning closure. We also expect the Commission to bring forward additional ideas to progress the recovery plan for the northern hake stock.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the annual grant to the Environment Agency for flood defence work has been in each of the last four years in <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> real terms; what the projected figures for the remainder of the planning period are; and if she will make a statement.  [10605]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w16.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> My Department provides funding to the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards for capital works that meet essential criteria and has also in

recent years made funds available to the agency for other initiatives, for example to assist with flood risk public awareness and recently to assist in meeting the extra costs for emergency response and repair associated with last year's floods, and special funding for the design and feasibility costs of river defences.
<P>

<a name="11119w16.html_para4">Allocations to individual authorities, such as the agency, within the total provision depends on the plans identified by those authorities and assessment against the Department's priority score arrangements. Actual outturn reflects the authorities' ability to deliver those plans. Allocations are decided in advance of the start of each financial year and I have just announced those for 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) was launched on 1 June 2000 and is designed to tackle the problem of fuel poverty. It offers packages of insulation and heating improvements to those households most vulnerable to cold-related ill health: low-income older people, families with children, the disabled and the long-term sick.
<P>

<a name="11119w17.html_para12">The scheme does not attempt to assess whether each individual householder falls within the definition of fuel poverty, which would be impractical. Instead it assumes that receipt of one of the main income or disability benefits suggests that the household may be at risk. It is therefore not possible to identify how many of the 250,000 householders assisted to date were in fuel poverty at the time. However, we are confident that they were vulnerable to cold-related ill-health and at risk of fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="11119w17.html_para13">A study of the scheme is planned over the next two years and will provide information on the nature of the householder assisted.

 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> The local authority are responsible for ensuring that the checks at border inspection posts (BIPs) are carried out to the standards specified in community legislation.
<P>

<a name="11119w18.html_para1">The Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996 contains provision for an authorised officer (of the Minister) to audit the local authorities' operation of border inspection posts. This includes checking whether staff comply with the requirements of the regulations, taking samples and the examination of documentary or computer material.
<P>

<a name="11119w18.html_para2">The regulations also require the local authority to provide detailed information on the products checked at the BIP and the outcome of those checks.
<P>

<a name="11119w18.html_para3">Local authorities are required to report on these activities through the Divisional Veterinary Managers of DEFRA. DEFRA staff work closely with the authorities in carrying out these inspection responsibilities.

<P>
<a name="11119w18.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The following provisions in Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 came into force on 30 January 2001: section 1 and Schedule 1, sections 3 to 11 and Schedule 3, sections 15 to 17, section 19, Chapters II and III, and sections 40 to 45. The commencement of these provisions enabled the Countryside Agency to begin preparation of and consultation on draft maps of open country and registered common land.
<P>

<a name="11119w18.html_para5">The right of access, in section 2(1), has not yet been brought into effect. We are committed to opening up all open country and registered common land by the end of 2005, but the Act allows for the right to be commenced at different times in different areas, so it would be possible to give people new rights of access to some areas of land before then. I am considering the option of regional commencement, and hope to make an announcement on this before the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Tackling the amount of waste produced is the first priority in the hierarchy for waste management decisions set out in the Government's Waste Strategy 2000. Action already taken aimed at encouraging waste minimisation includes Government support for the National Waste Awareness Initiative and guidance to local authorities on their powers under the Waste Minimisation Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="11119w18.html_para7">The Government have implemented the Packaging Directive and a voluntary agreement on newsprint. Further legislation on electrical and electronic equipment and batteries will follow, and a voluntary agreement on direct mail. These are all designed to reduce the amount of waste arising from these products.

[13908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Spain's target under the Kyoto protocol is to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 15 per cent. over 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12. Until Spain publishes its climate change programme, it is not possible to comment on Spain's progress towards meeting its target.
<P>

<a name="11119w18.html_para9">The European Community and its member states are already taking action to ensure that they meet their respective targets under the Kyoto protocol. Between 1990 and 1998, the Community's emissions fell by 2.5 per cent. More work is needed to reach the Community's target reduction of 8 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12, but this is in hand both at the member state and Community level.

 The United States participated in the negotiations in Marrakech as a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is important that the United States remain engaged in global efforts to tackle climate change. We have kept the door open for them should they decide to re-engage with the Kyoto process in the future, and we are encouraging them to take domestic action consistent with the aims of Kyoto in the meantime. We take every appropriate opportunity to raise climate change with the US. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State discussed climate change in meetings with Christine Todd Whitman, Administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency, on 1 November and in a meeting on 8 November in Marrakech, with Paula Dobriansky, the Under Secretary for Global Affairs, Department of State. We expect this dialogue with the US to continue.

<P>
<a name="11119w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government set a range of targets in their Chemicals Strategy published in 1999, "Sustainable Production and Use of Chemicals&#151;a strategic approach". Our key priority is to make progress in generating information about chemicals in widespread use and identifying those of most concern so that action can be taken. A Stakeholder Forum was established to implement the strategy and it met its first target by publishing a set of criteria for identifying chemicals of most concern in December 2000. The forum is now working to identify chemicals that meet these criteria.
<P>

<a name="11119w19.html_para2">The Stakeholder Forum is developing indicators of environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals, including those that are carcinogenic. This research will be used to set more specific targets for reducing overall exposure of the environment. I expect the development of the indicators to be completed by July 2002.
<P>

<a name="11119w19.html_para3">In the meantime, an international programme has been agreed to assess the hazards of chemicals that are produced in high volumes. A target has been set to complete 1,000 hazard assessments by 2004. These assessments will provide the information needed to decide whether a chemical is likely to be of concern. The Government will keep the programme under review. Industry and the Stakeholder Forum will review all of the chemicals that meet the criteria for concern. Risk management strategies on chemicals likely to cause serious damage will be produced by 2010 to ensure their

withdrawal from use. By 2015, the international chemicals industry aims to have completed hazard assessments for the 4,100 high production volume chemicals. The UK strategy aims to have at least sufficient data to characterise hazards of all commercially produced chemicals.
<P>

<a name="11119w19.html_para4">The emphasis of the strategy is voluntary action, and full transparency in decision making. This will be a faster route to phasing out chemicals of most concern than the legislation, although I will resort to that if we fail to secure co-operation.
<P>

<a name="11119w19.html_para5">In parallel with the UK strategy, the European Commission is developing legislation to implement its White Paper on a future chemicals policy. The Government are playing an active role to shape the proposals to ensure that an effective mechanism is put in place to ensure rapid progress in phasing out the uses of chemicals of most concern.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK from other EU member states must have been produced in accordance with the harmonised community rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC. Imports from third countries must have been produced to standards at least equivalent to those in the Directive. Among other things, this Directive sets out the licensing, structural and veterinary supervision requirements to be applied in abattoirs, cutting plants and cold stores.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para0">All meat imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where it is subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks. These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition during transport. In line with community rules, random spot checks at destination may be carried out on consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK from other EU member states.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para1">New arrangements have been introduced across all enforcement agencies involved to improve the sharing and analysis of information about known or suspected illegal imports. We are building up a database of details which is enabling us to target enforcement action and to make best use of available resources. Our national regulations have also been amended to assist local authorities in seizing suspected illegal imports when they are found at point of sale. The Food Standards Agency is also encouraging local authorities to ensure that checking for illegal imports is part of their routine inspection of food premises.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para2">Alongside this we have introduced improved publicity to ensure that travellers are aware of the restrictions on what may be imported. Posters have been placed at main airports and we have asked UK travel agents and airlines using UK airports to make information about import controls available to travellers. Recognising that it is most effective to inform travellers before they leave for their journey to the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have been active via British Embassies abroad, providing information directly to travellers and via travel agents and local media.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para3">We are keeping these measures under review and will make improvements as necessary. In addition, we are looking at a wide range of other options to ensure the rules on imports are enforced effectively and efficiently. These include, for example, the possible use of sniffer dogs and X-ray machines at ports and airports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the prospects for beef exports to <i>(a)</i> Germany, <i>(b)</i> the Netherlands, <i>(c)</i> Italy and <i>(d)</i> France; and how many United Kingdom plants are qualified to export beef.

<P>
<a name="11119w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 November 2001]:</i> It is not possible to make a realistic assessment of future prospects because recovery of our beef exports depends on many factors including the number of plants which seek approval to export under the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES); the conditions of DBES; the results of our BSE testing programme; consumer confidence in the countries concerned and currency values. In addition, prospects for beef exports to France depend on the outcome of the Commission's ECJ case which is expected shortly.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para4">Prior to the foot and mouth outbreak two establishments were approved to export beef under DBES.

Staff who have joined DEFRA since its creation are included in the percentage for MAFF.

 Information about numbers of ministerial appointments to public bodies is included in the Cabinet Office's annual report, "Public Bodies". Copies of this are placed in the Library of the House and the report is published on the Cabinet Office's internet website. The next edition of "Public Bodies", which will include numbers of appointments at 31 March 2001, will be published around the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para5">During the period 7 June 2001 to 31 October 2001, my Department made 33 ministerial appointments to public bodies. This figure includes 13 reappointments. The total number of appointments, which are currently within the gift of DEFRA Ministers, is 781.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> In their report on "The Use of Genetically Modified Animals", published on 21 May 2001, the Royal Society endorsed the recommendation of the Royal Society of Canada for a moratorium on the rearing of GM fish in aquatic net-pens, with approval for commercial production being conditional on the rearing of the fish in land-locked facilities.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para6">The views of the Royal Society accord with current Government policy.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para7">The keeping and rearing of GM fish is already tightly controlled. They must be kept in secure containment in land based tanks with suitable precautions to preclude escape. The keeping of GM fish in nets, tanks or cages in the sea or in rivers, lakes or streams would constitute a release to the environment and is prohibited under EU legislation without prior consent from the relevant authority. Any application to keep GM fish in such circumstances would have to be underpinned by a detailed risk assessment and would be considered on a case-by- case basis. Applicants would be required to demonstrate that there would be no adverse effects on human health or the environment arising from the activity. Given these requirements it is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which we would permit such a release.
<P>

<a name="11119w20.html_para8">There are no GM fish held in aquatic net-pens in this country and no approval has yet been sought or granted for commercial production of GM fish.

<a name="11119w21.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs led the UK delegation to the recent climate change negotiations in Marrakech. We achieved our aim of successfully translating the political agreement reached in Bonn in July on the implementation of the Kyoto protocol into detailed legal texts, removing the final obstacle to ratification and entry into force of the protocol. The UK intends to ratify, along with our EU partners, in time to allow entry into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development next September. Since Marrakech, Japan has also announced that it will now press ahead with preparations for ratification next year. We hope that many other countries will follow suit.

<a name="11119w21.html_para1">As at April 2000, the latest date for which data are available, the average cost of answering a written parliamentary question was &#163;123. The total cost of answering the questions tabled by the hon. Member for Buckingham on 12 November is therefore approximately &#163;14,500, although given that the cost is based on an average it is a very conservative figure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Social Exclusion Unit has three key priorities for the next 12 months. The first of these is to deliver four new reports on areas of cross-cutting work to address issues of social exclusion. These areas are: reducing the rates of re-offending among ex-prisoners; developing a more effective system to prevent young people from running away and to help those that do; improving the educational achievement of children in care; and removing the transport barriers that prevent people accessing work and critical services.
<P>

<a name="11119w21.html_para2">The Social Exclusion Unit's second priority is to work closely with the implementation units in other Government Departments to ensure that there is effective implementation of previous work carried out by the unit. This relates to projects carried out on rough sleepers, school exclusions and truancy, providing opportunities for 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment or training, and the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal. To support this work the Social Exclusion Unit will communicate with members of the public, the voluntary and the business sector, local government and key professionals regarding the Government's policies on social exclusion and ensure that they receive accurate, up to date information about the work of the unit.
<P>

<a name="11119w21.html_para3">The third priority for the Social Exclusion Unit over the next 12 months is to plan to deliver new areas of cross-cutting work to address specific issues of social exclusion as directed by the Prime Minister.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The British Crime Survey shows that violent crime reached its peak in 1995. Since then, there have been steady falls: down 17 per cent. by 1997, a further 4 per cent. by 1999, and a substantial further fall of 19 per cent. by 2000. Much of the explanation lies in the adoption of a strategic approach to tackling violent crime which emphasises the need for effective policing and punishment, as well as policies to root out the conditions which can engender violent crime, and better support for victims. We are determined to secure further reductions in violent crime in the coming years.

 The main focus of the Government's drugs strategy is on the drugs that cause the greatest harm, Class A drugs such as heroin and cocaine. However, as the Home Secretary indicated in his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on 23 October 2001, we need to be even more effective at tackling the harm caused by Class A drugs. He is seeking advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs on their assessment for reclassifying cannabis from Class B to Class C and will be introducing an innovative public awareness campaign on drugs aimed at young people. In addition, he has provided &#163;1 million as a starter fund for a pilot project to help police target regional drug traffickers with a view to a national roll-out of the scheme, has agreed further roll-out of drug testing programmes, and has agreed a series of measures, in partnership with the Department of Health, to minimise the harm drugs cause. We are also currently reviewing progress against all the drugs strategy targets as part of the work for the 2002 spending review, to ensure that we still have the right balance and focus.

<P>
<a name="11119w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Tackling crime and the fear of crime in all areas, including rural areas, is a clear priority for this Government. Our approach is to support the police and the local crime and disorder partnerships in tackling local crime effectively.
<P>

<a name="11119w23.html_para8">This includes increased funding for police forces covering rural areas to take account of the additional costs involved: &#163;30 million is being allocated to 31 forces this year. This money will make a real difference to policing in rural areas. In addition, the anti-crime strategies drawn up by the crime and disorder partnerships support a wide range of initiatives, including local "watch" schemes to help protect farms, equipment and livestock, and rural closed circuit television schemes. The rural crime toolkit, on the crime reduction website, will help local partnerships address crime in rural areas.

<a name="11119w23.html_para9">The British Crime Survey shows that crime levels are significantly lower in rural areas than in urban areas, with levels of burglary, violent and vehicle crime declining.

 The female prison population has increased by 52 per cent. between 30 April 1997 and 30 September 2001.
<P>

<a name="11119w25.html_para4">The main reason for the growth in this period is the rise in the custody rates at the courts. Around half the increase is accounted for by women imprisoned for drug offences; mainly unlawful importation of drugs, supplying class A drugs and possession with intent to supply class A drugs. During 2001, a rise in remands has also been a contributory factor.

<a name="11119w25.html_para5">Projections of long term trends in the prison population to 2008 were published on 23 May 2001 (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 8/01).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to <i>(a)</i> ensure that adequate provision has been made for the accommodation of women prisoners, <i>(b)</i> reduce the risk of suicide among women prisoners and <i>(c)</i> ensure the safety of prisoners at Downview prison in Surrey.

 The Prison Service Management Board continuously monitors the changes in population in order to ensure sufficient accommodation is provided for each group of offenders sent into prison custody. The change of function at Downview is one of the actions that was taken to provide adequate accommodation for women prisoners. Consideration is currently being given to the need to change the function of another male prison to accommodate women prisoners.
<P>

<a name="11119w25.html_para6">Following the Prison Service Internal Review, "Prevention of Suicide and Self-Harm in the Prison Service", a new three-year strategy to reduce prisoner suicides and self-harm was announced by my predecessor on 5 February. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types of prisons and prisoners whether male or female. Implementation of the strategy is being taken forward as part of a long-term programme aiming to reduce suicides and self-harm. This is an all-round approach to encourage a supportive culture in prisons based on good staff-prisoner relationships, a constructive regime and a physically safe environment. Among the five establishments chosen to pilot this programme is the women's prison and young offender institution Eastwood Park. The Prison Service has a duty of care to all prisoners in its custody, and recognises that self-harm is a particular problem among women offenders. The review highlighted the need for specific interventions for repetitive self-injury and a number of steps are being taken to address this issue. The Prison Service is considering alternative care pathways for those who injure themselves. After development, piloting and evaluation it is intended that specific interventions will be introduced in those prisons with a specific need.
<P>

<a name="11119w25.html_para7">All prisoners are assessed for the potential for self-harm before allocation to Downview. Prisoners who have been identified as being at risk of self-harm are only being allocated to Her Majesty's Prison Downview if this provides additional support and is specified in their individual support plan. Prisoners exhibiting the potential for self-harm while at Downview are closely monitored.

 Part 5 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill provides for the expansion of incitement to racial hatred and racially aggravated offences, to cover religious hatred and aggravated offences against members of religious groups.
<P>

<a name="11119w26.html_para0">The Bill defines "religious hatred" as hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. A "religious group" is defined as a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. It will be for the courts, if required, to interpret religious belief. This is in keeping with the approach taken in Northern Ireland since 1987 and the approach taken in international human rights instruments.
<P>

<a name="11119w26.html_para1">We do not believe that it is necessary in the criminal context to define religious groups. This law does not seek to defend religion or religious belief; instead it seeks to protect public order and religious groups from hatred and, in the case of aggravated offences, from violence and harassment. The Government do not intend to make value judgments about religions in this Bill. It is one thing to question, criticise or ridicule a religion and another thing to incite hatred against a group or to attack a person for holding beliefs.

 Powers of detention under the Immigration Acts are contained in Schedules 2 and 3 to the Immigration Act 1971. Those in Schedule 2 are exercisable by immigration officers, principally in relation to individuals liable to further examination or removal. Those in Schedule 3 relate to individuals subject to deportation action and are exercisable by the Secretary of State. There are no statutory time limits on the duration of detention although, as a general principle, it should continue for no longer than is necessary.
<P>

<a name="11119w26.html_para2">In addition, the provisions of the Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Bill will allow for the detention under Immigration Act powers of persons the Secretary of State has certified as being suspected international terrorists who are a threat to our national security, despite the fact that their removal or departure may be prevented for the time being by a point of law relating to an international agreement or by practical obstacles.

 The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 made kerb crawling an arrestable offence and created a new offence of placing prostitutes cards in telephone boxes.

<a name="11119w26.html_para3">We are also funding 11 projects as part of the crime reduction programme to find out 'what works' in tackling the crime and disorder associated with legislation.

 The Government are concerned to prevent vulnerable people, particularly children, from entering prostitution. They are therefore keen to ensure that the criminal law deals properly with those who seek to coerce or induce people into prostitution or exploit them as prostitutes. "Setting The Boundaries: Reforming the law on Sex Offences", published in July 2000, makes recommendations for new offences to deal with this and the Government are looking at these very carefully in the light of responses to the consultation exercise. A decision on all the proposals in the report will be announced in due course.
<P>

<a name="11119w26.html_para4">In addition, guidance on "Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution" was published jointly by the Home Office and the Department of Health in May 2000. One of its key messages is that those under 18 who engage in prostitution are almost invariably victims and must be treated as such. Agencies must work together to identify children at risk to prevent them entering prostitution and help them exit it.

 The proposed missile defence systems are not designed to protect against the type of attack seen on 11 September.

In the future, this might include ballistic missiles. Our position with regard to missile

We believe that it is important to tackle all these potential threats with a comprehensive strategy that includes arms control, counter-proliferation, diplomacy, deterrence and defensive measures.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent on the purchase of health care by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within the health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.<P>

2. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialities which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are therefore not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.<P>

1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent on the purchase of health care by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within the health authority area. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.<P>

2. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also 



distort the figures so the results are therefore not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.<P>

<a name="11119w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have undertaken extensive consultation on the proposals to establish a new Nursing and Midwifery Council. The draft legislation recognises health visitors' special contribution to public health and contains a number of safeguards for health visiting. There will be a separate part of the register for health visitors, protection of their professional title and they will be guaranteed equal representation on the council with nurses and midwives. Legislation is in the final stages of preparation and will be published shortly, together with a report on consultation. There are no plans to amend the proposed title of the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

<a name="11119w29.html_para0">The increases are net increases and take account of staff leaving the national health service and attrition during training. They are based on what is deliverable from training, recruitment and retention initiatives and international recruitment.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> Cost of living supplements were introduced in April 2001 as part of a wide-ranging strategy to address recruitment and retention in the national health service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The recent judgments of the European Court of Justice in the joined cases Geraets-Smits/ Peerbooms and Case Vanbraekel (joined Cases C-157/99 and Case 368/98 respectively) marked a development in the interpretation of directly applicable provisions of European Community law. These provisions override even inconsistent national law and must be given effect to. The relevant provisions of the National Health Service Act 1977 will be amended in the interests of legal certainty. This can be done by regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972 and this is in hand. In the meantime health authorities and NHS trusts are free to commission services abroad. However, sending patients abroad does pose practical and legal problems surrounding patient welfare. Besides establishing three test-bed sites to develop processes for sending patients abroad officials are discussing the practical and legal issues involved with relevant colleagues and interested parties, including the British Medical Association.

 Under national health service legislation, any asylum seeker given leave to remain in the United Kingdom or awaiting a decision on their application is regarded as ordinarily resident and is eligible for free treatment from a general practitioner and eligible to receive NHS hospital treatment. More specifically the Department is working with the Home Office to ensure that the health of asylum seekers is a key consideration in the reform of the asylum system announced recently by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. Also, officials are working with the Refugee Council to identify existing best practice in meeting the health and social care needs of asylum seekers dispersed through the National Asylum Support Service. This guidance is expected to be available early next year.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2001]:</i> In the selection of a topic for the national service framework programme, the main criteria are the importance of a health issue in terms of morbidity and mortality; the need for service improvement; and the capacity of the national health service and its partner agencies to implement the framework.

<a name="11119w30.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We are currently holding discussions with the manufacturers to consider a range of options under which drugs for multiple sclerosis might be made available under the national health service. One option is a "risk sharing" scheme which will evaluate their clinical and cost-effectiveness, and until these discussions are concluded we cannot provide detailed information on potential numbers of patients and likely costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the refusal of Merton, Sutton and Wandsworth NHS to fund anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment for a patient living in Battersea with rheumatoid arthritis.  [13172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Merton, Sutton and Wandsworth health authority recognise the potential benefit of anti-TNF treatments and are funding 24 patients who are part of an already established clinical trial. The health authority is not currently funding new patients. However, its health modernisation group is due to meet shortly to review the funding for these treatments. Funding for anti-TNF drugs will be considered along with other priorities as part of the HA process for financial planning for 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) requires that all midwifery pre-registration students should be able to provide

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11119w30.html_para2">The UKCC does not set any specific requirement for health visitor training on breastfeeding support. The statutory bodies do not define the hours required for specific topics within the total hours of the curriculum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Decisions on national health service provision of complementary or alternative medicine treatments are made by those responsible for commissioning health services for patients locally.
<P>

<a name="11119w30.html_para3">Osteopathy&#151;of which cranial osteopathy is one form&#151;is already available on the NHS, and is included in the information pack on complementary and alternative medicine for primary care groups which the Department published in July 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Post-natal care for women is provided on the basis of assessed health and parenting needs of the mother and baby rather than on the basis of the number of babies born. A range of family support services is available through health (doctors, midwives and health visitors) and social services.
<P>

<a name="11119w30.html_para4">We are currently developing the National Service Framework for Children, which will include the setting of new standards of quality for maternity services and post-natal care for all women.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many hospitals are taking part in the red card scheme; how many <i>(a)</i> red and <i>(b)</i> yellow cards have been issued; and what changes have been observed in the levels of violence to staff in the hospitals involved.  [13722]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Department issued national guidelines to national health service trusts to help develop policies on withholding NHS treatment from violent and abusive patients on 2 November 2001. All trusts must consider the need to develop a local policy on withholding treatment from violent and abusive patients. Such policies and procedures should form part of local policies addressing safer working conditions and should be in place by April 2002.
<P>

<a name="11119w30.html_para5">St. Bartholomews and the London NHS Trust introduced a policy on the withdrawal of treatment from violent patients, also known as the yellow and red card scheme, in September 2000. The policy has had a significant deterrent effect, and although the trust has issued eight yellow cards (formal written warnings), it has not proved necessary to issue red cards (withdrawal of treatment).

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We received 220 responses from manufacturers, health professionals and patients. 202 expressed opposition to the current arrangements.
<P>

<a name="11119w30.html_para6">The current system was introduced in 1999 to get a balance between treating men with impotence and protecting national health service resources to deal with other priorities including those with cancer, heart disease and mental health problems. Expenditure on impotence treatment drugs, at &#163;25 million a year, is above what we expected and continues to increase. We have concluded that the extra cost of allowing unrestricted prescribing might be substantially higher leading to diversion of funds from other NHS priorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the outstanding repair and maintenance backlog figures in each health authority in England are for each of the last two years.  [13620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Figures collected which generally reflect the cost of outstanding repair and maintenance of hospitals are known as the "cost to achieve Estatecode condition B". In relation to a building's physical condition this is the condition whereby the property is considered to be physically sound, operationally safe and exhibits only minor deterioration.
<P>

<a name="11119w30.html_para7">Costs to achieve Estatecode condition B (physical condition) for the year 1999&#150;2000, grouped into each health authority in England, are shown in the table. Similar costs for the year 2000&#150;01 are still in the process of collection and validation and are unlikely to be available until early next year.
<P>

<a name="11119w30.html_para8">Figures for special health authorities (SHA), figures are only collected in connection with special hospitals and therefore exclude costs relating to all other SHA organisations (for example, Family Health Services Appeal Authority, Commission for Health Improvement, NHS Information Authority).

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service consultants are employed under a professional contract, in that they do not specify particular hours of work. Whole-time and maximum part-time contract holders have a contractual commitment to devote substantially the whole of their professional time, up to 11 sessions, to their national health service duties. In 1999 a survey by KPMG did, however, demonstrate that both the volume of work and intensity of work, as a whole, had increased since 1990. Intensity pay supplements, amounting to &#163;50 million were therefore introduced from April 2000 to recognise and reward increases in work load, intensity of work and contribution to the NHS.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the change in work load for NHS consultants as a result of the Calman report and the new deal.  [14051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It is not possible to identify the effect of individual initiatives on changes in consultant work load. As well as implementation of the Calman report and the new deal, there have been parallel changes in service management and patient throughput, and changes in the balance of in-patient and day-case clinical work which will have had an effect on consultant work load.
<P>

<a name="11119w32.html_para1">Since the new deal was launched in 1991 there has been an increase in the consultant work force of 7,200 (45.5 per cent.) and since the Calman reforms were implemented in 1996 there has been an increase of 3,800 (19.9 per cent.). There have also been significant increases in the number of trainees and other hospital doctors in the relevant period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on how the higher travel costs and average basic pay of health workers in rural areas is reflected in the NHS funding formula.  [14378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w32.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department uses a weighted capitation formula to determine each health authority's fair share of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need. The formula weights each health authority's population 



<P>
<P><I>19 Nov 2001 : Column: 126W</I><P>
according to their relative need for healthcare and unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing healthcare.
<P>

<a name="11119w32.html_para2">Within the formula the staff market forces factor estimates the relative differentials that national health service employers need to pay in order to recruit and retain staff. And the emergency ambulance cost adjustment reflects the unavoidable cost variations of providing emergency ambulance services. This adjustment particularly benefits areas with low population density and lower numbers of journeys than average.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has for including rurality as a factor in the NHS funding formula.  [14379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The national health service funding formula weights each health authority's population according to their relative need for health care and the unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing health care.
<P>

<a name="11119w32.html_para3">Earlier studies have not identified evidence of need for health care associated with rurality that is not already covered within the formula. However some services cost more to provide in rural areas. An emergency ambulance cost adjustment has been included in the formula since 1998&#150;99.
<P>

<a name="11119w32.html_para4">A review of the formula is currently under way. By 2003 following the review, reducing inequalities will be a key criterion for allocating NHS resources to different parts of the country. The review will include consideration of the health needs of rural areas.

<P>

 I understand that Havering council is undertaking a review of its own care homes in order to ensure that they are able to meet future needs and standards. As a result of this review, one council home closed recently and another is in the process of doing so. The council plans to establish four new resource centres that are capable of meeting care needs in a holistic manner. There have been no recent independent home closures in Havering.

agreement with local government, the national health service and independent sector providers of care&#151;Building Capacity and Partnership&#151;will help to bring stability to the care home sector. In addition, Havering council is being targeted for extra help and will this year receive &#163;550,000 of the &#163;300 million we are allocating to councils over the next two years to tackle the problem of delayed discharge from hospital.

 National minimum standards for care homes for older people were published on 2 March 2001. Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11119w33.html_para2">Most of the standards will apply from 1 April 2002. The exceptions include standards 28.1 and 31.2 (qualifications of staff and managers) which will apply from 2005, and standards 20.1 (communal space per resident in homes existing prior to April 2002), 23.3 and 23.4 (floor space in single rooms), and 23.11 (proportion of single rooms) which will apply from 2007.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health on what basis social services departments will be graded with star ratings in accordance with his speech to the recent local government conference at Harrogate.  [14940]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w33.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The star rating that each social services department receives will be soundly based upon professional judgment encompassing all the available performance evidence&#151;from inspections, in-year monitoring and the performance indicators. The new system will allow people to tell at a glance how their local council is performing and provide national accountability by highlighting how their performance changes over time.
<P>

<a name="11119w33.html_para3">The detailed process for awarding star ratings is still being decided, in consultation with the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Social Services.

They will cover areas with outer boundaries coterminous with the Government offices for the regions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what estimate he has made of the likely cost in financial year 2002&#150;03 of <i>(a)</i> an incremental research and development tax credit for all companies paid only on additional spending and <i>(b)</i> a research and development tax credit for all companies covering all relevant spending;  [15702]

 The Government set out their views of an incremental R and D tax credit for large companies in the Budget consultation document "Increasing Innovation" published on 7 March. Since then we have received a number of responses from companies, representative bodies and others, which we are considering. The cost of such a measure depends upon the rate at which the credit is given and the final design of the scheme. Until decisions are reached on the design of the credit and the rate of relief, it is not possible to estimate the cost of the credit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w36.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The climate change levy was only introduced in April 2001. Therefore no annual figures are available.

<P>
<a name="11119w36.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the proportion of companies paying the climate change levy which will pay an excess charge over and above NI rebates.  [15706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11119w36.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The climate change levy is broadly revenue neutral with all revenue being recycled back to business through a reduction in national insurance contributions cuts and support for energy efficiency measures. The impact on any specific company or sector will depend on a number of factors, including: their future energy consumption and the use made of levy funded energy efficiency support; employment levels and the benefits received from the levy funded reductions in national insurance contributions; eligibility to receive a discount by signing up to an energy efficiency agreement; the use made of electricity generated from 'new' renewable sources of energy and combined heat and power, both of which are levy exempt.

 In 2001&#150;02 alone, the Government will spend around &#163;4&#189; billion more in real terms on help for pensioners than was spent in 1996&#150;97. That is almost &#163;3 billion more than would have been spent through earnings uprating of the basic state pension. Of this extra spending, &#163;2 billion is going to the poorest third of pensioners&#151;five times more than an earnings link would have given them.

<a name="11119w40.html_para4">The rules for the adjustment of benefits for periods in hospital are applied to most social security benefits such as incapacity benefit as well as to retirement and widow's pension. These rules, which are laid down in law, have been applied with only minor modifications since the introduction of the national insurance scheme over 50 years ago. The rules are based on the view that while the national health service provides free maintenance as well as free treatment, maintenance benefits, also paid out of state funds, should not be paid in full indefinitely.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> We consider carefully the findings of reports such as "Removing the Barriers". While the welfare reforms the Government have, and continue to make, have not been made as a specific result of concerns expressed in this particular report, they address many of the concerns raised.
<P>

<a name="11119w41.html_para0">The report concluded that there was a need for a co-ordinated approach to the provision of welfare services and that central and local government needed to share common objectives. We are committed to working together with the Local Government Association and have already agreed a framework for the conduct of relations between central and local government. Among the many things the framework embraces is a commitment to reflect both local and national priorities and the views of local communities.
<P>

<a name="11119w41.html_para1">The new pension service will also be based on working in close partnership with local authorities, particularly to encourage the take-up of benefits for older people. Officials met with the local government association on 24 October to discuss how these proposals can be taken forward.

 Child poverty is a complex multi-dimensional concept, affecting many aspects of children's lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of the environment, and opportunities to learn. The third "Opportunity for all" report (Cm 5260) sets out the Government's strategy for tackling child poverty and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against this strategy. The report also contains details of Public Service Agreement targets which set levels of progress to be achieved over specific timescales.
