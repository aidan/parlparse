<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Sir Richard Body: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the current status of the draft Council Directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees; and if a blocking minority currently shares the Government's position.  [97565]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The draft directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees has not been discussed in the Council of Ministers since it was first proposed by the Commission in December 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Crausby: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans he has to extend the Working Time Directive to the transport industry.  [97355]
<P><P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Waterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he intends to propose amendments to the Working Time Regulations to specify working hours for the occupations of mobile workers, including roundsmen.  [97252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Proposals to extend the working time directive to workers (mobile and non-mobile) in the transport sector are currently being negotiated in Brussels. It is not expected that the Directive will be formally adopted before next year. After that, there will be consultation on implementation in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Sarwar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the number of the people who have benefited from the introduction of the national minimum wage.  [97579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 700,000 more people were earning above national minimum wage rates in March-May 1999 than in the same period last year and almost two million who were earning below the national minimum wage will benefit when its full effects can be measured.

<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I understand that specified weapons are prohibited from manufacture, sale, hire or importation by the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) Order 1988. Section 141 of the 1988 Act includes an exemption for the supply of such items to the Crown and visiting forces, but not the police service. I also understand that, under the Firearms Act 1968, weapons whose possession is prohibited without the express authority of the Secretary of State include fully automatic weapons, self-loading and pump action rifles, handguns, mortars, rocket launchers, weapons designed to discharge noxious substances and firearms disguised as something else. Ammunition regarded as particularly dangerous (such as that designed to explode or expand on impact, pierce armour or have an incendiary effect at the target) is also subject to prohibition.
<P>

<a name="91108w01.htm_para0">The export of certain defence and security goods has been banned, and details are set out in the Summary of additional UK Restrictions on the Export of Strategic Goods, compiled by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; a copy of this document is in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures he proposes to ensure that <i>(a)</i> retailers and <i>(b)</i> packer and fillers take an increased share of the recovery and recycling obligation contained in the UK Packaging Waste Regulations 1997. [97472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="91108w01.htm_para1">The Advisory Committee on Packaging has proposed that the percentage obligation of packaging manufacturers should be reduced by two percentage points and that of packer/fillers and retailers be increased by one percentage point each. I expect to make a further announcement on this matter shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will estimate the increased cost to United Kingdom packaging manufacturers following implementation of the UK Packaging Waste Regulations in 1997.  [97471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="91108w01.htm_para2">The recovery and recycling obligations under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 took effect in 1998. My Department estimates that the costs of complying with these obligations in 1998 was some &#163;78,000,000 for the 4,011 obligated parties registered with the Environment Agency or Scottish Environment Protection Agency. We do not have a breakdown of figures specifically for packaging manufacturers, but these made up some 8 per cent. of the 4,011 registrations in 1998.

<a name="91108w01.htm_para3">Since 1989, the Government have been providing impartial advice to business and commerce through the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme. This provides information, energy efficiency studies and research and development support to manufacturers and others in the non-domestic sector. The Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme has helped industry to save over &#163;650 million per annum, to reduce emissions by over 3 million tonnes of carbon per annum and to improve energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="91108w01.htm_para4">In his Budget statement on 9 March 1999, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that, as a part of the Government's proposal to introduce the Climate Change Levy, he intended to recycle the revenue from the levy, in full, to business. He indicated that the Government intended that some &#163;50 million of revenue from the levy would be used to assist with funding of schemes to promote energy efficiency, including additional support for renewable sources of energy. The Government are considering how best to make use of the proposed additional funding to maximise the benefit to the non-domestic sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the extent to which the industrial sectors already with high energy efficiency will assist in achieving Kyoto targets; and if he will make a statement.  [97641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="91108w01.htm_para5">The Department commissions research which estimates the potential for cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in industry, commerce, the public sector and housing. This is done at a disaggregated level so that the scope in individual industrial sub-sectors is known. The information is being used in discussions with energy intensive sectors as a starting point for energy efficiency targets for negotiated agreements on the Climate Change Levy.

reduced by &#163;111,836,000 from &#163;3,377,638,000 to &#163;3,265,802,000. This is the net effect of increased Voted provision of &#163;130,974,000 and reduced non-Voted provision of &#163;242,810,000.
<P>

<a name="91108w01.htm_para8">The increase on Class XII Vote 3 is the net effect of additional Comprehensive Spending Review funding of &#163;37,000,000 (running costs), a take up of &#163;8,000,000 (running costs) from the Departmental Unallocated Provision (which will not change the gross running costs limit), an increase of &#163;3,137,000 (running costs) in respect of the reform of all work test and active case management, an increase of &#163;120,407,000 (running costs) under the end year flexibility scheme as announced by the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon.

<P>
<a name="91108w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Australian Government announced in July that they intended to terminate the Social Security agreement with the UK. We have not received formal notice of termination. The agreement would terminate 12 months after the UK received formal notification.
<P>

<a name="91108w02.htm_para1">The agreement helps UK pensioners who have lived in Australia for less than 10 years to meet the residence test for Australia's Age Pension. It can also help former residents of Australia now living in the UK to qualify for UK State Pension. People who had already become entitled to benefit through the agreement when it terminated would remain covered by its terms, so there would be no effect on them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Financial provision for the costs of uprating is set by reference to the most recent inflation assumption. Inflation assumptions for 2000-01 underpinning forecasts for expenditure for the Comprehensive Spending Review are set out at page 108 table B1 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report 1998 (HC620). These forecasts were updated in November 1998 and for the Budget in March 1999. The inflation assumptions underlying the Department's latest expenditure forecasts are set out on page 89 of the Social Security Departmental Report (Cm 4214).

A significant further volume of provision will be paid for in this financial year. The national launch of New Deal took place in April 1998 and as a result young people did not move into Options provision until later in the year and secondly that there was some late billing by providers. Expenditure on training provision is also affected by the higher than expected, and welcome, movement from the Gateway into unsubsidised jobs.

 Research is currently in progress to study the effect of the Road Traffic Act 1991 on prosecutions for dangerous driving. Among other topics, this includes a comparison of sentencing trends before and since the 1991 Act and monitoring of the behaviour of persons convicted of serious driving offences. The aim is to improve understanding so as to deter poor driving more effectively. The project began in May 1998 and is due to be completed in October 2000.

<a name="91108w03.htm_para5">A project has recently been completed for the Department to monitor the effectiveness of the experimental drink-drive rehabilitation scheme. The research carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory and published as "Drink/driver rehabilitation courses in England and Wales" (TRL report 426) suggests that offenders who have attended an approved rehabilitation course are three times less likely to re-offend. The scheme is to be made permanent throughout Great Britain from 1 January 2000. Consideration is currently being given to further research and monitoring.

 New planting of trees has taken place at a rate of 15,000 to 20,000 hectares per year since 1990 as a result of Government policy on woodland expansion. The present rate of increase in tree cover is likely to contribute about 0.25 per cent. towards the commitment under the Kyoto protocol.
<P>

<a name="91108w03.htm_para7">It would be possible to increase this proportion by accelerating the rate of new planting. Policies and initiative schemes whereby this might be achieved are under consideration by the Government Departments responsible.

 <i>[holding answer 2 November 1999]:</i> I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Mr. Peter Nutt, to write to the hon. Member.

<a name="91108w03.htm_para9"><i>Letter from Peter Nutt to Mr. Bernard Jenkin, dated 8 November 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You recently wrote to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions concerning the expected residual life of motorways and trunk roads.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency has a target to ensure that the percentage of the trunk road network having zero residual life at the end of financial year 1999/2000 is less than the figure published in the 1998 report of the National Road Maintenance Condition Survey (NRMCS). This gives the proportion of Motorways and All-purpose trunk roads as 4.6 percent and 8.2 percent respectively. The Agency expects to achieve this target with the proportions being lower than the 1998 figures at the end of the current financial year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no specific target for the residual life band zero to four years in the Agency's Business Plan but the information will be published in the 1999 edition of the NRMCS report. The Agency expects that the proportions will not be significantly different to those quoted in the 1998 report. These state that 8.2 percent of Motorways and 7.2 percent of All-purpose trunk roads had a residual life of zero to four years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is important to emphasise that residual life is only one of several indicators of road condition. A zero residual life indicates the onset of a less predictable deterioration pattern and the need for investigation. It does not necessarily indicate that the road is about to fail. I trust that this information is helpful.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="91108w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Secretary of State and the Franchising Director have received few representations about train cancellations and delays relating to leaves on the track or the level of resources devoted to leaf clearance. None of these has concerned the Connex North Kent lines specifically. Railtrack and train operating companies have set aside &#163;50 million to combat leaves on the lines.

<P>
<a name="91108w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In the first instance, it is for the employer to decide on appropriate disciplinary action to be taken with staff who contravene proper working practices. In addition there are duties on employees and employers under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and under specific regulations to ensure that work is done safely. For instance, the Railways (Safety Critical Work) 



<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 1999 : Column: 390</I><P>
Regulations 1994 require that employees are fit and competent to undertake activities (such as train driving) which are safety critical. The Health and Safety Executive could prosecute employers or employees who have contravened these duties and requirements.
<P>

<a name="91108w04.htm_para0">Among the immediate measures agreed at the meeting that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister held with rail industry leaders on 25 October were a review of consistent standards of driver training and establishing a consistent approach to safety management, embracing best practice across the network.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions by what means the Government will define energy-intensive operations when deciding which firms will receive significant discounts on the climate change levy.  [97378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w04.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 For the purpose of the climate change levy, energy intensive operations have been defined as those listed in Annex I to the European Union's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive. Sites which undertake operations of this type may join an appropriate sectoral energy efficiency agreement. Sectors which are able to negotiate satisfactory agreements will be eligible for reduced rates of levy.
<P>

<a name="91108w04.htm_para1">We have received suggestions from industry for alternative definitions and are giving these consideration as part of overall consideration of industry representations on the design of the levy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w04.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions with which less energy-intensive sectors the Government have started preliminary discussions on energy efficiency agreements; and to what extent those discussions have included the possibility of linking in with such agreements a mechanism for varying rates of climate change levy. [97380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government are not discussing energy efficiency agreements with less energy-intensive sectors. The Government invited the ten largest energy intensive industry sectors to participate in negotiations for energy efficiency agreements in March this year. Subsequently, we have initiated negotiations for agreements with a number of smaller energy intensive sectors.
<P>

<a name="91108w04.htm_para2">In both cases, the Government are offering the prospect of significantly lower rates of levy for those sectors that can agree targets for improving their energy efficiency which meet the Government's criteria.
<P>

<a name="91108w04.htm_para3">We have received representations from some non-intensive sectors. For non-intensive sectors, it may be worthwhile for them to explore the possibility of voluntary energy efficiency agreements under the Government's energy efficiency best practice programme. Though voluntary agreements would not entitle participants to discounts from the levy, they would facilitate the sharing of best practice, benchmarking, and other information between companies. They would also help them cut out waste, save money and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

<a name="91108w04.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In July, we consulted on a proposal to issue successful car driving test candidates with a provisional, rather than a full moped licence, as part of a package of measures to improve rider safety. This would mean that newly qualified drivers wanting to ride a moped would be required to take a basic training course like other persons who wish to ride powered two-wheelers. These drivers are generally young, and they have high accident rates. Our reason for proposing this change is that the skills for riding safely a powered two-wheeler are different from those for driving a car and that these riders would be safer on the road after basic training. The proposed change would not affect anyone who already held a full moped licence. We are currently considering the responses that we have received and, when we have taken decisions, they will be announced.

 The Lake District National Park Authority resolved to grant planning permission for a proposed extension to Bursting Stone Quarry but referred the matter to Secretary of State because, in its view, the proposal constituted a departure from the development plan. After carefully considering all the documents and representations before him, the Secretary of State informed the Authority on 7 May that he had decided to call in the application for his own decision as, in his view, it raises planning issues of wider than local importance which he considers he ought to decide himself. The Secretary of State's legal duty of impartiality prevents him for having any discussions with any party concerning it.

<P>
<a name="91108w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Straight line depreciation is the principal method which NI Departments and the Northern Ireland Office intend to apply to fixed assets in the current financial year in the preparation of departmental resource accounting balance sheets. In addition the Department of the Environment (NI) also intend to apply the following methods--renewals accounting, reducing balance and accelerated depreciation. As part of the dry run audit, depreciation policies will be subject to review by the Northern Ireland Audit Office.
<P>

<a name="91108w05.htm_para2">Use of these methods of depreciation is in accordance with the Department of Finance and Personnel's Northern Ireland Resource Accounting Manual, which follows private sector accounting practice as far as is appropriate. The requirements in the Manual, regarding depreciation policy, are underpinned by Financial Reporting Standard 15 "Tangible Fixed Assets" issued by the Accounting Standards Board.

The implication for UK forces is that 900 personnel will now return to the UK, without replacement, before Christmas.

Some refugees have returned as peace is being restored. British Army Gurkhas have played an important role from the start of INTERFET operations in East Timor, and most recently in the Ambeno enclave.

 Coalition patrols of the no fly zones remain an essential humanitarian task in support of UN Security Council Resolution 688 as they prevent Saddam Hussein from using his airforce against the Iraqi people in the north and south. Since the end of Operation Desert Fox last December, Saddam has waged a systematic campaign against coalition aircraft carrying out these patrols. Some 215 Iraqi aircraft have violated the No Fly Zones, and there have been over 500 other direct threats against our aircrew, including missile attacks and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Coalition responses are limited strictly to proportionate action in self-defence against Iraqi weapons and facilities which pose a direct threat to our forces.

 Soldiers enlisting into the Regular Army since 1991 have done so on the Open Engagement (up to 22 years), which commits them to a minimum of three years service (four years for those enlisting after 2 November 1999). Continuation of service beyond that point is subject to the wishes of the individual and the needs of the Army. There is no requirement for soldiers to specify the length of any further commitment, but they are normally required to give 12 months notice of their wish to leave.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much his Department has paid in employment protection to employers of members of <i>(a)</i> the Territorial Army, <i>(b)</i> the Royal Navy Reserve, <i>(c)</i> the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and <i>(d)</i> sponsored reservists mobilised in each year for which figures are available since 1989-90; and if he will make a statement.  [97663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No payments are made to employers of members of the reserve forces for the purposes of employment protection. Under the terms of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and the Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/309), employers may claim financial assistance for the loss of a member of staff who is mobilised for reserve service, and to cover any necessary retraining for that staff member on return. No financial assistance was provided to employers before 1 April 1997.
<P>

<a name="91108w09.htm_para0">No awards of financial assistance have been made to employers of Royal Naval Reserve personnel as a result of called-out service since 1 April 1997.
<P>

<a name="91108w09.htm_para1">It has not been possible to distinguish payments made to employers of TA personnel from those made to the employers of ex-Regular Army reserves. However, since 1 April 1997, the following totals have been paid to the employers of Army reservists:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on Major-General Spacie's report, "Welfare in the Army"; and when he intends to make the report public.  [97660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of the development of an overarching Human Resources Strategy, the Army's approach to welfare has been subjected to a fundamental and comprehensive review. In 1998, Major-General (Retired) Spacie was commissioned to undertake a study into welfare provision across the Army. This work was completed in September 1999 and is currently being assessed. The study was commissioned to inform the Army's personnel management policies and there are currently no plans to publish the findings externally.

[97575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Three Hawk aircraft were exported from the UK on 31 August, before the adoption of the Common Position. Once the aircraft left UK shores, we had no power to prevent delivery of these aircraft. No further Hawks have been exported from the UK while the embargo has been in place since 16 September.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office have worked closely together throughout the negotiations on the establishment of the International Criminal Court.

 The Sharm el-Sheikh agreement has created a real prospect of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The parties are committed to making a determined effort to conclude a Framework Agreement on Permanent Status issues by February, and to reaching a Permanent Status Agreement by September. We are confident that the permanent status negotiations, which have been formally resumed, will deliver substantive results.
<P>

<a name="91108w09.htm_para4">Implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh commitments is proceeding, albeit with some short delays. A southern safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank was opened during my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's recent visit.
<P>

<a name="91108w09.htm_para5">We do not underestimate the difficulties faced by both sides. Real vision will be needed to deliver a peace settlement which offers lasting security for Israel, and a real prospect of hope and prosperity for Palestinians.

<P>
<a name="91108w09.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The White Paper on Overseas Territories, published in March this year, sets out the Government's offer of British citizenship to those citizens of the Overseas Territories, including those of St. Helena, who do not already enjoy it and who meet certain conditions. This will require primary legislation. The issues are complex and the Government are working on the preparation of the necessary legislation.

<P>
<a name="91108w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Department for International Development (DfID) arranged for a visit to Kosovo for Her Majesty's Prison Service experts in August to consider what assistance we could provide for prison administration. DfID is providing $1 million in repair assistance and has made available the DfID Emergency Engineering Unit to the United Nations and to the NATO-led international force in Kosovo (KFOR) to help repair prison facilities before winter sets in.
<P>

<a name="91108w09.htm_para8">Two British prisons experts also went to Kosovo at the start of October for a two month visit to provide technical advice to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on the transfer of responsibility for prisons from KFOR to UNMIK, and the re-opening of prison facilities. DfID are also funding the secondment of four prison technical monitors to supervise local staff until February 2000.

<a name="91108w11.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 19 October 1999, c.436]:</i> One of the four Key Aims of the Government's drugs strategy is to protect communities from drug related crime. National initiatives introduced since 1997 include the piloting of the new Drug Treatment and Testing Order, for which around &#163;60 million has been earmarked for national roll-out from next year; the Prison Service has been given &#163;76 million over the next three years for tackling drug misuse in prisons, of which in the region of &#163;60 million has been allocated to drug treatment programmes, and up to &#163;20 million over the next three years is being made available to assist in the development of arrest referral schemes to get drug misusing offenders into treatment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will issue guidance to police forces about sharing information with local housing authorities about persons with previous convictions for burglary who are applying for local authority housing so that those authorities can consider whether to make an offer of accommodation; and if he will make a statement. [97036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w11.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under Part VI of the Housing Act 1996, local housing authorities are required to have an allocation scheme which sets out their procedures and priorities for allocating social housing. There are a number of classes of household or person who must be given "reasonable preference" under an allocation scheme. This framework is designed to ensure that priority for subsidised housing is given to those with the greatest need.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para0">Authorities have the power to define which classes of people are eligible for local authority housing. When deciding which classes of people should be non-qualifying, they are entitled to decide on the basis of objective criteria and evidence, whether granting a tenancy to a person is likely to result in disruption to the stability of the community.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para1">The Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions' "Code of Guidance for Local Authorities on the Allocation of Accommodation and Homelessness", which will be published shortly, will recommend that any decision to exclude classes of persons on the grounds of the need to protect the community or reduce levels of crime on an estate should be taken in consultation with relevant organisations in the criminal justice system, in particular the police and probation services.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para2">We shall consider the need for further guidance on the disclosure of information by the police if necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w11.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to amend the draft Freedom of Information Bill to accommodate commitments on environmental information disclosure contained in EU directives and the Aarhus Convention on Access to Environmental Information.  [97364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w11.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The consultation paper on the draft Freedom of Information Bill (published 24 May 1999) set out the Government's intention to modify as necessary the general right of access in the Freedom of Information Bill in order to implement the Aarhus Convention (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters) insofar as it relates to access to environmental information.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para3">The Bill will now contain a provision giving power to the Secretary of State to make regulations to give effect to the Aarhus Convention as it relates to access to environmental information. Ministers have agreed to this 



<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 1999 : Column: 420</I><P>
change of approach. This will allow for the creation of a free-standing regime for environmental information which will give effect to the Aarhus Convention and the existing European Community Directive on Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment. The current regulations will be revoked.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para4">Access to environmental information will, therefore, be given in the first instance under the regulations rather than the Bill itself. Freedom of Information legislation will continue to have an effect, however, by placing a duty on authorities to consider any discretion they may have to disclose information in the public interest where it is otherwise exempt under the regulations.

[97545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w11.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 As at the end of October, a total of 74,597 claims under the firearms compensation and ex gratia payment schemes had been paid. There are currently 966 claims outstanding, of which 800 are ones where payment offers have been made to the claimants in question and are awaiting acceptance. A total of &#163;88.96 million has been paid out and the final figure is expected to be approximately &#163;90 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what use has been made of restorative justice in response to motoring offences involving injury or loss to third parties.  [96636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w11.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Where it judges it appropriate and proportional, a court can make a probation order for a motoring offence. Probation service motoring programmes typically include sessions on raising offenders' awareness of the impact on victims. Such programmes often include police or hospital staff presenting information about the impact and injuries resulting from motoring offences and the consequences for victims.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para5">The Crime Reduction Programme announced last year, contains a restorative justice component. It is evaluating a number of existing restorative justice schemes in order to identify which elements or combination of elements are most effective in reducing crime and at what cost. Some of the schemes will include offenders who have committed motoring offences.

<P>

<P>
<P><I>8 Nov 1999 : Column: 421</I><P>
means that no company may manufacture such weapons without the written authority of the Secretary of State. In order to obtain such an authority, an applicant must show that there is a compelling reason for possessing prohibited weapons, that the applicant is fit to be entrusted with prohibited weapons and that they will be stored under conditions of security commensurate with the danger to the public posed by such weapons.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para6">Authorities are carefully conditioned to restrict to the minimum genuinely needed, the numbers and types of prohibited weapons the authority holder is allowed to possess. They are also specifically conditioned to restrict the purposes for which the holder may possess prohibited weapons and how the weapons may be disposed of.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para7">It is an offence punishable by up to six months' imprisonment, a fine of up to &#163;5,000 or both for a person to breach any of the conditions of an authority. Unauthorised possession of prohibited weapons is punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment, a fine or both. Where it is believed that an offence may have been committed, the information would be passed to the police for investigation. Any decision on whether or not to prosecute in an individual case is a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="91108w11.htm_para8">Export sales of such weapons are subject to the export licensing regime. Applications for export licences for prohibited weapons are considered carefully by the Department of Trade and Industry in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.

 Sections 34-40 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 provide protection for witnesses from cross-examination by the accused in person.

 Lay visiting is the responsibility of individual police authorities and each scheme must evolve to suit local circumstances. The West Midlands Police Authority began introducing an upper age limit of 70 for lay visitors from October 1998.
<P>

<a name="91108w12.htm_para0">Current Home Office guidance to police authorities on lay visiting makes no reference to age limits. However, the separate guidance issued for the Metropolitan Police area states that persons who are under the age of 18 or over the age of 70 will not normally be appointed. All this Home Office guidance, which is advisory, is shortly to be reviewed and the arguments for and against age limits will be considered as part of that process.

 In the first three years of this Parliament, pensioners will have received an extra &#163;1.6 billion through the new Winter Fuel Payments and the introduction of the Minimum Income Guarantee. This is more than twice the amount that pensioners would have received from uprating the basic state pension in line with earnings rather than prices.
<P>

<a name="91108w12.htm_para1">As well as being worth more than uprating, our policies for pensioners strike a better balance between benefiting all pensioners and getting more help to those in greatest need. The &#163;100 Winter Fuel Payment goes to every pensioner household, regardless of their income. The Minimum Guarantee means even more help for pensioners on low incomes.

To ask the Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to combine the responsibilities of the Home Office and Department of Health with those of other departments in order <i>(a)</i> to institute infant death response teams of trained police and specialist nurses to visit and support families within 24 hours, <i>(b)</i> to provide for inquests held by specialist pathologists and <i>(c)</i> to institute case conferences to consider and agree the cause of death.  [97715]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w13.htm_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The tragedy of death in infancy calls upon the expertise of a number of agencies with shared responsibility for supporting parents who have suffered bereavement. It is already accepted good practice for bereaved families to be visited by a police officer attached to the Coroner's Office and a nurse experienced in bereavement counselling. The benefit of a specialist pathology service for inquests into infant deaths has been recognised and I understand that closer working relationships between paediatric and forensic pathologists are being developed to this end. It is the duty of the Coroner to consider and identify the cause of death.

 The information showing the number of young people who had gained a job from New Deal and returned to claim the Jobseekers Allowance or returned to a New Deal Option within 13 weeks, by Unit of Delivery, is given in the following table. The figures include both subsidised and unsubsidised jobs. Also shown are the numbers gaining jobs that were sustained, lasting for 13 weeks or more. Job turnover is normal in a healthy labour market, especially among young people who need to try different jobs and accumulate experience to establish themselves successfully in the labour market. It is vital that those young people returning to unemployment after a short spell in work are given the support and encouragement they need to build on that experience and use it to find another job quickly. It is this kind of sustained help that sets New Deal above previous labour market policies.

began on 21 July 1997, is 457,052. Letters inviting participation in the New Deal for Lone Parents programme are sent to lone parents who are in receipt of Income Support and whose youngest child is aged at least 5 years and 3 months. Some 80,130 lone parents have attended an initial interview (including those outside the target group and early starters who did not receive an invite) and some 89 per cent. of these agreed to join the caseload and 26 per cent. of these have found jobs.

<P>
<a name="91108w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 None. The Educational Maintenance Allowance (EMA) Pilots have been funded entirely from new money provided for this purpose. The transfer from local education authority discretionary awards is being used to contribute to the costs of the access funds and specific help for residential students and for childcare. These new arrangements will mean more spending on students than would have been the case had the discretionary awards scheme continued.

There is a significant demand for "Voices" from a wide range of sources, so a re-print of 10,000 copies has been ordered to meet these requests. This will cost a further &#163;17,439. Copies of "Voices" will be distributed to all public libraries shortly. Copies have been sent to the UN, the European Commission and overseas contacts.

<P>
<a name="91108w15.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what progress has been made in developing a unique student identification number. [97488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w15.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, chaired by Lord Dearing, recommended in July 1997 that works be undertaken over the medium term on the creation of a framework for data about lifelong learning, using a "unique student record number".
<P>

<a name="91108w15.htm_para8">Since then a number of important developments have taken place--notably the introduction this term of a national system of "unique pupil numbers" to facilitate the statistical tracking of pupils through the school system. The potential for extending the use of the unique pupil number (or some alternative) beyond school needs to be reviewed, not only in relation to the Dearing recommendation, but also in the light of developments in post 16 education and training policy as a whole.
<P>

<a name="91108w15.htm_para9">The contribution of a unique student record number to the creation of a framework of data on lifelong learning (the real aim of the Dearing recommendation rather than the unique student record number in itself) would however take a great many years to materialise, because the number could be used only to reference learning episodes occurring from that point on. As an interim measure, we are therefore carrying out a technical evaluation of the possibility of accumulating data on individuals' learning experience by means of so-called "fuzzy matching" based on (for example) names and dates of birth. This approach too has its limits, given the increasing incidence of name changes with age. The aim in the first instance is to cover learning up to age 21, with a view subsequently to extending that up to age 25.

[97486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Careers services are required by contract to ensure that all young people get the careers information and guidance at whatever level they study. They must do this in close partnership with schools and colleges in order to provide the right help at the right time for each individual student. The Secretary of State has asked careers services to focus their resources on those most at risk of dropping out or under-achieving, to ensure that they remain in learning after they have left school.

<a name="91108w18.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 21 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>548</i>, what assessment he has made of the implications of contamination of polio vaccine in the United Kingdom with simian virus 40 between 1955 and 1963, for the development of cancers in humans.  [93663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w18.htm_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 SV40 (simian vacuolating virus 40) is a virus found in some species of monkeys. The polio virus in inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) used in the 1950s and early 1960s was grown on monkey kidneys, some of which have been shown to be potentially contaminated with SV40 virus. Concern about the possible impact of SV40 on the human population was raised in the early 1960s and precautions to prevent contamination were introduced internationally in 1962, shortly after the virus was identified. SV40 has been shown to be oncogenic in certain animals and has been found in several human tumours. It is not known whether SV40 causes the human tumours or whether it is just coincidentally present in the tumours. However, research studies in people who received potentially SV40 contaminated IPV have found no increase in cancers when compared with people who did not receive potentially contaminated IPV.
<P>

<a name="91108w18.htm_para4">The National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) has tested stored polio vaccine using the most sensitive available modern molecular biological techniques to check whether the precautions introduced in the 1960s were effective. All the polio vaccines used since 1980 have been shown to be free of SV40 and all vaccines used since 1962 for which samples could be located are also free. Samples of IPV from the 1950s to the 1960s were not available. Serological studies have been conducted with the Public Health Laboratory Service which showed no evidence of increased antibody to SV40 in people receiving polio vaccine. In all ages of the people tested, about 5 per cent. had SV40 virus antibodies, suggesting that the virus may have been present in humans for a very long time and hence these antibodies are unlikely to have come from SV40 contaminated polio vaccine.
<P>

<a name="91108w18.htm_para5">This issue has been considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the Government's independent expert advisory committee, which has expressed reassurance as a result of the NIBSC work. NIBSC's study has been published (Biologicals (1999), vol. 27, pps 1-10) copies of which are available in the Library.

 The National Cancer Forum (NCF) was established to support the implementation of the Calman/Hine cancer blueprint and to advise on specialised issues related to cancer. The Forum has met three times on 19 February 1998, 16 September 1998 and on 25 October 1999 at which I discussed the Government's priorities for cancer. The NCF has identified the need to secure quality and consistency in cancer services through ongoing implementation of Calman/Hine, the development of national standards and performance indicators and the publication of evidence-based guidance as key priorities. Members of the NCF have been working with the Department to take specific pieces of work forward. A number of NCF members were present at the Downing Street cancer summit held in May 1999 where these priorities were ratified and a work programme and action plan agreed. In view of the new agenda set for cancer it will be necessary to reconstitute the NCF to address a revised work programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w19.htm_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 There is no evidence at present that the increase in bovine tuberculosis in cattle has led to an increase in bovine tuberculosis in the local human population.
<P>

<a name="91108w19.htm_para1">The number of isolates of <i>M.bovis</i> from human cases of bovine tuberculosis in England and Wales has varied from 22 to 37 per year between 1993 and 1998 with no trend to increase or decrease. The numbers of cases arising in those regions of England and Wales with the greatest increase in bovine tuberculosis in cattle (South West, Wales and West Midlands) have remained low and have also varied from year to year with no increasing or decreasing trend.
<P>

<a name="91108w19.htm_para2">If the risk of tuberculosis due to <i>M.bovis</i> infection was increasing in the population generally as a result of bovine tuberculosis in cattle, an increase in tuberculosis notifications in young children (the group least likely to have other explanations for tuberculous infection) might be expected in the part of the country most affected by bovine tuberculosis. The number of cases of tuberculosis notified in children (less than 15 years of age) in the South West Region has remained low between 1993 and 1998.
<P>

<a name="91108w19.htm_para3">At the request of the Department of Health, the Public Health Laboratory Service has looked at existing data to investigate whether there is a correlation between cattle-associated occupations and bovine tuberculosis.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> Meningococcal A + C vaccine was recommended for higher education students starting their first year at university or college. It was recommended that first year students receive the vaccine either before the start of term or when they begin at university/college. Around 550,000 doses of meningococcal A & C vaccine were issued from the end of August, throughout September and into October. This quantity is well in excess of the target population.
<P>

<a name="91108w19.htm_para4">The Department wrote direct to all universities and colleges asking them to ensure that arrangements were in place for the vaccine to be offered to all first year students who had not been immunised. The Department also contacted direct those health centres and general practitioner practices which serve universities and colleges to see how best the vaccine could be delivered to them. The Health Education Authority sent packs of information, including special leaflets, to all universities and colleges so that they could target those first year students who had not been immunised.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 1999]:</i> It is estimated that over 6 per cent. of total Government expenditure on the National Health Service is spent on cancer services. Since 1997, we have provided an additional &#163;70 million into improving breast, colorectal, lung and outpatient cancer services. We will build on this record of achievement. An extra &#163;80 million from the NHS modernisation fund will be invested in cancer services over the next two years. This will support the implementation of the two week outpatient wait for all urgent cancer referrals and work to further improve consistency and equity of access to cancer services through investment in workforce and equipment.
<P>

<a name="91108w20.htm_para4">&#163;93 million is being spent on cancer equipment from the New Opportunities Fund from the National Lottery and a further &#163;23 million is also being set aside from the New Opportunities Fund for palliative care and prevention initiatives.

 The Pet Travel Scheme pilot is essentially the scheme recommended by Professor Kennedy, except that cats and dogs originating in rabies-free islands (other than assistance dogs from Australasia) will only be allowed to enter the UK once the full scheme is in operation.
<P>

<a name="91108w21.htm_para7">The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens considered Professor Kennedy's recommendations on exotic diseases other than rabies. The Committee agreed that treatment should be given to all imported pet cats and dogs for a tapeworm (<i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i>) and ticks. The ACDP advised that treatment be given not less than 24 hours and not more than 48 hours before embarkation to the UK. Professor Kennedy recommended that treatment be given no more than 24 hours before embarkation. This would represent a modification of Professor Kennedy's Recommendations 1, 2, 35 and 36.

Assistance dogs from Australia and New Zealand that meet the Scheme conditions will also be eligible.
<P>

<a name="91108w21.htm_para13">Not all countries in western Europe are considered rabies free, but Professor Kennedy found that provided dogs and cats were microchipped, vaccinated and blood tested, the risk of importing rabies in animals from these countries was comparable to that under the existing policy of quarantine.
<P>

<a name="91108w21.htm_para14">The Office International des Epizooties (OIE), the international veterinary organisation sets down criteria for countries to be regarded as rabies free, but it does not publish a list of those countries.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 1999]:</i> The major overseas suppliers of pigmeat and pigmeat products to the UK market are Denmark, the Netherlands, the Irish Republic, Germany and France. While we have no legal authority to impose British standards of welfare and traceability on those suppliers, my right hon. Friend the Minister will be meeting a number of retail groups to assess progress in their commitment given to him that all their own label fresh pork and certain processed products such as bacon would come from stall and tether and MBM free production systems.
<P>

<a name="91108w22.htm_para2">Also, as part of the strategy to assist the pig production sector, a verification officer has been appointed. His remit is to work with industry bodies to identify cases where product is being sold at retail or catering level which misleads the consumer into believing it contains pork of British origin when in fact it is imported.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will estimate the total value of food products, imported into the United Kingdom in 1998 from countries outside the EU, which were produced to hygiene standards less stringent that those required of British farmers.  [96265]<P>
<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what initiatives are being pursued by his Department to ensure that all EU member states implement the Community legislation on meat inspection to the same level.  [96261]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w22.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 It is for the European Commission to ensure that member states fully implement European legislation, including meat inspection legislation. However, where we receive evidence that other member states are failing to comply with Community obligations, we will of course pass such evidence on to the Commission for investigation. In this connection, we have passed copies of our own survey of meat inspection charges in other member states, and of the recently published Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) report on meat inspection charges and other enforcement costs to the Commission. In so doing, we have urged the Commission to carry out a thorough investigation of the way in which the EU Charges Directive has been implemented in other member states and of the level of inspection charges in each country. We are, in particular, pressing the Commission to investigate the allegations of subsidy in Italy and non-collection of charges in Spain outlined in the MLC report.

<P>
<a name="91108w22.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We have been pressing the European Commission to bring forward proposals to change EC food labelling legislation to make the labelling of nuts and nut products, and other substances recognised as causing hypersensitivity, compulsory in all cases when their presence is intentional. We will continue to press for action, and hope to see positive developments on this towards the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="91108w22.htm_para3">In the meantime, we will continue to encourage the voluntary provision of such information on food labels where this is appropriate.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how much Government funding was given to Shropshire farmers in the last 12 months for which figures are available.  [96476]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w22.htm_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Under the Common Agricultural Policy, a total of just over &#163;43 million was paid to Shropshire farmers in 1997. This included both EU and nationally funded contributions. However, they will also have received a share of funding under market support measures, which benefit farming generally but which cannot be calculated at a county level.

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 1999]:</i> A Reuters article, reported by several newspapers, alleging contamination of French animal feed with waste was seen by officials in my Department on 10 June 1999. Subsequent contact between the UK and the Commission was pursued by officials in the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group, the Department of Health and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. MAFF officials also contacted their French counterparts and received assurances on 15 June that these were isolated incidents and remedial action had been taken.
<P>

<a name="91108w22.htm_para4">Following new media reports on 16 August, the Commission then raised the issue with the French Government and initiated an investigation. At the same time, Ministers were advised by the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group that there was no immediate risk to health and no special action necessary.

 Pricing decisions in respect of produce at retail level are matters for the commercial judgment of the retailers involved. The Competition Commission are

<P><I>8 Nov 1999 : Column: 462</I><P>
currently investigating competition in the grocery retailing sector which will include relationships with suppliers including farmers. However, some of the actions arising from the work of the Food Chain Group should help to increase understanding throughout the food chain of the competitive pressures faced by individual sectors and how decisions and actions by one part of the chain may impact upon another.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91108w23.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee has identified criteria against which the controls on beef over-30-months of age can be reviewed in the future, and began to address these at its meeting on 18 March 1999. The Committee recognised that the issue would require careful study and would almost certainly need to be considered over several meetings.
<P>

<a name="91108w23.htm_para0">At its meeting on 20 September the Committee noted that it was expected that updated epidemiological analyses of the BSE epidemic would be available for its meeting on 29 November. The Committee agreed to postpone further consideration of the over-30-month rule until that meeting so that it could take these analyses into account.
<P>

<a name="91108w23.htm_para1">In the light of the Committee's conclusions, and after consultation with all interested parties, the Government will consider what changes to the over-30-month rule, if any, could be made, consistent with the continued protection of public health. Any changes to the rule will need to be agreed with the European Commission and member states as it forms part of the Florence Agreement on the lifting of the beef export ban.

 The National Assembly would not have to provide public expenditure cover for Lottery match funding. Lottery moneys are not Exchequer funding. Lottery funding counts as public expenditure within the Total Managed Expenditure of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
