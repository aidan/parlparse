<i> [holding answer 24 June 2010]:</i> The two franchise extensions will have a theoretical opportunity cost caused by foregoing the higher premium/lower subsidy expected if the franchises were re-competed instead of extended. This is difficult to quantify, because assumptions need to be made about the likely prices from new bidders versus the cost of extending with incumbents. The opportunity cost arising from the delay to replacing franchises was estimated to be Â£6 million for Essex Tameside and Â£18 million for Greater Anglia. However, we believe that including the two franchises in the reformed system, on which we will be consulting shortly, will yield benefits for passengers and facilitate investment in the railways which will outweigh these costs.</p>

The current issue relating to the import of food of non-animal origin is the application of official controls to certain high risk products from certain third countries, for the purpose of public health protection. The list of countries and products requiring control is reviewed by the Commission quarterly. Where any food of non-animal origin, presents a major public health issue, then the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) is used by member states. For other imported products not of animal origin, where routine official controls detect any problems, these will be reported to the Commission. Food exported from the United Kingdom should meet the requirements of European food law.</p>

In countries where abortion is legal, DFID will support programmes that make abortion safe and accessible. In countries where it is illegal and women are dying due to unsafe abortion, DFID will help make the consequences of unsafe abortion more widely understood and will consider supporting processes of legal and policy reform.</p>

 Tackling the UK's record deficit is the Government's top priority and we believe that it is right that local authorities make a contribution to the efficiency savings of Â£6.2 billion in 2010-11. We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount individual authorities lose. The impact on their area of the reductions in grants this year will be for local authorities to decide. We have ensured that councils are able to deliver essential frontline services by making no changes to the Â£29 billion they receive through Formula Grant and by increasing flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on how they spend their money.</p>

 In my answer of 16 June I noted that one of the main difficulties in taking forward the environmental negotiations in the Doha Round has been agreeing a definition. In general, environmental goods and services include those which contribute to the achievement of national and international environmental priorities including the mitigation of climate change, and the implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements. More specifically, the European Union, together with partners, has produced a list of goods to fulfil the Doha Declaration objective on environmental goods-JOB(09)/132.

 The benefits of international trade to gross domestic product (GDP) result from greater economic efficiency due to a combination of increased competition in markets, relative comparative advantages, economies of scale, increased opportunities for learning, and greater incentives for innovation.
