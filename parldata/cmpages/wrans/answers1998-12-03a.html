<a name="81203w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps the Welsh Office is taking to increase access to justice for people living in rural areas in Wales.  [61473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department is proposing to create a Community Legal Service, which will improve access to good quality legal and advice services for those with the greatest need. This will be achieved by greater local planning of legal and advice services and co-ordination of funding through Community Legal Service Partnerships between local authorities, the Legal Aid Board and other significant funders. This will be particularly important to rural communities, as the inconsistent geographic coverage of legal and advice services impacts disproportionately in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="81203w01.html_para0">The Lord Chancellor's Department also wishes to see the facilities at some magistrates' courts improved where these may be substandard, but--as section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 sets out--decisions about the location and number of courthouses and offices are the responsibility of the relevant magistrates' courts committees in consultation with their paying authorities. The Lord Chancellor's Department will become involved only when a paying authority appeals against an MCC's determination.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will take steps to halt the closure of <i>(a)</i> magistrates' and <i>(b)</i> county council courts in the rural areas of Wales.  [61474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Magistrates' courts are locally managed by magistrates' courts committees under the provisions of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. Decisions concerning the location and number of magistrates' courts in their area are for the relevant magistrates' courts committee to determine. A local authority that contributes financially may appeal to the Lord Chancellor against a proposed closure. The procedure for such appeals is set out in section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. In the absence of an appeal, however, the Lord Chancellor plays no part in the process.
<P>

<a name="81203w01.html_para1">The Court Service is responsible for all civil and the higher criminal courts and is required constantly to monitor and review the viability of its court network. Factors taken into consideration include the role played by the court in providing a service to the public in that area, and the effect and implications of providing an alternative for its current users. The criteria for considering the case for and against closure as set out in the Departmental Accommodation Plan are: the condition of the existing accommodation; the availability of facilities; the frequency of judicial visits and waiting 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 232</I><P>
times; the facilities provided by the alternative court; and the capacity of that court to cater for the additional work; and distances and public transport considerations. In general, the Court service must look to improve services to an area overall.

 A very large number of research papers are produced by the staff of Ministry of Defence research establishments and most such papers are in the public domain and not classified. Publication of research papers is the individual responsibility of the research establishments and sectors within them. Details of series of research papers are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 Responsibility for policing or prosecuting offences under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 lies with the relevant police force and the Crown Prosecution Service. My Department is happy to assist the police in any matters relating to the 1973 Act, whenever necessary. Steps are being taken to remind relevant police forces of their responsibilities under the 1973 Act, and of the designated wreck sites within their area of responsibility.

 The planning application for the National Stadium is a matter for the English National Stadium Development Company (ENSDC) in consultation with the London Borough of Brent, as planning authority. The present anticipated timetable for submitting a planning application is Spring/Summer 1999, although ENSDC are known to be reviewing the position. The English Sports Council (ESC) included milestone dates on planning issues as conditions of the Lottery award to ensure the project moves ahead on a reasonable timetable.
<P>

<a name="81203w02.html_para0">In the event of a breach of the conditions of the Lottery award, the ESC has the right to seek repayment. It is a condition of the Lottery award that the freehold interest cannot be sold. The site acquisition is still under discussion between the applicants and Wembley Plc. The site purchase arrangements are subject to strict Stock Exchange rules on disclosure. Following the acquisition, it is intended that the English National Stadium Trust will hold a 999 year lease for the stadium site. The principal lottery award conditions will apply for 50 years, even if the award is repaid, to ensure that the stadium meets its objectives throughout this period.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what restrictions are placed upon the Government's ability to act independently of other creditors to reduce debt owed by developing countries by (i) the European Union, 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 237</I><P>
(ii) the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and (iii) other international organisations or agreements.  [61491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The UK is not restricted in acting unilaterally to reduce debt owed by developing countries by either the EU, the OECD or any other international agreements.
<P>

<a name="81203w02.html_para2">However, lasting solutions to the problems of heavily indebted poor countries require a multilateral effort. Since the UK holds only a part of the total debt owed by these countries, it cannot by itself reduce their debts to sustainable levels. That is why the UK has been making such efforts in international forums to ensure that all creditors co-operate in giving poor countries a permanent solution to their debt burdens.

<a name="81203w02.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Reed: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w02.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The UK wrote off all of its loans to Honduras and Nicaragua long before Hurricane Mitch struck. Following the devastation caused to these countries last month, the Chancellor decided that Nicaragua and Honduras need make no debt service payments to ECGD over the next two years. The issue of a moratorium is to be discussed at the Paris Club of official bilateral creditors next week.
<P>

<a name="81203w02.html_para3">The Chancellor wrote to the International Financial Institutions--the IMF, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank--calling on them to look at possible mechanisms for lessening the debt service obligations of Honduras and Nicaragua, and has taken these proposals forward with his G7 and EU colleagues.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w02.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Reed: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will urge the IMF to sell gold reserves in order to pay for the immediate suspension of debt service payments to the international institutions by Nicaragua and Honduras.  [61494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The UK Government support, and have been pressing for, the sale of a proportion of the IMF gold reserves to provide financing for the HIPC initiative. The UK will continue to press for gold sales in the IMF Executive Board. Gold sales require the approval of the Executive Board by a majority of 85 per cent., and we are therefore working closely with other members at the IMF to secure Board approval.

<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 239</I><P>
UN agencies, the Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank, Red Cross and NGOs, EC and other donors. Our findings and conclusions are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Situation Assessment</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Consolidated estimates of damage confirm that Honduras is, by far, the worst affected country. Some 20,000 are dead and missing, 285,000 displaced and overall about 1.4 million (out of a total population of 6.1 million) affected. The physical devastation is widespread, affecting 14 out of 18 administrative departments: 60 per cent. of roads and bridges, 50 per cent. of agricultural production (including a fifth of the economically important coffee and nearly all the banana export crops), 80 per cent. of water distribution networks, 70 per cent. of hospitals, 12 per cent. of health centres, and 25 per cent. of schools are destroyed or severely damaged. The effects of the disaster, still starkly visible a month later, are reflected most obviously in disrupted access and basic utilities. Groups of destitute families are living under ramshackle and insanitary conditions wherever they can find shelter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In Nicaragua damage to infrastructure has been more moderate though still significant in five departments (Pacific coast and the north). Overall, some 3,000 are dead and missing, and 370,000 (out of a total population of 4.5 million) severely affected. But, in contrast to Honduras, the physical effects and human impact are less evident a month later.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The mission did not visit El Salvador (population 5.8 million, 475 killed/missing, 84,000 affected) and Guatemala (population 10.9 million, 400 killed/missing, 105,000 affected) but reports suggest substantially less damage. In both countries, agricultural losses appear to be more significant than infrastructure damage (except in particular pockets).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Assessment of disaster response</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In both Honduras and Nicaragua, a striking feature has been the self-help efforts of the communities themselves, reflecting the strong regional tradition of community solidarity. Most lives were saved and vulnerable people helped by indigenous efforts as the physical disruption of the hurricane and floods meant that it took time for outside help to arrive. The strength of local government was a key factor in enabling good local mobilisation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The most effective external life-saving interventions appear to have been carried out by the military (both national and foreign forces). However, there are lessons to be drawn in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of tasking and military/civil co-operation. The Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua also responded effectively.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Co-ordination in both countries presents a mixed picture. However it is important to recognise the practical constraints (especially in Honduras) and the burden placed by outside organisations rushing in. The UN-coordinated needs assessment process was crucial and reached credible conclusions. The UN Diaster Assessment and Co-ordination (UNDAC) mechanism of OCHA was also useful and appropriately deployed in support of the in-country UN Resident Co-ordinator. Inter-agency co-operation within the UN system appears to have been satisfactory. But overall, the UN could have been more assertive in terms of providing guidance and "gate-keeping", and donors more conscientious--and less competitive--in deferring to UN co-ordination.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The EC through ECHO, has disbursed funds for immediate relief through NGOs working in the region, and is planning an extensive reconstruction package. In the Development Council on 30 November, I emphasised the importance of co-ordinating this with the wider international assistance effort. We intend to work closely with the EC to ensure that its assistance is disbursed as effectively as possible.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>International NGOs have also made useful contributions. The best work is being done by agencies already established on the ground. They are able to mobilise existing systems and structures and draw on the local knowledge and trust they have built up. This contrasts with the many diaster relief organisations that have flocked to the region and have had difficulty in finding a 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 240</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meaningful niche while possibly creating additional problems for their hosts (for example overburdening internal transport systems).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Impact of DFID humanitarian assistance</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Britain was among the fastest in delivery relief on the ground. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, a total of about &#163;1 million was granted by DFID to NGOs (CAFOD, CARE, Christian Aid, Del Campo farmers co-operative, Food for the Hungry, IRC, Tear Fund), the International Federation of Red Cross, the Pan American Health Organisations, and the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA). The geographical distribution of funding to date is about &#163;370,000 for Honduras, &#163;390,000 for Nicaragua, &#163;15,000 for El Salvador, and &#163;200,000 for regional use to benefit all four countries. Most of our grants have been disbursed very rapidly and transformed into urgently needed benefits for an estimated 0.5 million people. These include provision of emergency shelter, clothing, blankets and household goods, water supplies, health care, seeds and other agricultural inputs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Forward strategy</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Immediate disaster relief needs have been largely met except perhaps for the most isolated communities. Planning for the longer-term needs of reconstruction is progressing but it will be at least six months before we see real progress. Meanwhile, there is a transition period in which continued humanitarian assistance is necessary. Survivors--especially those who are displaced--remain vulnerable to disease in the absence of safe water and disruption of health services. Food security can be promoted if inputs are made in time for the current planting season. If primary schooling is not restored, vulnerable children may drop out permanently from education. The solution to meeting these urgent needs is, as has been demonstrated already, by supporting successful community efforts, in close conjunction with socially responsive local municipal authorities, in a way that kick starts local economies. But one very serious constraint--especially in Honduras--is the continued lack of access to poor communities because of disrupted roads. Without tackling this very little else is possible, and vulnerability will increase as people's reserves run out.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The UN is about to launch a "Transitional Appeal" for the period December 1998 to May 1999. This should provide a good framework of priorities. Our own further transitional humanitarian assistance, over the next six months, will enable people--especially the poor who have been left completely destitute by the disaster--to survive and cope, while seeking to establish the basis for sustainable recovery.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the light of this, I have decided that, during this transitional period, we will provide further humanitarian assistance of &#163;3 million allocated according to the relative needs of the affected countries. This will include:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In Honduras, a programme of emergency repairs and rehabilitation to secondary (rural) roads, including essential small bridges; and also a public works programme ("cash for work") targeting particularly neglected municipalities. This would benefit poor families by creating short-term local employment while also generating much needed social benefits through the rehabilitation of essential community infrastructure, and injecting cash into local economies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In Nicaragua support for UNICEF's emergency programmes to repair water and sanitation infrastructure and to restore primary health and education services for diaster affected communities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On a regional basis, support for a WHO/PAHO programme within the national health authorities of the four Central American countries, especially in the area of epidemiological surveillance and epidemic control.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Support for UNDP's function of inter-agency co-ordination through the Offices of the UN Resident/Humanitarian Co-ordinators in all affected countries.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 241</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Longer Term</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are also working on plans to respond to longer term needs. We have already committed &#163;6 million for Central America over the next two years. We are now re-focusing this to take account of reconstruction needs. We are also taking forward the proposals on debt relief which the Chancellor and I announced on 7 November.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Learning the lessons</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Given the magnitude of the disaster and the complexity of the international and national response efforts, there are many lessons to be learned to improve disaster preparedness in developing countries. We shall be pursuing these in the context of a UN-led lessons learnt exercise planned for February 1999.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if, where a child is admitted in the final term, as an agreed exception under the Regulations of the School Standards and Framework to a reception infant class that already has 30 pupils, it will be mandatory to

reduce the class size maximum to 30 in the following year; and what advice local education authorities will be given on compliance with the legislation.  [61824]<P>

<P>
<a name="81203w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 There are two general sets of circumstances in which a child will be treated as an excepted pupil and not count towards the infant class size limit of 30 pupils for every qualified teacher, to apply from the start of the 2001-2002 school year--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) where a child is admitted to the school in certain specified circumstances that could not have been anticipated in planning, for example where he moves into the area outside a normal admission round and cannot find a place at any other suitable school; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) where a child, who is normally educated in a special school or in a unit in a mainstream school for children with Special Educational Needs (SEN), attends a mainstream class.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81203w04.html_para5">The first set of exceptions applies only for the remainder of the school year in which the child was first admitted--even where the child was admitted during the final term of that year. The second set of exceptions enables those pupils to gain the benefit of attending mainstream classes and will be permitted beyond the school admission year--at any time when those pupils attend the infant classes at the mainstream school or outside the special unit. Thus it will only be mandatory to reduce the class size maximum to 30 in the following year if the exception is one within the first group.
<P>

<a name="81203w04.html_para6">On 9 September 1998, the Department for Education and Employment sent guidance (and copies of the relevant Regulations) on the class sizes legislation to all local education authorities in England.

 My Department has not commissioned any research into the effect of art and music lessons on children's ability in other subjects. This Government believe that art and music are essential parts of every child's education. That is why music and art remain National Curriculum foundation subjects which must be taught by all schools as part of a broad and balanced curriculum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when he expects to appoint adjudicators under section 25 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998; and if he will publish the job description for such adjudicators.  [62305]




<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 247</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We will announce the appointment of adjudicators in the New Year. The posts were advertised in the Summer. Those who expressed an interest were sent a copy of the job description and person specification, which is as follows.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>School organisation and admissions adjudicators</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The job</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The School Standards and Framework Bill, currently before Parliament, provides for decisions on changes to school organisation (opening, closing, enlarging and changing the character of schools) to be taken at local level by a School Organisation Committee, established by, but independent of the local authority. The Bill also provides for the Secretary of State to appoint adjudicators to consider cases where the School Organisation Committee is unable to reach a decision. The Bill also establishes new arrangements for agreeing school admissions arrangements at local level and provides for complaints about admissions arrangements to be referred to the adjudicator for resolution.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The adjudicator will consider and decide cases, usually on paper, taking account of the views both of those proposing change and those objecting to it. There will be guidance from the Secretary of State on issues that adjudicators will wish to take into consideration. In the case of admissions there will be a statutory Code of Practice. Adjudicators will be empowered to hold a local public inquiry into any case and will be required to do so if any proposals are made by the Secretary of State. Further background information is contained in the attached documents.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State proposes to appoint about 20 adjudicators initially, for two or three years. Adjudicators will be allocated cases on the basis of their availability--and where appropriate on the basis of geographical location. We expect that adjudicators will work from home. Adjudicators will be paid &#163;270 per day plus expenses for any day on which they are required to consider cases. The Secretary of State will provide other facilities as necessary and administrative support, which will be located in Darlington. It is difficult to assess loading at this stage, but an adjudicator might be called upon on between 60 and 120 days each year. There are likely to be seasonal pressures, particularly in considering admissions issues, around Easter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The first appointment will be of a lead adjudicator whose role would be to secure effective and efficient adjudication by:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) developing procedures and processes through some experience of adjudicating and through discussion with other adjudicators;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) seeking efficient use of resources through guidance on practical issues such as conduct of considerations and writing of decisions;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) seeking to support the consistent application of procedures through peer review--but not reviewing decisions once made. (The provision for appeal against adjudicators' decisions is judicial review);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) convening and chairing training conferences;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) undertaking appraisal of adjudicators, which would inform a decision on re-appointments or potentially on the allocation of cases;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(f) advising on recruitment and appointment;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(g) the publication of an annual report;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(h) providing one voice for the adjudication service with whom Ministers could discuss concerns.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But we do not envisage that the lead adjudicator will have a heavier adjudication load than any other adjudicator. The lead adjudicator will also be a part-time appointee, but will be paid &#163;300 a day, and would be guaranteed work for 125 days per year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Interviews for candidates for appointment as lead adjudicator will be held in September, with a view to the appointee taking up post as soon as possible thereafter. Other interviews for adjudicators will be held in the late Autumn.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Person Specification</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The role of an adjudicator will be a challenging one. It is essential that adjudicators have credibility with both the local and education communities, derived from their experience, independence and impartiality.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Adjudicators must be able to keep an objective perspective, weigh competing arguments, and be accepted for their ability to do so.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We envisage that successful applicants will have experience of education or education planning at a senior level, for example as a senior education officer; a headteacher or an HMI.</FONT></UL>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes in the arrangements for <i>(a)</i> deporting persons subject to deportation orders and 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 249</I><P>
<i>(b)</i> locating and removing illegal immigrants are planned to be made in the period from 1 December 1998 to 1 March 1999.  [62228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The period 1 December 1998 to 1 March 1999 will see the reorganisation of casework in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate from the present Directorates into a single Integrated Caseworking Directorate. Arrangements for the removal of illegal entrants and people against whom deportation orders have been made will continue unchanged during this period: and the Immigration Service will continue to respond in cases where suspected illegal entrants are detected. During the reorganisation of headquarters case records there will be some interruption to the paper processing of cases, but this will not affect the ability of local immigration officers to take enforcement action in the many cases where decisions have already been taken.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how he plans to ascertain whether or not the considerations to be taken into account in dealing with asylum applications made between 1 July 1993 and 31 December 1995 apply to the cases of individual asylum seekers; and if he plans that each such applicant will be interviewed;  [62229]
<P>
<UL>(2) how he plans to ascertain the considerations to be taken into account in dealing with asylum applications made between 1 July 1993 and 31 December 1995; and if he plans that each such applicant will be interviewed.  [62209]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Undecided asylum cases, where the date of application falls between the dates relevant to the backlog procedure, have already been identified. Instructions to caseworkers processing these cases will be issued shortly and will be made available to the public through selected sites and the internet. A copy will also be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="81203w05.html_para3">Although it may be necessary to interview some of these applicants in order to give cases full consideration, where possible a decision will be taken on the information already available on the file, or subsequently obtained by post from the applicant.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the incidence of offending among asylum seekers; and if he will make a statement.  [62211]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No general assessment has been made of such incidents, but any conviction will be notified to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and will be taken into account when deciding whether an asylum seeker should be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom. There is no evidence that the vast majority of asylum seekers are committing non-immigration criminal offences in the United Kingdom. Recent reports in the press have highlighted criminal offending by a minority, most of whom, with the sanction of the courts, will be removed from the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he proposes to establish guidelines as to the considerations to be taken into account in dealing with asylum applications made between 1 July 1993 and 31 December 1995 as outlined in paragraph 8.30 of Fairer, Faster and Firmer.  [62208]

<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Instructions on how to deal with cases which fall to be dealt with under the backlog procedures are to be issued to staff shortly. A copy of these instructions will be placed in the Library, sent to selected sites and placed on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's website on the internet.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what account will be taken of delays in dealing with their asylum claim caused by the actions of the asylum seekers themselves as regards applicants <i>(a)</i> before 1 July 1993 and <i>(b)</i> from 1 July 1993 to 31 December 1995, in determining the eligibility of such an asylum applicant for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 8.29 of Fairer, Faster and Firmer.  [62233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It would be difficult to envisage a set of criteria which would make it possible to distinguish those who through some action have delayed their case and the extent to which it was, in each individual case, justifiable or not.
<P>

<a name="81203w05.html_para4">Applicants who sought asylum in the United Kingdom before 1 January 1996 and who were still awaiting an initial decision on 27 July 1998 will not be excluded from the backlog procedures announced in the White Paper, even if some of the delay was caused by their own actions. However, any applicant whose case is being dealt with as part of the backlog exercise who, without good reason, fails to respond promptly to inquiries made by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate since the publication of the White Paper, is liable to have their application refused on non-compliance grounds.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how he proposes to ascertain in the case of each individual applicant whether or not the presence of pre-July 1993 asylum applicants is conducive to the public good;  [62207]
<P>
<UL>(2) how he plans to ascertain in the case of individual pre-July 1993 asylum seekers whether or not their presence is conducive to the public good.  [62213]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The information on individual case files will be examined. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate is routinely informed when those subject to immigration control are arrested and convicted of an offence.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the offences which amount to serious criminal offences for the purposes of determining the eligibility of pre-1 July 1993 asylum applicants for indefinite leave to remain under Para 8.29 of Fairer, Faster and Firmer-A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum.  [62230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It depends on the circumstances of the case, but generally an offender receiving a custodial sentence of 12 months or more would be excluded from benefiting from the backlog procedure. Other offenders may be excluded if their record is serious enough.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are currently taken to discover if asylum seekers have a criminal record prior to claiming asylum in the United Kingdom; and what plans he has to introduce new checks so as to ascertain if asylum seekers have criminal records.  [62210]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is existing practice for the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to be advised if any foreign national is convicted of a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. A refugee who has been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime and constitutes a danger to the community may be removed to the country from which they sought asylum. When considering asylum applications, factors such as criminal convictions will be taken into account if a person qualifies as a refugee and before permission is given to remain in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="81203w05.html_para5">It is not generally possible to ascertain whether an asylum seeker has committed an offence before they arrived in this country. However, if it is discovered that they have, consideration will be given to whether their actions exclude them from protection under the terms of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
<P>

<a name="81203w05.html_para6">We have no plans to introduce any new checks to ascertain whether asylum seekers have criminal records.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the likely effects of the refurbishment of Lunar House on the Immigration Service over the next three months.  [62227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The conditions at Lunar House have been described as Dickensian. The much needed refurbishment has been timed to fit in with fundamental changes in the way the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) handles casework. These include the creation of a new Integrated Casework Directorate, which will be in temporary offices above the Whitgift Centre in Croydon until the building work on Lunar House has been 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 252</I><P>
completed in 2001. I wrote to all hon. Members on 18 November to explain that there will be considerable upheaval in the next three months. However, I am confident that, after February, IND's service will be much improved. The refurbishment will create more reasonable conditions, which will be more conducive to the efficient delivery of services.

<a name="81203w05.html_wqn13"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum applications from Slovakians have been certified since May 1997; how many Roma or Slovakian cases there have been in the period; and in how many of these cases the certification has been overturned at appeal.  [61690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w05.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The number of asylum applications made by nationals of Slovakia from May 1997 to October 1998 was 1,095, of which 565 were certified. I regret the information on ethnic origin could be obtained only by examination of individual case records and is, therefore, available only at disproportionate cost. I regret that the information on how many of the certified refusals overturned at appeal is not available.

 It is long-standing Government policy neither to confirm nor deny whether the Security Service holds a record on any individual. I informed the House on 29 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>251-52</i>, that the Security Service has released almost all the surviving material in its archive covering the years 1909-1919, and is actively reviewing for release its more extensive stock of records for World War Two. Once this second phase of historical release has been completed, the Service will

<a name="81203w06.html_para0">Staff clubs are, according to current model rules, independent entities separate from Prison Service establishments. They are formed by staff and the managing committee should be responsible for any debts that arise. In their day-to-day operation with creditors, however, clubs have, on occasions, failed to make it clear that they are a separate legal entity from the core Prison Service. Consequently, when problems have occurred, the Prison Service has not always been able to distance itself from liability in the minds of creditors. The worst cases have resulted in settlement of debts from public funds. The Prisons Board has approved a corrective course of action which, following implementation, will ensure public funds are not misused to clear mess and club debts, fines and penalties.

<P>

<a name="81203w06.html_para1">The majority of food poisoning notifications are sporadic cases which cannot normally be linked to a specific food vehicle. The most reliable data linking particular foods with infection is derived from the investigation of outbreaks. Information on outbreaks associated with food production processes such as those relating to the slaughter and evisceration of poultry is not available. The tables show the pathogens responsible for disease associated with the consumption of turkey products and the faults in food handling that investigators have identified as contributing to the transmission of infection in these outbreaks.

 The Medicines Control Agency is funding, jointly with the National Health Service, Executive Trent, a pilot project for the reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions in children, entailing the establishment of a research unit at Derbyshire Children's Hospital run by Professor Imti Choonara of the University of Nottingham. The objectives of the project are to stimulate reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions occurring in children in the Trent region to the Medicines Control Agency and Committee on Safety of Medicines, to identify and investigate possible signals of new adverse drug reactions occurring in children and to determine the value of extending the scheme to other regions or nationally. The centre commenced work in September 1998 and will report on its progress in mid-1999.

 A doctor must decide what information to pass on to a patient about the possible adverse reactions to any drug, including vaccines, and we would expect them to pass on all the relevant information to each patient. Full details of the contraindications to vaccination and the adverse reactions associated with measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are set out in the United Kingdom Health Departments' memorandum "Immunisation against Infectious Disease" which is issued to doctors. The chapter on MMR states:

"Parents should be told about possible symptoms after immunisation".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="81203w07.html_para1">In addition, the Health Education Authority (HEA) produces a range of leaflets on immunisation, which give information on possible side effects. Details of possible adverse reactions to MMR vaccine are included in the leaflet "A Guide to Childhood Immunisations", which is given to new parents, and in the leaflet "Immunisation for School Leavers". The HEA also produces a range of factsheets, including two on MMR, to assist healthcare professionals in responding to more detailed queries from parents.
<P>

<a name="81203w07.html_para2">Measles/rubella (MR) vaccine was used during the 1994 immunisation campaign. During the campaign all parents received an information leaflet/consent form and parents who were worried were advised to talk to their family doctor or school nurse. A letter from the Chief Medical and Nursing Officers, information and question and answer sheets were issued to all doctors and nurses either involved in giving the vaccine or in giving information on the campaign.

 The White Paper "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain", issued in April 1998, sets out the Government's anti-drugs strategy for the next 10 years. This includes a proposal that senior representatives of local housing authorities are included in the core, multi-agency membership of Drug Action Teams, to ensure that housing initiatives are included in local strategies designed to meet the needs of people with drug problems. In addition, the new body to tackle rough sleeping in London, where the problems are most intense, will put in place a programme of outreach support and

<a name="81203w09.html_para0">Under the homelessness legislation, local housing authorities must assist people who are unintentionally homeless and vulnerable because of ill health or other special reason; this includes those who are vulnerable because of drug problems. And in allocating permanent social tenancies, local housing authorities must give reasonable preference to persons with medical or welfare problems, among others. Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) already provide 700 units of supported accommodation specifically for people with drug problems, and also manage a number of hostels for homeless people which provide support for this client group. The Housing Corporation is currently developing good practice guidance for RSLs on strategies for providing residential services to drug users, in conjunction with the United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what representations he has received in respect of United Kingdom airlines' access to the United States civil aviation market, with particular reference to rights of <i>(a)</i> cabotage and <i>(b)</i> ownership of United States airlines; and if he will make a statement;  [61795]

<a name="81203w09.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department has received representations from numerous sources in the UK and US about the liberalisation of UK/US air services. The two issues of cabotage and ownership of airlines have featured prominently in the representations from UK-based organisations. The UK hopes to conclude a new liberal agreement with the US which provides genuinely equal opportunities for airlines of both countries.

 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made a statement on 2 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 883-901, about our proposals for Standard Spending Assessments for 1999-2000, including the allowances to be made for sparsity of population. These proposals include, for the first time, a sparsity allowance in the element of the Standard Spending Assessment for social services for the elderly in their own homes.

<P>
<a name="81203w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1998]:</i> Aviation emissions of greenhouse gases are indeed covered by the Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. Emissions from domestic flights are covered by UK commitments to reduce greenhouse gases. Emissions from international flights are not "allocated" to individual countries at present but are the subject of separate requirements to take preventive action, particularly through the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

<a name="81203w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Snape: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many of the environmental protection measures proposed for the second phase of the channel tunnel rail link between Ebbsfleet and St. Pancras are a specific requirement of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996.  [62107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w10.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Additional tunnelling in the approach to St. Pancras and at Barking and revised alignment of the track at Thurrock and Rainham were provided partly for environmental reasons and are required by the 1996 Act. Other environmental protection measures may arise from the detailed planning approval granted under the provisions of the 1996 Act by the local planning authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate his Department has made of the value for money of the environmental protection measures included in design for the second phase of the Channel Tunnel Rail Line between Ebbsfleet and St. Pancras; and if he will make a statement.  [62108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w10.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have not sought to make such an estimate, partly because few CTRL works in section two are exclusively for environmental protection, but primarily because there is no reliable means of apportioning costs between environmentally protective and other works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w10.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have received a number of representations from residents near the railway line between the channel tunnel and London concerning noise from the horns of Eurostar trains. I understand from Eurostar that the levels of these horns comply with the rules governing international railway operations and are required by railway safety regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason the Government have decided not to issue an approved code of practice, covering issues raised in Circular 12/92 entitled "Guidance to Local Housing Authorities on Standards of Fitness" under section 352 of the Housing Act 1985; and if he will make a statement.  [62122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We have decided against introducing an Approved Code of Practice for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) as we consider that our existing powers do not enable us to produce an effective and workable code that would deliver the standards we want HMOs to achieve in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="81203w10.html_para0">We will be consulting on proposed standards for the licensing scheme we are committed to introduce for HMOs.

 We hope to issue a consultation document on our proposals for a licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) early in the New Year.

 I am delighted to announce today that the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) is to go ahead.
<P>

<a name="81203w10.html_para1">The Government are to provide &#163;167 million of revenue support to Nottingham City Council so it can fund its side of the deal. The NET is an early local authority Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project.
<P>

<a name="81203w10.html_para2">The project is the culmination of years of hard work and is an excellent example of central and local Government working together to bring real benefits to the local community. This is illustrated by our support for this

project. Over the next few years the NET will take up a large part of my Department's allocation of resources for local authority PFI projects. We will not be in a position to support similar light rail schemes in this way for the foreseeable future.
<P>

<a name="81203w10.html_para3">As we set out in "New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone", the transport White Paper published in July, we aim to give local authorities greater input into providing tailored transport solutions. This is reflected in the recently issued draft guidance to help Local Authorities to formulate local transport plans which are a core part of our proposals to deliver integrated transport strategies at the local level.

As stated in our White Paper "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People", we are discussing with business representatives the details of a possible scheme to reduce this burden on small businesses.

<a name="81203w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government regard it as unacceptable that anyone should be deprived of water supplies to their home because of an inability to pay. The Water Industry Bill, introduced on 25 November, includes provisions which, if agreed by Parliament, would make it an offence to disconnect water supplies to dwellings, schools or hospitals for non-payment of charges.
<P>

<a name="81203w11.html_para0">At present, water companies have powers to disconnect water supplies to homes for non-payment, under the Water Industry Act 1991. Water undertakers are also required to operate a code of practice on debt and disconnection and to have regard to guidance issued by the Director General of Water Services. The Government welcome the reductions in the numbers of customers disconnected in recent years. Nine water companies in England and Wales made no household disconnections for failure to pay water service bills in the first half of 1998-99.

The provisions in the 1998 Social Security Act which streamline and simplify the decision making process will be implemented in the Child Support Agency from June 1999.

<a name="81203w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 In 1998-99 Dyfed Powys received &#163;237.8 million in discretionary resources, &#163;8.4 million, or 3.6 per cent. more than in 1997-98. It is a matter for the health authority to determine how these funds should be used to provide an appropriate range of health services to its resident population, taking into account the pattern of local health need.

<P>
<a name="81203w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 Since the privatisation of the water industry in 1989, there has been a general decline in the number of water supply disconnections made by Dwr Cymru Welsh Water. In 1991-92 the number of household disconnections was 2,938 as compared to 160 in 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="81203w13.html_para3">The issue of disconnection formed part of the Government's recent review of the water charging system in England and Wales which proposed the prohibition of the disconnection of household water supplies for non-payment of charges. The Government have decided to proceed with this proposal. Clause 1 of the Water Industry Bill, which will have its Second Reading in the House on Monday 7 December, provides for this prohibition through an amendment to section 61 of the Water Industry Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="81203w13.html_para4">The development of charitable trusts by water companies is strongly supported by the Government as they provide invaluable support to customers in genuine need.

 The Government are bound by the timetable laid down in the Montreal Protocol to reduce or phase-out substances such as methyl bromide which deplete the ozone layer.

 Pet Animals arriving from North America are already subject to the same regime as animals arriving from anywhere else outside the British Isles. The Advisory Group on Quarantine has recommended that quarantine should be replaced for cats and dogs leaving the UK and returning after visits to the European Union and European Economic area countries, and rabies-free islands in the rest of the world; quarantine would also be replaced for cats and dogs entering the UK from such countries. Quarantine would be retained for cats and dogs coming into the UK from other countries.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the progress of the attack rate experiment examining the dose of BSE-infected cattle brain necessary to transmit BSE orally between cattle; and what evidence the experiments have produced on the relationship between the incubation period and the size of the dose.  [61558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81203w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In the so called attack-rate experiment, to determine the minimum amount of BSE-infected cattle brain required to infect cattle by the oral route and the effect dose size may have on the incubation time, groups of 10 cattle were deliberately infected at four months of age by feeding them with either 300, 100, 10 or 1 gram 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1998 : Column: 280</I><P>
of BSE infected brain tissue. The cattle were then observed for the development of disease and killed when judged to be positive by clinical signs. Diagnosis of BSE was confirmed by examination of the brain post-mortem.
<P>

<a name="81203w14.html_para1">The experiment has now been running for 7 years and transmission of BSE has been accomplished with all four different doses of brain. All 10 animals in each group dosed with 300 or 100 grams of brain have been positively diagnosed with incubation periods ranging from 32-42 months and 32-60 months respectively. Seven of the 10 animals in each group dosed with 10 or 1 gram have been positively diagnosed with incubation periods ranging from 44-71 months and 45-71 months respectively. One animal died early from other causes not related to BSE in the group that received 10 grams of brain. All the remaining animals from the groups that received 10 or 1 gram of brain are now showing early clinical signs consistent with BSE.
<P>

<a name="81203w14.html_para2">The results indicate that cattle can be infected by the oral route down to a level of 1 gram of BSE infected cattle brain and that incubation period appears to be prolonged at lower doses.
<P>

<a name="81203w14.html_para3">The experiment has since been extended and groups of cattle have now been challenged with either one, one tenth, one hundredth or one thousandth of a gram of the same infected cattle brain used previously. The experiment has been running for 11 months and all animals are still clinically normal. It is hoped that this phase of the experiment will define the minimum dose of brain required to infect cattle and provide further information relating to the effect on incubation period relative to the infecting dose.

 DTI has in place a number of procedures and mechanisms to ensure that the appropriate scientific advice is sought and used to inform policy making in line with the Guidelines on "The Use of Scientific Advice in Policy Making". These mechanisms include, for example, the use of in-house experts, independent advisory committees and expert research or technical advice. The Office of Science and Technology carried out a review of how Departments were implementing the Guidelines, and the Chief Scientific Adviser published a report last July which showed that good progress was being made. A further review will be undertaken next year.

 From the day it was elected, this Government have striven to encourage better networking by research-oriented SMEs. Very often, such firms possess real talent and innovative ideas; it is our aim to encourage them to learn from each other, and from a wider canvas of expertise, how best to bring their research to market.
<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para6">I recognise and welcome the industrial forums that have been established in Wales and commend them to other parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para7">One of the earliest actions of this Government, following the 1997 election, was to announce the establishment of the first four Faraday Partnerships in the UK.
<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para8">Each Faraday Partnership is a collaborative network between one or more universities, one or more independent research and technology organisations and a group of up to 30 firms, focusing especially on small and medium-sized firms.
<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para9">At regional and local level, numerous semi-formal groupings exist, usually facilitated by Government Office, Business Links or universities and research organisations. Many such groups have been established as a result of the work of the team of 13 regional industrial secondees working in the DTI's Innovation Unit, who in turn collaborate with local providers to identify suitable topics for networking.
<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para10">Particular emphasis has been given to encouraging smaller firms to understand the outcomes of the Foresight process.

 Small and medium-sized businesses are crucial to a successful enterprise economy and the Government are firmly committed to stimulating the creation, competitiveness and growth of new and smaller businesses.
<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para11">The key principles underlying the Government's approach include fostering an enterprise culture that encourages innovators and risk takers; providing and maintaining a supportive economic environment; identifying and removing barriers to growth; and providing high quality business support for firms at all stages of their development.

<P>

<a name="81203w15.html_para13">The setting of a different rate for young people reflects the importance we attach to their training, development and education and to helping them to secure jobs.

<a name="81203w15.html_para14">The national minimum wage will help improve relationships at the workplace and produce improvements in work force commitment, morale, and performance.

 There was no specific assessment of the increased overheads faced by small businesses, but we do not think small businesses will be disproportionately affected because of their size. An assessment for the whole of British industry was made, a copy of which is held in the Library.
<P>

<a name="81203w16.html_para0">The Government have endeavoured to minimise costs and burdens on business in line with proper implementation of the Directive. These measures will provide workers with proper rest and help combat stress and illness amongst workers. With the CBI estimating &#163;25 billion lost in 1996 due to absenteeism they also make good business sense.
