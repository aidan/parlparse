 In December 2005 Ofcom, the regulator for the broadcasting sector, estimated that the potential revenue from product placement could be worth &#163;25 million to &#163;35 million per annum after five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="90318w0002.htm_para11"><a name="09031889000243">A number of respondents to the consultation on the UK implementation of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, conducted between July and October 2008, agreed with the Ofcom estimate. Other respondents put forward far higher estimates of the potential value of product placement. One broadcaster thought the potential value was greatly overstated. The variation in the estimates made by respondents to the consultation indicates that there is a lack of clear evidence about the potential value of product placement and that there is no consensus on the potential size of the UK product placement market.</p>

 The Home Office has supported the rollout of Neighbourhood Policing teams to every community in England and Wales. For neighbourhood policing teams an essential element of developing partnerships with their local communities is to consider how to engage effectively with young people. For example, each borough in Surrey has a youth intervention team that engages with young people in schools and the wider community, while Essex police make use of the county council&#146;s youth buses to engage with hard to reach communities. We also recently published our Youth Crime Action Plan (YCAP) which highlights the need to improve the communication and relationships between young people and the police.</p>

For example, of arrestees who reported taking heroin and/or crack cocaine (HC) at least once a week, 54 per cent. reported shoplifting in the four weeks prior to arrest compared to 10 per cent. for those arrestees who did not take HC at least once per week.</p>

 The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 introduced the power for courts to issue orders for the closure of premises where Class A drugs and serious nuisance and disorder are a problem. The provision commenced on 20 January 2004.

Information on closure orders where Class A drugs are used unlawfully is not available in the format requested. However, information published in May 2008 and covering the period October 2003 to September 2007 is shown in the following table.</p>

 Invitees to the burglary summit held on 4 February were intended to provide as wide a representation of stakeholders as possible across the public, private and voluntary sectors, within the constraints of the venue. The security industry was represented in the first instance by the British Security Industry Association, as they have a wide reach through the industry, but the Home Office recognises that Master Locksmiths&#146; Association has a very valuable role to play.</p>

Since the summit, a number of companies and industry bodies have contacted officials expressing a willingness to support the real help for people in hard times work. The support of the Master Locksmith's Association is most welcome; they have been contacted by Home Office officials and will be included in relevant aspects of this work as it progresses.</p>

 The Security Service will investigate individuals where there is cause for concern regarding their behaviour or activities. Where it is determined that an individual poses a direct threat to national security and public safety, the Security Service, in co-operation with the police, will take disruptive action. However, the number of individuals under investigation by the Security Service at any one time does not necessarily equate to the number of people who pose a direct threat. This is because the police and security and intelligence agencies will never have comprehensive coverage or surveillance so there could be extremist activities of which we are not aware.</p>

 The Audit Commission report, &#147;Crunch Time?&#148; found that councils are generally prepared for the impact of the economic downturn and the consequent loss of fees and interest, and increased demand for services. The Government have continued to invest in local services with an extra &#163;8.9 billion as part of the first-ever three-year settlement giving councils the stability and flexibility they need to manage their budgets effectively. Delivering continued efficiency gains is key to enabling authorities to manage the pressures they face which will generate a further &#163;4.9 billion over the CSR07 period.

 It is a key principle of Government funding of adult learning that there is a shared responsibility on the part of learners, employers and the Government to contribute towards the cost of learning. The Skills Strategy White Paper &#147;21<sup>(st)</sup> Century Skills: Realising our Potential&#148; (published in July 2003) set out our intention that employers and learners should contribute towards the cost of their course, in light of the returns they derive from learning. &#147;Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&#148; (March 2006) confirmed our intention to increase learner and/or employer fee contributions to 50 per cent. by 2010/11 for those not eligible for free provision. Lord Leitch&#146;s Review of Skills (December 2006) reaffirmed the importance for a shared responsibility to invest in skills with employers and learners asked to contribute most where they see the greatest private returns. We are therefore increasing private fee contributions for both employers and learners from 42.5 per cent. in 2008/09, to 47.5 per cent. for 2009/10 and 50 per cent. for 2010/11.</p>

 With regard to colleges the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) provides funding for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) to Further Education colleges as part of their overall allocation for adult learning. 297 colleges received funding to deliver courses in ESOL in 2008/09, spread across all nine regions.</p>

The LSC commissions with colleges in light of their performance, the quality of their delivery, their capacity and capability, including their financial health. Allocations and contracts are then agreed with colleges based on a planning assumption of the volumes the college will deliver.</p>

 Community care grants can only be made for minor household repairs and improvements. The community care grant savings rule applies to all grant awards, which means that all savings over a set limit are fully taken into account against the amount of an award. Currently the limit is &#163;500 where the applicant and their partner is under 60 years of age, and &#163;1,000 where the applicant or their partner is 60 years of age or over. There are no plans to review this rule.</p>

 During the 12 months to December 2008, probation service staff took a total of 239,801 days as sick leave. This equates to an average of 11.5 days per staff year.</p>

An area&#146;s eligibility to apply for trust status is in part dependent on their performance as assessed in the Integrated Probation Performance Framework (IPPF). Performance against the sickness absence target forms part of the overall assessment.</p>

<i> Cause code</i><br>
The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. The field within HES counts only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Cause codes used:<br>
 Deliberate (intentional self-harm): X60-X84 (intentional self-harm), Y87.0 (sequelae of intentional self-harm)<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 While a family&#146;s initial involvement in a Family Intervention Project is voluntary, the projects draw on the range of sanctions that a family or family members may already be facing. These include seeking possession of a family&#146;s tenancy, a parenting order, antisocial behaviour order, proceedings to take children into care and juvenile specific orders. Once families have agreed to take part, a contract is drawn up with the family setting out the changes that are expected, support that will be provided and sanctions that may be used if changes are not made. Early evaluation of Family Intervention Projects has shown that they are helping to reduce antisocial behaviour and prevent homelessness.</p>

We will, however, retain the flexibility for individual school governing bodies to determine how material should be presented and what teaching resources schools use to support delivery of their SRE programmes.</p>

Given the wide range of audiences and the challenging nature of some of our priority advertising and publicity messages the use of big voices, advocates and high profile celebrities (where the selected &#145;voice&#146; has a resonance or a known link to the message or there is a strong argument that the individual or individuals have a high level of influence within a particular audience group) this is one way we would look to deliver and influence to our markets.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has continued to make limited assessments, hindered by the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s refusal to allow free and full access to the conflict area. DFID has deployed humanitarian specialists to Colombo for some time and a first brief visit, organised by the Sri Lankan Government, took place on the 11-12 March. The DFID specialist was able to confirm that the fierce fighting between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elaam (LTTE) and Government of Sri Lanka forces has caused the humanitarian situation to deteriorate. Approximately 230,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) are trapped in a decreasing area of LTTE control in the Vanni region.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment his Department has made of <i> (a)</i> the scale of the cholera epidemic, <i> (b)</i> food security and <i> (c)</i> prospects for economic stabilisation in Zimbabwe. [263518]</p>

<p><a name="st_413"><a name="090318108002152"><a name="90318w0025.htm_spnew10"><a name="090318108002445"><b>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</b>
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that there are now around 90,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe with over 4,000 deaths. The figures suggest that the number of new cases is starting to decline and better care at health institutions means that the death rate is also coming down. However, with continuing rains and the fragile state of water and health systems, WHO estimates that the total number of cases may well exceed 100,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_636"><a name="90318w0025.htm_para8"><a name="090318108002153">Recent nutritional assessments have highlighted the seriousness of the food situation and the clear need for ongoing aid. The proportion of children under age five who are underweight was estimated at 17 per cent., a rate that has not changed since 2003 while chronic malnutrition has slightly declined by 2 per cent. to 27 per cent. The number of acutely malnourished children is increasing but at 4.8 per cent. remains below internationally recognised emergency levels (10 per cent.) across the country. UN figures suggest that seven million people will have received food aid in Zimbabwe by February 2009. The next harvest will partly alleviate the situation but early projections suggest a similar scale of food insecurity in 2009-10, with a peak before next year&#146;s harvest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_637"><a name="90318w0025.htm_para9"><a name="090318108002154">Economic stabilisation in Zimbabwe will be tough due to the low starting point. GDP has shrunk by 50 per cent. in a decade with all economic sectors suffering from a failure of Government policy. In addition, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has printed the Zimbabwe dollar out of existence so the economy is rapidly dollarising. The IMF and other major financial institutions are currently undertaking missions to Zimbabwe and it is hoped that this will give the international community a clearer picture of the extent of the problem and how best to rectify it.</p>

 The UK sees diversity of sources of imported gas as vital for the EU's security of energy supply. Recent events have underlined the importance to the EU of being supplied with gas from a wide range of countries. The development of a southern corridor, with the aim of bringing gas to the EU from the Caspian region through Turkey or directly across the Black Sea, and in the longer term from the Middle East, is crucial to that end. The UK therefore strongly supports the efforts of the European Commission and fellow EU Member States to develop a southern corridor and this Department is actively engaged in these efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_642"><a name="90318w0027.htm_para3"><a name="090318111000343">The Commission's second Strategic Energy Review (SEER2) of November 2008 affirmed the importance of a southern corridor as one of the EU's highest energy priorities and the importance, to that end, of increasing high level political engagement with potential gas supplier countries, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iraq. The European Commission and current Czech presidency of the EU have made this a priority for 2009 and we are working closely with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_643"><a name="90318w0027.htm_para4"><a name="090318111000344">The UK also sees it as important for there to be a diverse selection of routes for gas to enter the EU and for this reason we support the building of new pipelines, under market conditions, to bring gas from established suppliers to the EU such as Norway, Russia and Algeria. In addition to pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), imported by tanker from countries such as Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, Algeria and Nigeria, also plays an important role in diversifying gas supply to the UK and other EU member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_644"><a name="90318w0027.htm_para5"><a name="090318111000345">The UK's own security of gas supply has been improved in recent years by new import infrastructure projects such as the BBL (Netherlands-UK) and Langeled (from Norway) pipelines, expansion of the (Belgium-UK) IUK pipeline and the new LNG import terminal at the Isle of Grain. Two further major LNG import terminals at Milford Haven are expected to be commissioned soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_653"><a name="90318w0027.htm_para14"><a name="090318111000370">DECC officials are in regular discussion with the European Commission and the EU Co-ordinator on the concept of a North sea offshore grid to link offshore wind generation in the North and Baltic seas, in order to share our experience of offshore transmission and ensure that UK objectives are met in any developments on this project. DECC officials are also engaging with the Commission and other EU member states on proposals to develop solar and wind power in desert regions in North Africa and the Middle East as a means to provide clean energy for these countries and for Europe. We are in contact with the French Government which has been seeking to give impetus to these ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_654"><a name="90318w0027.htm_para15"><a name="090318111000371">The idea of a European supergrid could help member states meet climate change and energy goals.
