<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2001]:</i> Where a vehicle has been used for the carriage, handling, deposit or concealment of anything liable to forfeiture, that vehicle is itself liable to forfeiture to the Crown under s141(1)(a) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. Any such vehicle is forfeit once a month has passed and no appeal has been received, or where there is an appeal and the Magistrates find in favour of Customs and Excise. The Commissioners of Customs and Excise will dispose of forfeit vehicles on behalf of the Crown in the most efficient and cost-effective way.

<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Customs record the number of vehicles seized for all Customs offences on a financial year basis.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 30 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 642W, on departmental budgets, if he will provide a breakdown for each listed Department of the main items of intended expenditure that were not spent, comprising each of the annual underspend totals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The allocation of budgets within Departmental Expenditure Limits is normally a matter for individual Secretaries of State. Under this Government's system of full End-Year Flexibility, unspent provision is available for use in future years. Departmental Appropriation Accounts break down outturn by section of the Vote.

<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Under this Government's system of full End-Year Flexibility, unspent provision can be carried forward by Departments for use in future years. This removes the incentive, which applied under previous arrangements, to use up budgets wastefully at the end of the financial year. The allocation and management of budget within Departmental Expenditure Limits are in general a matter for individual Secretaries of State.

<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_wqn8"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the projects in his Department which have been considered as potential public-private partnerships since 1997 which have not been undertaken because the public sector comparator had a lower net present value than the public-private partnership proposed; and if he will make a statement.  [13453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 In our 1997 reforms of PFI, the Government abandoned the requirement to submit all capital projects to PFI testing. Accordingly, it will be concluded at a very early stage in the option appraisal process whether a PPP approach is likely to deliver value for money (vfm); where it is not, a public sector comparator (PSC) will not be constructed. Only when it is concluded, following careful consideration, that PPP is likely to offer vfm, will a PSC normally be developed.
<P>

<a name="11113w01.html_para3">Against this background, and with the maturing of the PPP process and the PPP market, it is likely that a high proportion of projects which do embark on the PPP route will contract on that basis, with competition helping to secure value for money and the PSC acting as a quantitative aid to informing judgment.
<P>

<a name="11113w01.html_para4">PPP deals continue to account for only a small proportion of the total sums invested to improve the delivery of public services. Public sector gross investment is projected to rise from &#163;19 billion in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;35.2 billion in 2003&#150;04. Over the same period, capital investment by the private sector through PFI will be about &#163;3 billion annually.
<P>

<a name="11113w01.html_para5">So far as the Treasury as a Department is concerned, there have been no projects within the terms of the hon. Member's question.

<a name="11113w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement about the impact of the charging of VAT on the residential costs of nursing home care.  [12123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government are of the clear view that the care of vulnerable people provided in all residential homes should not be subject to VAT. In May, the VAT Tribunal confirmed that the care provided in residential nursing homes was exempt from VAT. However, the Tribunal also ruled that care provided by a commercial body was not exempt, and Customs and Excise are currently appealing against that ruling. Whatever the outcome of that appeal, the Government will take steps to ensure that residents of care homes and their families do not face increased costs as a result of VAT.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many employees of <i>(a)</i> mutual, <i>(b)</i> co-operative and <i>(c)</i> employee trust award companies would benefit if the present rules were changed to permit such organisations to participate in employee share ownership plans; what plans there are to expand ESOPs in this way; and if he will make a statement.

 Employees of registered industrial and provident societies which are co-operatives are already able to participate in the Share Incentive Plan introduced last year. Companies such as mutual organisations and trust-owned companies that do not issue shares are not able to participate.

<a name="11113w02.html_para0">We estimate that some 70,000 staff are employed by mutual organisations and around 60,000 are employed by trust owned businesses in the UK.

 There is no proposed EU legislation to prohibit machinery operators from driving plant and equipment for more then two hours per day. The proposed Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive introduces a limit value for exposure to whole body vibration. The European Parliament has proposed an amendment to the common position on the Directive reducing this limit value. This reduced limit value could, in particular circumstances, have the effect of restricting the driving time by individuals of certain equipment to two or three hours.

 TRL has given only informal advice to my Department on these issues, other than its letter formally responding to our recent consultation exercise on pedestrian protection. A summary of this, and other responses received, has been placed in the House Library. Copies of the full responses can be seen at the DTLR Library. Our understanding of TRL's views, both formal and informal, are as follows:
<P>

<a name="11113w02.html_para10"><i>Bumper test:</i> It is likely that, for some struck pedestrians, the proposed 21 degree bending angle for phase one might encourage technical designs that would cause permanent disabling injuries rather than injuries that

will heal without disablement. The TRL view is that, because the whole package, including phase two, will result in considerable overall benefits, the opportunity to have pedestrian protection on vehicles should not be put at risk over this issue.

<a name="11113w02.html_para11"><i>Head impact test:</i> In the Negotiated Agreement two thirds of the bonnet area would have to meet a HIC limit of 1000; the head protection level normally associated with occupant protection. The other one third could have a HIC limit of 2000. This carries a higher risk of injury. However, it is likely that a combination of manufacturers aiming for better standards in production, and the impossibility of designing a bonnet in practice that has a step change such that it only just met the higher level over the whole one third, means that the average level in that zone would probably be midway between a HIC of 1000 and a HIC of 2000.
<P>

<a name="11113w02.html_para12">In phase one, the adult area will be tested with a child headform. Despite this, the additional protection would still be of benefits to adults in many accidents. However, in some adult accidents the bonnet will be too soft, with a risk of pushing it down on to immovable underlying components.
<P>

<a name="11113w02.html_para13"><i>Bonnet leading edge test:</i> There has been a long term trend towards more streamlined vehicles which has helped reduce femur and pelvic injuries, and this is the lowest priority of the EEVC tests. However, there is a possibility that manufacturers may raise or stiffen the bonnet leading edge to help gain better performance in the legform test; this would increase the risk of femur and pelvis injuries. The current inclusion of the test with performance targets in phase one of the negotiated agreement would allow such a trend to be monitored if it were to occur.

<a name="11113w02.html_para14"><i>The influence of car design:</i> The effect of the long term change in style towards more streamlined shapes is mentioned above.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have not made a specific assessment of this. However, it is clear that industry continues to see difficulty in meeting the full EEVC criteria as a universal requirement for cars at an early date.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will estimate the pedestrian fatality reduction potential of the Phase 1 tests in the draft negotiated agreement as a percentage of the potential in the EEVC Working Group 17; and what assessment he has made of the ability of the draft negotiated agreement to meet the level of protection in the harmonisation process required by the Treaty of European Union.  [13390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w02.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is estimated that Phase 1 would deliver a benefit of around 25 per cent. for fatal injuries and 60 per cent. for serious injuries, relative to the Phase 2 levels associated with the EEVC WG 17 requirements. The negotiated agreement is likely to start delivering two years earlier than a directive, which would itself be likely to be phased.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how it is intended that the car industry will work to agreed longer-term targets for pedestrian protection if Phase 2 of the draft negotiated agreement is not specified with Phase 1.  [13420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w02.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Phase 1 and Phase 2 are both specified in the negotiated agreement.
<P>

<a name="11113w02.html_para15">I am satisfied that the technical requirements of the first phase will be operated in a flexible manner, which will allow manufacturers to deliver cars in Phase 1 which incorporate techniques more appropriate for meeting the Phase 2 levels. This will address one of the concerns raised by TRL and others about the headform test in Phase 1.

 On-going market testing is exploring all avenues, and on the basis of professional advice we are in discussion with a small number of serious contenders. To reveal details of the discussions would not be conducive to a successful conclusion and would be against the public interest.

<a name="11113w03.html_para0">From 1 July 2001, when the lease of the New Millennium Experience Company ended, English Partnerships, the Government's regeneration agency, has been incurring an average of &#163;240,000 per month on Dome maintenance and management related costs. English Partnerships also expects to incur expenditure in the order of &#163;9.75 million this year on decommissioning the Dome contents in preparation for a future use and about &#163;1.7 million in relation to the current sale process. Any money spent on these will be recovered from sale proceeds so the cost will not fall to the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions at what date the 1 per cent. rise in levels above the rate of inflation will commence under his restructuring proposals for local authority rent levels; if it will apply equally to all local authorities; and whether mitigation will be introduced to dampen the effect where high-level rents are instituted in high-value areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Rents for local authority properties are set by the responsible authorities and depend upon decisions taken locally. The proposed 1 per cent. real terms increase in rents is the assumption for the purposes of calculating housing subsidy in England for 2002&#150;03 which was announced at the end of the 2000 spending review. It is independent of our policy on rent restructuring. Ministers are considering how it will apply to each local authority in the light of responses to the consultation on proposals for subsidy changes and will make an announcement soon. We expect rent changes as a result of rent restructuring to be limited to a maximum of &#163;2 per week in any year above normal inflation-related increases. We are considering whether there should also be a cap on the rents of high-value properties which would otherwise attract high rents.

<P>
<a name="11113w04.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 In 2000, an estimated 133 accidental fire related deaths in dwellings were recorded for the seven metropolitan brigades, out of a national total of 326. The number of accidental house fire deaths in metropolitan brigade areas had fallen in recent years from 167 in 1996 to the current estimated figure of 133 for 2000. The downward trend in dwelling fire deaths is reflected nationally for England and Wales. There were 588 dwelling fire deaths in 1996, compared with 516 for 2000.
<P>

<a name="11113w04.html_para0">Malicious false alarms, both for the metropolitan areas and nationally, have been falling steadily over recent years. In 1996 there were 57,100 malicious false alarm calls recorded by the metropolitan areas. In 2000, metropolitan brigades attended a total of 33,800 malicious false alarm calls&#151;a fall of 41 per cent. against the 1996 figures.

<a name="11113w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The public-private partnership is designed to achieve a comprehensive modernisation of the entire underground network. This is necessarily a long-term programme and there is a limit on the amount of work that can be done simultaneously without causing excessive disruption to the service to the public. The overall requirements have therefore been specified by London Underground to upgrade every line over time, prioritised to deliver the greatest benefits as quickly as possible. The capability of most lines is expected to be increased by around 10&#150;25 per cent. The detailed requirements are currently being negotiated and London Underground will publish details once the negotiations have been completed.

 The Government's plans for a publicly run, privately built London Underground are designed to deliver at least &#163;13 billion of investment over the next 15 years. The private sector will be incentivised to deliver this investment by contracts that are principally output- based, with payments to the private sector infrastructure companies increasing as they improve capacity, reliability and the quality of the travelling environment on the tube network. The private sector will be similarly financially penalised for poor performance. These penalties will reflect the impact of any delay or disruption to passengers and not be limited by a cap.

 Members of the local government modernisation team have been appointed on a mixture of short-term secondments or fixed-term contracts, usually of one to two years (full and part-time). Most members are senior civil service equivalents. Remuneration is based on salary before joining the team, and is currently in the range from &#163;45,000 to &#163;80,000 per annum. Members have the option of remaining in the local government pension scheme or joining the principle civil service pension scheme when they join the Department.

 The Government want to see more regular and reliable bus services that will attract increasing numbers of passengers. Since the publication of the most recent bus quality indicators bulletin in September, we have commenced powers under the Transport Act 2000 with regard to statutory Quality Partnerships and Quality Contracts. This means that local authorities now have a wider range of powers at their disposal to help them to take steps to improve local bus services.
<P>

<a name="11113w06.html_para6">The Transport Act 2000 also requires all local transport authorities to develop arrangements for ensuring that appropriate bus passenger information is made available, and enables them to step in to provide proper passenger information, at operators' expense, if existing arrangements are inadequate.

It also remains possible that a strategic partner will be brought in to assist with the commercial development of the company prior to a flotation. The Ministry of Defence is likely to retain an interest in QinetiQ as a means to ensuring that taxpayers receive full value for the investment in past Government funded research. An announcement, hopefully early in the new year, will be made once a decision has been taken on the transaction route, and the proposed timetable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w07.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 At the first meeting of the task force on 6 November, my ministerial colleagues from other Departments with an interest in veterans issues, representatives from the veterans' community and I agreed terms of reference committing us to making our policy development and services responsive to the reasonable needs and concerns of veterans. We agreed a vision focusing on the key themes of partnership, identity, recognition, education and care, and agreed a cross- government action plan to take these themes forward. This work is being undertaken in partnership with experts from veterans organisations and will include reviews of resettlement for the most vulnerable of those discharged from the armed forces, of the educational material on veterans and their achievements provided for Key Stage 3 of the national curriculum and of ways in which we might improve the effectiveness of our communications with veterans. Ministers also agreed to review their relevant public service agreements to identify those in which there was a significant and discrete veterans problem that merited action in its own right. Particular areas to be considered were focused on the most vulnerable and included the levels of service-related problems among the prison population, among marital breakdowns and among the unemployed. Deadlines have been set for action plan work items, and overall progress with the initiative will be considered at the next meeting of the task force in May 2002.
<P>

<a name="11113w07.html_para2">I consider that the task force agreements represent substantial progress towards achieving our objective of raising the profile of veterans' issues in Government and more widely across the nation, and of improving the delivery of benefits to veterans, particularly the most vulnerable.

 There are no plans to include formed units of the Territorial Army in the operations in Afghanistan. However, a call-out order has been made under section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to permit up to 150 individual reservists from all three services to be called out for service in support of the current operation. They are needed to augment headquarters, and provide operational support to the Royal Air Force. Most will be based in the UK. Augmentation of this nature is a routine task for the reserves.

 The exercise activity of Exercise Saif Sareea 2 ended on 29 October and the recovery of our forces and their equipment is under way.
<P>

<a name="11113w07.html_para3">The objectives of the exercise were to deploy and sustain a major joint force across strategic distances, and conduct realistic coalition war fighting training in a testing desert environment. As such it was a major test of some of the equipment and personnel that are part of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force.
<P>

<a name="11113w07.html_para4">It will take some weeks to analyse all the results of the exercise and the lessons identified. But it is already clear that the exercise did indeed provide very valuable training and many very useful lessons have already been identified. Overall, our initial judgment is that the exercise has met its aims most successfully. It has demonstrated the ability of the United Kingdom to project forces over a strategic distance, and in doing so reaffirmed UK commitment to the stability and security of the middle east region at an important time.

 On 12 October, the Government published a draft Digital TV Action Plan which sets out the issues on which action needs to be taken to enable and encourage take up of digital television. An essential element of the Plan will be the need to raise the awareness and knowledge of consumers including those who want to receive only free-to-view channels.

<P>
<a name="11113w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government welcomed the English Tourism Council's (ETC) report, "Sea Changes", which was produced in the light of advice from the ETC's Resorts Task Force. The report makes 20 recommendations, which would involve various bodies at a national, regional and local level, as well as the industry itself. This Department has asked the ETC to consider how that report can best be implemented and to

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will consider the <i>(a)</i> establishment and <i>(b)</i> funding of a Seaside Regeneration Trust modelled on the Coalfields Regeneration Trust.  [13740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w09.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The English Tourism Council's report, "Sea Changes", published last February, makes a number of recommendations about how to approach regeneration that could be of use to resort towns.
<P>

<a name="11113w09.html_para1">The Government consider that the prime responsibility for resort regeneration, which often has some tourism focus, lies with those who administer individual resorts&#151;working with local and regional partners. There is a variety of funding and organisational mechanisms now in place to help achieve this, for instance, Neighbourhood Renewal Strategies (for those eligible) and Local Strategic Partnerships. We encourage local authorities to make use of these mechanisms. However, while acknowledging the level of deprivation that has developed in some of our resorts over the years, we do not consider it directly 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w09.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government believe that the principal responsibility for supporting the infrastructure of British seaside resorts lies with local government, working with other interested parties in the light of a clearly enunciated vision and strategy for tourism and other economic activity. It is also particularly important that aspects of planning and transport, for instance, as well as any overall plan for regeneration, dovetail with wider regional plans which are the responsibility of regional development agencies in England. In Scotland and Wales the infrastructure of seaside resorts is a matter for the relevant Minister in each devolved administration.

 Following their successful collaboration with the Home Office in producing and televising the 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2001 : Column: 639W</I><P>
national ceremony to mark the first United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January, the BBC have developed plans for covering Holocaust Memorial Day in the future. These will culminate in a major live televised ceremonial event on 27 January 2005, the 60th anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz. My officials will take up the BBC's invitation to discuss with them their strategy for covering Holocaust Memorial Day over the next four years, and to include representatives from the Home Office-led strategic group planning Holocaust Memorial Day.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received regarding the BBC televising the Holocaust Memorial Day national event; and if he will make a statement.  [14501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w09.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 All those organisations involved in helping the Home Office plan the national event on Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January 2002 have expressed their disappointment that the BBC have decided to televise the national event every five years only, the next time on 27 January 2005 the 60th anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz.
<P>

<a name="11113w09.html_para2">However, the BBC have made an unequivocal commitment to mark Holocaust Memorial Day each year in a range of appropriate ways. They have invited Home Office officials and those organisations involved in planning Holocaust Memorial Day to discuss their strategy for the next four years with them. Their proposed strategy contains a differing mix of documentary, drama, current affairs, children's programming and news coverage each year leading to a major live ceremonial event for 2005.
<P>

<a name="11113w09.html_para3">In January 2002 the BBC have a major original film drama "Conspiracy", starring Kenneth Brannagh, about Reinhard Heydrich and the Wannsee Conference; their television religious strands "The Heaven and Earth Show" and "Songs of Praise" plan to feature Holocaust related material in their programmes on 27 January; the BBC are looking at a special edition of their BBC 2 current affairs programme "Correspondent" during the Holocaust Memorial weekend and it is likely that various programmes from Children's BBC will take up the theme too.
<P>

<a name="11113w09.html_para4">The BBC also intend to cover the national event next 27 January on their news bulletins on BBC 1 and 2 and on News 24, and likely on radio too.

<P>
<a name="11113w09.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There was an estimated audience of 1.2 million for the ceremony televised live on 27 January 2001 which got one of the highest quality ratings for a TV programme. Many people said they found the event both moving and challenging. In addition, many others will have become aware of the purpose of Holocaust Memorial Day through the many local activities around the country, particularly in schools, to mark the day.

 We anticipate there will again be a wide range of local activities around the country to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Further guidance has been produced to help local authorities and community groups to plan their events; and new material for use in schools has also been produced. In each case the guidance has drawn on good practice from this year and suggestions for improvement identified through surveys of local authorities and schools.

 Officers in the Metropolitan police qualify for a London allowance and London weighting in addition to their basic pay. For officers who were appointed before 1 September 1994 and who receive a housing emolument, the London allowance is worth &#163;1,011 a year. From 1 July 2000, officers who were appointed on or after 1 September 1994 and who are not in receipt of a housing emolument receive a London allowance of &#163;4,338 a year. London weighting was increased to &#163;1,773 a year for all Metropolitan police officers from 1 July this year. In addition, officers in the Metropolitan police have free rail travel to and from work within a 70-mile radius of Charing Cross Station.
<P>

<a name="11113w10.html_para5">From 1 April 2001, officers in Bedfordshire appointed on or after 1 September 1994 who are not in receipt of a housing allowance receive an allowance of &#163;1,000 a year in addition to basic pay.
<P>

<a name="11113w10.html_para6">The increase in the London allowance and the new allowance for officers in Bedfordshire were approved by the then Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), following agreements in the Police Negotiating Board (PNB). PNB is the statutory negotiating body for police pay and conditions which makes recommendations to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State approved the new allowances in recognition of the recruitment and retention difficulties associated with the higher cost of living in London and Bedfordshire.

In addition, under subsection (3)(b), a person commits an offence if he invites another to receive instruction or training and the receipt would constitute an offence under subsection (2) but for the fact that it is to take place outside the United Kingdom.

<a name="11113w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government have put in place a robust policy to increase investment in the development of renewable energy. The single most important mechanism, the new Renewables Obligation (RO) to be introduced next year and lasting right through until 2027, will drive forward investment in renewables. The RO is expected to create long-term support for renewables, worth over &#163;1 billion per year, by 2010. The introduction of the Obligation will be underpinned by direct Government funding for renewables worth over &#163;260 million between 2001 and 2004. This includes the Government's current sustainable energy research and development programme, worth &#163;55.5 million over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="11113w12.html_para4">Other components to this strategy, which will increase investment in the renewable energy sector, include:
<P>

<a name="11113w12.html_para5"><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>exemption of renewables from Climate Change Levy (CCL) payments. This is expected to lead to greater demand for renewable electricity and increased investment;

<a name="11113w12.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) Orders supported many renewable energy projects through the previous Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation. We have arranged that existing NFFO contracts will be honoured. We have also announced a proposal for a NFFO locational flexibility Order. Locational flexibility will be available for all NFFO 3, 4 and 5 projects that have not been commissioned, other than mixed waste incineration projects. This Order will allow projects not already built, to identify more appropriate locations, so that they can overcome any problems in securing planning permission. These initiatives are expected to bring forward investment in this sector in the near future;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11113w12.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government have also initiated regional assessments throughout all regions of the UK. The majority of these studies have been completed and have identified each region's capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. Once all the assessments are completed, it is expected that specific regional targets will be adopted across the UK. These targets are expected to attract investment in the resources available in these regions.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11113w12.html_para8">Government policy is bringing about a much more positive approach to supporting renewable energy projects. Taking all these measures together, the Government believe the industry is well placed to attract and retain a significant level of investment.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> The Department of Trade and Industry attaches great importance to green forms of energy and has set ambitious targets. The new Renewables Obligation as well as Scottish R. O. will create a long-term market for renewables which will be worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010. The Obligation will be the main mechanism by which we will meet our renewables targets and will be underpinned by direct Government funding worth over &#163;260 million between 2001 and 2004. This will include an extensive capital grants programme for the early development of offshore wind and energy crops, the initial stage of a major photovoltaics demonstration programme and a boost for research and development.
<P>

<a name="11113w12.html_para9">Our target is that by 2010, just over 10 per cent. of electricity sales by licensed suppliers will come from sources eligible for the Renewables Obligation. As set out in our recent statutory consultation document, we have proposed that the level of Obligation will increase from year to year as follows.

<a name="11113w12.html_para10">The Obligation will remain in place until 31 March 2027, although to date we have not made any proposals for increasing the target after 2010. This will, however, be reviewed throughout the lifetime of the Obligation in the light of available information on climate change. The target may increase after this time, and this would be effected through an amendment to the Renewables Obligation Order which we aim to put before the House later this year.

<P>
<a name="11113w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement about the recent visit to China of the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson).  [10119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> My recent visit to China focused on promoting the UK aerospace and energy industries.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para4">On aerospace, my agenda was to develop good bilateral relations with the Chinese aviation authorities and airlines&#151;particularly in respect of commending the possible purchase of fifty Airbus narrow-body aircraft by China; promoting UK collaboration on developing a domestic Chinese regional jet and encouraging Chinese airlines to firm up outstanding options on the Airbus A340 large aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce engines. (As you will know, Airbus wings are made in the UK, as are Rolls-Royce engines).
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para5">As elsewhere, we have found that much of the aerospace business we have secured with China in the past has been dependent upon good, long-standing relations at Government level and with the airline and aerospace manufacturing industry.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para6">China is the world's fastest growing aviation market and looks set to continue to grow rapidly over the next 20 years based on the anticipated expansion of the Chinese domestic economy. This will provide many new opportunities for the UK aerospace industry to benefit from both selling to China and entering into profitable industrial collaboration arrangements with the Chinese aerospace industry.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para7">Current prospects in China remain buoyant, despite the aviation downturn in the West. Airbus has just announced that it is expected to deliver eight A318 aircraft to Air China by 2004 and no Chinese airline customers have postponed Airbus aircraft orders since Sept 11.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para8">The opening up of China's vast western regions also offers enormous opportunities for UK companies to benefit in helping China develop its airport and energy infrastructure. During my visit I also encouraged the Chinese authorities to expand their use of UK companies in the development and upgrading of China's airports, building on the recent success by Ove Arup in winning the contract to design the new terminal building at Chongqing.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para9">On the energy side, China's growing market for gas also offers good opportunities for UK companies. The Chinese Government have decided to develop a pipeline from the western region to the industrialised east. A number of major liquified natural gas (LNG) projects are also under way.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para10">I addressed the Beijing Energy Forum, co-chaired by senior officials of the DTI and their Chinese counterparts. The establishment of the Forum was an important development, especially now that natural gas has been ear-marked as a major source of energy for China.




<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2001 : Column: 652W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para11">A newly established China-Britain Natural Gas Working Group will also strengthen links and help to identify opportunities in this area. The Working Group will facilitate the sharing of UK experience and help ensure that the development is both safe and environmentally acceptable. There are four key areas of collaboration&#151;policy creation, gas supply, infrastructure and the utilisation of natural gas in China. The promotion of joint ventures to fill identified capability gaps in China will enable more activity between Chinese and UK businesses.
<P>

<a name="11113w13.html_para12">In Shanghai I launched a new brochure prepared by the British Consulate-General in Shanghai which catalogues current local opportunities for UK companies. The rate of growth in this dynamic region is awesome and the brochure outlines a number of major projects in which British companies could become involved. From my discussions with the Government and Shanghai city authorities it is clear that a higher level of British involvement would be welcomed. One of the major opportunities is presented by BP's involvement in the biggest-ever joint venture in China to build a petrochemicals complex at Caojing, on the outskirts of Shanghai. I held discussions with BP during my visit and asked them to encourage as much British involvement as possible in the supply chain.

<a name="11113w14.html_para4">As part of our work on improving the British gas market the Government published a consultation document on 2 November "A Consultation on Gas Prices and Possible Improvements to Market Efficiency" which considers various concerns made about the gas market. The document also seeks views on the wider benefits to the gas market of increased information flows between the onshore and the offshore following a seminar held with the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association on 10 September. Copies of this document are available from the Department of Trade and Industry website www.dti.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="11113w14.html_para5">There has also been progress with the strategy more generally. In March the EU Commission published proposals for a revised Gas Directive which was a positive step towards greater liberalisation. Interconnector (UK) Ltd now publishes details of flows with a one day lag instead of the previous six week delay. The Government have also been working with IUK and interconnector shippers on improvements to interconnector governance and marketing arrangements. The EU Commission's inquiry into the operation of the interconnector, which was undertaken at the request of the Government, is now reaching its final stages.

 The Department has made no recent estimates of the cost of electricity generated by nuclear power. The last study published in 1995 concluded that the levelised costs of nuclear power were around 3.9p/kWh. Studies suggest that capital costs account for about 70 per cent. of total costs, operating and maintenance costs about 20 per cent. and decommissioning and waste costs about 10 per cent.

 On 1 November 2001, I issued a consultation document in response to Ofgem's reports "The New Electricity Trading Arrangements&#151;Review of the First Three Months" and "Report to the DTI on the Review of the Initial Impact of NETA on Smaller Generators" of 31 August 2001.

<P>

<a name="11113w15.html_para8">The Government believe consolidation services are vital in order to establish and foster smaller generation plant. While consolidation services are now starting to emerge in the market, the Government have proposed establishing a working group of smaller generators, the National Grid Company, BSC (Balancing and Settlement Code) participants, Ofgem, the DTI and DEFRA to look urgently at possible structural or regulatory obstacles to consolidation, including the likely time scale on which competitive consolidation services will emerge. The Government will ask this group to provide an interim report by 24 December 2001, and a final report by 31 January 2001.

 Distribution Charging Arrangements are a matter for Ofgem.

<a name="11113w15.html_para10">Ofgem's recent consultation paper "Embedded generation: price controls, incentives and connection charging&#151;a preliminary consultation document" considers whether there might be an alternative to the payment of "deep" connection charges up-front. This paper is specifically aimed at moving without delay to a workable interim solution, under the existing pricing control and possibly from 1 April 2002. Ofgem have asked for responses to the consultation by 16 November, and I understand it is their intention to produce a summary of responses before the end of the year.

<a name="11113w15.html_para11">Embedded generation offers the prospect of a significant reduction in network losses, but more work is needed to understand the best way to achieve this goal. The distribution price control already contains incentives for distribution network operators (DNOs) to reduce network losses, but work on embedded generation presents new opportunities for achieving significant reductions.
<P>

<a name="11113w15.html_para12">An Embedded Generation Coordinating Group (EGCG) is currently being established to ensure that these issues and the wider recommendations outlined in the Report of the Embedded Generation Working Group into Network Access Issues are addressed in a timely and co-ordinated manner.

We have worked with the UN on the Disarmament Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) programme and to move forward the deployment of UNAMSIL throughout the country. We have maintained close links with regional leaders, especially Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Konare of Mali, to ensure full and successful implementation of the Abuja Agreement.

 It is estimated that there may be many thousands of Russian nuclear and chemical and biological warfare scientists who have lost their jobs or who face the prospect of losing their jobs in the next few years. The possibility that these scientists may sell their skills to foreign regimes is one that the UK takes seriously. To address this, UK funds are directed, through the European Union, to the International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC). The ISTC was set up in 1994, following an agreement signed by the EU, US, Japan and the Russian Federation, to stem the possibility of recruitment of former Soviet scientists by potential proliferators, through the funding of non-weapons related research at former defence institutes.

 <i>[holding answer 12 November 2001]:</i> Currently there is no assessment of clinical outcomes in mental health in the United Kingdom in comparison to other European Union countries.

<P>

<a name="11113w21.html_para1">One is the outcome measurement implementation programme headed by the national director for mental health, Professor Louis Appleby, who has established an expert group of the leading experts in the field of outcome measurement in the UK. They are advising on and overseeing the selection and the pilot implementation of instrumentation for the routine measurement of outcomes for individuals in terms of mortality, morbidity, quality of life and user and carer satisfaction with services. The evidence base for this approach is substantial and drawn from extensive research conducted in the United States of America, Europe and Australia over many years.
<P>

<a name="11113w21.html_para2">The other initiative is the establishment of the new National Institute for Mental Health for England (NIMH(E)) which I announced in July.

It will work with all agencies and interests to develop a co-ordinated programme of research, service development, workforce development and support. NIMH(E) will also generate links with organisations responsible for mental health services in other countries.

 <i>[holding answer 12 November 2001]:</i> As indicated in the mental health policy implementation guide, early intervention in psychosis teams should use either low dose traditional or atypical antipsychotics in first line treatment and they should involve service users in decision making and monitoring of effects. The NHS Plan states that by 2004 all young people who experience a first episode of psychosis, such as schizophrenia, will receive the early and intensive support they need.

<a name="11113w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 At present my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State allocates resources to health authorities. Health authorities then allocate resources to their primary care trusts. In the future, as part of our programme to devolve power to frontline organisations, we intend that the Secretary of State will allocate resources direct to primary care trusts. The National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Bill, currently before Parliament, seeks to give effect to this.

 For staff transferring from health authorities to primary care trusts under Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment (TUPE) Regulations 1981 or by terms reflecting TUPE principles (Transfer Orders), continuity of service will automatically

 There are incentives for all areas of up to &#163;5,000 per eligible general practitioner. Those areas deemed as underdoctored will attract an additional payment of up to &#163;5,000 more per eligible GP.
<P>

<a name="11113w23.html_para1">The primary care trusts/groups eligible for the underdoctored additional payment are those that have fewer than the national median number of GPs (GP principals or equivalent on whole-time equivalent basis) per 100,000 weighted population. The national PCT/G median is 52.695 GPs per 100,000 weighted population, Worthing PCG has 54.35 GPs per 100,000 weighted population and therefore each newly appointed GP will receive up to &#163;5,000.

 Professor Al Aynsley-Green's appointment was announced in July this year, following the publication of the report from the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry. The term "National Director for Healthcare services" originated in a recommendation in that report.
<P>

<a name="11113w24.html_para0">However, Professor Aynsley-Green's role includes chairing the Children's Taskforce, and leading work to develop the Children's National Service Framework. Both of these roles require an overview across health and social care services.

<P>

<a name="11113w24.html_para1">The title of "National Clinical Director for Children" recognises Professor Aynsley-Green's particular expertise as a clinician, but does not limit the type of services in which he takes an interest. This formulation matches that used for many other national directors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department's definition of a significant hospital building development is any capital investment scheme with a total cost of over &#163;25 million. No such publicly funded schemes started construction in 1997 until the private finance initiative began to deliver, with the Dartford and Gravesham scheme in August 1997 and the Carlisle scheme in November 1997. Since 1 May 1997, 64 such schemes have been given approval to proceed under the private finance initiative.
<P>

<a name="11113w24.html_para2">In May 1997, 12 significant publicly funded schemes were in progress, having started construction several years previously. Eight such schemes reached completion during 1997.

 Records relating to Terence MacSwiney have been transferred to the Public Record Office by the Home Office, the Metropolitan Police and the Judge Advocate General's Office. Those that were closed under the guidelines that obtained before the 'Open Government' White paper 1993 (Cm 2290) will now be reviewed by the transferring departments under current guidelines. This is in accordance with standard practice, which is to undertake re-review of specific historical records on request.
<P>

<a name="11113w24.html_para4">Researchers who require access to closed records held by the PRO or to historical records still held by departments should write to the Departmental Record Officer of the department that created the records (or its successor) quoting the PRO reference where this is known. Requests for review of access restrictions are handled in the order in which they are received, regardless of the source of the inquiry or its subject matter. The only exception to this is where the information is urgently required for legal purposes.

 The movement licence provisions were drawn up in close co-operation with the farming industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w25.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 All the activities listed by my hon. Friend are potentially eligible for support under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), either as farm diversification projects or under specific schemes, such as the Organic Farming or Energy Crops Schemes. Encouragement of uptake under the ERDP is being promoted through a variety of routes, including in national and regional media, through the Department's presence at agricultural and similar shows providing the opportunity for direct contact with potential grant recipients, through revised specialist literature, and through the work of partner organisations and others providing business advice to farmers. Some crops grown for energy purposes may alternatively receive support under the Arable Area Payments Scheme.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para1">As far as changes in employment levels are concerned, the ERDP was developed as a significant tool for the long- term regeneration of rural areas and the encouragement of an environmentally sustainable and economically diverse countryside. While the programme does include targets for numbers of jobs sustained or created under some of the measures, the impact of the programme on the rural economy and environment overall is potentially of greater significance than the single indicator of levels of employment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations the Government have received on the level of insurance premiums being demanded of homeowners whose property lies in an area classified as a high flood risk; and if she will make a statement.  [13911]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government maintain close links with the insurance industry to help ensure continued availability of affordable flood cover. Together with the flood defence operating authorities, we are reducing the risk of flooding and are communicating this to the industry. However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para2">The agreement among ABI members is that they will continue to provide flood cover, except in exceptional circumstances, for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure, during 2001 and 2002. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I met the Association of British Insurers on 5 September to discuss our mutual aim of ensuring that affordable flood insurance cover continues to be generally available after December 2002. Further discussions between officials have taken place.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para3">In relation to the concerns expressed by the ABI, the Government are acting to reduce flood risk, through substantial increases in investment in flood and coastal defence (which now totals over &#163;400 million a year). Flood defences are being repaired, renewed, maintained and improved. Flood warning arrangements are continually being improved. The Government have issued strengthened guidance to local planning authorities on control of development in flood risk areas, and are reviewing the financial and institutional arrangements under which the flood defence service is delivered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w25.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the efficacy of the flood risk area analysis, conducted by the Environment Agency; and if she will make a statement.  [13890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No formal assessment has been made by my Department. The Environment Agency flood plain maps are completed on the basis of the best information available. They are indicative only. A party seeking a more specific site related flood risk analysis should seek further, more detailed, local information from the Environment Agency, and/or carry out further investigations to determine the nature and extent of flood risk within a particular area. The maps are continuously improved and updated on an annual basis as better information is gained.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para4">The agency is currently in the process of extending the scope of this mapping to provide an indication of an extreme flood outline for the whole of England and Wales which will give a better indication of the range of potential flood risk in many areas. It is expected that these maps will be published before the end of 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will list the number, value and location of properties newly leased in each of the last five years by his Department, broken down by those leases by the Department itself, its next step agencies and its non-departmental public bodies, differentiating between purchases made as a result of the creation of new bodies and those purchases made by established bodies.  [7822]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Tables of information have been placed in the Library. The tables include details of both the freehold and leasehold accommodation that has been acquired by the former Employment Service (ES) in the last five years. Information about "PRIME leases" taken on by the former Department of Social Security (DSS) is provided from 1 April 1998, as details are currently available only from when the PRIME contract commenced. The PRIME PFI contract transferred the ownership of the former DSS freehold properties and all obligations for leasehold accommodation to our private sector partners Land Securities Trillium.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para5">As modern leases have no intrinsic value as such, the rental cost of the former ES accommodation is given together with the market value of the freehold accommodation where appropriate. For the former DSS, details of the Facilities Price that we pay to Land Securities Trillium for the additional serviced office accommodation that has been taken on is provided. The Facilities Price covers not only the space we occupy but also a large number of building related services such as building management and maintenance, internal and external cleaning, and security.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para6">The only additional accommodation that has been taken on as a result of the creation of a new body is for the Pension Service.
<P>

<a name="11113w25.html_para7">While we have taken on new accommodation in recent years, the flexibility in the PRIME contract has allowed us to reduce overall office space on the former DSS part of the estate from 1,488,701 sq m to approximately 1,300,000 sq m, as at October 2001. Taking the average 2001&#150;02 Facility Price of &#163;182 per square metre, this equates to a saving of approximately &#163;34.34 m per annum.

<P>
<a name="11113w25.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Departmental Central Index (DCI) Data Cleaning Project removed 100,000 surplus duplicate National Insurance numbers (NINOs) from the DCI between April 1997 and March 2001.

 Employers are required to provide employees with access to a stakeholder pension scheme. Employers are not themselves required to set up a pension scheme or to contribute to it.
<P>

<a name="11113w26.html_para0">Regulation of compliance with the requirement for employers to designate a stakeholder pension scheme for their employees will be undertaken by the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra).
<P>

<a name="11113w26.html_para1">The number of employees in companies that have designated stakeholder pensions schemes for their staff is not available. However, figures from the Association of British Insurers show that the end of September this year, 212,242 employers of all sizes had designated stakeholder pension schemes for their workforces.

<P>
<a name="11113w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Stakeholder pensions are designed to be simple. Many pension providers currently offer basic advice within the 1 per cent. annual management charge cap for stakeholder pensions. Additionally, the Financial Services Authority has produced decision trees to assist consumers.

 Shortly after the publication of a Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) report, the local authority concerned is invited to respond to the BFI's findings, giving its proposals for improvement. Where the response indicates that the actions the authority has already taken or plans to take to improve its performance are satisfactory, the Department monitors the performance of the authority through the management information they provide and their performance against Best Value performance indicators.
<P>

<a name="11113w26.html_para2">Where there are continuing concerns, authorities are asked to submit progress reports to ensure that their planned improvements are being implemented and achieved. If it is thought necessary to gain additional assurance that improvements have been implemented, the BFI may be asked to undertake a further inspection.

<P>
<a name="11113w27.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Individual Learning Account (ILA) Centre received five complaints in September 2000. Between 4 September 2000 and 30 September 2001 the ILA Centre received a total of 6,053 complaints. At the end of October, taking account of complaints received direct by the Department, the total number of complaints was 8,448 against a backdrop of 2,529,609 Individual Learning Accounts opened. Around a quarter (2,314) of these related to learning providers not following the rules of the programme correctly. It is important to note that the complaints recorded are wide ranging and include issues such as the ending of the &#163;150 opening offer as well as service provision and providers. The October figure relates to those received at the ILA Centre and by the Department. The table provides a breakdown of this figure by month and cumulatively.

 The Government are committed to tackling age discrimination wherever it is found, and is a signatory of the EU Employment Directive on Equality, which commits the UK to introduce legislation to combat such discrimination in employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006. The Government have asked the Learning and Skills Council&#151;as the body responsible for planning, funding and improving the quality of post-16 learning outside higher education&#151;to promote age diversity and tackle age discrimination when translating its commitment to equality of opportunity into effective strategies and actions. The Employment Service, which operates training programmes including Work Based Learning for Adults, Work Trials and Programme Centres, is committed to equal opportunities and encourages employers to make effective use of the skills, experience and reliability that older people can contribute.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w29.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what changes have been made to the criteria qualifying primary school children for special needs status in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998, <i>(c)</i> 1999, <i>(d)</i> 2000 and <i>(e)</i> 2001.  [13814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 It is for Local Education Authorities and maintained schools to identify and make suitable provision for all children who may have special educational needs in the light of the provisions of Park IV of the Education Act 1996, the Education (Special Educational Needs) Regulations 1994, and the statutory advice contained in the "Code of Practice on the identification and assessment of Special Educational Needs", published in 1994. This situation has remained unchanged between 1997 and 2001. From January 2002 a revised Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, which was approved recently by both Houses of Parliament, amendments to Part IV of the Education Act 1996 brought about by the SEN and Disability Act 2001 and revised Special Educational Needs Regulations will come into effect.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w29.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the funding regime for primary school pupils with special needs status was in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> Shropshire in (i) 1997, (ii) 1998, (iii) 1999, (iv) 2000 and (v) 2001.  [13810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Some special educational needs (SEN) funding is delegated to primary schools by local education authorities (LEAs) in budget shares, with amounts calculated for each school on the basis of factors which measure need either directly or indirectly. Other SEN funding is held centrally by LEAs and spent as required on pupils, for example on extra support for pupils with statements of SEN. This basic pattern has obtained in all five years mentioned, although the proportion of funding held centrally has declined since Fair Funding succeeded Local Management of Schools in 1999. In Shropshire, funding for primary age pupils with statements of SEN was held centrally before 2001, but some is now delegated to schools on the basis of eight bands of need. In 1997 and 1998 SEN funding for pupils with SEN but without statements was based on the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals; from 1999 a further indicator&#151;the number of pupils on the SEN register at stages 2&#150;4 of the SEN Code of Practice&#151;has been used. From 1997 to 2000 schools with SEN units received place-led funding for such units; in 2001 this was subsumed into delegated funding for pupils with statements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11113w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills does not collect data on the cost of internet access. Internet costs are dependant upon the supplier, the bandwidth and the level of service and the cost therefore varies from school to school. However, I can report that the average annual school spend in England, as from January 2001, on ICT for teaching and learning was &#163;8,500 in primary schools and &#163;49,600 in secondary, this compares with averages of &#163;6,800 and &#163;41,800 in January 2000. Substantial progress has been made towards the Government's target for every school to have access to the internet with over 99 per cent. of secondary and 96 per cent. of primary schools connected as of January 2001.

<P>
<a name="11113w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Many local authorities provide funding for nursery education on top of resources the Government make available through direct grant to provide nursery education places. The Government have increased the under 5s sub-block within Education Standard Spending (ESS) by more than the level of inflation which has increased the resources available for this and other purposes. However, it is not possible to identify separately the total amounts spent specifically on three-year-olds.
<P>

<a name="11113w30.html_para4">We have made &#163;390 million of direct grant funding available between 1999&#150;2000 and 2001&#150;02 to help increase the number of three year olds with access to a free early education place from 34 per cent. to 66 per cent. by March 2002.

 Seven proposals were decided by the Secretary of State. The circumstances varied in each case. Some were published by the LEA, or school governors, to address changes in local demand for sixth form places, some featured as part of a wider reorganisation of schools in the area, others arose from the need to rationalise places to deliver more cost effective provision. The remaining six proposals were published after September 1999 and were decided under local decision making arrangements, introduced by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Under these arrangements those publishing or deciding proposals are not required to send details of the background to the proposals to the Department, and we therefore cannot comment on the circumstances leading to these proposals.

 No schools in the state sector are run by private firms. The legal responsibility for running a school rests with the governing body and head teacher, even where they are supported by expertise from the private sector.

 Crossing the threshold gives teachers a substantial and permanent pay increase by moving them to an upper pay scale.

 Verification of threshold assessments involves professional dialogue between heads and assessors about assessment methods and individual applications.
