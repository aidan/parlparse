<a name="20508w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures her Department has taken since 1997 to encourage energy efficiency in <i>(a)</i> the domestic sector, <i>(b)</i> the commercial sector, <i>(c)</i> the industrial sector and <i>(d)</i> the public sector; and how much Government financial support has been made available.  [50433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have introduced a wide range of measures, including market incentives, financial assistance, legal obligations, and guidance and information, to encourage energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) on domestic energy supplies, from 2002 to 2005;
<P>
<BR>
the Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreements;
<P>
<BR>
the UK Emissions Trading Scheme;
<P>
<BR>
the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES)
<P>
<BR>
revised building regulations which require high energy efficiency standards;
<P>
<BR>
the Market Transformation programme;
<P>
<BR>
a wide range of measures to support combined heat and power (CHP);
<P>
<BR>
the Community Energy capital grant programme;
<P>
<BR>
substantial Government funding of the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust to promote and support energy efficiency in the domestic, public, industry and business sectors.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20508w01.html_para0">The majority of DEFRA's financial support for energy efficiency measures is channelled through the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (now marketed as Warm Front), the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme, the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust. The total funding made available by the Department and its predecessors to support and promote these efficiency programmes in each year since 1997 is set out in the table.

<a name="20508w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the Lion Code of Practice and Lion Quality Mark in <i>(a)</i> reducing salmonella levels in egg production and <i>(b)</i> raising overall 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2002 : Column 156W</I><P>
food safety standards; what reference was made to the Lion Quality Scheme in her Department's report entitled "Sustainable Food and Farming&#151;Working Together"; and what plans she has to endorse the British Egg Industry Council's Lion Code of Practice for all eggs sold in the United Kingdom.  [53201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the period since 1998 there has been a significant fall in human salmonellosis in Great Britain and in egg-associated salmonella outbreaks. Lion code producers can be proud of the investment they have made in the Lion Mark scheme, which includes vaccination of flocks against salmonella, good biosecurity measures, registration, and traceability and controls on storage times and temperature that go beyond statutory requirements. We warmly endorse the work they have done on this.
<P>

<a name="20508w01.html_para1">The Sustainable Food and Farming report did not make specific mention of any sectors. The paper indicated where DEFRA and others are taking forward recommendations made by the Policy Commission on Farming and Food, and sought views on what should be done next. I hope that the egg industry will contribute to this exercise.

<a name="20508w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to simplify the administration of milk quotas; and if she will make a statement on the benchmarking in the dairy industry.  [53209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The implementation and administration of the milk quota system is under continuous review. The new Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations, which entered into force on 31 March 2002, will reduce the administrative burden on the industry by removing unnecessary requirements, such as certain deadlines, and liberalising the provisions for the permanent transfer of quota without land.
<P>

<a name="20508w01.html_para2">We support the use of benchmarking by the dairy sector as a useful tool in identifying and promulgating best practice. We have, for example, already supplied the Milk Development Council (MDC) with Farm Business Survey data for farms with dairy enterprises with a view to the MDC setting up on-line interactive data base which would allow dairy farmers to benchmark their businesses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proposals she has to encourage greater co-operation and communication between participants in the dairy supply chain arising from her Department's response to the Milk Task Force report published on 3 January.  [53210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We shall take every opportunity to encourage all parts of the dairy industry to take up the recommendations of the Milk Task Force to improve communications between one another&#151;for example between supermarkets and their suppliers&#151;and to increase co-operative and collaborative activity&#151;for example between processing and production and between dairy farmers. But it for the industry itself to make progress in these important areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proposals she has to introduce tariffs and labelling on wood imports.  [53654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At present we have no plans to introduce tariffs or labels on wood imports. Such controls have, however, been considered as part of a thorough examination of the pros and cons of a variety of courses of action designed to combat illegal logging and to promote the sustainable management of forest overseas.
<P>

<a name="20508w01.html_para3">In the case of tariffs, we are using the current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation under the Doha development agenda to propose a reduction or elimination of tariffs on timber and wood products from sustainably managed sources. This would provide a positive incentive for owners of forests and those in the international timber trade.
<P>

<a name="20508w01.html_para4">When considering mandatory labelling, we were mindful that any action would most likely contravene European Union rules on free trade. Instead we announced in July 2000 that all central Government Departments and agencies would actively seek to buy timber from sustainable and legal sources. Wood products and timber labelled under credible certification schemes will be accepted as meeting this requirement.
<P>

<a name="20508w01.html_para5">We have taken the lead internationally in efforts to combat illegal logging and to promote the sustainable management of forests. We are currently working with partners in the timber trade, the environmental community and with Governments in the timber producing countries. For example, on 18 April the Governments of Indonesia and UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing the two parties to a range of actions to tackle forest law enforcement and governance in Indonesia and the import by UK of illegally logged forest products from Indonesia.
<P>

<a name="20508w01.html_para6">At the forthcoming World Summit, we shall, of course, be aiming to secure further commitment and action on sustainable forest management.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government are taking to ensure that there is parity of support for arable farmers across the UK.  [53424]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Agriculture is a devolved responsibility in the United Kingdom. But support for the arable sector, like many others, is governed by the relevant Common Agriculture Policy regimes which set rates of aid and conditions applicable to all Member States.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she is taking to prevent illegal meat imports.  [53677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have taken a range of initiatives aimed at improving our ability to prevent and detect illegal imports of animal products. These initiatives have been co-ordinated by officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but involve other departments such as HM Customs and Excise and the Food Standards Agency, and the local authorities who are responsible for controls at ports and airports. We have concentrated on raising public awareness of our import rules through our Embassies, and strengthening intelligence gathering and sharing to improve targeting of anti-smuggling measures. We also introduced new posters which are displayed at airports and ports to ensure that travellers are aware of the restrictions on what may be 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2002 : Column 159W</I><P>
imported. On 28 March we published an action plan which is available in the House Libraries. This plan commits Government to a range of measures including completing a risk assessment of disease risks posed by illegal imports of meat. In addition we have enquired into the use of detector dogs and aim to carry out a pilot this summer. These actions are kept under constant review.

<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Ruffley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much post-weaning multisystematic wasting syndrome has added to the production costs of pig meat in the last 12 months.  [53701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Although no independent studies of the economic effects of this disease have been carried out, the economic consequences can be significant. When the disease is present on farm, the mortality rate for weaner pigs appears to increase from around 3 per cent.- 5 per cent. to 5 per cent.-20 per cent. At worst, a continuous 20 per cent. post-weaning mortality rate would increase costs by an estimated &#163;11.00 per 95kg pig sold. This represents 10 per cent.-14 per cent. of the average sale price.
<P>

<a name="20508w02.html_para0">In addition, the Meat and Livestock Commission estimates that some 300,000 pigs that would otherwise have reached slaughter weight have been lost to the disease. Based on this estimate, the loss to the pig industry is some &#163;21 million at the farm gate, around 2.5 per cent. of total annual farm gate value.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the total level of funding required to implement the recommendations of the Policy Commission report on the Future of Farming and Food; and when she plans to begin implementing the report's recommendations.  [54489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Policy Commission estimated that implementing its recommendations would cost approximately &#163;500 million over three years. However, the cost of many of the recommendations would depend upon the precise way in which they were implemented.
<P>

<a name="20508w02.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced on 26 March a series of early actions as a first step towards implementing the report. In the early autumn, after discussion with all of those with an interest in food, farming, the environment and rural areas, the Government will produce a Strategy for Sustainable Food and Farming in England. This will incorporate a definitive response to all of the Policy Commission's recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what forms of financial assistance are available to farmers intending to grow flax; what assessment she has made of the levels of flax production in the UK; what percentage of agriculturally productive land was under flax in the last year for which figures are available; what steps her Department is taking to encourage flax production; and if she will make a statement.  [54490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Flax is eligible for aid under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS). Payments rates vary in different parts of the UK. In England the rate in 2001 was &#163;270.88 per hectare. Aid is also payable on the tonnage of flax fibre produced by an authorised primary processor, the most recent rate being &#163;55.67 per tonne.
<P>

<a name="20508w02.html_para2">Flax production in the UK built up during the early 1990s before falling back again, peaking at just over 20,000 hectares in 1996. In 2001, AAPS aid was claimed for 4,847 hectares of flax in the UK out of a total AAPS claim of 4,511,374 hectares, flax representing 0.1 per cent. of arable agriculturally productive land. The Census total for all agricultural land in the UK, excluding common rough grazing, is 17,323,000 hectares. Flax therefore represents around 0.03 per cent. of all agriculturally productive land.
<P>

<a name="20508w02.html_para3">The Government Industry Forum on Non-Food Crops, set up to evaluate opportunities for non-food crops and provide strategic advice to Government, has commissioned a case study on the potential for UK grown fibre crops in composite materials. We expect this report to be published in the summer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As yet we do not have enough data to enable an analysis of what part the reopening of markets and resumption of livestock movement has played in the number of incidents of bovine TB disclosed in the first quarter of this year. We will continue to monitor the position carefully with the independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB to produce an analysis when sufficient data are available.

 Operational responsibility for flood measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing. I understand that the EA has recently reviewed the extent of their flood alleviation proposals for the Silk Stream and the London borough of Harrow is due to consider the revised scope of the proposals for planning purposes by the end of May. The EA will then be submitting an application for grant to DEFRA which will be considered against our normal economic, technical and environmental criteria and priority score arrangements. Subject to all approvals and contributions being in place, the EA plan to commence works in summer 2003.

 Participation in the National Scrapie Plan is voluntary, and at present it is only those rams which are most susceptible to scrapie which have to be removed from the breeding flock (either by slaughter or castration). It is normal farming practice to remove rams that are not required for breeding, and the plan allows sheep farmers to take susceptibility to scrapie into account in this process. The market provides a return for rams that are removed, and the Government have no plans for a subsidy to top up this return. Decisions on the financial arrangements for any future schemes under the National Scrapie Plan will be taken in full consultation with stakeholders.

<P>

<a name="20508w05.html_para10">Part of the Government's strategy of encouraging energy efficiency through the Climate Change Levy (CCL) has been to move the burden of tax from 'goods' such as jobs to 'bads' such as pollution. The Government is committed to making Britain one of the most competitive environments for business in the world, which is demonstrated, for example, by the fact that the overall tax burden in the UK is much lower than the EU average. It is also important to consider the less-easily quantifiable costs on operating a business, such as employment regulation.
<P>

<a name="20508w05.html_para11">The climate change levy is small in proportion to total energy costs, and energy costs themselves are only a small proportion of total business costs. All sectors can reduce the impact of the levy on their costs by improving energy efficiency, and taking advantage of the available incentives.

<P>
<a name="20508w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The additions to the defence budget in 2001&#150;02 from the reserve cover a number of heads, including the &#163;252 million for the campaign against international terrorism. Final outturn figures for expenditure in 2001&#150;02 are not yet available, but they are expected to show that most of the sum to which my right hon.

<P>
<a name="20508w07.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The contract for the development and production of the A400M was signed on 18 December 2001, but its activation was subject to the German Government obtaining Bundestag funding approval. This was achieved in late March. The participating nations are in the process of implementing a jointly agreed mechanism designed to activate the contract at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="20508w07.html_para1">We expect that design work on the A400M will be completed by mid 2005. However, the progressive completion of the design will allow the manufacture of some major components to begin in 2004. Assembly of the first A400M aircraft is expected to begin in 2006.

 <i>[holding answer 25 April 2002]:</i> It is common practice for the Secretary of State for Defence to respond to letters addressed personally to him from members of the royal family and Members of Parliament who are fellow Privy Councillors. Letters from other hon. Members would normally be delegated to the responsible junior Minister for reply, although there will be some exceptions to this rule. Similarly, letters from Her Majesty's lords-lieutenant would normally be delegated to the responsible junior Minister or his private secretary. Letters from others will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Most will receive an official response, but some will receive a response from a Minister or one of his private secretaries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w07.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> The potential for the issue of mistaken taxation of service invaliding pensions to apply to the Royal Navy and RAF as well as the Army was identified only very recently. Work is continuing to identify the extent of the error and I am therefore unable at present to provide numbers of affected RN and RAF pensioners. The total cost of the tax refunds to be paid will not be known until this work has been completed. No widow(er)s are directly affected as all widow(er)s' pensions under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme are taxable, regardless of whether their spouse was in receipt of an attributable pension. Some may, however, be affected indirectly as beneficiaries of a pensioner's will.

 Certain non-service personnel may be accommodated on Ministry of Defence bases in view of their duties or connection with the MOD, by authority of Defence Council Instructions. Commanding officers also have discretion to allow personnel to invite non-service personnel to stay in MOD accommodation, and to apply suitable rules. No requirements for periods of notice, or notification to the security services, are laid down centrally.

Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) in which I referred to contracts having been placed with private sector providers to help return personnel to fully deployable status.

For the long term, in announcing recently the outcome of the quinquennial review of our medical agencies on 11 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 556&#150;57W, we stated that while developing and strengthening our relationship with the NHS, we would also make use of private sector healthcare providers as necessary.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> During the last five years, businesses in the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency have received over &#163;148,000 investment via the enterprise grant scheme and SMART/SPUR awards on capital investment of over &#163;600,000. This has contributed, along with other Government policies and the work of Government agencies such as the Small Business Service, to a 38 per cent. fall in the number of unemployment benefit claimants in the constituency since May 1997. Constituents will also have benefited from the introduction of the national minimum wage, which has helped an estimated 230,000 people across the north- west region.

 The Export Control Bill provides new powers allowing for the imposition of controls on trade from one overseas country to another, intangible technology transfers and the provision of technical assistance overseas. The Bill allows for these controls to be imposed in relation to military, paramilitary and dual-use goods or technology. The new powers will be used to strengthen the UK's domestic export control law, which at present allows only for controls of tangible exports from the UK. In particular, the new power on trade in controlled goods will be used to introduce controls on trade in all military equipment already subject to export control, and also to control, and in effect prohibit, trade in arms to embargoed destinations and trade in equipment used for torture to any destination.
<P>

<a name="20508w11.html_para9">The Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, as announced to Parliament on 26 October 2000, will continue to be the basis for licence decision-making under the Export Control Bill. Before taking a decision on an export licence under the Consolidated Criteria, Ministers take into account all reliable information about end-users of potential concern, including reporting from other Government Departments and UK posts overseas. The Government will not issue a licence where there is a clear risk that the equipment could be used for internal repression or international aggression, or where there is an unacceptable risk of diversion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what his most recent annual estimate is of the accrued amount of benefits overpaid due to <i>(a)</i> customer error, <i>(b)</i> official error and <i>(c)</i> fraud if the cases where there was (i) high and (ii) low suspicion of fraud were well founded.  [45252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w15.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our most recent estimate is that the total amount of benefits overpaid due to customer error and official error taken together is around &#163;1 billion and the total amount due to fraud is around &#163;2 billion. These are broad order estimates. They are made up of estimates from the continuously measured benefits (income support and jobseeker's allowance), from National Benefit Reviews and from estimated levels of loss in the unmeasured benefits.
<P>

<a name="20508w15.html_para3">Estimates of high and low suspicion fraud have been provided for most of the benefits reviewed. The Department has, however, tightened its approach to recording such cases since the earlier reviews of the 1990s and now makes much greater effort to resolve cases either way.
<P>

<a name="20508w15.html_para4">Further information on the handling of suspicion of fraud in the benefit review process is in The Results of the Area Benefit Review and the Quality Support Team from April 2000 to March 2001, Fraud and Error in Claims for Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance, a copy of which is in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many cases there were and what the value of cases was where his Department had deemed that there was <i>(a)</i> high and <i>(b)</i> low suspicion that an overpayment in (i) housing benefit, (ii) jobseeker's allowance and (iii) income support was made due to fraud, but where that suspicion was eventually cleared altogether, in the years (A) 1998&#150;99, (B) 1999&#150;2000 and (C) 2000&#150;01.

 The information is not available for housing benefit.
<P>

<a name="20508w15.html_para5">We do not have complete information on the number of cases in the Area Benefit Review process which were initially thought to be suspicious between 1998 and 2001. However, analysis of the data we hold from this period provides information on the proportions of high suspicion cases resulting in different outcomes. The analysis indicates that 42 per cent. of those initially deemed 'high suspicion' and subjected to a full further investigation, were found not to require or merit a change to benefit in payment. The corresponding proportion by monetary value is 49 per cent. A further 26 per cent. (21 per cent. by value) were found to be fraudulent. In the remaining 32 per cent. of cases (30 per cent. by value) it was not possible to prove that fraud had occurred, but a strong suspicion remained. It is this final category which is reported as high suspicion in the National Statistics reports "The Results of the Area Benefit Review and the Quality Support Team, Fraud and Error in Claims for Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance".
<P>

<a name="20508w15.html_para6">Low suspicion cases are not subjected to further investigation and are not, therefore, liable to be re-categorised. Since October 2001, in order to streamline data collection processes, the Department no longer records low suspicion as the information is of limited value.

<a name="20508w16.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 I am aware of the impact that accounting and audit requirements can have on parish councils as a consequence of complying with the Accounts and Audit Regulations 1996. For this reason, last year we increased the income threshold, below which local councils are subject to the least onerous accounting regime, from &#163;5,000 to &#163;50,000. In addition, the Audit Commission has introduced a new 'lighter touch' audit framework for local councils, with the aim of making the audit process simpler and therefore cheaper. The new regime should result in lower audit costs for most small councils.

<a name="20508w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> Planning decisions are based upon the land-use merits of each proposal; an assessment must be made of the impact of the proposed development on amenity. Each planning case is likely to have a unique set of relevant facts, and the courts are final arbiters of what is material. The Department's advice on materiality is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 1 (PPG1), "General Policy and Principles".

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w16.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Stewart Group's report on mobile phones and health suggested that the appointment of an ombudsman would help with planning decisions on siting of base stations, for example, where agreement could not be reached locally. The Government's response to the report made clear that while the Government are sympathetic to the objectives of the proposal, it feels there are better ways of achieving them, bearing in mind that there is no comparable arrangement in relation to other kinds of development. The role of an ombudsman would not sit comfortably with the existing appeal process within the planning system.
<P>

<a name="20508w16.html_para4">As regards siting, the Government's view is that the objectives are met by the planning process. When considering applications for new development, local planning authorities consult local people and take their views into account in making decisions. Where an authority refuses an application the developer can appeal to the Secretary of State. Pre-applications discussions with authorities and with local people also have an important part to play, providing opportunities to explore alternative approaches to the siting and appearance of masts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I have been advised by the board of London Regional Transport that London Underground Ltd. has today signed public-private partnership contracts to modernise and maintain London Underground's infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para1">There are three contracts, which will each run for 30 years. Those for two of the infrastructure companies will go to Metronet, and the third to the Tube Lines Group.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para2">In my statement to the House on 7 February I set out why the Government supported London Transport's decision that it was minded to proceed with the tube modernisation plans. The Government have consistently set out three key tests that the plans must pass if they are to proceed: that they are not a privatisation; that they should offer value for money; and that they should be safe for both passengers and staff.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para3">I am satisfied that the modernisation plans are not a privatisation. The ownership of the assets, and the operation of the public service, stay in the public sector. It is also likely that the assets will continue to be scored on London Underground's balance sheet, in the public sector.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para4">I am also satisfied that the arrangements offer value for money, when judged against alternative proposals. At my request, Ernst and Young reviewed London Underground's original value for money assessment and confirmed that, overall, London Underground's methodology for assessing value for money was robust, and that London Underground's recommendation that the PPP proposals deliver value for money, while subjective, was supported by its analysis. Since then, Ernst and Young has reviewed the work done by London Underground to update the value for money assessment in respect of material changes to the contracts. They confirmed that London Underground's approach was consistent with that used for the previous report. I have placed a copy of their update in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para5">The Health and Safety Executive has still to reach a final judgment on London Underground's revised Railway Safety Case. The position therefore remains that the tube modernisation plans will only proceed if the independent regulator accepts the safety arrangements for both passengers and staff.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para6">Subject to approval of the safety case, I share London Regional Transport's belief that the modernisation plans are the right solution and offer significant benefits for Londoners.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para7">Fares will continue to be set by the Mayor of London. The modernisation plans do not require fares to rise faster than inflation.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para8">The three contracts are intended to take effect by the summer. I notified Parliament on 20 March that I was considering issuing a comfort letter in support of each of 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2002 : Column 216W</I><P>
the contracts. My intention is that such comfort letters should be issued shortly before the transactions are completed.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para9">London Regional Transport's decision has been taken in the light of an extensive consultation with Transport for London. London Regional Transport has accepted some of the points Transport for London has made, and made changes to the contracts accordingly.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para10">I fully support the decision taken today by the board of London Regional Transport and look forward to the modernisation plans coming into operation.
<P>

<a name="20508w17.html_para11">It remains my intention that the ownership of London Underground will be transferred to Transport for London as soon as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions for what reason the law compelling children on school coaches to wear seat belts does not apply to children on double decker buses when those buses are being used for school transport; and if he will make a statement.  [53828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The design of many of these bus types makes it technically difficult for them to be fitted with adequate seat belts. Also, the types of passenger journeys on these vehicles are such that the need for belts and the likelihood of their being used are less than on faster long-distance journeys. We would expect the service provider to take into account the type of vehicle and provision of seat belts when specifying the vehicle for the service.

practice of foreign airliner wet-leasing by United Kingdom airlines on the economic well-being of the domestic aviation industry; what representations he has received about the practice of foreign airliner wet-leasing by United Kingdom airlines; what proposals he has to introduce regulations to restrict wet-leasing of aircraft; and if he will make a statement.  [54690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Aircraft leasing by UK airlines is governed by European Community law. My Department continuously monitors wet-leasing applications to ensure compliance with Community law, including the requirement that UK airlines do not become excessively dependent on aircraft registered outside the European Economic Area. There are currently eleven passenger and thirteen freighter aircraft wet-leased to UK carriers for periods approaching a traffic season, of which five passenger and eleven freighter aircraft are registered outside the EEA. Five of these aircraft are in process of transfer to the UK register.
<P>

<a name="20508w19.html_para1">My Department's Transparent Procedures for handling leasing applications include provisions whereby interested parties can make representations about individual applications both to the Civil Aviation Authority and to my Secretary of State. In addition my Department receives regular correspondence on the subject of wet-leasing. I consider that the ability to wet-lease foreign registered aircraft within the constraints of Community law enhances the operational efficiency of UK airlines and contributes to the economic well-being of the UK aviation industry. I have no plans to pursue regulations, which could only be introduced at Community level, to place further restrictions on wet-leasing by UK airlines.

We are very glad to have had the committee's thinking on more integrated arrangements for transport safety, for which there are arguments meriting careful consideration. We have taken the view that the emphasis in the first place should be on getting in place the new Rail Accident Investigation Branch and the new Rail Industry Safety Body. But we will then be returning to the question of new cross-modal safety arrangements, and considering further the views expressed by the committee and by others.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w20.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10. We need to nip early offending in the bud and reinforce young people's sense of personal responsibility for their behaviour. Timely intervention can make a difference and most young people of that age are mature enough to know the difference between right and wrong, to take responsibility for their behaviour and to cope with the operation of criminal law.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2002 : Column 223W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20508w20.html_para0">The Government's youth justice reforms ensure that young offenders receive appropriate interventions to make them understand and take responsibility for their offending behaviour, and are subject to programmes which directly tackle the causes of their offending.

 There is no immediate intention to strengthen legislation relating to illegal hare coursing or to increase relevant fines. The police and the courts already have extensive powers and substantial penalties available to them in dealing with this issue.




<P>

<a name="20508w20.html_para1">Depending upon the exact circumstances the police may be able to arrest alleged offenders and a court may have the capacity to order forfeiture of vehicles used in committing or facilitating an offence.
<P>

<a name="20508w20.html_para2">Offences relevant to the disorder sometimes associated with illegal hare coursing are contained in the Public Order Act 1986. They include, for example, an offence of intentionally using threatening, abusing or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress. There is also the more serious offence of violent disorder which carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the level of street crime in each Metropolitan Police division between January and March in each year from 1997 to 2002.  [52334]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 April 2002]:</i> The Home Office did not collect borough figures prior to April 1999 and does not publish monthly or quarterly statistics. The Home Office will publish national statistics for the year 2001&#150;02 in the summer in its crime bulletin. The Metropolitan police have already published figures for this period, which are available on its website. The table contains figures for total recorded robberies (including robberies of personal property and business property) in London boroughs for 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20508w20.html_para4">The Metropolitan police force area is one of the 10 areas included in the Government's wider street crime initiative, which involves a concerted response to street crime across all the criminal justice and social agencies.
<P>

<a name="20508w20.html_para5">The 10 Force Street Crime initiative began in April 2002 across the 10 force areas with the biggest robbery problem. The police and criminal justice agencies are working together in these areas to target and fast-track all street crime offenders. The initiative also brings together the resources and expertise of non-criminal justice system agencies to help tackle the causes of street crime and take preventative action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There is no restriction on police officers crossing police boundaries when pursuing suspected criminals. Guidance issued to police forces by the Association of Chief Police Officers advises that when police officers cross boundaries in such circumstances they should hand over the pursuit as soon as possible to the police force whose area they have crossed into.

 We have not made a detailed assessment of the costs of introducing a certification regime for air weapons, but as there are an estimated 4 million air weapons in circulation it is clear that the resource implications for police firearms licensing departments would be very substantial.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Tackling antisocial behaviour calls for a cross-Government approach. Among the many actions we are taking are the introduction of community safety officers and measures in the Police Reform Bill to enhance the effectiveness of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs). We are also consulting on further measures to deal with the problems of antisocial tenants and of abandoned vehicles.

<a name="20508w21.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The total cost, met from an award from the Cabinet Office Invest to Modernise fund, was &#163;715,000. All staff should have been trained within the next two to three years.

 Support from the prison service has largely been advisory for this staff support network. A small amount of funding (less than &#163;2,000) has been given towards the cost of leaflets and posters.

 During the year 1999&#150;2000 there were 374,686 recorded thefts and attempted thefts of motor vehicles in England and Wales and 338,796 during 2000&#150;01. The information available does not distinguish between cars and other motor vehicles.
<P>

<a name="20508w21.html_para0">The Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) was set up in September 1998 to develop and oversee the implementation of initiatives to meet the Government's target to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years. They published their proposals for achieving the target on 22 September 1999.
<P>

<a name="20508w21.html_para1">The main proposals include improved security on new and used cars; improved car park security; better policing and community responses which target prolific offenders and crime hotspots; and new procedures at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 took forward VCRAT recommendations for regulation of the motor salvage industry and controls on the supply of vehicle number plates and we expect to implement these provisions progressively between August 2002 and April 2003.

 The prison population has risen considerably, and on 30 April 2002 was provisionally estimated at 70,578, an increase of 7.5 per cent. (nearly 5,000 prisoners) on the number held in April 2001. Because of the urgent need to provide additional accommodation at existing prisons, including Albany, applications for planning clearance have had to be submitted under the special urgency procedure of Department of the Environment Circular 18/84 which gives the local planning authority 14 days from the date of receipt to submit any comments.
<P>

<a name="20508w21.html_para2">Planning clearance was requested on 11 April 2002 from the Isle of Wight council for the construction of Albany prison of one, two storey 40-place ready to use unit with a single storey ancillary building, within the secure perimeter of the prison. The council advised us on 24 April 2002 that their Development Control Committee had resolved to raise no objection to the proposal. The Prison Service will be writing separately to the hon.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> The Government condemn all acts of racism, anti-Semitism and religious intolerance. We are fully committed to tackling these manifestations of a vile hatred. That is why we extended the scope of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to cover religiously as well as racially aggravated offences and why we increased the maximum penalty for inciting racial hatred from two to seven years imprisonment. The investigation of race hate crime is also

 The Home Office made an extra &#163;250,000 available to the National Criminal Intelligence Service in 2000&#150;01 to fund additional staff for the Economic Crime Branch, which handles suspicious transaction reports. The extra funding was increased to &#163;1.8 million last year and will continue this year. The National Criminal Intelligence Service increased the staffing of the branch from 24 in August 2000 to 66 in December 2001, and a further increase of up to 20 staff is planned for 2002&#150;03.

 We will put in place arrangements for all prisoners to have access to a full assessment of learning needs on reception and a supporting individual learning plan. In the longer term we want to make the transfer of records of individual achievement from prison to prison more efficient as part of a wider strategy to support effective management information systems through information technology. This should eradicate the need for prisoners to be re-assessed before of after they are transferred to a new establishment within a reasonable timescale.

 All prisoners are offered a basic skills screening test at reception. We plan to improve initial assessment by introducing a greater range of diagnostic tests and are piloting computer-based initial assessment in basic skills for juveniles in selected young offender institutions and secure units.
<P>

<a name="20508w24.html_para0">We are widening education targets at national and establishment level to enable prisons to be more flexible in responding to the learning needs of their population. Prison education is now covered by the Adult Learning Inspectorate, which will monitor teaching and training standards to ensure they meet the needs of learners and enable them to progress. Under the Basic Skills Quality Initiative, all establishments will be supported in producing an action plan for delivering basic skills. We will also provide training to instructors and prison officers to enable them to support prisoners' educational needs.

 The case of Siham Suleiman Moussa Qandah and her family was brought to our attention recently by several MPs and by the NGO Christian Solidarity Worldwide. The Jordanian authorities are also aware of our interest in the case. I am very concerned about the unfortunate and distressing situation. The UK is committed to the promotion and protection of religious freedom, and condemns instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief. The case of Siham Suleiman Moussa Qandah is a complex one and I am seeking further information from our embassy in Amman and from Christian Solidarity Worldwide. Our embassy has already been in touch with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the case. We will need to ensure that any action we take is not counter-productive to the needs of the individuals concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent assessment she has made of whether the target for the reduction of running costs as a proportion of the departmental expenditure limit between 1999&#150;2000 and 2001&#150;02 will be met on time.  [47255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w27.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Latest estimates suggest that departmental running costs in 2001&#150;02 represented 2.291 per cent. of the departmental expenditure limit, compared with 2.526 per cent. in 1999&#150;2000. This means we will have exceeded the target to reduce running costs as a proportion of DEL by 4.5 per cent. These figures exclude transfers to the Department following machinery of Government changes in the wake of the general election on 7 June 2001.

 I am pleased to announce the publication of (a) the post consultation report for the Green Paper "Towards Effective Enforcement&#151;A Single Piece of Bailiff Law and Regulatory Structure for Enforcement", and (b) the summary of responses following the consultation paper on distress for rent procedures.
<P>

<a name="20508w28.html_para0">The Green Paper, published on 9 July 2001, invited comments on the structure for the regulation of enforcement services, a single piece of bailiff law, fees, information and data sharing and a partial regulatory impact assessment. The 84 respondents came from a wide variety of groups concerned with enforcement, including local authorities, public interest groups and enforcement agents. Consultation showed overwhelming support for most of the proposals in the Green Paper. Copies of both documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="20508w28.html_para1">Delivery will require a legislative opportunity. We intend to publish a White Paper early next year bringing together proposals on both civil enforcement (including regulation of all enforcement agents) and distress for rent.

<a name="20508w28.html_para2">My noble Friend Baroness Scotland of Asthal QC today launched the publication 'National Standards for Enforcement Agents'. The 'National Standards' identifies duties and responsibilities which creditors and their enforcement agents share. It has been warmly welcomed and endorsed by the enforcement profession.

In 1999&#150;2000 one NHS trust recorded expenditure on HIV/ AIDS within the speciality genito-urinary medicine. However, in 2000&#150;01 the trust reclassified this expenditure and recorded it within the speciality infectious diseases. This accounts for an approximate decrease of &#163;17 million in 2000&#150;01 and also demonstrates that recording of expenditure on genito-urinary medicine can vary from year to year.<P>

 During the early years of implementation of the diabetes national service framework (NSF) we would expect the majority of available resources to be directed towards improvements in treatment for those people with diabetes who have not received systematic high quality treatment in the past.

 There is a world-wide increase in end stage renal failure, although the number of new patients in England still falls behind other European countries. The principal causes of end stage renal failure include diabetes and hypertension, and the effects of increasing age. As the incidence of diabetes and hypertension (which are both major risk factors) increase so does the number of people who develop renal complications. People with diabetes make up 16 per cent. of all new patients with end stage renal failure. Additionally people from ethnic minority groups are at greater risk of developing the disease and the number of patients being treated in these groups is rising as the ethnic population ages.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the building projects under construction; and what coolant will be used for the building services water chilling system for such projects.  [52052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20508w32.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A list of building schemes currently under construction and with a total cost of over &#163;2.5 million, including VAT, is given in the table. Information on the coolant used in building services chilled water systems is not collected centrally. However, all refrigerants used in chilled water systems should comply with EC Regulation EC 2037&#150;2000 which came into force on 1 October 2000. The NHS Estates Model Engineering Specification Rev 3 November 1997, MES C10 Refrigerant Plant&#151;General advises the use of refrigerant R134a or 407c and its associated blends, which are ozone friendly.

 The 1998 public service agreement set targets for efficiency and other value for money gains in departmental operations for 1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. Information about progress on meeting this PSA target was published in the Department's 2001 departmental report, a copy of which is in the Library. This recorded that we were on course to deliver the target.
