<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many of the Higher Education Bill's <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;clauses and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;schedules were (i) debated, (ii) partially debated and (iii) not debated during the recent committee stage.  [162988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;March 2004]</i>: 25 clauses of the bill were formally debated during Committee Stage. Debates over fourteen sessions were both wide-ranging and detailed. Debate on the fees provisions lasted for seven committee sessions, and ensured a very full exploration of the Government's policy on tuition fees. A similarly long debate on the Government's proposal to establish an Office for Fair Access lasted for three Committee sessions. 25 clauses and seven schedules were not debated. Among the clauses not debated are 10 clauses that cover technical, interpretative or commencement provisions. The wide-ranging discussion on several clauses meant that the debates touched on a number of issues associated with later clauses that were not formally reached.
<P>

<a name="40325w01.html_para0">In order to ensure that the policies and legislation in the Higher Education Bill were debated in detail, the Government encouraged the extension of several Committee sessions into the evening and added an extra day to the time allotted for Committee stage.

 The objectives of the British-led Provincial Reconstruction Team are to help the Afghan Transitional Authority extend its influence, to stimulate the development of Security Sector Reform and the reconstruction effort and so to facilitate the development of a stable and secure environment in the Afghan regions. We have no plans to revise these objectives.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w04.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The engines on HMS Albion have proved to be extremely reliable in service. There have only been a small number of defects, none of them significant. While there have been defects affecting the supporting cooling systems and electrical control systems, these have been rectified by the shipbuilder and the systems have generally performed to a level consistent with any First of Class vessel entering service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w04.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Triumph will begin her refit in summer 2005, as originally planned. She arrived in Devonport at the end of January 2004 and her further operation will not be possible until essential refuelling and safety justification work has been undertaken. Once HMS Talent, currently in refit, vacates her dock, the dock-dependent refit work on HMS Triumph will begin. In the meantime, to make optimum use of the facilities and resources at the dockyard, the Department is seeking to reduce the overall length of the refit by identifying that work which is not dependent on a dry dock and may be undertaken ahead of the main refit and refuelling work. In addition, a reduced ship's company, in conjunction with dockyard employees, will conduct trials to inform the content of the refit package.

 There are currently two operational Royal Navy aircraft carriers, HMS Invincible and HMS Ark Royal. HMS Ark Royal is currently operational, but will be moved to a state of extended readiness from April 2004. HMS Illustrious will return to operational service in 2005 following a period in refit.

 The February 2003 Energy White Paper "Towards a Low Carbon Economy" defines the Government's overall strategy for energy policy. Its four core objectives&#151;cutting carbon emissions, maintaining reliability of energy supplies, promoting competitive markets to promote productivity and sustainable growth, ensuring every home is adequately and affordably heated&#151;apply and will deliver benefits in Scotland as elsewhere. I take part in the work of the sustainable energy policy network in following through on the White Paper commitments. Scottish Executive Ministers are closely associated with this work.
<P>

<a name="40325w05.html_para2">Core aspects of energy policy and related issues of competition and regulation are reserved. Devolved policy responsibilities in Scotland include promotion of renewables and of energy efficiency. Co-operation in devolved policy areas including planning, environmental protection, encouraging economic development and a skilled work force is crucial to the success of energy policy in Scotland. Good working relations at all levels between the Scottish Executive and UK Government Departments are therefore especially important.

In addition to a public consultation on the future role of further education and an analysis of course provision, enrolments and performance by the 16 local further education colleges, new research was commissioned by DEL to supplement existing information on the work of the colleges. This new research addressed: the qualifications of further education staff; the qualifications of 16&#150;19 year olds entering full-time education; the contribution of further education to economic development; and, an evaluation of the current funding mechanism. The findings of this considerable body of information were augmented further by a number of study visits aimed at evaluating best practice in vocational education.

The combined floor space of the two new offices amounts to some 32,000 sq ft in comparison.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w08.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In encouraging entrepreneurial attitudes among young people, the DTI has supported Enterprise Insight in developing a national campaign to promote enterprise to young people and to those who influence them (including teachers, careers advisers etc). This campaign will have as its focal point an annual Enterprise Week, the first of which will be from 15 to 21&nbsp;November this year. Enterprise Week will include national and regional activities and celebrations of entrepreneurial achievement.

<a name="40325w08.html_para4">The DTI is also working closely with the DfES and the Treasury in taking forward the recommendations of the Davies Review. From 2005&#150;06 all Key Stage 4 pupils will receive the equivalent of five days enterprise activity, which develops enterprise capability&#151;innovation, creativity, risk-management and risk-taking, and financial and business understanding. 151 Enterprise Pathfinder projects were launched last September, covering nearly 400 secondary schools in England, from which DfES will derive guidance for all schools prior to launching the &#163;60&nbsp;million enterprise education entitlement in September 2005. A second wave of Pathfinders will start in September 2004.
<P>

<a name="40325w08.html_para5">The two Departments are also supporting the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship. Building on existing good practice, the aims of the Council will be to raise the profile of entrepreneurship and starting a business as a career option within Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), including both universities and other higher education establishments, with the objective of increasing the numbers of students and graduates who give serious thought to this. It will therefore work with all interested parties to encourage and create an entrepreneurial culture among students and graduates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Under the Communications Act 2003, Ofcom was given a duty to set general conditions for service providers to provide information about services standards and customer rights. Under Ofcom's General Conditions of Entitlement, Internet service providers must provide a consumer code of practice that will set out clear information about the company they are dealing with, what they offer, what policies are in place (e.g. in relation to disconnections, payment, billing etc.), how to contact them, how to complain and how to go to an alternative dispute body.
<P>

<a name="40325w08.html_para9">The Communications Act 2003 also gave Ofcom a duty to promote media literacy. As part of Ofcom's strategy for the promotion of media literacy they will be encouraging Internet service providers to offer advice and guidance to customers, particularly in relation to the protection of young people from harmful content and services delivered on the Internet. In addition, Ofcom propose to direct people to information provided by other stakeholders when looking for information to control their and their children's activities online.

<P>
<a name="40325w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The regulation of Internet service providers is the responsibility of Ofcom. Under the Communications Act 2003 Ofcom have put in place a range of general conditions which improve the accountability of all communications providers, including ISPs, to their customers. For example all communications providers now have to establish alternative dispute resolution procedures for handling complaints made by their customers.

<P>

 The Al-Ghawar oil field is estimated to have production capacity of around five million barrels of oil per day, approximately 6&nbsp;per cent. of global oil production.
<P>

<a name="40325w09.html_para0">My Department keeps abreast of the various studies looking at the sustainability of output from Al-Ghawar, and Saudi Arabia more generally. Although production from the Al-Ghawar field may slowly decline in future years, Saudi Aramco is confident that replacements from other giant oil fields mean that oil production from Saudi Arabia can be sustained at current levels, and higher if necessary, for several decades.

 The imperative to maximise the economic benefit, and the consequent contribution to energy security of supply, from the UK's oil and gas reserves applies whatever the oil price. Working with PILOT, the Government-industry forum, we aim to ensure that the North Sea's oil and gas reserves are fully exploited, for example by attracting new entrant oil companies and improving the recovery from existing fields.

 <i>[holding answer 17&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> No public funds have been spent on the Channel Tunnel itself. The Treaty of Canterbury, signed on 12&nbsp;February 1986, specifically prohibits any public finance for this infrastructure. The connecting road and rail infrastructure has been developed with Government support. However, in the UK the bulk of this is in the form of guaranteed bonds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Transport Research Laboratory's Research Project Report 214, "The Effectiveness of Child Cycle Training Schemes" has shown that cycle training is effective, with trained children found to be significantly safer than untrained children when knowledge and skills were tested two years after training. The research also identified that better performing cycling schemes involve on-road training, staged courses spread out over a number of weeks, and a problem solving or cycling awareness approach to learning.
<P>

<a name="40325w10.html_para5">There is no longer a single official cycle proficiency test. Local authorities adopt different practices when running cycle training schemes according to how they believe they can best deliver safer cycling locally. But we understand that many local authorities currently base their cycle training on the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents' guidelines for the management and operation of practical cyclist training schemes.
<P>

<a name="40325w10.html_para6">The Department is currently working with the National Cycling Strategy Board for England to develop a comprehensive promotion of cycling to school.

<a name="40325w11.html_para1">The Department has not provided any direct funding to London boroughs for transport improvements following the creation of TfL, which is now responsible for allocating borough capital funding. Boroughs, however, do use some of their Revenue Support Grant allocation from the Office of Deputy Prime Minister to fund routine highway maintenance works, concessionary fare provision, and other local transport planning and management activities.

 Powered wheelchairs and powered scooters are designed to provide independent mobility for people with a physical disability. Their use is governed by The Use of Invalid Carriages on Highways Regulations 1988 (SI 1988 No.2268). There are two classes of powered vehicle: class 2 vehicles are restricted to 4 mph (6.4 kph) and are designed to be used on footways; class 3 vehicles are restricted to 4 mph (6.4 kph) on the footway and 8mph (12.8kph) on the carriageway.
<P>

<a name="40325w11.html_para3">The vehicles are treated for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act as not being motor vehicles and are, therefore, outside the scope of most requirements of road vehicle construction regulations. Users do not need a driving licence and are not subject to a test.
<P>

<a name="40325w11.html_para4">The speed of 8 mph (12.8 kph) was set following consultation with disability organisations, industry and road safety groups and was intended to provide a balance between the needs of the users for local outdoor mobility and road safety concerns both for the users and for others on the road. We are currently reviewing the regulations and we will be holding a wide-ranging consultation later this year on a range of issues including speed limits.

<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how badger fecundity changes where food supplies are freely available, irrespective of population density.  [158361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Badger fecundity is positively correlated with autumn body condition. In environments where food is plentiful, such as south and south-west England, a badger social group may produce several litters each year. Alternatively, in poorer environments, such as upland areas of Scotland, only one litter may be produced per social group per year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether population stress in specific badger social groups triggers migration.  [158365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Movements of badgers between social groups is a natural phenomenon. However, rates of movement may differ relative to population density, among other factors. It is generally believed that badgers move between social groups more frequently in lower density and disturbed populations.

<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her best estimate is of the effect on the competitiveness of British dairy products compared with those of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Ireland, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;France and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;other European Union member states arising from the additional cost borne exclusively by UK farmers as a result of bovine TB.  [158369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are too many variables to be assessed, for instance, industry structures, fluctuation in /euro rates and uncertainty about the real economic effects of TB on the average dairy business in Great Britain, to allow for a realistic estimate of effects on competitiveness to be made.
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para3">The cost of TB to farmers in Great Britain is currently being assessed. Defra has commissioned Reading University to carry out research into the economic impacts of TB and alternative control policies in Great Britain. A report is expected shortly and a summary of the findings will be published on the Defra website in due course.

<a name="40325w12.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the findings from the Krebs reactive trials are sufficient to rule out the use of reactive culling on a larger scale than was undertaken during those trials.  [158698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The result from the reactive areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial suggests that removal of badgers in the way it was carried out during the trial is ineffective in reducing the level of bovine TB in the cattle population. Reactive culling of badgers in this way, even on a larger scale, has therefore been ruled out as a policy option.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether there is a relationship between badger population density and the prevalence of TB in badger populations.  [158716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Currently the only available data, to investigate the potential relationship between disease prevalence and badger population density, originates from the Central Science Laboratory's study at Woodchester Park. This suggests that the prevalence of infection in badgers has fluctuated widely and bears no simple linear relationship to badger density.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the difference in population growth rates is between <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;high, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;medium and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;low density badger populations; and what the primary factors responsible for the difference are.  [158717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The growth rate of the badger population, as with any animal population is dependent upon a number of underlying ecological principles, and in particular the rates of births and deaths. A high density population may have little scope for growth, as it is likely to be near the capacity which that particular habitat can support, if the local habitat is poor for badgers then it may only be capable of supporting low numbers. However, if badgers are culled to a low level from a previously high density in a location where conditions are favourable, then there is likely to be considerable potential for population recovery.
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para4">Following removal of 11 social groups from a high density badger population in Gloucestershire, it took 10 years for numbers to recover to pre-cull levels (Cheeseman et al, 1993). Following incomplete removal of eight social groups in a lower density population also in Gloucestershire, density returned to pre-cull levels after only three years (Tuyttens et al, 2000). Recovery rates are likely to be dependent on the quality of the habitat, and the size of the badger population in the surrounding area from which immigration will occur.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to what extent multiple administration of a TB detection test with low 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2004 : Column 990W</I><P>
sensitivity improves the chances of detection of infection in an infected animal which has previously shown a negative response to that test.  [158720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Any single test with imperfect sensitivity, when applied more than once to an infected animal, will cause the overall sensitivity of the procedure to rapidly approach 100&nbsp;per cent., although the added value of extra tests will diminish substantially. The probability formula for the overall sensitivity of the multiple testing protocol is as follows:
<p align=left><img src="formula.gif"></p>
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para7">Where <i>a</i> is the known sensitivity of a single test, n is the total number of tests carried out in the same animal and r ranges in value from 1 to n.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is possible to identify visually individual badgers which are heavily infected by TB; whether it is possible to target those badgers for killing; and whether such a practice would have a significant impact on the incidence of TB in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;badger and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cattle populations.  [158723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Currently, the only sure way of determining the TB status of a badger is through post mortem examination. Even heavily infected individuals may show no outward sign of TB infection. It follows that it would not be possible to target such badgers effectively, and such a practice would be unlikely to have a significant effect on TB in badger or cattle populations.

<a name="40325w12.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with the Treasury on the costs of the TB control programme.  [159059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Discussions are in progress with the Treasury in relation to Spending Review 2004 and expenditure on the TB control programme is a recognised element in those discussions.

<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she plans to reduce the costs of the TB control programme.  [159060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A key challenge for Government in developing a new TB strategy is, in partnership with industry and others, to reduce the overall economic impact of TB and increase the cost-effectiveness of control measures.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_wqn17"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the need for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;vaccination of (i) cattle 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2004 : Column 991W</I><P>
and (ii) badgers and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other measures to control the incidence of TB in cattle herds in the absence of any significant wildlife reservoir of the disease.  [159061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Evidence from other countries shows that, in the absence of a significant wildlife reservoir, cattle controls based on regular testing and slaughter, inspection at slaughterhouses, and movement restrictions (including tracing and contiguous testing) can be effective at controlling bovine TB without vaccination.
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para8">Any badger/wildlife management strategy (whether culling or vaccination) would need to be deployed in conjunction with cattle-based controls. However, practical application of potential vaccines for cattle or badgers remains a long-term prospect.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are undertaken by her Department in respect of animal sanctuaries and hospitals to ensure that the guidelines relating to the release of badgers into the wild are fully observed.  [159069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 None. As I have explained in previous answers these guidelines were prepared by animal welfare organisations and are voluntary. As they are not approved by the Department we do not seek to enforce their use.
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para9">Animal hospitals treating sick or injured badgers are not legally required to test animals for bovine tuberculosis before they are released from captivity.
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para10">To minimise the risk of animal hospitals accidentally spreading tuberculosis Defra facilitated development of the voluntary protocol for the rehabilitation and release of badgers. This was drawn up by the RSPCA, National Federation of Badgers Groups and Secret World Wildlife Rescue. The protocol provides comprehensive guidance on the precautions necessary to protect the welfare of badgers and critically, to minimise the risk of transmitting bovine tuberculosis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the change in premiums for bovine TB insurance policies since 1997.  [159070]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made. Insurance companies will make their own decisions on whether to insure, and about the size of premiums, based on their assessment of the risk.
<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para12">Contact between officials and the insurance industry early in 2003 indicated that, although companies are honouring existing policies, they are not offering new policies to cover TB in cattle herds, particularly in areas 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2004 : Column 992W</I><P>
where TB is increasingly prevalent. This is because farmers do not wish to take the cover in areas where the risk is low (such as Yorkshire), but do wish to purchase cover in areas of high incidence (such as the South West). However, the insurance companies considered that the financial risks in offering insurance policies in areas of high incidence were too high at that time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Individual elements of the field trial including such overheads are not individually quantifiable, as a work recording scheme is not operational.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 TB surveillance in GB relies particularly on tuberculin skin testing and meat inspection at the slaughterhouse. Neither of these methods allows a precise ascertainment of when new infection occurred. This is compounded by the nature of TB which is a chronic disease with a highly variable incubation period. If it were possible to determine the time of infection with any certainty, this information would, in some circumstances, help inform the source of infection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew25"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B>

 Many features of the cattle farming landscape are beneficial to badgers. For example, permanent pasture provides ideal habitat for badgers to forage for earthworms, and farm woodlands and hedgerows provide cover for their setts. Furthermore, cattle feed may provide alternative nutrition for badgers when natural foods are unavailable. This is most likely where cattle feed is either put out on pasture or stored in insecure facilities.

<P>

<a name="40325w12.html_para17">A survey of badger damage to agricultural properties in England and Wales conducted in 1997 estimated that the annual cost of damage to structures on farms (this includes buildings, machinery, drains, fences etc.) was &#163;25.7 million (with 95&nbsp;per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w12.html_spnew35"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No wildlife reservoir of bovine TB has been identified for eradication. In the event that eradication of a wildlife reservoir was selected as a policy option, it may still be appropriate to retain the option of "ring-vaccination" in zones adjacent to those targeted by eradication. Since it cannot at present be guaranteed that eradication of a wildlife reservoir would completely eliminate bovine tuberculosis, there may still be a need to maintain research towards development of a cattle vaccine.

 The Thornbury clearance area was bounded by major motorways and rivers. Complete badger clearance was achieved by repeated gassing of setts with hydrogen cyanide. The area was subsequently recolonised, showing that badgers can migrate across barriers such as motorways. Large expanses of water are probably the only really effective barrier to badger movement.

 The National Fallen Stock Company has had many issues to resolve since its work started in November last year. Many have been relatively straightforward but others have been more complex and the board has advised that these require more time and negotiation to get right. For example, identifying available alternatives required to cope with sheep in full fleece which cannot be rendered, setting up payment and tender arrangements for the collection and disposal industry, and devising fair subscription rates for the pig and poultry sectors. In addition to these practical problems, the company has, with Defra, been required to ensure the scheme as a whole does not contravene the state aid rules of the EU. A state aid notification has been submitted for the scheme and we expect to have further discussions with the European Commission about the scheme before it goes ahead.

On 24&nbsp;July 2003 it was announced that the basis for sharing the costs of the Scheme and its eventual transfer to industry had been agreed and that the Scheme would go ahead. At that time it was expected that the Scheme would begin in January 2004. That proved to be unachievable. On 24&nbsp;February the Board of the National Fallen Stock Company and government jointly announced that the launch would have to be postponed. The reasons for this were set out in PQ 1897 to which I would refer my hon. Friend.

 The herbicide regime employed on the GMHT crops in the farm-scale evaluations (FSE) was established at the beginning of the trials, based on proposals by the chemical manufacturers and the terms of the experimental license granted by the Pesticide Safety Directorate. These guidelines remained in force throughout the FSE. This herbicide regime will now be specified in writing on the release consent in line with advice given by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment on 13&nbsp;January 2004 and the announcement made by my right hon.

<sup>(23)</sup> The Countryside Agency accounting system has changed since the Initiative started so a breakdown of running costs and salaries is not possible.<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> Funding for transport is included, although it should be noted that this was a separate funding stream. Also, as some schemes were designed to link towns and cannot be attributed to a single town, this information has been excluded<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> Regions town by town expenditure may not add up to the total on the overview page. This is due to inclusion of projects which are funded to benefit all towns in a region, such as regional networks or training.<P>

<a name="40325w14.html_para1">While this investment has not translated into capacity within Crosby itself there are several wind farm developments, both constructed and proposed, in the surrounding area. The first of these is the 3.6 MW 6 turbine wind farm at Seaforth Docks. It was constructed in 1999 and is roughly three miles from Crosby. The second is the North Hoyle offshore wind farm, which is located around 20&#150;25 miles from Crosby and was opened in November 2003.
<P>

<a name="40325w14.html_para2">There are also two proposed developments for offshore wind farms relatively near to Crosby. The first of these is the 30 turbine Burbo Bank offshore wind farm, it is due to being constructed in 2005 and will be situated around 5&#150;6 miles out to sea from Crosby.
<P>

<a name="40325w14.html_para3">The second is the Gwynt-y-Mor site, which has been awarded a licence under round two of the offshore wind programme and would be located around 15&#150;20 miles from Crosby. The award of a site licence option is only the first step in the development of this wind farm, however, it is hoped that it will be completed by 2010.

<P>

<a name="40325w15.html_para1">On 1&nbsp;March 2001 those required to register with the police under Part 1 of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 became ineligible for the scheme under the provisions of section 65 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Service Act 2000.

latter part of their sentence unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. This streamlined scheme is applicable to low risk only, less serious offenders. Drug dealers, violent and sexual offenders are not eligible for Presumptive HDC.
<P>

<a name="40325w15.html_para3">On 16&nbsp;December 2002 the maximum curfew period was extended from 60 to 90 days and then, on 14&nbsp;July 2003, the curfew period was extended further to 135 days. At the same time, a presumption against suitability for release on HDC was introduced for offenders serving sentences for certain serious violent offences. These offences include attempted murder, explosives offences, possession of an offensive weapon, cruelty to children and racially aggravated offences. In addition, prisoners with any current or previous history of sexual offending, not already barred from HDC, are presumed unsuitable for release. Further, also with effect from 14&nbsp;July 2003, young offenders, under the age of 18, sentenced to a term of detention under Section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Court (Sentencing Act) became eligible for consideration for HDC. Prior to that date all prisoners under 18 years-of-age were statutorily excluded from HDC.
<P>

<a name="40325w15.html_para4">Finally, with effect from 14&nbsp;January 2004 notorious prisoners whose release may undermine public confidence in the scheme are referred to the Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service, who takes the final decision whether, after taking all matters into consideration and the individual circumstances of the case, early release is appropriate.

Even where an internet site is closed down following an investigation, many of the images that were on it may remain in circulation through other websites, newsgroups, or other internet activity. Nor can we be certain how many sites hosted outside the UK have been closed down following reports originating within the UK. Figures from the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) show that the percentage of sites reported to them found to contain illegal images of children which were hosted in the UK fell from 18&nbsp;per cent. in 1997, to 3&nbsp;per cent. in 2000, and to 1&nbsp;per cent. in 2003. The number of sites within the UK identified in each year from 2000 is given in the table. In each of these cases the internet service providers concerned removed the offending material and police inquiries were made. In 2003 the IWF also identified 510,000 indecent photographs of children carried on newsgroups through the UK's Usenet infrastructure, resulting in access to these being stopped by the IWF members who provide a Usenet feed to their customers.

 Section 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act gives the police a general power of arrest for the purposes of enabling the police to prosecute for a non-arrestable offence or to prevent a crime from being committed. The statistics collected centrally on persons proceeded against and those convicted do not enable those originally arrested under this power to be separately identified.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus came into existence as a national organisation at the beginning of April 2002. The Benefits Agency and Employment Service ceased to exist at the same time. The new service is being rolled out across England, Wales and Scotland on a district by district basis. Nearly 400 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices are now operating across the country, 33 of which are in Scotland. Integrating the whole of the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency's services for people of working age and creating the national network of Jobcentre Plus offices will not be completed until 2006.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During 2002&#150;2003, 23 offices were successfully introduced across Grampian, Moray, Orkney and Shetland District and Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll and Bute District. Implementation is ongoing in Glasgow, Lothian and Borders and Tayside Districts. Rollout planning schedules are at an advanced stage for the remaining Districts; Ayrshire Dumfries and Galloway, Edinburgh, Fife, Forth Valley and Dunbartonshire Highlands and Western Isles and Lanarkshire. Our aim is to complete rollout of Jobcentre Plus throughout Scotland by 2006.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As each district starts to plan for the introduction of the new integrated Jobcentre Plus, service delivery arrangements are shared with local stakeholders, MPs and others. The service delivery arrangements are shared at the initial proposal stage, amended to take account of comments received where appropriate, then shared again when approval for the plans has been given. This is an integral part of the planning process for the introduction of the Jobcentre Plus service across England, Wales and Scotland.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>District Managers are provided with a list of suggested stakeholders for this initial planning stage. These include; local MPs/MEPs/MSPs/Members of the National Assembly of Wales, Local Authorities, programme providers/service delivery partners, employers, Citizens Advice Bureaux, and welfare rights organisations. This list is not exhaustive and each District Manager may identify their own local stakeholders.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the impact of his Department's policies on the constituency of Hackney, North and Stoke Newington since 1997.  [162290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001; since then, we have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para3">We are making a significant contribution to the Government's objective of eradicating child poverty in 20 years and halving it within 10, and there are now half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1997. Child Benefit is now worth &#163;16.05 a week for the eldest child, compared to only &#163;11.40 in 1997, benefiting 13,200 families in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para4">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.27&nbsp;million. Unemployment in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington has halved and long-term unemployment has fallen by over 75&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para5">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1,029,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals, and over 9,500 have been helped into work in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para6">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country, and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending an extra &#163;10 billion in 2004&#150;05 on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997; this is &#163;6 billion more than an earnings link would have given them. Almost half the extra spending, around &#163;5 billion, is going to the poorest third of pensioners.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para7">Pension Credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for modest savings and income. Around 4,559 pensioner households in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington are already benefiting from Pension Credit, with an average award of &#163;69.81 per week.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para8">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty, and this winter (2003&#150;04) we have made available a Winter Fuel Payment of &#163;200 for each eligible household to help with their fuel bills. In 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2004 : Column 1029W</I><P>
addition, the introduction of the 80 plus annual payment gives an extra &#163;100 to households where there is someone aged 80 or over. So far 10,120 older people in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington have received a payment this winter; of those 1,865 have received the 80 plus annual payment.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para9">On 17&nbsp;March, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget statement, announced a &#163;100 pension payment to households with someone aged over 70, to help with council tax bills.
<P>

<a name="40325w20.html_para10">Some 8,900 pensioners in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington benefited from the above inflation increase in the rate of basic state pension from April 2003. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 3,700 in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, may also qualify for free TV licences.

Potential linkages between climate change and international security include increased pressure on food and water resources and energy supplies, which in turn (and in combination with other factors) may contribute to the causes of migration, instability and conflict.

 I most recently discussed the border dispute with the Eritrean ambassador, together with a visiting representative of the Eritrean Government, on 18&nbsp;March 2004 I also discussed the border with Eritrean President Isaias in Asmara on 15&nbsp;January 2004 and with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles in Addis Ababa on 16&nbsp;January 2004. On each of these occasions I reiterated to the parties that the Boundary Commission's decision is final and binding and urged them to engage in political dialogue on all of the issues separating them.

<P>
<a name="40325w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Government Hospitality Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine cost approximately &#163;6,000 in the financial year 2003&#150;04. The work of the Committee is managed by an established civil servant, whose salary is paid by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Kosovo Force (KFOR) reports that the situation in these towns is calm but tense. We have called upon all the leaders in Kosovo and Belgrade to show restraint and use their influence to calm the situation. It is important that they continue to work with KFOR and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to build a stable, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Our policy on Kosovo is based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) and the UN endorsed review process of agreed standards, launched in December 2003. As part of this there will be a formal review of Kosovo's progress in meeting the agreed standards in mid 2005. If it were positive, but only if, it could allow a process to begin to determine Kosovo's future status.

 The UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, the Kosovo Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and the NATO Force for Kosovo are in the process of assessing the damage caused by the recent violence and. the extent of the reconstruction programme required. The PISG has announced the allocation of Kosovo funds to rebuild Serb Churches and homes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 We have received no such representations from Serbia and Montenegro. However, on a number of occasions since taking office on 3&nbsp;March 2004, Serbian Prime Minister Kostunica has stated publicly his Government's preference for the decentralisation of Kosovo through entities or cantons to ensure the security of the Serb community in Kosovo.

 Responsibility for border control points in Kosovo is held by the Kosovo Police Service under the authority of the UN Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo. Responsibility for the border security of Kosovo, including adjacent to the border with Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, rests with the NATO-led Kosovo Force. On the Macedonian side of the border, responsibility for border crossing points rests with the Macedonian Border Police, and for the rest of the border with the First Army Brigade. On the Albanian side of the border, the Albanian Police are responsible for border control. We assess that Kosovo's borders with both Albania and Macedonia are adequately secured.

 We are committed to maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, as re-affirmed in UN Security Council Resolution 1511. We have been in regular contact with Iraq's neighbours to urge them to take steps to ensure better security on their borders with Iraq. We have been working hard to improve border security through increased personnel, new technology and tighter procedures. There are currently 8,000 Iraqi border police in place and the Coalition is aiming to double this number. In the north the US military have taken on this role in the Kurdistan Regional Government administered areas.

 Focus groups and internal/external opinion polls are not managed centrally. The subject of the group or poll would determine which department within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) managed it. For example, the FCO's Information Directorate (responsible for explaining UK foreign policy, creating systems to deliver this information, both internally and to the public, and the development of relationships with the FCO's key partners in shaping and communicating policy) spent &#163;311,000 on focus groups and polls in 2003&#150;04. To collate all costs relating to groups and polls would incur disproportionate costs.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) if he will assess the difference between the level of housing management and maintenance allowance for Brent council in 2003&#150;04 calculated using national crime statistics and the level using more local crime statistics;  [163362]

<P>
(5) if he will amend the management and maintenance allowance for housing revenue accounts to take account of overcrowding.  [163372]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w24.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister made proposals to revise the calculation of management and maintenance allowances within Housing Revenue Account subsidy in a consultation paper published in July 2003. Following consultation the new methodology was adopted for 2004&#150;05 and onwards.
<P>

<a name="40325w24.html_para13">The research underlying the proposals found that crime levels were a significant driver of an authority's relative need to spend. Although the original proposal was to use county-wide crime figures, respondents to the consultation suggested that appropriate figures were available at individual local authority level. In the calculation of the allowances for 2004&#150;05, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister therefore calculated a relative crime rate for each individual local authority by comparing the recorded crime figures at the local and national level. County level figures were not used. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister plans to continue to use local authority level relative crime rates in future years.
<P>

<a name="40325w24.html_para14">The management and maintenance allowances for 2003&#150;04 did not use the new methodology and therefore did not include any crime figures. As both the national and local figure feeds into the calculation for 2004&#150;05, it is not possible to compare the difference between allowances using either one of these figures. Using the methodology as outlined, the combined allowance for Brent for 2004&#150;05 after transitional protection is &#163;1,892.85 per dwelling.
<P>

<a name="40325w24.html_para15">With data currently available, it is not possible to assess the direct impact of the new arrangements on the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. However, the new methodology is widely recognised as achieving a better allocation of resources across all authorities, and the overall increase in resources for local authority management and maintenance has been welcomed as recognising the important role that housing management plays in meeting a number of the Government's priorities.

The use of the local recorded crime rate is intended to cover issues around the former. It was not possible to include the latter as there is a lack of robust data both on the numbers of languages spoken in each authority and on the actual size of the additional costs incurred.

<a name="40325w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Local Authorities (Standing Orders)(England) Regulations 2001 set out the arrangements for councils to handle allegations of misconduct by their head of paid service, monitoring officer or chief finance officer. These arrangements provide that no disciplinary action (apart from suspension in order to allow investigation of the allegation) may be taken by a local authority in respect of such officers other than in accordance with a recommendation in a report made by an independent person appointed under the Regulations to investigate the allegation. If the authority does suspend the officer it must be on full pay and may only be for a maximum period of two months. The independent person may, once appointed, choose to extend the period of suspension if he feels it necessary to enable him to carry out his investigation.

 The accident and emergency (A and E) department at Ashford Hospital has not been closed. It remains open 24-hours a day accepting a wide range of medical and surgical emergencies. However, in October 2000 one group of seriously injured patients, those with trauma injuries, were diverted to St. Peter's Hospital, to reflect the concentration of specialist trauma care at St. Peter's.
<P>

<a name="40325w26.html_para0">The diversion from Ashford Hospital to St. Peter's Hospital was made to improve further clinical outcomes for trauma patients and at the same time the trust renamed the A and E department in Ashford Hospital to 'emergency department'.
<P>

<a name="40325w26.html_para1">There is a standard departmental classification system for A and E departments. Ashford Hospital's A and E rating is unchanged. It remains a type 1 A and E, which is a major multi-specialty consultant led 24-hour service, with full resuscitation facilities and designated accommodation for the reception of accident and emergency patients.
<P>

<a name="40325w26.html_para2">Classification does not depend on the name of the service. This is, within certain rules, a matter for the local health service. The official description remains A and E but emergency department is increasingly used as a local alternative.

<P>

<a name="40325w26.html_para3">Figures for government expenditure on research on specific types of cancer are not available. However analysis carried out in 2002 by the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI), which co-ordinates research activity among government bodies, charities and the pharmaceutical industry, indicates that of the combined spend that was available for analysis, around 40&nbsp;per cent. was attributable to specific tumour sites. Approximately 18&nbsp;per cent. was on breast cancer, approximately 4&nbsp;per cent. on cervical cancer and approximately 8&nbsp;per cent. on prostate cancer. This does not include national health service research and development support funding.

<a name="40325w28.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact on human health of man-made chemicals found in household goods, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;perfluorinated compounds, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;phthalates, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;phenolic compounds and <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;brominated flame retardants; and what measures the Government plans to protect human health against the dangers posed by such chemicals.  [159467]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40325w28.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Existing Substances Regulation (ESR) is European-wide legislation which required any manufacturer or importer of a chemical into the European Union to submit data to the European Commission. Substances were prioritised and have undergone comprehensive risk assessment, addressing both the human health and the environmental hazards and risks. Several chemicals from the phthalate, phenolic compounds, and brominated fire retardant groupings have been assessed, or are currently undergoing risk assessment. Those that have been agreed by Member States are publicly available on the website of the European Chemicals Bureau at http://ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals). In a number of cases, cross-European marketing and use restrictions have been introduced as a result of these assessments.
<P>

<a name="40325w28.html_para4">Following the voluntary withdrawal from the market by the major producer of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), a hazard assessment of this chemical was undertaken under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Coperation and Development (OECD);this is available on the OECD website at www.oecd.org/dataoecd/23/18/2382880.pdf. This is now being followed up by the United Kingdom with a risk reduction strategy which aims to look at the remaining uses of PFOS and how they can be phased out.
<P>

<a name="40325w28.html_para5">In addition, information on the hazardous properties and the safe use of chemicals in household goods is governed by the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for supply) Regulations 2002. These Regulations require that manufacturers must assess a chemical product for its health effects. If dangerous, the 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2004 : Column 1058W</I><P>
product must be labelled with a warning symbol and phrases indicating the dangers. The particular chemical(s) which cause the product to be classified must be named on the label. The Regulations also require that all potentially dangerous chemicals supplied to the public must be in packaging that is properly labelled and contains warnings about the potential hazards and giving advice on suitable precautions.
<P>

<a name="40325w28.html_para6">Other regulations for protecting the consumer are the Department of Trade and Industry's General Product Safety Regulations 1994 (GPSR), which implement the EC General Products Safety Directive (92159/EEC) and apply to all consumer products (or aspects of those products) that are not covered by specific European safety legislation. The GPSR requires manufacturers to ensure that products present no risk or only minimal risk compatible with the product's use. In other words, producers must first take steps to reduce the hazard as far as possible, then warn about any residual hazard(s) and give advice about the precautions that consumers should take when using the product.

 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are responsible for monitoring the safety of medicines in the United Kingdom. Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by health professionals through the Yellow Card scheme are an important source of information regarding the safety of medicines in normal clinical practice.

<P>

<a name="40325w29.html_para4">The Yellow Card scheme primarily acts as an early warning system for the identification of previously unrecognised adverse reactions and also provides valuable information on recognised adverse drug reactions, allowing the MHRA/CSM to identify and refine the understanding of risk factors that may affect the clinical management of patients. The value of the scheme has been demonstrated many times and it has helped to identify numerous important safety issues. To date the MHRA/CSM has received more than 450,000 ADRs reports from the Yellow Card scheme.
<P>

<a name="40325w29.html_para5">In evaluating a possible drug safety issue, the Yellow Card data is typically considered in conjunction with relevant information from other sources such as clinical trial data, published studies, adverse drug reaction reports received from the pharmaceutical industry and data from other Regulatory Authorities.
<P>

<a name="40325w29.html_para6">Where necessary, to protect public health, the MHRA on the advice of CSM may take regulatory action to ensure the medicine is used in a way which minimises risk and maximises benefits to the patient. Possible actions include addition of a new side effect to the product information provided to prescribers and patients, and issuing warnings about groups of patients who should not be given the medicine. In rare circumstances, the MHRA may withdraw a medicine from the market, if the risks of a medicine in clinical use are greater than its potential benefits.

The England totals shown here correspond to the total number of cases shown in the regional table given in the answer of 1&nbsp;March, <i>Official Report</i>, column 708W. The strategic health authority data totals given in that answer differ from the regional data totals because these, and most of CDSC's other sexually transmitted disease data presentations, are calculated using an imputation method.

 The national service framework for coronary heart disease and the NHS Plan require local action to tackle obesity and physical activity, informed by advice from the Health Development Agency (HDA) on what works. The Department commissioned the HDA to conduct a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of public health interventions for increasing physical activity amongst adults. This will be published shortly. The guidance will be available to national health service regions, strategic health authorities and primary care trusts as well as local government.

<P><I>25 Mar 2004 : Column 1070W</I><P>

The launch of the consultation on public health, "Choosing Health?", provides the opportunity to discuss at a national, regional and local level what needs to be done to develop a coherent strategy to improve health. The activity co-ordination team will publish its draft proposals setting out current and future action to increase activity levels. The Government will then publish a White Paper setting out its strategy for action in the summer.
