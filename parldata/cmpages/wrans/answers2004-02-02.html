<a name="40202w01.html_wqn0"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;allegations and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reports of bribery of a foreign public official by a UK company or individual have been forwarded to the Serious Fraud Office by the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice in the US since 1997; and on what dates they were received.  [151523]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The SFO has received no reports of allegations of bribery of a foreign public official by a UK company or individual from the US Department of Justice since 1997.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para0">One request for mutual legal assistance has been made involving a suspicion of bribery. In this instance the alleged offences took place prior to the implementation of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

To ask the Solicitor-General how many allegations of bribery of a foreign public official the Serious Fraud Office received between November 1997 and February 2002; and how many of these allegations led to an investigation.  [151403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The SFO have identified four cases referred to it between November 1997 and February 2002 where bribery of a foreign official has been one of the allegations. None of these cases have resulted in an investigation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many of the requests for mutual legal assistance on corruption offences received by the Serious Fraud Office have <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;indicated an offence by a UK individual or company and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;led to an investigation by the SFO into a possible UK offence.  [151404]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Prior to the implementation of the Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, the SFO did not record the category of offences referred for mutual legal assistance by foreign authorities.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para1">Since February 2002, the SFO has identified three mutual legal assistance requests where there may be suspicion of corruption offences of persons overseas involving UK citizens or companies.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para2">These requests have not resulted in a domestic investigation. Two of the requests are still being assessed and the relevant offences in the other request took place prior to the implementation of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General whether the Serious Fraud Office has received additional resources for enforcing Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 since February 2002.  [151405]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The SFO has received no additional resource since February 2002 specifically for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting using the provisions of Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para3">As part of the 2002 Spending Review, the resource budget of the Serious Fraud Office will rise to &#163;35.34&nbsp;million by the end of the 2005&#150;06 financial year. The Serious Fraud Office plans to use some of this resource to expand its permanent staff numbers from 232 to approximately 300 by the end of that financial year.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para4">The Serious Fraud Office does not allocate its staff resource to a particular type of crime or case. Each case referred to the SFO is assessed on its individual merits, and this includes allegations of bribery by UK citizens or companies overseas.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of fiduciary risk for direct budget support.  [152083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w01.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID has developed a comprehensive approach to assessing and managing the fiduciary risks associated with direct budget support, which has been agreed with the UK's National Audit Office.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para9">Firstly, a thorough evaluation of the recipient government's public financial management and accountability procedures, systems, practices and associated risks must be carried out. We have set out eight good practice principles and 15 related benchmarks which provide a framework both to ensure that adequate and sufficient information is obtained and that a broad assessment can be undertaken.
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para10">Secondly, the recipient government must have a credible programme to improve public financial management and if necessary to incorporate temporary safeguards to mitigate identified risks. The decision to provide direct budget support is made where the potential development benefits justify the risk involved. DFID's policy in this area is clearly identified in the published document "Managing Fiduciary Risk When Providing Budget Support".
<P>

<a name="40202w01.html_para11">DFID is working with other development agencies and international financial institutions to harmonise approaches to fiduciary risk management, thereby limiting the burden placed on governments to meet the requirements of different donors and lenders. This includes harmonisation of donor assessment procedures.

 DFID has committed &#163;220&nbsp;million towards humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq since the beginning of 2003. In spite of difficulties resulting from the security situation in Iraq, there is no humanitarian crisis in the country. Significant progress has been made since the end of the conflict in restoring essential services, maintaining the Public Distribution System for food rations, reopening hospitals and schools, and beginning the process of longer term reconstruction.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 This information is set out in the Scottish Consultation Document and supporting technical reports. These estimate the number of people who would be affected by different levels of noise under a range of runway options at Edinburgh Airport including maximum use of the existing main runway, greater use of the existing crosswind runway and development of a new close parallel runway. Our analysis suggests that by 2030, the development of a new close parallel runway, assuming a&#151;14 dBA technology improvement, would reduce the number of people affected within the 63 dBA 16 hour Leq contour by 300 with an increase of 200 people affected at the 69 dBA 16 hour Leq contour.

<P>
<a name="40202w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Local authorities have a power under s135 of the Transport Act 2000 to require local bus operators to provide through ticketing. The Bus Partnership Forum, which I chair, has produced four templates intended for use as model ticketing schemes, including one that provides an example of a through-ticketing scheme involving different companies. We are placing the templates on the Department for Transport's website (under "Local Transport"), and I encourage all local transport authorities and bus operators to take advantage of these resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what budget has been allocated for the enforcement of employment law in agriculture during the period covering the last two financial years; and how many enforcement officers are dedicated to investigating breaches of employment law in agriculture.  [152096]<P>

<P>
<a name="40202w02.html_spnew8"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The only employment law enforced by Defra is the Agricultural Wages Order made by the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948. Initial enforcement is undertaken by the five members of Defra's Agricultural Wages Team at an annual cost of some &#163;133,000. This process is complaint led and complaints are investigated by Agricultural Wages Inspectors based in the Department's Rural Payments Agency. Some 37 Rural Payments Agency staff are authorised to investigate agricultural wage complaints. In the 2002&#150;03 financial year it is estimated that agricultural minimum wage investigations undertaken by the Rural Payments Agency utilised staff resources of just over 0.5 staff years at a cost of &#163;12,000. Rural Payments Agency staff inputs between April and December 2003 totalled some 0.25 staff years at a cost of &#163;6,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 10&nbsp;December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 522W, on badgers, whether the reference to the gassing of badgers being considered to be inhumane refers only to the use of hydrogen cyanide gas; and what gases are available for use for the slaughter of subterranean animals which have properties that do not engender distress in those animals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;standard trawl speed and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;type of trawl gear is used by her Department's survey vessels in carrying out the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the North Sea.  [149121]

<P>
<a name="40202w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The trawl used for scientific surveys of bottom living fish in the North Sea is the GOV trawl ('Grande Ouverture Verticale'). This general purpose bottom trawl has a high headline of five to six metres, and is used where the target species are a mix of commercial whitefish such as cod, haddock, whiting, pout and saithe. The net also samples shoaling or pelagic species including herring and mackerel. Design, specification and operation of the GOV trawl are all agreed internationally and co-ordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. The standard towing speed is four knots over the sea bed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Yes. Commercial gear is rigged by individual skippers to suit local conditions and to maximise the catch of target species. It is regularly modified to follow the changes in the technical conservation legislation, and is frequently adjusted to improve catchability. Survey gear is chosen to fish both a wide range of species and a wide range of sizes including juvenile fish. It is maintained and operated to an internationally agreed specification without modification over time, so that the results of different national surveys can be combined. True comparisons can thus be made from year to year unaffected by technical changes.

 The Environment Agency's Flood Mapping Strategy of July 2003 outlines 2005 as the earliest date for delivery of the 'Flood Zones for year 2050' onto the National Flood and Coastal Defence Database. 'Flood Zones for year 2050' is a dataset to show planners the anticipated extent of a range of flood probabilities (including, for fluvial flooding, a zone showing the one per cent. or one in 100 year probability) in the year 2050, taking account of current guidance on climate change.
<P>

<a name="40202w04.html_para5">The Environment Agency follows government policies and guidance for climate change; for floodplain, this is found in PPG25.

 The proceeds from the sale of part of the United Kingdom's gold holdings between 6&nbsp;July 1999 and 6&nbsp;March 2002 totalled approximately $3.5 billion. These proceeds were invested in interest-bearing foreign currency assets in broadly the same proportion as currently held in the net foreign currency reserves (40&nbsp;per cent. dollars; 40&nbsp;per cent. euros; 20&nbsp;per cent. yen). The gold sales reduced risk by around 30&nbsp;per cent. (as measured by value-at-risk) and are not expected to deliver a loss in return when measured over the medium to long-term, the appropriate time horizon for such a decision.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;countries which have abolished tax stamp regimes for whisky and other spirits, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;countries which, after consideration, decided against introducing tax stamps and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;countries which have tax stamps regimes; and what the outcome of those discussions was.  [151694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w06.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Officials are in regular discussions with other countries on these matters. Tax stamps have been introduced in 40 different countries for a variety of reasons ranging from quality assurance to tackling fraud. Of eight European Union and accession countries where direct inquiries have been made, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic have no plans to withdraw their schemes. Greece have withdrawn their 'quality' marker stamp and Belgium decided after consideration not to introduce tax stamps. Additionally, we are aware that the USA withdrew their tax stamps in 1985 when the 1954 law governing marks on spirits was repealed. The variety of reasons for introduction and withdrawal of tax stamp schemes highlight that direct comparisons between different countries' excise regimes cannot be easily drawn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w06.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Under formal European Union agreements (Council Directive 92/12/EEC) member states may require the use of tax stamps or other fiscal marks on products subject to excise duty. Any such scheme must ensure that the tax stamps do not create obstacles to the free movement of the products.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what effect he expects the electronic control of movements systems which will be in place in the EU by 2009 to have on tax stamp regimes.  [151696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w06.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The EU Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) should be introduced by July 2009 and should reinforce the Government's strategy to tackle alcohol duty fraud. It will allow member states to monitor, in real time, the despatch and receipt of movements of alcohol, as well as tobacco and certain fuel products, between tax warehouses located in different member states. EMCS will be an improvement on the current paper-based system of Accompanying Administrative Documents. However, tax stamps are still likely to have a useful role to play in the detection of smuggled and diverted products after the full implementation of EMCS.

<a name="40202w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No proposal has been made to abolish national trading marks and replace them by a European Union wide trademark. The European Commission has produced a discussion document setting out options in considering possible EU origin marking. The document does not suggest abolition of national markings such as "Made in Britain". The Government are currently finalising its response to the Commission having consulted interested parties in the UK, including business, trade unions, retailers and consumer organisations. At a meeting with EU Trade Ministers on 25&nbsp;January I made it clear that British companies would want to retain the ability to say "Made in Britain" or use other current marks and was assured by Commissioner Pascal Lamy that there was no proposal to interfere with companies continuing to do so.

 The Energy White Paper was collectively agreed by Ministers (including the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) before being presented to Parliament in February 2003. Since then my right hon.

<P>
<a name="40202w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> ECGD has unrecovered claims of around &#163;623&nbsp;million arising from contracts with Iraq signed prior to the first Gulf conflict in 1991. This amount does not include interest, which, it is estimated, could bring the figure to around &#163;1 billion.
<P>

<a name="40202w07.html_para9">These claims stem from more than 500 cases supporting the export of goods ranging from consumer items to heavy industrial equipment. The details of these contracts could be collated only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40202w07.html_para10">The Government believe that Iraq's external debt is unsustainable and that creditors will need to agree a substantial reduction through a clear multilateral process in order to restore Iraq to sustainability. This is likely to lead to the writing off of the vast majority of Iraq's external debt.

 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> In making its decision the UK considered the results of two assessments of the ITER candidate sites, the Joint Assessment of Specific Sites (JASS) in January 2003, and the European ITER Site Study Group (EISSG) in May 2003. Both concluded that Cadarache could meet the requirements for ITER. Safety regulations for the construction of new nuclear facilities in France to meet the risk of earthquakes are very strict. Earthquakes are more frequent and stronger in the vicinity of the Japanese candidate site, Rokkasho.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. We have interpreted the question as being about how much the small business service costs to run (&#163;18&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03), rather than the cost of the programmes it delivers (outturn &#163;354&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03).<P>

2. The total cost of running the SBS reported in the accounts includes not only the administration budget from DTI (outturn &#163;11.5&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03) which covers staff in London and Sheffield, and Directors for the regions, but also the cost of the regional teams, SBS's share of DTI central services and accommodation costs.<P>

3. The leap in administration costs from 2001&#150;02 (&#163;13&nbsp;million) to 2002&#150;03 (&#163;18&nbsp;million) is due to the transfer of 94 staff (full-time equivalents) from Government Offices to SBS regional teams, and to a rise in accommodation costs. <P>

 It is our expectation that in due course the Foundation Degree will replace the Higher National Diploma. Higher National Diplomas have served employers well in the past and while employer loyalty exists in some sectors, the numbers applying for these courses are in decline.
<P>

<a name="40202w12.html_para0">Edexcel, who award the BTEC Higher National Diploma, have announced plans to make BTEC Foundation Degrees available. Colleges and universities currently offering HNDs will make decisions about whether they retain their HND provision, develop their own Foundation Degrees, or move to new BTEC Foundation Degrees. In doing so, they will take account of student and employer demand.

 Modern Apprenticeships (MA), in England are funded through the work based learning for young people budget of the Learning and Skills Council. This budget covers Advanced MAs, Foundation MAs, NVQ Learning and Entry to Employment.

In 2002&#150;03 the LSC's budget for WBL was &#163;828&nbsp;million of which it is estimated that &#163;539&nbsp;million was spent on MAs. The LSC's budget for WBL for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;791&nbsp;million. Before April 2001 MAs were funded by the Training and Enterprise Councils (TEC).

 <i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> We are committed to raising the skill levels of adults in the workforce, and in particular, supporting adults with no, or low qualifications to gain qualifications that give them the foundation skills for employability.
<P>

<a name="40202w13.html_para2">The Skills Strategy White Paper, "21st Century Skills Realising Our Potential", published in July last year, set out a number of key measures to address this issue. And we have already put in place support for adults with basic skill needs through our Skills for Life Strategy.
<P>

<a name="40202w13.html_para3">The White Paper announced the introduction of a new entitlement to free learning for all those studying for their first full level 2 qualification as foundation for employability. We have begun to pilot the introduction of a new adult learning grant of up to &#163;30 a week for full time learners studying for their first NVQ Level 2 qualification or equivalent.

<a name="40202w13.html_para5">We are running 12 Employer Training Pilots, of which two are in the West Midlands, to encourage employers to invest in skills and qualifications, particularly for low skilled trainees. They are testing out a package of financial support measures to improve access to training and enable employees to develop basic skills and NVQ level 2 qualifications.
<P>

<a name="40202w13.html_para6">In the West Midlands, six professional development centres have been established as a result of partnerships between the local LSCs and the Universities of Wolverhampton, Warwick, Worcestershire and Staffordshire. These are aimed at providing support and opportunities for all those working across the spectrum of Skills for Life delivery&#151;teachers, voluntary sector workers and those working in Adult and Community Learning.
<P>

<a name="40202w13.html_para7">We are working nationally to engage employers in activity to address the basic skills needs of their employees. This includes raising demand in the workplace and ensuring that appropriate advice and guidance is available to employers to help them establish the learning programmes they require for their employees. In the West Midlands, we have established a group of employer champions who will push the message that basic skills are important to other employers.
<P>

<a name="40202w13.html_para8">Advantage West Midlands has responded to our invitation to RDAs and their regional partners to draw up proposals for Regional Skills Partnerships. The Partnerships aim to ensure that the work of different agencies involved in delivering the aims of the Skills Strategy&#151;the Learning and Skills Councils, Jobcentre Plus, the Skills for Business network, the Small Business Service and others&#151;are better co-ordinated and delivered in a way that connects with the needs of employers at individual and regional, local and sectoral levels.

 None. While a number of agencies use local authority ward boundaries as a convenient basis for the allocation of grant aid and regeneration funding, such considerations do not fall within the scope of the matters which are taken into account in carrying out boundary reviews.

 The UK supports a European Security and Defence Policy, where the responsibility for decisions relating to defence, including research and development, rests primarily with Member States (Articles 13 and 17 of the Treaty on European Union). The Government recognises the need to consider the scope for co-operation with the Community's civil research programmes. The Community's programmes, under Article 163 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), cover "promoting all the research activities deemed necessary by virtue of other chapters of this Treaty [the TEC]". In this context, in November 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed to create an Agency, under the authority of the Council, whose responsibilities would include "promoting, in liaison with the Community's research activities where appropriate, research aimed at fulfilling future defence and security capabilities requirements".

 Pakistan has submitted three reports to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee, showing commitment and real progress in meeting the requirements of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. Pakistan has signed or ratified 10 of the 12 anti-terrorism conventions, and is an important partner on counter-terrorism. We are encouraged by Pakistan's efforts and will continue to work closely with Pakistan in this area.

 The United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) was established in order to encourage and ensure global compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. The CTC works to promote full implementation of the Resolution by UN member states in a transparent and effective manner. All member states are engaged in this process. Reaching full compliance is an ongoing process with long-term action for many States. The CTC's monitoring of this is continuous.
<P>

<a name="40202w16.html_para0">The CTC reviews and replies to states' reports, which outline the domestic provisions in place and the progress made in fighting terrorism in accordance with the Resolution. In addition to reviewing and replying to states' reports, the CTC promotes compliance with Resolution 1373 by facilitating technical assistance to states, and encouraging co-operation with international and regional bodies to strengthen counter-terrorism capacity building globally.
<P>

<a name="40202w16.html_para1">The Committee is currently reviewing its reporting requirements and mechanism in an effort to encourage fuller and more timely reporting, and further substantive progress, from all member states. The UK remains a strong and active supporter of this effort.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the projected total <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;wage and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;administration costs for implementation of the "Agenda for Change" are; and whether these costs have changed after evaluation of the 12 early implementer sites.  [150642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The total annual costs of the proposed new national health service pay system, "Agenda for Change", in England are estimated to be just under &#163;1 billion by 2005&#150;06 (compared with costs in 2002&#150;03). The Department of Health, NHS employer representatives and NHS trades unions are monitoring closely the cost impact in the 12 'early implementer' sites, but it is too early to re-assess the national cost estimates in the light of experience in these sites. The cost estimate excludes non-recurrent costs involved in implementing the new system, which are difficult to estimate accurately and are being tested through the 'early implementer' process.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much money has been allocated to each <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;primary care trust, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;acute and specialist hospital trust, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;mental health trust, <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;ambulance trust and <i>(e)</i>&nbsp;strategic health authority in England for each of the next five years to implement the "Agenda for Change" programme.  [151143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Additional funding, worth 0.8&nbsp;per cent. of main allocations, has been allocated to primary care trusts (PCTs) in 2004&#150;05 and a further 0.8&nbsp;per cent. in 2005&#150;06 to cover the costs of implementing "Agenda for Change" in acute and specialist hospital trusts, mental health trusts, ambulance trusts and PCTs themselves.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National job profiles for the proposed new national health service pay system, "Agenda for Change", have been developed in partnership between representatives of the United Kingdom Health Departments, the NHS Modernisation Agency, NHS trade unions and NHS employing organisations. It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the costs incurred by these organisations in releasing staff for this purpose.

<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how much his Department has spent on knowledge and skills framework training for staff and managers in the 12 early implementer sites as part of the "Agenda for Change" programme; and what his estimate is of the total cost to the NHS of knowledge and skills framework staff training;  [151146]
<P>
<UL>(2) how much has been spent on job evaluation training for staff and managers in the 12 early implementer sites as part of the "Agenda for Change" programme; and what his estimate is of the total cost to the NHS for staff training in job evaluation.  [151147]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The direct costs so far incurred centrally in providing training in use of the proposed new national health service job evaluation system and NHS knowledge and skills framework are around &#163;256,000. This excludes the costs incurred by NHS organisations in making staff available to receive training.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many staff in the 12 early implementer sites have had a reduction in pay consequent on the "Agenda for Change" programme; and how many staff in the NHS <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;immediately after implementation and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;after April 2011 will have a reduction in pay consequent on the programme.  [151148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 As a result of agreed pay protection arrangements, none of the national health service staff in the 12 'early implementer' sites will have had a reduction in pay as a result of the "Agenda for Change" pay modernisation programme, nor will any other NHS staff receive a reduction in pay after implementation of the proposed new pay system. Where, in a minority of cases, staff need to have their pay protected, there will be a review of their skills, knowledge and role as soon as possible during the period of protection. This will be used to assess whether they can be re-assigned to a more highly weighted job or offered development and training to fit them for a more highly weighted job. This is designed to keep to an absolute minimum the number of staff, if any, who are still covered by the protection arrangements immediately before those expire in April 2011.

[149853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B>

 <i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals national health service trust received a two star rating in July 2002 because its clinical governance review report from the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) did not show enough strengths to allow a three star rating to be awarded by the Department of Health. The trust was awarded a three star rating by CHI in July 2003.

 Responsibility for administration of the general dental services arrangements passed from health authorities to primary care trusts (PCTs) in October 2002.

<P>

<a name="40202w17.html_para0">Proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 for primary dental services will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service provided through contracts between PCTs and dental practices, properly integrated with the rest of the national health service and providing better access to services with an improved patient experience. The NatPaCT programme will continue to support PCTs through to implementation in April 2005.
<P>

<a name="40202w17.html_para1">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act also provides for the replacement of the existing Dental Practice Board by a new special health authority for England and Wales with a wider remit for modernisation and change. This will happen in 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w17.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 We expect several related policies to help reduce the number of cases of misdiagnosis of epilepsy. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has already made its report of the National Clinical Audit of Epilepsy Related Death available to local national health service clinicians and organisations to help improve the management of epilepsy and epilepsy-related death. NICE is also planning to publish a clinical guideline for the diagnosis, management and treatment in July 2004 which will be available to the NHS to support improvements in services. Additionally, implementation of the clinical quality standards of the new general medical services contract from April 2004 will help improve the management of epilepsy in primary care. We are also developing the national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions which will focus on improving the standard of neurology services across England for conditions such as epilepsy. We currently plan to publish the NSF in December 2004 for implementation from 2005.

<a name="40202w17.html_para4">These changes provide a challenge for PCTs, but they also provide an opportunity for PCTs to review and reconfigure the provision of out-of-hours services across their area and to co-ordinate this with other services including accident and emergency, social care and in-hours services such as national health service walk-in centres.

<a name="40202w18.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 On 21&nbsp;January 2004, I wrote to all right hon. and hon. Members describing the current position as follows:
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para17">Mobile phone technology and health issues have hit the headlines again following the publication of a scientific review by the National Radiological Protection Board's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR). News headlines about such issues tend to raise the levels of people's concern and you may well receive inquiries about mobile phones or mobile phone base stations. I am glad to say that the report confirms the conclusions of the Stewart Report and there is no new evidence suggesting that mobile phone use is likely to cause ill health in the general population. In the words of AGNIR's carefully considered report:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The weight of evidence now available does not suggest that there are adverse health effects from exposures to RF fields below guideline levels, but the published research on RF exposures and health has limitations, and mobile phones have 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>2 Feb 2004 : Column 690W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>only been in widespread use for a relatively short time. The possibility therefore remains open that there could be health effects from exposure to RF fields below guideline levels; hence continued research is needed."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para18">The rapid expansion of mobile phone telecommunications has brought with it huge benefits to individuals and the business community. Government are however taking seriously the concerns that people have that there might be health effects resulting from exposure to radiofrequency signals from this technology. It is for this reason that the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP) was set up under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para19">Sir William's expert group published its report on Mobile Phones and Health in May 2000 and it can be read in full on the website (www.iegmp.org.uk). The overall conclusion was that

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures to RF (radiofrequency) radiation below guidelines do not cause health effects to the general population."

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40202w18.html_para20">They went on to say that the emerging new technology should be accompanied by appropriate research and that a further review of the evidence for potential health effects should be reviewed in three years or earlier if circumstances demand it. These were just two of the 30 or so Stewart recommendations that have subsequently been acted upon by Government Departments or by the appropriate agencies.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para21">The siting of base stations was identified by the Stewart group as an issue of some concern. When they examined all the scientific evidence they concluded that

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines."

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40202w18.html_para22">About 300 measurements undertaken by the Radiocommunications Agency (RA), now part of Ofcom, have confirmed that public exposures are very much lower than the widely accepted guidelines published by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This information is available on the websites of these organisations: www.ofcom.org.uk and www.icnirp.de.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para23">Although the Stewart Group did not identify any adverse health effects caused by exposures by mobile phones or base stations they were aware that if people are unduly concerned about potential exposures then that in itself may affect their well-being. They made a number of recommendations, therefore, designed to provide more information about mobile phones and base stations. The Department of Health has produced a pair of leaflets and these can be seen on the Department's website www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones. A description of work undertaken by various organisations since the Stewart Report has been written by Dr. John W. Stather of the NRPB entitled "Mobile Phones and Health&#151;an Update". This article was published on the NRPB website http://www.nrpb.org/publications/bulletin/no3/article3.htm) in March 2003 and provides more detailed information on the issues.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para24">The sites of base stations in this country are now shown on the Sitefinder location of the Ofcom website www.ofcom.org.uk. Planning arrangements have been improved and a "Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone 



<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 2004 : Column 691W</I><P>
Network Development" has been developed with the aim of providing for more discussions between operators, local authorities and members of the public. The booklet and current planning arrangements (PPG8&#151;Policy Planning Guidance on Telecommunications) can be found on the ODPM website www.planning.odpm. gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para25">Over the last few years a number of groups have assessed the possible health effects of exposure to RF radiation such as from mobile phones and mobile phone masts. These include reports from Canada (1999), the Netherlands (2000), France (2001, 2003) and the British Medical Association (2001). These groups have come to broadly similar conclusions to the Stewart Report and have recommended further research. The new AGNIR review also supports the Stewart conclusions.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para26">Public interest in mobile phone base stations has been quite marked recently and a number of concerted campaigns against mobile phone masts have come to my attention. I am pleased that the AGNIR report has addressed this issue and concluded that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para27">Having considered research issues, AGNIR has helpfully made a number of specific recommendations that aim to improve the quality and interpretability of future health-related research and current health research programmes.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para28">The Government, in conjunction with industry, are already sponsoring a &#163;7.4&nbsp;million research programme in this country on a number of important health related issues identified in the Stewart Report. The research is being carried out under the management of an independent Programme Management Committee. The research is mainly concerned with users of mobile phone handsets as recommended in the Stewart Report but has recently decided to extend its range of studies to accommodate concerns about exposures from base stations. Full details of the research studies and the committee membership can be found on the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research website: www.mthr.org.uk. This programme represents a significant contribution to a world-wide research effort encompassing the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Union, the United States and others.
<P>

<a name="40202w18.html_para29">The Department continues to monitor research largely through the work of National Radiological Protection Board who have a statutory duty to advise on risks from all types of radiation.

<P>
<P>

 The high hedges provisions were introduced into the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill following extensive consultation in England and Wales and after lengthy discussions in Parliament as several Private Members' Bills failed to become law. The consultation showed widespread support for legislation to give local authorities in England and Wales the powers to deal with complaints about high hedges.
<P>

<a name="40202w20.html_para0">No similar consultation has been conducted in Northern Ireland and there is no solid evidence to suggest that legislation is necessary. We have kept our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office in touch with our proposals for England and Wales throughout.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w20.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Differences between induction centres and detention centres, which were renamed removal centres under section 66 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, are substantial. Induction Centres provide additional services for the asylum applicant, including health screening, and initiate the consideration of their asylum claim and support needs. Induction Centres provide short-term accommodation, where necessary, prior to dispersal. Accommodation and services are provided in a variety of buildings which are expected to have a low profile in the existing community. Asylum applicants staying in induction centres are not detained and are free to leave their accommodation. Removal centres provide safe and secure accommodation for those who are detained under immigration legislation. No facility acts as both a centre for induction and detention.

<a name="40202w20.html_para5">Of the 10,740 principal asylum applicants removed from the United Kingdom in 2002, 895 departed under the Voluntary Assisted Return Programmes (VARP). Information on the number of these who departed each month is not available. Data on the number departing under the VARP programmes in 2003 will be published at the end of August on the Home Office website: www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration.html

The International Organisation for Migration, which runs this programme on behalf of the Home Office, will assist the returnee prior to departure with counselling and independent advice. They will also help with travel arrangements, tickets etc.
<P>

<a name="40202w20.html_para8">On arrival in their country of origin the returnee can receive, if they so choose, reintegration assistance worth up to approximately &#163;500 (not cash). Reintegration assistance includes help in the country of origin to access existing services such as health, education and housing. Employment-related training and help to access available employment is also offered to enhance the sustainability of the return.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what conclusions the Department has reached on data collection methods for the assessment of the number of failed asylum seekers remaining in the UK.  [150332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w20.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is assumed that 'data collection' refers not to failed asylum seekers specifically but to work to assess the size of the illegally resident population in the UK. The Home Office has commissioned a review of methods used in other countries to estimate the size of their illegal populations. The research was commissioned in order to help define methods appropriate for the UK.




<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 2004 : Column 699W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40202w20.html_para10">The illegally resident population includes overstayers, clandestine entrants and workers in breach of their right to remain in the UK, as well as failed asylum seekers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what target for the removal of failed asylum seekers has been set.  [150334]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w20.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Our Public Service Agreement target for asylum removals is to remove a greater proportion of failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom. The Immigration Service, like other Government Departments, also has various internal measures against which its performance is monitored and managed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w20.html_wqn12"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are being taken to encourage participation in the Voluntary Assisted Return Programme.  [150335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w20.html_spnew12"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP) is widely advertised directly by the Home Office within the asylum system and through outreach and advice work by non-governmental and international organisations. Information on the programme can be found in Reporting Centres, Reception Centres and Removals Centres as well as from the Home Office website. Asylum seekers who have been refused asylum are sent an information sheet which gives details of how to return voluntarily. We also hold regular meetings with non-governmental and international organisations including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, UNHCR and IOM to discuss promotion of voluntary return. The voluntary sector organisations conduct outreach work with community groups directly to advise them of the option of voluntary return. The Home Office hosts meetings with Afghan community groups to raise the profile of voluntary return including the Return to Afghanistan Programme and the recently launched Afghan Explore and Prepare Programme.
<P>

<a name="40202w20.html_para11">In the first instance, those who are interested in returning home voluntarily are required to register their interest with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) who are co-funded by the Home Office and the European Refugee Fund (ERF) to operate VARRP.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w20.html_spnew13"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Strip searches of adult detainees in immigration removal centres may take place only on the basis of specific evidence or intelligence of a risk to the safety and security of the centre, its staff or other detainees. Central records of the number of such searches are not maintained and the information requested is therefore available only at disproportionate cost.

 The booking of flights for the removal of asylum seekers is not centrally co-ordinated by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate but is made by the immigration office dealing with the individual case.
<P>

<a name="40202w20.html_para12">Where the removal is to be effected at the expense of the inbound carrier under the provisions of paragraphs 8 and 9 of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, arrangements will be made directly with the carrier. If removal is to be effected at public expense under paragraph 10 of the same schedule they will be made via the travel company contracted to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate for that purpose. In these cases there is a central unit in the Immigration Service which provides a ticket procurement and payment function for these bookings. These arrangements apply in all removal cases and there are no separate processes for those who have sought asylum here.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w21.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Bill provides that families whose asylum claims have failed would no longer be entitled to support at the expense of the taxpayer if they refuse opportunities to leave the country. If parents fail to take these opportunities to leave and put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of the children should be protected under the existing child protection legislation that applies to all children. We do not believe that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position. If this were to happen, the costs would be met by central Government.

 The new clause brought forward by way of Government amendment to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill will allow an Immigration Officer to require a carrier (UK or overseas based) to provide either a full or partial copy of any document relating to a passenger and containing information about that passenger. A carrier would only have to provide copies of documents on written request. This will help deal with the significant number of asylum seekers who deliberately destroy their travel documents.
<P>

<a name="40202w22.html_para2">Consultation with carriers began on 27&nbsp;October 2003 and continues through correspondence and meetings. The Home Office has received a range of cost estimates from a number of carriers. There are currently joint discussions over the practical details of a trial to provide a more precise estimate of the costs involved and to test the process.
<P>

<a name="40202w22.html_para3">This power will not be implemented unless the trial has demonstrated that this is practical and cost-effective. This power would not be applied universally but would be deployed on selected routes as and when there was a problem with undocumented arrivals. The power will be capable of being invoked in respect of any ship or aircraft which has arrived/is expected to arrive in the UK or which has departed/is expected to depart from the UK, regardless of which port that ship or aircraft arrived/will arrive at or will depart/has departed from. It is, therefore, not necessary to designate or list departure points for the purposes of the use of the power.
<P>

<a name="40202w22.html_para4">The proposal is for the criminal offence in section 27(b)&nbsp;(iv) of the Immigration Act 1971 to apply in respect of the new power. The offence in section 27(b)&nbsp;(iv) of the Immigration Act 1971 is not committed if the carrier has a "reasonable excuse" for failing to comply with the request. This means that it would be a criminal offence, punishable on summary conviction with a fine of not more than level five on the standard scale or with a maximum of six months imprisonment, or with both, for a carrier to fail to comply with a request to copy documents, without reasonable excuse. It is anticipated that a carrier would decline to carry any passenger who refused to allow their document to be carried.

<a name="40202w22.html_para5">The Home Office will be responsible for the retention and disposal of any copies.

 Most provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) have been implemented in Northern Ireland. The final provisions of part III of the DDA concerning the rights of access to goods, facilities, services and premises will be implemented in October 2004 when service providers may have to make 'reasonable adjustments' in relation to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.

<a name="40202w25.html_para0">Part V of the DDA allows for accessibility standards to be set for public transport.

Draft measures will have regard to taxi accessibility proposals announced for England and Wales in October 2003 and will form part of a wide range of measures to reform taxi regulation emerging from the on-going NI Review of Taxi Regulation.

The provision also provides that such a driver may be exempted from this obligation on medical grounds. It is the Department's intention to extend similar provisions under section 37A to licensed drivers of private hire vehicles in mid 2004.
<P>

<a name="40202w25.html_para2">The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations (NI) 2003 came into operation on 30&nbsp;April 2003.

They are also intended to ensure that disabled people are carried in these vehicles in safety and in reasonable comfort e.g., they provide for wheelchair spaces, boarding lifts and ramps, suitable entrances and exits, handrails and kneeling systems.

<a name="40202w25.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what estimate he has made of the number of estate agents who have been subject to violent threats to deter their provision of services and letting of properties to members of ethnic minority groups; and what steps have been taken by the police to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;identify and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;prosecute those responsible.

 In recent weeks the media reported that an estate agent in the Donegal Road area of Belfast had suffered intimidation from unknown persons who attempted to deter him from offering his services and letting property to members of ethnic minority groups, however no complaint has been made to the police in South Belfast by any estate agent.
<P>

<a name="40202w25.html_para5">As a result of these media reports, police officers contacted estate agents in the Donegal Road Area that let property about these allegations; however no estate agents subsequently reported any form of intimidation against them concerning their letting practices.

 The Department of Education is currently working with the Education and Library Boards and other school authorities to update the information held on the number of temporary classrooms in the school estate. This information will be supplied to you when the results of the survey are available.
<P>

<a name="40202w25.html_para6">There is no average replacement time forecast for temporary accommodation. It is replaced based on the educational need and the resources available. Through the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative, &#163;15&nbsp;million was made available over the past two years specifically to remove temporary classrooms from 52 schools. Over the next two years, a further &#163;16&nbsp;million will be made available for this purpose. In addition, over the past four years major capital projects totalling some &#163;650&nbsp;million have been announced and this investment will also contribute to further reductions in temporary accommodation as these schemes come to fruition in the coming years.

 The London 2012 Olympic bid team included Windsor Park as a proposed venue for preliminary rounds of the Olympic football tournament, should the London bid be successful.

 It is not possible to provide details of the number of persons arrested or charged for such offences as the offences which they have been charged with are defined as assault occasioning actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm. Police statistics do not identify whether such crimes were the result of paramilitary attacks. Police investigations into these crimes are often hampered by the victims' reluctance to co-operate with them.

 The Department of Education does not collect information about the number of pupils who move schools as a result of bullying. Parents move their children from one school to another for a variety of reasons, which may include alleged bullying. However, there is no requirement for parents to advise any statutory agency of the reasons for the move. The Department recognises that bullying in whatever form and for whatever reason, have no place in schools. The Department has issued comprehensive guidance to all schools about how to tackle bullying. Further, the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 2003, which came into operation on 1&nbsp;April 2003, places a duty on all grant-aided schools to have an anti-bullying policy and to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 My Department, in conjunction with other criminal justice agencies, is actively addressing the problems of ineffective and cracked trials. The CJS PSA2 seeks to bring 1.2&nbsp;million offenders to justice by 2006 and to reduce the proportion of ineffective trials. My Department aims to cut the ineffective rate in the crown court from 24&nbsp;per cent. to 17&nbsp;per cent. and in the magistrates court from 31&nbsp;per cent. to 23&nbsp;per cent. To monitor progress, interim targets have been set for April 2004 of 20.4&nbsp;per cent. in crown court and 26.5&nbsp;per cent. in the magistrates court. Following changes to a more victim and witness focused listing system with greater emphasis on trials being effective, over-listing in the crown court has reduced and the ineffective rate has reduced to 19.7&nbsp;per cent. over the last quarter. Progress in the magistrates court has been slower, which reflects the more diverse nature of the business, but is now achieving a rate of 28.8&nbsp;per cent. New targets to lower the rate further in 2004&#150;05 are currently being agreed.
<P>

<a name="40202w28.html_para0">My Department is working with the Home Office, the CPS and the judiciary to address the problems of cracked trials in a number of ways. The most important of these is the tri-lateral Effective Trial Management Programme, which will introduce a Criminal Case Management Framework, which clearly sets out the procedure to be 



<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 2004 : Column 728W</I><P>
followed in each type of case. This framework will be supported by a new soon to be established Criminal Procedure Rule Committee.
<P>

<a name="40202w28.html_para1">There will also be provision for judges and magistrates to give an early indication of sentence. These measures, coupled with the CPS taking responsibility for charging and the work being done to support witnesses, will reduce the number of cracked trials and those where the prosecution ends the case or offers no evidence. My Department has an effective performance management system in place which will ensure that the proportion of cracked and ineffective trials will reduce and is currently appointing Case Progression Officers to each area to work closely with other agencies to ensure greater certainty that cases listed proceed as planned.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister in what circumstances private homes owned by Her Majesty's forces qualify for a council tax discount.  [151646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Private homes owned by Her Majesty's forces will qualify for council tax discounts in the same way as private homes owned by anyone else. For example, there will be a 25&nbsp;per cent. discount if it is the taxpayer's sole or main residence and the taxpayer lives by themselves, or if they share with a full time student. If the taxpayer has two private homes, the second home will be subject to a discount. The amount of that discount can be anything from 10&nbsp;per cent. to 50&nbsp;per cent., depending on whether the billing authority has passed a resolution to reduce the statutory discount of 50&nbsp;per cent. The power to reduce that discount came into force on 18&nbsp;December 2003 for the financial year 2004&#150;05 onwards. In addition, billing authorities now have the power to reduce the amount of council tax which a person is liable to pay in respect of a dwelling. Billing authorities therefore have discretion in effect to grant additional local discounts.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister on what basis the calculation in Cm 3897, page 81, paragraph 6.33 was made that a Band D council tax payer would pay an extra three pence on his or her council tax bill to contribute to the costs of the Mayor, Assembly and new central services; and what the current precept for Band D council tax payers is.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The calculation in Cm 3897 was based on an initial Government estimate of the cost of the Mayor, Assembly and central services before their creation. It is for the Mayor to determine the level of Greater London Authority (GLA) precept. In 2003&#150;04 the total GLA precept for a Band D council taxpayer is &#163;4.31 per week outside the City of London and &#163;1.25 per week in the City of London. Approximately 13.6p a week of this is for the Mayor, Assembly and central services.

 The Government's plans for the Thames Gateway region, including south Essex, are set out in Creating Sustainable Communities: Making It Happen in the Thames Gateway and Growth Areas, published on 30&nbsp;July 2003. That document makes it clear that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be establishing a Gateway delivery office to work alongside local, regional and national partners to turn strategic plans into operational programmes. The Gateway office will be responsible for monitoring implementation of the Government's plans and for communicating progress. It is anticipated that the office will be up and running shortly.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[pursuant to his answer, 26&nbsp;January 2004, Official Report, c. 6]</i>: I need to correct that answer. Ceramic body armour (ceramic plates) has been issued since 1992 when an initial issue of 32 individual plates was made. Each soldier requires one pair of plates. Combat Body Armour or Enhanced Combat Body Armour is not usually issued as a complete set.
<P>

<a name="40202w32.html_para0">Instead, units request the number of components (covers, fillers and individual plates) required to make up the sets that they need. Current estimates of the issue history of ceramic plates since their introduction into service show an average of approximately 4,000 issues a year up to 1999 when nearly 23,000 were issued. Most recently in 2003 more than 80,000 individual ceramic plates were issued.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which equipment purchased under urgent operational requirements for the Iraq war will be sold; how much it cost to acquire; how much its sale is expected to realise; and to whom it is intended to be sold.  [148162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w32.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The principal focus of the Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) process is to provide additional capabilities to meet the demands of specific operations. The majority of equipment purchased for Operation Telic under UOR procedures continues to be used in support of that operation.
<P>

<a name="40202w32.html_para1">When an operation comes to an end or particular UOR equipment is withdrawn, the Department considers, as part of the annual planning round, whether that equipment can and should be retained in-service. That process is currently under way: it is therefore too early to say which UORs will be retained in-service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer to the hon.

[150356]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40202w32.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 To date eight military vehicles have been identified as having been hit by depleted uranium (DU) munitions within the southern sector of Iraq under British military control. All these vehicles have been clearly marked. Arrangements are currently being negotiated with the US for a contractor to collect and securely store these military vehicles.
<P>

<a name="40202w32.html_para2">Generic assessments of the potential risks from DU munitions have been carried out by organisations such as the Royal Society and the United Nations Environment Programme and are available on the world wide web at: www.postconflict.unep.ch/ and www.royalsociety.ac.uk/du/ The levels of DU contamination found by MOD personnel are much lower than those predicted from these theoretical risk assessments.

<P>
<UL>(2) whether all British troops serving in winter conditions during the winter of 2004&#150;05 in Iraq will be issued with appropriate winter footwear;  [150892]

 There is no need for soldiers to purchase their own winter footwear for Iraq. Soldiers currently serving in Iraq have deployed with both Desert Boots and Combat Assault Boots. Combat Assault Boots are suitable for a minimum temperature of minus 19 degrees centigrade and are appropriate for the temperatures experienced in southern Iraq during the winter months.
