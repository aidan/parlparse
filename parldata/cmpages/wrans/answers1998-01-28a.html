<a name="80128w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he expects the Appeals Committee to consider the application made on 21 May for leave to appeal to the House of Lords in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Reeman of Brixham and the Department of Transport. [25942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The petition for leave to appeal has been considered by an Appeal Committee and was refused on 26 January 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what representations he has received from the Law Society on its proposals for a Contingency Legal Aid Fund, and what assessment he has made of the options proposed for setting up such a fund. [25871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The President of the Law Society wrote to me on 16 December 1997 enclosing a paper entitled "A proposal by the Law Society to link legal aid and conditional fees". I am considering the proposal and I am due to meet the President shortly to discuss it further. No final decisions will be taken about this, or any other representations, until the consultation paper has been issued and all the responses received.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on his Department's policy towards the funding of Legal Aid Board franchises, with particular reference to Citizens Advice Bureaux. [25869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board is piloting contracts for advice and assistance services provided by both solicitors and not-for-profit agencies, including Citizens Advice Bureaux. These contracts allow contract-holders meeting the franchise quality standard to provide advice, assistance and some limited representation. The pilot began in 1994.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para0">On 14 January the Lord Chancellor asked the Legal Aid Board to construct an implementation plan to achieve the objective of delivering all advice and assistance through fixed-price contracts with quality-assured suppliers by the end of 1999. These contracts will include contracts with the not-for-profit advice sector, of which the Citizens Advice Bureaux form a part, in an expansion of the original pilot.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para1">22 Citizens Advice Bureaux participated in the first phase of the pilot with contracts in 1996-97 to the value of &#163;1,722,000 out of a total budget of &#163;3 million.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 222</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para2">Approximately 200 organisations, including more than 70 Citizen Advice Bureaux, are likely to be offered contracts in 1998-99. The Board has been allocated up to &#163;14 million within its PES allocation for legal aid to support these contracts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what representations he has received with regard to the future funding of those disbursements and up-front costs in civil cases which at present receive legal aid for those purposes; and if he will make a statement. [25870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have received many representations on our plans for reform of legal aid which refer to the problems of funding disbursements and up-front costs. The wide consultation we are undertaking is partly aimed at looking at ways of meeting these costs, either through lawyers funding these as a business cost, or by lawyers sharing the risk with insurers, banks or other funders. It may be that in certain types of case public funds may be necessary where there is no alternative.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he plans to introduce a merits test on legally aided civil cases of 75 per cent. [25868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We intend to introduce a flexible legal aid merits test that can take account of the priority and importance of different types of case. Changing the merits test will require primary legislation. We intend to bring forward a Bill that will fundamentally reform the legal aid scheme, as soon as Parliamentary time allows.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. John M. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the preparedness of <i>(a)</i> his Department, <i>(b)</i> the Land Registry and <i>(c)</i> the Public Record Office for the computer consequences of the arrival of the year 2000. [25430]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Comprehensive plans for the achievement of Year 2000 compliance in the Department, its Agencies and other bodies which report to the Lord Chancellor, including the Land Registry and the Public Record Office, were delivered to the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency in October 1997. They have since been placed in the public domain. The plans document in detail areas of vulnerability and the remedial action required to combat the Year 2000 problem.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para3">A supplement to the plans was issued in December 1997 and quarterly progress reports will also be made available. The first of these will be prepared shortly, for publication in March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the procedure for appointing members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. [25509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Membership of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council derives from the occupancy of certain judicial and ministerial posts. The membership comprises the Lord Chancellor, the present and former Lords President of the Council, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 223</I><P>
and those other members as shall from time to time hold or have held high judicial office. In practice this also includes the Heads of the Divisions of the Supreme Court, members of the Court of Appeal and those judges of the Court of Session and Supreme Court of Northern Ireland who are members of the Privy Council.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para4">Retired judges in these categories who have not yet attained the compulsory retirement date of 75 are also members.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para5">Serving and retired judges of certain Commonwealth superior courts who are members of the Privy Council are members of the Judicial Committee by virtue of the Judicial Committee Amendment Act 1895, as amended by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1908.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list the membership of the Judicial Committee of the Privy 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 224</I><P>
Council indicating their <i>(a)</i> age, <i>(b)</i> legal jurisdiction of origin and <i>(c)</i> membership of other public bodies; and if he will make a statement. [25508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Those who are eligible to sit as members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council include the present and former Lords President of the Council and those members of the Privy Council, not over the age of 75, who hold or have held any of the following high judicial offices: Lord Chancellor, Lord of Appeal in Ordinary or judge of a superior court of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Membership of the Judicial Committee extends to serving and retired judges of certain Commonwealth superior courts who are members of the Privy Council.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para6">I list below the names of the members together with the other information requested, where available. By convention, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are the regular judges of the court, drawing occasional assistance from the Commonwealth and retired judges.
<P>

<a name="80128w01.html_para7">I have no plans to make a statement.

 The estimated net cost to public funds of VED evasion by heavy goods vehicles was &#163;19 million in 1996-97. The enforcement cost to DVLA in the same period is estimated at &#163;200,000.

<a name="80128w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Europe-wide controls on the transport of dangerous goods apply to the Channel Tunnel. Over and above these, special additional restrictions apply to Eurotunnel's dangerous goods policy, approved by the Intergovernmental Commission on the advice of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority (CTSA). The policy approved in 1994 was reviewed as a consequence of the fire in the Channel Tunnel on 18 November 1996, and some further restrictions were introduced as a result in June 1997, when HGV Shuttle services were allowed to resume operations.

 The latest figures held centrally relating to the overall passenger rail network are contained in the British Railways Board's annual report and accounts and show the number of vehicles owned by the Board as at 31 March for each of the years 1990-95 inclusive. These are shown in the table. The rolling stock leasing companies who now own most of the passenger rolling stock, were privatised in 1995. Figures for subsequent years are not held centrally.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> Some of the information contained in the documents requested is of a commercially confidential nature: the release of such information in to the public arena could be prejudicial to future negotiations with our bilateral partners. It would therefore not be appropriate to place the information in the House Library.

<P>
<a name="80128w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The original estimate by National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) for the capital expenditure at the Swanwick Centre, made in July 1989, was &#163;215.5 million at 1988-99 prices, which equates to &#163;313 million at 1997-98 prices. A reappraisal of the project was approved by the Government in December 1991, with a new budget of &#163;310.2 million at 1990 prices. Using actual inflation indices, this gives an actual costs budget of &#163;350.7 million--NATS still expects to be within this budget.
<P>

<a name="80128w03.html_para0">The original operational date for the Swanwick Centre, given in July 1989, was November 1996. The current target date is the winter of 1999-2000. The major causes of the delay were <i>(a)</i> problems with the integration of 23 software sub-systems, and <i>(b)</i> the need for additional functions in the system, which was identified following testing of the system by air traffic controllers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on what occasions Eurotunnel has asked <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority to refrain from publishing information relating to the safety of the Channel Tunnel; and on what occasions it has invoked clause 33.3 of the Channel Tunnel Treaty to prevent publication. [25959]<P>

<P>
<a name="80128w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There have been no such occasions in either case. My Department, and the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, both abide by the terms of Clause 33.3 of the Channel Tunnel Concession Agreement, but these do not prevent the Safety Authority from publishing its own reports, such as the eight Annual Reports published to date, the 1989 Report into non-segregation of tourist shuttle passengers from their vehicles, and the 1997 Report into the fire on HGV Shuttle 7539.

<P>
<a name="80128w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I am satisfied that the requirements of Clause 33.3 of the Channel Tunnel Concession Agreement enable adequate information to be published. Eurotunnel is free to publish the safety information which it produces, and the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority publishes an annual report on its activities, covering all aspects of Channel Tunnel safety. Copies of this report are placed in the Library.

<a name="80128w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The previous Government's planned public expenditure total provided &#163;13.5 million for 1998-99, compared to this year's &#163;19 million. We have allocated an additional &#163;5.5 million to the Trust, to avoid the previous Government's planned cut, and to maintain Government support for the Trust. This allocation of grant support reflects the contribution which energy efficiency makes both to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and to reducing consumers' energy bills. The increased allocation will enable the Trust to maintain and develop its successful programmes, and will secure the Trust's capability to plan for the climate change task ahead. For the present year, the Secretary of State has allocated the Trust an additional &#163;450,000, to enable it to extend its successful 'Energy Efficiency' promotion campaign and extend other successful programmes.

 Local Education Authorities have the discretion to continue paying grant to students holding mandatory awards who, with the permission of their academic authority, are absent from their courses. We have issued detailed guidance to LEAs on how to approach the question of payments for students who are absent through sickness. It encouraged LEAs to take a sympathetic and positive view when dealing with sick students, and to bear in mind that they are not immediately eligible for benefits. Sick students may become eligible for Income Support and other benefits only where the period of illness has continued for 28 weeks or more. It is right for LEAs to have discretion in this area and I have no plans to change the present position in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="80128w04.html_para0">One of the eligibility criteria for obtaining a student loan is that students must be attending their courses. Students who leave their courses for any reason, including sickness, cease to be eligible until they return to their course.

<P>

<a name="80128w04.html_para4">Opportunities for young people on the Environment Task Force will be as broad and inclusive as possible and will, where possible include opportunities for young people to become involved in the regeneration of their local communities for example on housing, reclamation, recycling and conservation projects.

<P>
<a name="80128w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 It is a principle of the design of the New Deal that young people should be helped to choose the option most appropriate for them. Accordingly, we have not estimated the number of child care opportunities likely to be pursued under each New Deal option. We expect, however, that many of the placements will be found under the Voluntary Sector option of the New Deal, with further opportunities under the Employment and Full Time Education or Training options.

 The sectors for which my Department is responsible--arts, museums, libraries, sport, tourism, the built heritage, the music industry, film and broadcasting--are central to delivering improvements to the quality of life for everyone. In all these sectors our objective is to ensure access for the many, not just the few, whether as audience or participant.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para1">The arts, sport and broadcasting have a widely accepted role in promoting social cohesion, and in providing through formal and informal education the necessary skills which individuals need to develop socially and at work.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para2">Public libraries are a vital focus for the community, offering a source of information and advice to help the unemployed into work or training, and free access to sources of learning and enjoyment for all.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para3">All our sectors are supporting the New Deal. The tourism industry in particular has the potential to provide many new job opportunities over the next few years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The consultation period closed on 11 April 1997. One hundred and sixty one organisations and individuals submitted responses. I am grateful to them for taking the trouble to address the issues which the consultation paper discussed, and for submitting their views. I have placed a summary of the results of the consultation exercise in the Libraries of the House.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 239</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para6">The Government believe that it is extremely important to ensure that material published in this country is incorporated into our national archive irrespective of the medium used. The arrangements for legal deposit, which are concerned primarily with published material in print form, underpin the nation's academic, research and educational sectors. We intend to ensure that these benefits extend also to material published in format other than print. But in so doing, we recognise the need to minimise the burden that such arrangements might place on the publishing industry.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para7">I am therefore establishing a working group, chaired by Sir Anthony Kenny, comprising representatives of the British Library and legal deposit libraries, the British Film Institute, and publishing sectors. The working group will be asked:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) To advise on how an effective nation archive of non-print material might be achieved, taking into account the need to minimise the burden on publishers, the need to safeguard deposited material from unauthorised use, the archival value of the material, and the scope for making deposited material available among legal deposit libraries through secure IT networks;
<P>
<BR>
(ii) To draw up and agree a voluntary code of practice to achieve deposit of electronic and microform publications until such time as the Government may decide to introduce legislation;
<P>
<BR>
(ii) To ensure that such arrangements are compatible, where appropriate, with the existing arrangements for the voluntary deposit of films and sound recordings;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="80128w05.html_para8">The Government will keep under review the case for introducing legislation to extend legal deposit to these additional categories of publication. We will take account of the working group's recommendations and the extent to which the voluntary code meets the reasonable current and future needs of those requiring access to deposit material.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para9">The Government do not for the present plan to make any amendments to the system for print publications under which up to six copies are deposited, although we will expect the legal deposit libraries to operate together 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 240</I><P>
to ensure that the burden on publishers is reduced through greater selectivity and co-operation. The working group will therefore also be asked:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) To advise on the scope for developing the existing arrangements for the deposit of printed publications with a view to ensuring greater co-operation between the different legal deposit libraries, encouraging greater selectivity in the material claimed from publishers, and the scope for developing IT networking solutions which can in the longer term be used to reduced the statutory burden on publishers in complying with the deposit arrangements.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="80128w05.html_para10">In the light of the responses to the consultation paper, we are not convinced that there is a sufficient case for establishing an additional legal deposit library in Northern Ireland. Users of legal deposit material who live in Northern Ireland are able to gain access to it at the other legal deposit libraries. It would also take many years for an additional legal deposit library to build up a collection which would provide significant benefits to users.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para11">I have, however, asked the working group to include in its work under item (i) examination of the scope for improved access in Northern Ireland to deposited material through IT networking. A representative from Northern Ireland will be appointed to the working group.
<P>

<a name="80128w05.html_para12">I have asked the Working Group to report to me on these matters within six months.

 School nurses employed by the National Health Service hospital and community health services are not separately identifiable from other community nursing staff within the non-medical workforce censuses conducted by the Department of Health after 1994. Consequently, figures for 1995 and 1996 are not available centrally. In addition to the number of school nurses, the table gives the numbers of schools and school children, as changes to the ratios can be the result of changes to these components as well as changes to the numbers of nurses.

<a name="80128w08.html_para0">The capital cost of a scheme in the OBC (or equivalent) is not necessarily comparable with the capital cost of the facility provided under the PFI. The capital cost in the OBC is based on the scheme being funded from limited public capital whereas under PFI the same constraints on capital do not exist. PFI allows Trusts to develop schemes which transfer risks from the public sector to the private sector and offer the best value for money to the taxpayer.
 Only the projects that prove to be affordable to the healthcare planners, value for money to the taxpayer and offer real healthcare improvements to the public will proceed under PFI.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) if she plans to alter the child benefit extension period school leaving dates to bring these regulations into line with the Education (School Leaving Date) Order 1997; and if the existing rules will still apply in Scotland where there has been no change to school leaving dates; [24012]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many school leaving dates there will be per year in future for the purposes of child benefit regulations in the case of young persons who leave relevant education after the terminal date based on their date of birth. [24014]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Education (School Leaving Date) Order 1997 relates only to children in England and Wales who are approaching the end of their compulsory full-time education. There is no necessity for any change to the regulations governing the Child Benefit Extension Period, which apply to school leavers aged 16 or 17 throughout Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="80128w09.html_para6">From September 1997, children in England and Wales who reach age 16 during the academic year are required to remain in full-time education until the end of the summer term. Those who choose to remain in education beyond compulsory school leaving age may leave at any time.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 257</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80128w09.html_para7">Child Benefit Regulations prescribe three fixed dates on which Child Benefit may cease for a child leaving full time education. These are the first Monday in January, the Monday after Easter and the first Monday in September. When a child leaves school at the end of the summer term, Child Benefit may continue up to the first Monday in September, providing the child does not start work or youth training and the other conditions of entitlement are met.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how benefit entitlement will be affected in the case of a young person educated in Scotland who moves to England or Wales after being entitled to leave school under Scottish law, but who is still too young to have left in England or Wales. [24013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The benefit entitlement of a person who has legally left school in Scotland will not be affected if they move to England or Wales before they would be able to legally leave school in that country. This is because the date that a person legally leaves school in Scotland will continue to be used to decide when young people cease being treated as a "child" for benefit purposes, regardless of which part of Great Britain they claim in.

<P>
<a name="80128w12.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Qualifying costs of decommissioning oil and gas installations are allowable for Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) purposes. They also attract a special 100 per cent. capital allowance for Corporation Tax (CT) purposes. The level of tax relief available for decommissioning the installations of a field therefore depends on the extent to which the field has paid PRT and the companies which own it pay CT.
<P>

<a name="80128w12.html_para0">The Department of Trade and Industry currently estimates that the total costs of decommissioning existing offshore installations over the next 25 years could be in the region of &#163;7 billion to &#163;10 billion at today's prices. On average, about half those costs are expected to be met from the Exchequer by way of tax relief.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The cost of reducing VAT on domestic fuel from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. is estimated to be &#163;485 million in 1998-99. This is split between income deciles in the table together with the gain to households as a percentage of their net income.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The saving on the UK's net contribution to the EC which my right hon. Friend announced in November reflected the difference between the forecast of net payments to EC Institutions in the previous Government's expenditure plans for 1997-98 and the actual net payments the Government now expects to make for 1997-98, which are based on more recent information. The saving was therefore not directly derived from specific items of underspending in the EC Budget; indeed the previous forecast published in November 1996 Financial Statement and Budget Report had assumed an element of underspending.

In addition, the supply of such items from the UK or supply abroad by UK registered companies and nationals is prohibited by Orders in Council under the United Nations Act 1946. From time to time, the contents of the Military List may change, for example, to reflect technological advances or continuing international efforts to counter the proliferations of weapons of mass destruction.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the funding and registration of political parties. [26514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government are committed to reforming the system of party funding. On 12 November 1997, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister asked the Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by Lord Neill, to review issues in relation to the funding of political parties and recommend any changes in present arrangements. At that time, it was the Government's intention to legislate in this Session to deliver our manifesto commitment to ban foreign funding of political parties and to demand disclosure of donations above &#163;5,000.
<P>

<a name="80128w14.html_para8">Since then, Lord Neill and the members of his Committee have reached the view that it would be preferable for the Government not to proceed with the funding aspects of proposed legislation at the same time. In a letter to me, dated 26 January, Lord Neill explained why he is particularly concerned about simultaneous consideration of these issues by Parliament and the Committee.
<P>

<a name="80128w14.html_para9">In response, I have therefore decided not to introduce legislation on the funding of political parties in this Session of Parliament. I have placed in the Library a copy of Lord Neill's letter, together with a copy of my reply.
<P>

<a name="80128w14.html_para10">Lord Neill has made it clear that the Committee is considering not whether the Government's two specific manifesto commitments should be fulfilled, but how best to do so. The Government remain firmly committed to legislate in this area and will bring forward proposals in the light of the recommendations of the Neill Committee. This will enable us to bring forward a comprehensive and effective package of measures.
<P>

<a name="80128w14.html_para11">The registration of political parties is necessary to enable the electoral systems proposed for the European Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly to function effectively and to deal with misleading descriptions on ballot papers. I intend to introduce the Bill on this subject later in this Session.

<P>
<a name="80128w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In the six-month period between 1 July and 31 December 1997, a total of 435 applications for asylum in the United Kingdom, excluding dependants, were lodged by nationals of Algeria. During the same period, a total of 265 decisions, excluding dependants, were made on asylum applications lodged by Algerian nationals. Of these, 80 (30 per cent.) were to grant asylum, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 276</I><P>
five (2 per cent.) were to refuse asylum but grant exceptional leave and 180 (68 per cent.) were to refuse both asylum and exceptional leave.
<P>

<a name="80128w15.html_para0">Provisional data indicate that, during the period 1 July to 31 December 1997, a total of 68 Algerian asylum seekers were removed or made voluntary departures from the United Kingdom. Of these, a total of 13 persons, who had been refused asylum in the United Kingdom, were removed to Algeria. During the same period, a further five asylum seekers were recorded as having made a voluntary departure to Algeria. Many of the others have been removed, or have made voluntary departures, to safe third countries. The available data exclude any in-country applicants who make a voluntary departure prior to the initiation of enforcement action.
<P>

<a name="80128w15.html_para1">All asylum applications are considered in accordance with the United Kingdom's international obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and the risk to the individual is assessed on its merits. In addition, if the granting of asylum is not appropriate, consideration is given to whether there are compelling humanitarian reasons to grant permission to remain in the United Kingdom exceptionally. In cases of applications from Algerian citizens, particular care is being taken in the light of the current situation in Algeria.
<P>

<a name="80128w15.html_para2">Both Ministers and officials receive and take account of advice and information from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on this. Information provided by non-governmental organisations is regularly reviewed by the Country Information and Policy Unit of the Asylum Directorate. Although no specific meetings have been held to discuss the situation in Algeria with members of the various refugee groups, such as the Refugee Council, they have expressed their concerns to Ministers in a wider context. In addition, we have invited a number of organisations closely connected with the asylum determination process to discuss country information issues.
<P>

<a name="80128w15.html_para3">The cases of all rejected asylum seekers from Algeria will be reviewed individually just before removal, in the light of detailed advice from UNHCR, and to take account of the latest information and advice from other sources. No one will be returned to Algeria unless it is reasonable to believe that they could be so safely. A declaration of upheaval under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 will be made if the situation in Algeria is such as to constitute an upheaval throughout the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 A total of 53 Algerian nationals who had sought asylum at some stage were recorded as being detained solely under Immigration Act powers as at 5 January 1998 (port cases) and 6 January 1998 (after entry cases). Detention is used sparingly and only where there are good grounds for believing that a person will not comply with the terms of temporary admission, regardless of nationality.

 The available information is given in the table.

<a name="80128w15.html_para4">I regret that comprehensive data on the final destination of those Algerian asylum seekers removed from the United Kingdom since 1990 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, a recent exercise indicated that, of the 68 Algerian asylum seekers who were removed (or departed voluntarily) between 1 July and 31 December 1997, 13 were removed to Algeria and a further five were recorded as having made a voluntary departure to that country. Many of the others have been removed, or have made voluntary departures, to safe third countries. These data are provisional and exclude any in-country applicants who make a voluntary departure prior to the initiation of enforcement action.

 Her Majesty's Prison Parc, Bridgend, opened with the provision of 50 available prisoner places on 17 November 1997, four weeks ahead of programme.
<P>

<a name="80128w16.html_para2">In the first four weeks of operation, the prisoner population at Parc increased in line with the contractual programme of 50 per week. During the four-week period commencing 15 December 1997, the number of prisoners sent to Parc by the courts dropped significantly as a result of the usual seasonal downturn over the Christmas/new year period, which resulted in an overall fall of about 2,400 in the number of prisoners held in England and Wales. Some prisoners were transferred to Parc from Cardiff and Swansea prisons but, because overcrowding had reduced nationally, it was decided on operational grounds not to disrupt prisoners by transferring them over long distances during December to prisons where there were vacancies or where population pressures were much lower, such as Her Majesty's Prison Parc.
<P>

<a name="80128w16.html_para3">The prisoner population at Parc is now building up at a rate agreed between the Prison Service and the contractor, and full occupancy of 800 places is expected to be achieved no later than the week commencing 23 March 1998.
<P>

<a name="80128w16.html_para4">The cost to the Prison Service of unused places at Parc, from opening date to 21 January 1998 inclusive, is &#163;368,000.

 During 1997, curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring were imposed on 516 men and 49 women. Of these, 11 men and three women had two separate curfew orders imposed on them during the year.
<P>

<a name="80128w16.html_para5">Because of considerations of commercial confidentiality, it would not be appropriate to publish details of the payments made to contractors which are the major part of the costs of curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer leads on debt policy, but my Department has a key interest in ensuring the rapid and flexible implementation of debt reduction measures for the poorest most-indebted countries. Debt relief, coupled with economic policies that benefit the poor, has an important part to play in creating the conditions for the sustained economic growth needed to eliminate poverty in poorer countries. We seek to work closely with other donors and creditors in order to achieve this objective. In recent weeks, I have had discussions with the development Ministries of most of our EU partners, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and the President of the African Development Bank. Last month, the Chancellor and I met representatives of the churches and leading NGOs, to discuss how we would work together to make faster progress.

 Copies of Welsh Office letters dated 11 and 19 December to local authority Chief Executives setting out the arrangements for the &#163;50,267 million additional revenue funding for schools have been placed in the Library of the House. The advice follows discussions with the Welsh Local Government Association. We expect to see the bulk of the funding included in delegated school budgets, and I will be monitoring the outcome.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the current work on compiling shoreline management plans will be completed for England; and how this work will relate to the disbursement of funds for shoreline management and coastal defence works. [24813] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department has encouraged coastal defence groups to develop shoreline management plans to cover the whole coastline of England. The jointly agreed target is for plans to be completed by the end of 1998. Where shoreline management plans are in place it is expected that proposed works will be consistent with them. The disbursement of Ministry funding for flood and coastal defence works, and related studies, is made on the basis of the priority score arrangements, which take account of Ministerial priority, urgency and benefit cost ratio.

<P>
<P>

 The Government recognise the impact of currency movements on agriculture, but it is difficult to assess these effects precisely. UK farmers received a substantial degree of protection from the impact of currency movements for their receipts under the CAP through the EU agri-monetary system.

[25064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have no information on the amount of seaweed used as a fertiliser in the United Kingdom. The Ministry does not have information on the bio-accumulation of toxic materials in seaweed. Radioactivity concentrations in seaweed sampled from around the coasts of the British Isles are given in the annual Radioactivity in Food and the Environment report published by the Ministry. The bio-accumulation or concentration factors for various radionuclides in seaweed have been published by the International Atomic Energy Authority in Technical Report No. 247 (1985).

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Townend: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will define the method of application of the principle of relative stability <i>(a)</i> from 1983 to 2002 and <i>(b)</i> from 2003 onwards. [24983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The purpose of relative stability is to maintain the percentage share of total allowable catches which each Member State receives although, in the case of stocks covered by Hague Preference, the percentage shares can be adjusted when total allowable catches fall below predetermined levels. Relative stability has taken this form since 1983. It will continue in this way from 2003 unless the Council of Ministers decides otherwise.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Townend: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the principle of relative stability was established; and by which Article in which Regulation and under which Article in which Regulation the principle is presently established. [24984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The principle of relative stability in the allocation of fishing quotas under the Common Fisheries Policy was given effect in 1983 by Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 170/83. Relative stability is currently applied by virtue of Article 8 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3760/92.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The proposal contained in the Reform of Quarantine Regulations Bill is similar to one of the alternatives to quarantine currently being assessed by the Advisory Group on Quarantine under the chairmanship of Professor Kennedy. It would be premature to alter the present system until Professor Kennedy has reported on whether alternative arrangements would give equal or better protection against the importation of rabies.

<P>

<a name="80128w21.html_para0">My noble friend the Parliamentary Secretary held useful talks with the Indonesian Minister of Agriculture last autumn and reaffirmed our willingness to continue to explore ways to co-operate. Three working groups set up under the Memorandum of Understanding met and looked at ways of advancing projects. A seminar looked at new areas for co-operation.
<P>

<a name="80128w21.html_para1">We recognise that the region is currently experiencing extreme economic difficulties; but we believe that we should take the long-term view. There remain opportunities for the UK agri-business sector, and it is now that we should seek to strengthen our ties, continue co-operation, and encourage Indonesia on the road to recovery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have no such plans at present. However, the public health risks associated with drinking such milk are likely to be similar to those associated with drinking raw cows' milk. With this in mind, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food has recommended that surveillance on the microbiological status of raw sheep and goats' drinking milk be undertaken, and this is currently being taken forward.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the cost to farmers of <i>(a)</i> a ban on the sale of raw cows' milk and <i>(b)</i> the cost of enforcement of a ban. [25838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w21.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I recognise the importance of assessing the likely costs and savings. If we do proceed to legislate in this area, assessments would accompany the consultation document on the proposals for draft Regulations, as part of the regulatory appraisal process.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 1998]:</i> Food labelling must be clear, accurate and informative, giving consumers the opportunity to make informed choices about the food they buy, without being unduly prescriptive or costly. Wherever possible, we prefer to have general rules which are applicable to all types of

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 1998]:</i> The report, published in December, by Professor Krebs and the Independent Scientific Review Group estimates that a vaccine for field trials could be available within 10 years. It recommends that research towards the development of a cattle vaccine should be a high priority for MAFF. The Government have indicated that they are disposed to accept the report's recommendations subject to further consideration of public expenditure, legal and practical implications. We are currently reviewing bovine TB research expenditure, including work towards a cattle vaccine, in the light of the Krebs report. Public consultation on how the report's recommendations should be implemented ends on 27 February.

 Improving farm animal welfare is a priority for our presidency. We have already restarted negotiations on proposals for a general Directive concerning welfare of livestock on farms, stalled since 1994. We have also obtained an undertaking from Commissioner Fischler that he will urgently bring the long overdue proposals to update the EU rules on the welfare of laying hens and the welfare of animals at slaughter. We intend to start negotiations on these two proposals as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the outcome of the review of non-organophosphorus sheep dips carried out by the Veterinary Products Committee; and if he will make a statement. [26466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80128w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Committee's report to the Licensing Authority (Agriculture and Health Ministers) is today being placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para1">Following its review last year of the effectiveness of the Certificate of Competence Scheme for the purchase of organophosphorus (OP) sheep dips, the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) has reviewed the use of non-OP sheep dips. The Committee has advised that the Certificate of Competence Scheme should be extended to all sheep dips and we are already consulting on the necessary changes to the legislation to bring this into effect as quickly as possible.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para2">The Committee reaffirmed its earlier advice that the Scheme should apply to the use of sheep dips as well as to their purchase and, as for OP dips, this will be achieved by strengthening measures to secure compliance with existing statutory duties. New guidance is being prepared by the Health and Safety Executive about the duties of farmers under the Health and Safety at Work Act and related legislation. The guidance will also emphasise the importance of the Certificate of Competence Scheme operated by the National Proficiency Tests Council (NPTC).
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para3">The Committee was very concerned about reports of the environmental effects of synthetic pyrethroid (SP) sheep dips. We endorse this concern and are pleased to note that the NPTC has already completed a revision of the Certificate of Competence Scheme. In future, the Scheme will include practical training in the proper use and disposal of dips. The questions in the test for the Certificate will be arranged in specific sections relating to, for example, environmental issues and operator safety, and a certain level of knowledge will be required in each section to achieve a pass mark. In addition, questions will relate to all forms of sheep dip and will include reference to the dangers to aquatic life from use and disposal of SP dips.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para4">We endorse the Committee's advice that those who have already obtained Certificates of Competence should be encouraged to take a further test on new areas of the Certificate not previously covered.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para5">The Committee has recommended that product literature warnings about toxicity to aquatic life should be based on risk not hazard; that advice about the protection of the environment should be simple, concise, clearly set out and cross-referenced; that there should be reference to specific problems that may arise such as spillage, contamination from sheep to water, and improper disposal; and that product labels should be amended to refer to the Environment Agency (EA), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland (DOENI). We accept these recommendations and will pursue them with marketing authorisation holders, in the light of the Committee's further consideration of the labelling of sheep dips.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 305</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para6">We accept the Committee's advice that there should be a mechanism for informing water regulators about dipping and for consulting them about proposed methods of disposal. Proposed new Groundwater Regulations recently issued for consultation by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office include provisions which would address these issues.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para7">The Committee has advised that the sheep dipping leaflet (AS29) should be revised to include comprehensive and up to date advice on the proper use and disposal of sheep dips to prevent contamination of water and this is being done.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 1998 : Column: 306</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para8">We accept the Committee's advice that there should be new requirements for toxicity data for SP dips. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) has been asked to ensure these changes are made and that data on flumethrin are obtained as quickly as possible.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para9">Finally, the Committee has asked for an up to date data base on the use of sheep dips. It has previously been found difficult to obtain accurate information on this but officials of the VMD will pursue the question further with marketing authorisation holders.
<P>

<a name="80128w22.html_para10">I should like to thank Professor Aitken and the Committee for the thoroughness of their review and for their clear and helpful advice.
