 Whenever this is mutually convenient.
<P>

<a name="11212w01.html_para0">Ministers are always ready to meet the Chief Minister. I had hoped that he would meet me while he was in London last month. The Secretary of State hopes to visit Gibraltar early in 2002. The Governor of Gibraltar meets the Chief Minister on a regular basis.

 I refer my hon. Friend to my statement in Westminster Hall on 7 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 88&#150;92WH. The Government believe that talks under the Brussels Process represent the best way to ensure a more secure, stable and prosperous future for the people of Gibraltar.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Spanish Foreign Minister announced following their meeting held in Barcelona on 20 November, the British and Spanish Governments aim to reach by the summer of next year an agreement covering all outstanding issues between them over Gibraltar, including those of co-operation and sovereignty. A copy of the press communiqu&#233; has been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="11212w01.html_para1">Should a comprehensive agreement affecting sovereignty emerge from these Brussels Process discussions, HMG are committed to asserting the wishes of the people of Gibraltar, as stated in the 1969 Order in Council establishing the Gibraltar Constitution. Since the result of such a referendum could trigger the introduction of a primary legislation in

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has received from the Government of Georgia concerning Russian aerial bombardment of Georgian territory in November.  [22166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w01.html_spnew4"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 On 28 November the Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister briefed the British and other EU ambassadors about reported aerial bombardment in Georgia on 27 and 28 November. The Georgian embassy in London has also contacted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on this matter.

<a name="11212w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what inquiries his Department has made into allegations by the Government of Georgia that Russian aircraft bombarded the Pankisi Gorge.  [22167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w01.html_spnew5"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 We raised the matter with the Russian Government in Moscow on 4 and 7 December, and with the Georgian Government on 6 December. The Russian and Georgian Presidents have agreed to establish a joint commission to investigate the incident.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his policy is on Russian military action against Chechens located on the territory of other sovereign states of the former Soviet Union.  [22168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w01.html_spnew6"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 We recognise that groups of Chechen fighters located in other states in the former Soviet Union pose a threat to regional security. But Russia must respect the territorial integrity of other sovereign states and not take unilateral military action. We have told the Russians that to do so would be unacceptable and would not solve Russia's security problems or promote regional stability.

 The Government support multiple pipelines to create more secure, diverse energy markets, but decisions on individual pipelines are a matter for commercial judgment.

 We have played an important role in encouraging the interested parties to agree at the Bonn Conference on 5 December, to a power-sharing government.

 In accordance with the Council's rules of procedure, provisional agendas are drawn up by the presidency and sent to other members of the Council and the Commission at least 14 days before the beginning of each meeting of the Council of Ministers.

<a name="11212w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is committed to reducing sickness absence by 20 per cent. (to an average of 6.5 days) by 2001. This figure was set against the 1998 baseline figure of an average of eight days. We now have a new reporting system in place, which allows us to monitor sickness absence in detail, and effectively manage individual cases. Figures for 2001 have not yet been collated, but early indications are that we are on course to meet the 2001 target.

 The coalition has from the outset of the campaign gone to very great lengths to minimise the risks to civilians from air strikes, which have been conducted against exclusively military targets. Although extensive battle damage assessment is routinely conducted after each strike, we cannot know for sure how many bombing raids may not have hit their intended targets, nor how many civilian casualties may have been caused as a result. While we investigate all such claims carefully, most cannot be verified.

<a name="11212w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> Under the former Far East prisoners ex-gratia payment scheme, the eligibility criteria for former service personnel are based upon the unit in which an individual was serving. Hence the main eligibility criterion is to have been taken as a prisoner of war while serving with our armed forces. In addition, certain other former military personnel who were taken as prisoners of war while serving in the colonial forces, the old Indian Army, or the Burmese armed forces and who received compensation in the 1950s under UK auspices under Article 16 of the Peace Treaty with Japan are also eligible for the scheme.

 The safeguards provisions of the Euratom Treaty apply to all civil material in the UK and the Euratom Safeguards Office therefore inspects all parts of the BNFL Sellafield facility where such material is located. Since 1994 these inspections have involved between 1,400 and 1,750 person days of inspection each year. Reports on Euratom Safeguards Office activities are published periodically by the European Commission, most recently in July of this year (report reference COM(2001)436 final, accessible at the website of the European Parliament&#151;Department of Trade and Industry Explanatory Memorandum 11669&#150;01 refers).

<a name="11212w04.html_para5">In addition to ongoing Euratom Safeguards Office inspections, civil material at UK nuclear facilities is subject to the terms of the tripartite safeguards agreement between the UK, Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), under which the IAEA designates certain civil UK nuclear facilities, or parts of them, for inspection. In the period in question, the IAEA has chosen to inspect the following parts of the BNFL Sellafield facility: the THORP Fuel Receipt and Storage area, the Special Nuclear Materials Store 9, the Oxide Fuel Storage Ponds, and the THORP Plutonium Store. The number of person days of inspection effort involved in these inspections has reduced from some 290 per year in 1994 to about 190 in 2000&#151;reflecting moves by the IAEA to focus its efforts on the facility's major plutonium storage areas. Reporting on IAEA safeguards activities is included in the IAEA's Annual Reports (accessible at the IAEA's website).

 We estimate that council rents in Barnet would rise by an average of 1.6 per cent. in real terms in 2002&#150;03 and 2.2 per cent. a year in real terms thereafter until 2011&#150;12 if rents are adjusted in line with our proposals. Over the period 1991&#150;92 to 2001&#150;02, council rents in Barnet rose on average 2.5 per cent. a year in real terms. Estimates for future years are based on property valuations and other data provided by the London Borough of Barnet which may be subject to amendment. The figures for 2003&#150;04 and later years may also be adjusted as a result of Spending Reviews.
<P>

<a name="11212w05.html_para3">We do not hold data on the registered social landlord rents at the individual authority level. Nationally, our rent restructuring proposals would result in RSL rents rising by RPI plus 0.5 per cent. a year until 2011&#150;12. This figure is subject to periodic reviews by the Housing Corporation.

The covering letter to the consultation paper invited local authorities to make written representations on the proposals in time for them to be received by Thursday 10 January.

<P>
<a name="11212w06.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The White Paper will be about regional governance in England. However, meeting in Cardiff on 30 October 2001, the annual plenary meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee (which brings together Ministers of the UK Government and of the devolved Administrations) noted the progress on the Government's White Paper on English regional governance. The devolved Administrations expressed their support for extending the benefits of devolution where there was a regional demand for this, and offered to assist the process based on their experience of devolution to date.
<P>

 We are looking at a wide range of information sources during the preparation of the forthcoming White Paper. The Department's own review of research on international experience, published in October 2000, shows that EU member states have a wide variety of approaches to devolution.

 The information on the number of firms that have registered abroad is not available. It is estimated that around 200 vehicles were registered in other member states while still specified on British operators' licences. Following a Transport Tribunal ruling in January 2001 the UK licensing authorities deemed it no longer acceptable for foreign registered vehicles to be used under the authority of a British operator's licence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Transport Council met in Brussels on 7 December. I represented the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para3">The main focus of the Council was on the Galileo satellite navigation project and on aviation security. I am pleased to say that on both issues the outcome was satisfactory from our point of view.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para4">On Galileo, Ministers were asked to agree to the release of funding from the Trans-European Networks (TENs) budget to enable the project to proceed to its next phase, and to agree on the management structure that the project would have. I was among Ministers to press for deferral of decisions on the project. I drew attention to the concerns which the recently issued PricewaterhouseCoopers report had raised, on public sector funding, overall cost and lack of commercial benefits. The report made clear that any decision on the joint undertaking would have funding implications, so I argued that a decision on this should not be taken while funding issues were not sufficiently clear. There was also some discussion of the details of the draft Regulation to establish the joint undertaking, but a majority of member states declined the Commission's request for a vote to agree the text. Decisions on the next phase of Galileo were deferred and no formal conclusions were agreed. The Presidency indicated that the Galileo project might be discussed further at the European Council at Laeken later this month.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para5">The Council reached political agreement on a regulation establishing a Community framework for airport security standards and monitoring. The Commission had initially insisted on arrangements to oversee member states who were operating more stringent security measures. But in response to concerns which I and others expressed about the need for freedom to respond to perceived security threats it accepted that member states should be free to apply additional measures, provided they were in accordance with Community law. This important measure should ensure that high standards are in place throughout the EU and create a safer environment for air passengers using EU airports.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para6">There was discussion of a draft directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation, on the transposition of JAR-OPS standards into EC law, and on a draft directive on the training of aviation cabin crew. No decisions were reached on the first two issues, and the Presidency concluded that no progress was possible on the third. The UK view is that provision for cabin crew training should be included in the JAR-OPS legislation.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para7">The Council noted the difficult economic situation faced by the air transport sector. On war-risk insurance, member states wished to return to a market approach, but the industry was not ready for that yet. In the interim the Commission was prepared to continue to approve state aid measures up to end March 2002, subject to monthly reviews. Ministers also noted the need to consider

urgently ways to address possible unfair competition from third country carriers; the Commission will present a proposal in the near future.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para8">The Council noted the importance of making early progress on the recent proposal for a Directive to replace the hushkits regulation.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para9">The Council reached political agreement on the regulation to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency, which was proposed as part of the ERIKA II package of maritime safety proposals. We are content with the text as agreed.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para10">The Council agreed the text of a Directive to simplify reporting formalities for ships leaving and entering Community ports. It was able to accept the European Parliament's position on the proposal, and therefore reached agreement at the First Reading.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para11">I and the French Minister, with support from the Commissioner, stressed the need for member states to make quick progress on ratifying the Hazardous and Noxious Substances convention and other maritime pollution compensation Conventions, as the December 2000 Council Conclusions had urged.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para12">The Council noted a Presidency progress report on the proposal to update Regulation 3820/85 on commercial drivers' hours and rest periods. Further consideration of this will pass to the Spanish Presidency.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para13">I maintained the UK's opposition to the proposal to extend the fitting of speed limiting devices to goods vehicles above 3.5 tonnes and to coaches/buses with over eight passenger seats regardless of weight. I argued that we were not in favour of a threshold below 7.5 tonnes, but that an extension of European regulation to 7.5 tonnes would be in line with UK law. I expressed my doubt that the safety and environmental consequences of fitting limiters to lighter vehicles would be beneficial. The Presidency concluded that Council adopted the proposal by qualified majority. The proposal will now be considered by the European Parliament early in the new year.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para14">The Council reached political agreement on a draft directive setting out initial and ongoing training requirements for professional drivers.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para15">Following the recent fires in Alpine road tunnels, the Commission reported to the Council that it would propose legislation early in 2002 to improve safety. The proposals will address issues relating to technical equipment, driver information, traffic controls and training of operational staff. We await further details of the proposals, and will need to examine them carefully.
<P>

<a name="11212w06.html_para16">The Presidency presented its conclusions on the Commission's White Paper on transport policy, published earlier this year. The Presidency largely agreed with the White Paper's assessment of the negative impact of uneven development of different transport modes, and believed that modal shift and enhancement of quality should be promoted. It hoped the Council would further examine the White Paper and looked forward to Commission proposals to implement the priorities emerging from further discussion.

I had previously written to the Commissioner asking her to propose amendments to address these shortcomings, which would create serious enforcement difficulties. Other Ministers at the Council supported me in asking the Commission to re-examine the issue and bring forward a new proposal to amend the Regulation.

 As part of our fundamental review of the planning system, we have decided that as from today we will give reasons for our decision not to call in planning applications. This decision, which forms part of the raft of measures in our Planning Green Paper published today, is in the interests of transparency, good administration and best practice. The Courts have established that there is no legal obligation to provide reasons for not calling in an application.
<P>

<a name="11212w07.html_para0">It should be borne in mind that the issue before him for decision is not whether the application should be granted planning permission but whether or not he should call it in for his own determination. The Secretary of State's policy on calling in planning applications&#151;which is to be very selective&#151;is set out in the written reply by the then Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) to a parliamentary question on 16 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 138. That approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference.

<a name="11212w07.html_para3">The then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), announced in May 2001 that as a new full-scale objective study into sleep disturbance would be unlikely to add significantly to our understanding, the Government would concentrate instead on further research into subjective responses to annoyance by night and by day. Since that announcement a contract for the project has been awarded and a steering group representing aviation and environmental interests has been formed to oversee the work, and has met once. We are also setting up a peer review group representing both national and international experts. As well as re-assessing the association between the Leq index and reported annoyance the study will attempt to examine subjective valuation of the nuisance from aircraft noise.

<a name="11212w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The rebate scheme for goods vehicle excise duty had two stages: a rebate of up to 50 per cent. of the cost of a licence against licences in force on 30 November 2000; and a similar rebate against all licences taken out between December 2000 and November 2001. Following these transitional arrangements a new structure of vehicle excise duty for goods vehicles came into effect on 1 December 2001.
<P>

<a name="11212w07.html_para4">Rebates totalling &#163;236 million were paid out in respect of some 250,000 goods vehicles against licences in force on 30 November 2000. Although the total amount rebated against licences taken out between December 2000 and November 2001 has yet to be finalised, it is expected to be of a similar order.
<P>

<a name="11212w07.html_para5">The Government have not formally commissioned any research on the impact of these rebate schemes. The Road Haulage Forum gives Ministers and the haulage industry a regular opportunity to discuss, take account of and assess the impacts of fiscal and other factors affecting the haulage industry.

 The extra funding will be spent on local network management and technology schemes, the M42 active traffic management pilot, the system for managing project and on the civil service reform fund programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he will publish his Green Paper on Planning.  [22729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Following our review of the planning system, I am today publishing a Green Paper "Planning: delivering a fundamental change" setting out our proposals for reform.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para0">A good planning system is vital to our quality of life. We need a system that fully engages people in shaping the future of their communities and local economies. The present planning system is too complicated, too slow and engages insufficiently with local communities. We need to make it more efficient and more accessible so that it better serves everybody with an interest in the growth and development of their community, whether individuals, businesses or representative organisations.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para1">The Green Paper sets out our proposals for simplifying the complex hierarchy of regional, county, unitary and local plans. We propose to replace local plans with new Local Development Frameworks that will have two main components: a set of core criteria that will allow local authorities to express a vision for the future of their areas and a strategy for its delivery; and action plans for specific areas where detailed planning is required. These include, for example, neighbourhoods, villages, town centres and major development sites. We intend that action plans should be a particular focus for community participation in the planning of local areas.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para2">The Green Paper proposes a much stronger emphasis on customer service, including delivery to business. New targets for processing planning applications by local authorities will distinguish business from householder applications in order that all applicants should have a clear and realistic expectation of the speed of decision. We propose that delivery contracts should be agreed between 



<P>
<P><I>12 Dec 2001 : Column: 882W</I><P>
local authorities and business for the biggest planning applications that would include an agreed timetable for reaching planning decisions.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para3">The Green Paper proposes the introduction of business planning zones in which planning consent will not be necessary for certain businesses so long as strict quality standards are met. We propose that each region should have at least one zone to promote technology companies.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para4">The Green Paper seeks to put communities at the heart of the planning system. We propose better community participation in the preparation of our new Local Development Frameworks and action plans. A statement of community involvement will set standards for consultation on planning applications and plans. Master planning of major sites will help developers plan for higher quality development, in partnership with local people and local authorities. There will be a much clearer procedure for submitting planning applications and a new emphasis on openness and accountability within the planning process.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para5">I also propose to speed up the handling of planning applications that have been called in and appeals that have been recovered for my determination. I give reasons where applications are called in but, up to now, they have not been given when I decide not to call in an application. In the interests of greater openness I shall, from today, give reasons in both circumstances.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para6">Copies of the Green Paper are being sent to every Member representing an English constituency and they will be available in the Vote Office and in the Library. An electronic copy can be viewed at www.planning.dtlr.gov.uk.

<P><I>12 Dec 2001 : Column: 883W</I><P>

Monitoring of the first year's operation of the pilots has shown a 47 per cent. reduction in those killed and seriously injured at camera sites and an 18 per cent. reduction in KSIs in the areas as a whole. The new funding system is now available nationally and I fully expect that, as more areas join, the numbers of those killed or seriously injured will decrease still further.

 Following discussions with officials I announced continued funding for existing neighbourhood warden schemes in England at the annual wardens conference on 19 November. Marketing expansion and funding opportunities for wardens schemes were discussed at that conference and continue to be reviewed.
<P>

<a name="11212w08.html_para7">There are 85 neighbourhood and 125 street warden schemes covering each of the government regions. The Government have commissioned a national evaluation of the neighbourhood warden programme which is due for completion by mid 2003. The evaluation is intended to provide an assessment of scheme impacts and to understand the processes of scheme implementation. It is not possible to consider each and every scheme in the same detail but care is taken to ensure that all regions receive roughly equal coverage that enables a picture of national-level impact to be established. In addition, schemes are encouraged to undertake local-level evaluations appropriate to their needs. Street warden schemes in England have yet to start and will be subject to a similarly rigorous evaluation process.

 A UK cost-benefit assessment carried out in September for my Department and the British National Space Centre by ESYS Consulting suggested that Galileo could yield net economic benefits for UK users and suppliers, based on European Commission studies and discussions with potential UK users. However, the recent study for the Commission by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), released on 22 November, excludes supplier benefits and estimates a much reduced and narrower range of benefits for transport users than previous Commission estimates. The report also made clear that there would be a need for continuing public sector funding throughout future phases of the project. On Friday the Transport Council deferred decisions on the next stage of Galileo in order to allow time for further consideration of the PWC report.

 Child benefit will be &#163;15.75 per week for the first child and &#163;10.55 per week for subsequent children from April 2002. If it were taxable at the basic rate, in order for a taxpayer to receive the same net benefit it would have to be increased to &#163;20.20 per week for the first child and &#163;13.55 per week for subsequent children. If it were taxable at the higher rate, the corresponding figures would be &#163;26.25 per week for the first child and &#163;17.60 per week for subsequent children.

<a name="11212w11.html_para0">The gross programme cost of increasing child benefit to &#163;20.20 per week for the first child and &#163;13.55 per week for subsequent children would be &#163;2.5 billion in 2002. The gross programme cost of increasing child benefit to &#163;26.25 per week for the first child and &#163;17.60 per week for subsequent children would be &#163;6 billion in 2002.

 This information is not collected centrally. School admissions are dealt with at local level by the relevant admission authority for each school. It is the responsibility of admission authorities to set their own admission arrangements, after consultation with other admission authorities in their area, and they are expected to have regard to the guidance in the School Admissions Code of Practice. Where a school has a specialism and gives priority to pupils on the grounds of aptitude for that specialism, it is up to the school's admission authority to

 The aim of the work load study was to identify the main factors that determine teachers' and head teachers' work load, and to develop a programme of practical action to eliminate excessive work load and promote the most effective use of all resources in schools.

 In common with other Government agencies, the CSA can make payments to compensate its clients for financial loss suffered as a result of maladministration. This compensation scheme can cover maintenance payments lost as a result of administrative failures in the agency. Compensation payments cannot, however, be made to cover maintenance withheld by non-resident parents where the CSA has acted correctly in seeking to enforce liability.

<P>
<a name="11212w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> There are a number of measures already in place to ensure that pensioners know they might be eligible for the Minimum Income Guarantee.
<P>

<a name="11212w13.html_para7">From 15 October 2001, callers to the Retirement Pension Telecentre who are not already receiving MIG are asked a series of questions to identify if they may be entitled and encouraged to claim if they wish to do so. Those pensioners who claim Retirement Pension by post are sent a MIG leaflet.
<P>

<a name="11212w13.html_para8">We are looking at a number of options to extend this service so that a claim to MIG will be invited automatically following certain key life events, for example when the pensioner reaches age 75 or 80, or when another benefit, such as Attendance Allowance, is awarded.
<P>

<a name="11212w13.html_para9">We are also working in partnership with organisations for older people to improve access to benefits and take up of the MIG. This includes projects on a national good practice guide and a survey of local take up initiatives.

 We are currently looking at how the disability living allowance claim form can be made more easily accessible for all disabled people: This follows changes earlier this year, when we reduced the claim pack by nine pages without losing essential information.

 Regulation 10C was added to the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 with effect from 25 September 2000 in order to make clear that remote "attention" via the telephone, or other electronic means, does not count as attention in connection with bodily functions for the purposes of the care component of disability living allowance.

 People in residential care or nursing homes in England and Scotland who fund the whole cost of their care from their own resources can receive attendance allowance. From 1 October 2001, such residents in England can have the opportunity to have their need for nursing care assessed by an NHS nurse. This determines the level of payment that the NHS pays to the nursing home in respect of that person's nursing care: low (&#163;35 per week), medium (&#163;70 per week) and high (&#163;110 per week). Such payments are disregarded in determining whether or not a person is a self-funder.
<P>

<a name="11212w14.html_para11">Proposals for changes to the provision of nursing and personal care in Scotland are a matter for the Scottish Executive. If, however, the result of the proposals for personal care are such that people who were self-funders no longer meet the whole cost of their care from their own resources attendance allowance will no longer be payable.

Estimates suggest that the poverty rate has risen during this period from 21 per cent. to 35 per cent.

<P>

<a name="11212w18.html_para2">The agency, in accordance with its enforcement policy, has investigated the breach of the emissions limit that occurred at the stack from kilns 5 and 6 on 14&#150;15 February 2001 and a warning letter has been issued to Castle Cement. Over the period to August 2001, I understand that the company undertook its own exploration of emissions from the stack, including sampling. Following the February breach, the agency commissioned work modelling the likely fate of dioxins in the environment and the human food chain. This concluded that even under the worst conditions, individuals in the community exposed to the levels found during the breach of the limit would be most unlikely to exceed the World Health Organisation guideline intake. However, the agency will not accept any re-occurrence of the elevated levels found in February 2001.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Under EU rules the UK is not obliged to inform other member states of any national review programme of pesticide products undertaken to address national issues. However, all member states and the Commission were informed of the UK programme to review organophosphate compounds which included carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos. In addition, all are automatically informed of any new product approvals and revocations. The separate European programme intends to review all active substances used in plant protection products within the community and all member states and the Commission are involved in this decision-making process.
<P>

<a name="11212w18.html_para3">The approval holders for carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos chose not to submit supporting data for their products under the UK review and therefore these products will not be available in the UK after 31 December 2001. Under the European review programme carbofuran has been supported so far although its continued use will depend upon the assessment of the data submitted. Chlorfenvinphos has not been supported. The impact of the European regime will not be felt until 2003 when all the compounds not supported by companies anticipating extensive data requirements will be withdrawn.

 The practice of forced marriage is wrong. Forced marriage occurs where a marriage is conducted without the valid consent of both parties, and where duress is a factor.

<a name="11212w20.html_para3">The unification of the accident and emergency department for Chorley and Preston has brought many enhancements to service levels and an increase in activity, as shown in the tables. The rotation of consultants and their junior colleagues between the two sites has enabled medical staff to gain the relevant experience at both locations to provide comprehensive, quality health care. This has led, specifically at Chorley, to more consultants working on the hospital site and, at the same time, to an increase in the number of middle grade doctors working over the 24-hour period.The accident and emergency service for Central Lancashire, which is provided on both sites, already has an excellent record of recruiting staff for the department. It is, for example, one of the few units in the north-west with a full complement of nursing staff.
<P>

<a name="11212w20.html_para4">Chorley and South Ribble accident and emergency department was redeveloped and expanded in August 1996. The link with Preston has secured the future of this service, so that the population of Chorley and South Ribble will continue to enjoy access to two accident and emergency departments, at Chorley and Preston. Based on existing guidelines, and through its partnership arrangements, Chorley and South Ribble district general hospital has the capacity to provide 24-hour A&E cover in all clinical situations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research is being carried out into the medical impact of aluminium on the human body <i>(a)</i> via its use as a food packaging material and <i>(b)</i> in terms of its presence in drinking water.  [19077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w21.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The most recently published study by the Food Standards Agency showed that exposures of United Kingdom consumers to aluminium from the typical diet in the UK were well within the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) established for aluminium in 1989 by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, even for those eating above-average amounts of food. Although general exposures from the diet are low, the Food Standards Agency currently has four research projects to test if there is migration of aluminium into food from, respectively, glazed ceramic ware, paper and board, kitchen ware and glass.
<P>

<a name="11212w21.html_para4">Aluminium in drinking-water is a minor contributor to oral intakes of aluminium in UK consumers.
<P>

<a name="11212w21.html_para5">A wide range of types of research contributes to scientific understanding of the effects of aluminium in humans. There is no comprehensive national or international database of current research on aluminium. The most relevant studies listed in the National Research Register concern the role of aluminium in dementia, clinico-pathological correlates of dementia in Down's syndrome (including aluminium absorption), possible protective effects of selenium and magnesium on the toxicity of aluminium, and a clinical trial of immunotherapy with aluminium hydroxide. The National Research Register is a database of on-going and recently

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which NHS trusts provide treatment and which health authorities have purchased treatment for individual patients <i>(a)</i> inside and <i>(b)</i> outside their own area, for macular degeneration.  [19416]<P>

<P>

 In 2000&#150;01, there were 3,317 in-patient episodes in England with a primary diagnosis concerning age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The hospital trusts that provided the treatment are given in list 1, the health authorities that purchased treatment from within their own area in list 2, and those that purchased treatment from outside their area in list 3. An appraisal of the use of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of AMD, which is being conducted by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), should be completed in July 2002 provided there are no appeals. NICE's guidance will provide for a consistent approach to the purchasing of the treatment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many accidents were reported by patients while they were on the premises of hospitals in the University of Leicester Hospitals Trust in the last 12 months.  [20260]<P>

<P>
<a name="11212w22.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The number of statutory reportable "incidents" is collected under Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 1995. This covers reportable infectious diseases, and accidents that result in more than three days absence from work, deaths in the workplace for example.
<P>

<a name="11212w22.html_para2">The number of RIDDOR incidents recorded at University Hospitals of Leicester National Health Service Trust (UHL) in 2000&#150;01 was 89&#151;the latest year for which figures are available. This figure includes both patient and staff incidents.

 The Renal National Service Framework was announced on 27 February 2001. An external reference group led by Professor Robert Wilkinson and announced on 14 September 2001, will develop proposals for modernising services and improving patient care over a 10 year period in planned stages. The programme will build on the already agreed and funded targets for expanding kidney dialysis set out in the NHS Plan, and increased transplantation rates agreed with, and funded through, United Kingdom Transplant.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 28 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 978W, on transsexual people, (1) if he will make it his policy to issue guidance on the protocols of care for transsexual people, irrespective of the issue of funding for gender reassignment surgery for particular individuals;  [20845]

<P>
<P>
<a name="11212w23.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The provision of services for transsexuals has to be very comprehensive as most will require specialist counselling and psychotherapy before surgery takes place, and appropriate care afterwards. The Department does not produce care protocols for treatments, as these are clinical issues and are best left to the professional bodies. The Royal College of Psychiatry has already produced guidelines on child and adolescent gender identity services, and is planning to produce clinical guidelines for adults in 2002.
<P>

<a name="11212w23.html_para0">Decisions on the types of services that should be delivered to meet the needs of a population have to be taken on the front line by the local heath commissioners. It is their responsibility to be aware of the needs of the population and in deciding what services to provide they should take account of resources. However, there should be no blanket ban on the provision of any service and each case should be considered on its merits. Whatever care is being given, all patients are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect for their individual needs.

 The Department does not run any competitive grant schemes aimed specifically at tackling social exclusion. However, most of what the Department does has great potential to tackle social exclusion by improving health and wellbeing. The Department, through the section 64 general scheme, makes grants to voluntary organisations working in health and social care to tackle health issues which in, for example, reducing health inequalities and reaching disadvantaged groups, assist in tackling social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="11212w23.html_para3">The section 64 general scheme is primarily aimed at national voluntary organisations although local projects of national significance can be funded. The degree to which individual section 64 grants tackle social exclusion would be impossible to calculate. Project, core and capital funding is available.

<a name="11212w24.html_para0">The purchase or hire of cars and other vehicles is subject to the Suppliers Directive (93/36/EC as last amended by Directive 97/52/EC). Together with the relevant Remedies Directive (89/665/EEC) the Suppliers Directive has been given effect in the UK by the Public Supply Contract Regulations (SI.1995/201, last amended by SI.2000/2009). Compliance with these Regulations will also fulfil the purchaser's obligations towards suppliers from third countries pursuant to the EEA Treaty, various Europe Agreements and the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. The current threshold is &#163;93,896 and there are rules that require recurrent purchasers to be considered in aggregate over a governed period for the purpose of applying the threshold. Government Departments and other public bodies are responsible for complying with the regulations. The commission will follow up complaints of non-compliance with the member state concerned and may initiate proceedings under Article 226/EC. In the UK interested suppliers harmed or at risk of harm from the breach of the rules can seek interim or final remedies in the High Court (Court of Session in Scotland) which may lead to an interim or final injunction or the award of damages.
