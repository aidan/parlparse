undetermined intent are not included when examining suicide
(intentional self-harm) in children. The table below shows the number

constant review to meet present and planned future requirements, with a
view to disposing of surplus assets as quickly as possible. Pending a
final decision and subsequent disposal action, any redundant sites will
normally be closed and/or mothballed to reduce unnecessary expenditure.
The need for financial support to assist the disposal of a site is
considered on a case by case basis, usually to maintain the property to
an appropriate standard to meet environmental and health and safety
requirements, consistent with the most likely disposal strategy.
Limited opportunities may also exist for temporary commercial or
military training uses while in
disposal.</p><p><a name="06062281000083">Other
Departments provide direct financial support for economic development
regionally or to communities. However, the closure of defence
establishments can often provide new opportunities for civilian re-use
and development. It is therefore the usual practice of the Ministry of
Defence to work closely with the local authority and other
stakeholders, amongst others English Partnerships, Regional Development
Agencies, and in Scotland the Scottish Executive, the Enterprise bodies
and the Welsh Assembly in Wales to consider the most appropriate future
use.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 2051W</b><br><p><a name="06062281000084"><b><a name="06062281000139">Mr.

Andrew Mitchell:</b> To ask the Secretary of
State for International Development what estimate he has made of the
percentage of people in Burma living in poverty.
[77799]</p><p><a name="06062281000094"><b><a name="06062281000148">Mr.
Thomas:</b> Reliable date about poverty in Burma is scarce,
but Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia, comparable to
Cambodia and Laos on available measures and is almost certainly not on
track to achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals. A household
survey from 1997, found that 23 per cent. of people (11.2 million) had
an income below subsistence level. The percentage of poor people
earning less than $1 US a day is likely to be significantly higher than
this. The same Government survey found that 70 per cent. of household
expenditure was on food, an indicator of the vulnerability of poor
people in Burma. There is widespread malnutrition, with one in three
children aged 5 being moderately to severely malnourished. In 2001, 109
of every 1,000 children died before they reached the age of 5, double
the East Asia and Pacific regional average. Maternal mortality is among
the highest in the region. Only 40 per cent. of children complete five
years of primary
education.</p><p><a name="06062281000095">Social
sector spending in Burma fell steadily during the 1990s and the
authorities now spend less than $1 per person each year on basic health
care and education combined. This is one of the lowest levels of public
investment in the world. Public sector salaries are a long way below a
living wage and teachers, doctors and other public servants are forced
to either supplement their income through unofficial charges or
undertake additional income earning activities. Most poor people rely
on informal, private healthcare providers, often receiving poor quality
or ineffective treatment as a result. Although education has
traditionally been highly valued in Burma, its quality is being
undermined by under-investment in the crumbling public education
system. HIV/AIDS is a major public health risk in Burma. Burma is one
of three countries in Asia with a generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic,
420,000 people are estimated to be infected with the virus and
prevalence continues to rise. Prevalence in pregnant women exceeds 2
per cent. indicating that the epidemic has spread from high-risk groups
into the general
population.</p><p><a name="06062281000096">Many of

For example, we are providing over &#163;60 million to support
disaster preparedness in Orissa, India, and we are supporting the
Government of Bangladesh&#146;s Comprehensive Disaster Management
Programme. We have committed to allocate 10 per cent. of the value of
our humanitarian response to each major natural disaster to prepare for
and mitigate the impact of future disasters, where this can be done
effectively. Under this policy, DFID has committed &#163;7.5 million
in the tsunami-affected
region.</p><p><a name="06062281000102">DFID
is also increasing funding to the international DRR system. We have

Reduction and have recently agreed a &#163;4 million programme with
the World Bank on mainstreaming DRR into the Poverty Reduction
Strategies of several disaster-prone countries. In 2005, we committed

and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits trebled.
Growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly, and in November
2005, there were 2.71 million people claiming incapacity 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 2062W</b><br>benefits, a fall of 61,000 over the year. Although
46 per cent. of those claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50
and state pension age, between 2000 and 2005 the number of people in
the 50-plus age group fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the
overall reduction in the incapacity benefits
caseload.</p><p><a name="06062288000023">Like other
age groups, people aged 50 and over will be able to benefit from the
rollout of the successful pathways to work service across the whole
country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new IB
customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct
access to a &#145;Choices Package&#146; of employment programmes
and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will
be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis.
Pathways has already begun helping people in the Rotherham area, having
rolled out there in
April.</p><p><a name="06062288000024">Our
age positive campaign works with employers and others to promote the
business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age
in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the
&#145;Be Ready&#146; national information campaign to raise
employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and
retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of
older workers in advance of age legislation due in October

McGuire:</b> When the new Department for Work and Pensions
(DWP) was formed in 2002, the Human Resources (HR) function inherited
different sets of legacy HR policies and terms and conditions; paper
driven systems, HR Service Centres dominated by low
value added data input; Business HR teams pre occupied with detailed
transactional based advice and Corporate HR focussed on developing and
maintaining detailed and over prescriptive HR
guidance.</p><p><a name="06062288000029">Working with
colleagues from the DWP Businesses, the HR Senior Management Team
designed a new HR Operating Model based on best practice in both the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 2063W</b><br>private and public sectors. The HR function now has
in place a set of HR job roles common across the Department, delivering
a uniform HR
service.</p><p><a name="06062288000030">This new HR
Operating Model places the emphasis on self service for employees and
line managers, with on-line access to HR processes through the new
Resource Management IT system which will be fully implemented in 2007.
This is supported by a telephone based advice and guidance service
provided by integrated HR and Finance shared service centres, and
accessed through a single telephone
number.</p><p><a name="06062288000031">The new
Operating Model for HR in DWP has already allowed for a reduction in HR
staff numbers from 5,500 to 3,000, and by March 2008 that number will
be reduced by a further 500. This has freed up resources for front line
work with our
clients.</p><p><a name="06062288000032">Business HR
teams focus on working strategically with operational managers on the
HR issues affecting business performance. Corporate HR has been
restructured to form four new Centres of Expertise which have improved
and simplified the Department&#146;s HR policies, making them easier
for line managers to interpret and

suffering from mesothelioma due to exposure in the workplace can make a
claim for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB), Constant
Attendance Allowance (CAA) and Exceptionally Severe Disablement
Allowance (ESDA). From July 2002 people suffering from mesothelioma
were exempted from the need to be medically examined by the Department
if clear evidence is already available to confirm their condition.
Alongside that change regulations were introduced to automatically
award IIDB at the 100 per cent. rate. Currently this is &#163;127.10.
In addition CAA may also be payable dependant upon the level of the
person&#146;s care needs. There are four rates of payment ranging
from &#163;25.45 to &#163;101.80 a week. Where the two higher rates
of CAA are in payment Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance (ESDA)
may also be payable at the current weekly rate of &#163;50.90. Where
the relevant employer is no longer in business the person may also make

end of last year.</p></ul><a name="06062292001320"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Department for Constitutional Affairs maintains a list of bodies
accredited by it to carry out scientific tests for parentage (nowadays
usually DNA tests) under section 20 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969.
This list is for use by the civil courts in England and Wales where the
court makes a direction under section 20 of the 1969
Act.</p></ul><a name="06062292001321"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Section
20 directions&#148; are not given in every civil case where parentage
is an issue. Where parties submit DNA evidence by agreement and without
any section 20 direction being given, it is not essential for the
testing body to be chosen from the accredited list. As with other
evidence, it is for the court to consider questions of admissibility
and weight of the
evidence.</p></ul><a name="06062292001322"><ul><p class="tabletext"><i> Background to the
accredited
list</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001323"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Family
Law Reform Act 1969 made provision for court-directed blood testing to
determine paternity. The provisions were amended in the Child Support
Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, to refer to &#147;scientific
tests&#148; (reflecting the development of DNA technology which could
be applied to bodily samples other than blood). References to
&#147;paternity&#148; were replaced with &#147;parentage&#148;
so as to be
gender-neutral.</p></ul><a name="06062292001324"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section
20 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969 provides that in any civil
proceedings a court may give a direction for the use of scientific
tests to ascertain whether such tests show that a party to the
proceedings is or is not the father or mother of a person whose
parentage falls to be determined. By virtue of subsection (1A), tests
may only be carried out by a body which has been accredited for the
purposes of section 20 by the Lord Chancellor, or a body appointed by
him for the purpose. Section 20(2) of the 1969 Act provides that the
individual carrying out court-directed scientific tests must report to
the court stating the results, whether a person is excluded from
parentage and (if not) the value of the results in determining
parentage. The report is to be received as evidence of the matters
stated. It must be in a prescribed form (subsection (3)). Any party may
seek a written explanation or amplification, which is deemed to be part
of the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 2079W</b><br>report (subsection (4)). A party must serve notice of an intention to
call the tester within 14 days of receiving the report. It is expressly
provided that where the tester is called as a witness the party is
entitled to cross-examine him (subsection
(5)).</p></ul><a name="06062292001325"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section 22
provides that the Lord Chancellor may make regulations about
&#147;section 20 directions&#148; and may prescribe conditions for
eligibility for accreditation (subsection (1)(f)). The regulations are
the Blood Tests (Evidence of Paternity) Regulations 1971, as amended
(including to reflect the 2000
Act).</p></ul><a name="06062292001326"><ul><p class="tabletext"><i> The Blood Tests
(Evidence of Paternity) Regulations 1971, as
amended</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001327"><ul><p class="tabletext">These
Regulations set out the detailed changes that made it possible for
bodily samples other than blood to be taken, and for scientific tests
to be used to establish whether a person is a natural parent of the
person whose parentage is to be determined. The Regulations also
provided that the tests were to be carried out by an accredited body
(rather than an individual, which was the case under the previous
scheme).</p></ul><a name="06062292001328"><ul><p class="tabletext">Regulation 8A
provides that a body shall not be eligible for accreditation for the
purposes of section 20 of the 1969 Act unless it is accredited to
ISO/IEC/17025 by an accreditation body which complies with the
requirements of ISO Guide 58 (now replaced by ISO
17011).</p></ul><a name="06062292001329"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Regulations also deal with the procedures for taking bodily samples,
despatch to a tester, testing and then reporting to the court. The
Regulations require the completion of 2 statutory forms. Form 1 is
called a &#147;Direction Form&#148; and is to be filled in by the
court, the sampler and the tester. Form 2 is called &#147;Report by
Tester&#148; and is to be filled in by the tester. All of this is
designed to ensure that the right people actually provide samples, that
the same samples reach the tester, and that the nominated tester does
the testing and reports to the
court.</p></ul><a name="06062292001330"><ul><p class="tabletext"><i> Criteria for DCA
accreditation prior to the recent
review</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001331"><ul><p class="tabletext">The ISO
accreditation is a statutory requirement for &#147;section 20&#148;
accreditation by the Department, as set out above. Bodies wishing to be
added to the Department&#146;s accredited list were expected to
produce evidence (either an original or a certified copy) of a valid
and current ISO/IEC/17025 accreditation certificate, given by an
accreditation body that complies with ISO/IEC Guide 58 (now ISO
17011).</p></ul><a name="06062292001332"><ul><p class="tabletext">A further
non-statutory requirement was added, as a matter of policy. This was a
requirement to give an undertaking to comply with the Department of
Health&#146;s <i> Code of Practice and Guidance on Genetic Paternity
Testing Services.</i> This Code sets out best practice and clear
standards for organisations delivering paternity testing services
generally.</p></ul><a name="06062292001333"><ul><p class="tabletext">These
criteria were put in place in 2001, when the Blood Tests (Evidence of
Paternity) (Amendment) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001 No. 773) came into
effect.</p></ul><a name="06062292001334"><ul><p class="tabletext">More recent
practice has been to require that written applications be made to be
added to the DCA accredited
list.</p></ul><a name="06062292001335"><ul><p class="tabletext">The particular
International Standards Organisation (ISO) standards were chosen
because they were considered to be the most appropriate standards for
this area of activity. ISO/IEC/17025 is an accreditation given to
testing and calibration laboratories that meet certain competence
requirements. There was no formal or public consultation on the
criteria chosen for accreditation, but the 2001 Regulations, as a
statutory instrument, had the approval of Parliament. The Department of
Health&#146;s Code was put together by an ad-hoc advisory group on
genetic paternity testing services, whose membership included service
providers, clinicians, academics and
scientists.</p></ul><a name="06062292001336"><ul><p class="tabletext"><i> Ensuring
compliance with ISO/IEC 17025
standards</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001337"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
accreditation bodies ensure compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 by
undertaking regular reviews and re-accreditations. Because
accreditation bodies are the technical experts, it is not necessary or
appropriate for representatives of the Department themselves to visit
any of the DCA-accredited laboratories, and no-one from the Department
has ever done so. For the purposes of DCA accreditation, if an up to
date and valid ISO 17025 certificate is produced (an original or
certified copy) and the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 2080W</b><br>accreditation body is ISO Guide 58 (now ISIO 17011) compliant, then this
is proof enough of the laboratory&#146;s
competence.</p></ul><a name="06062292001338"><ul><p class="tabletext">Bodies
accredited by DCA are not permitted to contract out parentage tests
directed by the court under s20 to any other
organisation.</p></ul><a name="06062292001339"><ul><p class="tabletext"><i> How the courts
ensure accredited bodies carry out parentage tests where a section 20
direction is
given</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001340"><ul><p class="tabletext">Where the
court is considering an application for a paternity test in the course
of civil proceedings, and the parties do not agree to the testing, then
section 20 of the 1969 Act is available. The court may give a formal
direction (on Form 1, a statutory form, part of the Blood Tests
(Evidence of Paternity) Regulations 1971 (as amended)) which will
include the name and address of the body that is to carry out the test.
The body will be chosen from the list of accredited bodies. The tester
(a person employed to carry out scientific tests by an accredited
laboratory) will complete and sign Form 2, (the Report by the Tester)
to certify the result of the test. As explained above, the Regulations,
which include the two statutory forms, are designed to ensure the
authenticity and integrity of the samples, and that the nominated
tester carries out and reports on the
test.</p></ul><a name="06062292001341"><ul><p class="tabletext">The list the
Department maintains relates only to bodies which may carry out
court-directed scientific tests for parentage in accordance with a
direction made by a court pursuant to section 20 of the Family Law Act
1969. Where the court has not directed the test, parties to a case may
submit DNA evidence by agreement and in accordance with case management
directions of the court. It is not essential for the testing body to be
chosen from the accredited list. As with other evidence, it is for the
court to consider questions of admissibility and
weight.</p></ul><a name="06062292001342"><ul><p class="tabletext"><i> The
investigation</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001343"><ul><p class="tabletext">Starting
in October last year, a number of Questions were tabled in Parliament
and the Department received a number of press enquires about DNA
Bioscience and the accredited list generally. This prompted an
investigation as to the eligibility of each of the bodies on the
accredited list, and the work also extended to a review of the
processes and procedures associated with adding bodies to the list and
the maintenance of
it.</p></ul><a name="06062292001344"><ul><p class="tabletext">The review did not
extend to any examination of the financial accounts of the bodies on
the DCA accredited list. DCA has no responsibility in this area. The
bodies on the accredited list do not provide services to the
Department. The accredited list simply exists to provide the civil
courts with the names of bodies that reach a certain standard for use
when the court directs a test under section 20 of the Family Law Reform

list</i></p></ul><a name="06062292001384"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Family
Law Reform Act 1969 made provision for court-directed blood testing to
determine paternity. The provisions were amended in the Child Support
Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, to refer to &#147;scientific
tests&#148; (reflecting the development of DNA technology which could
be applied to bodily samples other than blood). References to
&#147;paternity&#148; were replaced with &#147;parentage&#148;
so as to be
gender-neutral.</p></ul><a name="06062292001385"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section
20 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969 provides that in any civil
proceedings a court may give a direction for the use of scientific
tests to ascertain whether such tests show that a party to the
proceedings is or is not the father or mother of a person whose
parentage falls to be determined. By virtue of subsection (1A), tests
may only be carried out by a body which has been accredited for the
purposes of section 20 by the Lord Chancellor, or a body appointed by
him for the purpose. Section 20(2) of the 1969 Act provides that the
individual carrying out court-directed scientific tests must report to
the court stating the results, whether a person is excluded from
parentage and (if not) the value of the results in determining
parentage. The report is to be received as evidence of the matters
stated. It must be in a prescribed form (subsection (3)). Any party may
seek a written explanation or amplification, which is deemed to be part
of the report (subsection (4)). A party must serve notice of an
intention to call the tester within 14 days of receiving the report. It
is expressly provided that where the tester is called as a witness the
party is entitled to cross-examine him (subsection
(5)).</p></ul><a name="06062292001386"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section 22
provides that the Lord Chancellor may make regulations about
&#147;section 20 directions&#148; and may prescribe conditions for
eligibility for accreditation (subsection (1)(f)). The regulations are

Regulations set out the detailed changes that made it possible for
bodily samples other than blood to be taken, and for scientific tests
to be used to establish whether a person is a natural parent of the
person whose parentage is to be determined. The Regulations also
provided that the tests were to be carried out by an accredited body
(rather than an individual, which was the case under the previous
scheme).</p></ul><a name="06062292001389"><ul><p class="tabletext">Regulation 8A

court, the sampler and the tester. Form 2 is called &#147;Report by

testing and calibration laboratories that meet certain competence
requirements. There was no formal or public consultation on the
criteria chosen for accreditation, but the 2001 Regulations, as a
statutory instrument, had the approval of Parliament. The Department of
Health&#146;s Code was put together by an ad-hoc advisory group on
genetic paternity testing services, whose membership included service

undertaking regular reviews and re-accreditations. Because
accreditation bodies are the technical experts, it is not necessary or
appropriate for representatives of the Department themselves to visit
any of the DCA-accredited laboratories, and no-one from the Department
has ever done so. For the purposes of DCA accreditation, if an up to
date and valid ISO 17025 certificate is produced (an original or
certified copy) and the accreditation body is ISO Guide 58 (now ISIO

(Evidence of Paternity) Regulations 1971 (as amended)) which will
include the name and address of the body that is to carry out the test.
The body will be chosen from the list of accredited bodies. The tester
(a person employed to carry out scientific tests by an accredited
laboratory) will complete and sign Form 2, (the Report by the Tester)
to certify the result of the test. As explained above, the Regulations,
which include the two statutory forms, are designed to ensure the
authenticity and integrity of the samples, and that the nominated

submit DNA evidence by agreement and in accordance with case management

that makes patient information available at point of need will improve
patient safety. In addition, it provides a common computer system
interface which makes training easier and more economic across
different trusts which should also improve accuracy and consistency in
treatment. History suggests that the NHS does not have a good track
record of procuring, developing or using IT at a local level. An
accreditation programme has already enabled 46 local and previously
incompatible systems to exchange data with and via national systems. A

Antisocial behaviour&#148; which contained a typology of antisocial
behaviour intended to provide a practical guide to the main categories
of behaviour that are widely accepted to be antisocial by both
practitioners and the public. This has been used to develop a standard
focus for work aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour problems locally.
The introduction of the antisocial behaviour hotline &#147;It's your
call&#148; in 49 areas since January 2005 has encouraged the public
to report incidents of antisocial behaviour and has helped to further
standardise local agencies' reporting of antisocial behaviour. Building
on &#147;It's your call&#148;, the single non-emergency number,
101, is currently being rolled out by local authorities and police
partnerships across England and Wales and will provide the public with
easy access to community safety and antisocial behaviour services,
advice and information. The recording and categorisation of incidents
of antisocial behaviour reported to 101 will be standardised based on
the Home Office RDS typology of antisocial behaviour as well as the
Police National Standard for Incident Recording. This will facilitate
the greater standardisation of reporting by local agencies as well as
supporting a more effective operational approach to reducing incidents
and patterns of antisocial behaviour and improving the quality of
services to the public. The 101 service will be operational across

duties, rather than powers, under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The
Home Office has recently conducted a review of the relevant provisions
of this Act in order further to strengthen the visibility,
responsiveness, membership and role of CDRPs. Our aim is to make-them
the most effective possible vehicle for tackling crime and disorder,
substance misuse, antisocial behaviour, and environmental crime at a
local level. The review findings were published on 25 January
2006. A copy is available in the Library of the House. The
legislative changes required to implement the recommendations

the reconfiguration of Hampshire constabulary, Kent police and Thames
Valley police as strategic forces, would be of the greatest benefit for
the South East region. A joint Home Office, Association of Chief Police

[78332]</p><p><a name="0606231000692"><b><a name="0606231001205">Mr.

S.51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (in relation to
criminal proceedings) and S.39 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act
2001 (in relation to civil proceedings). The provisions cover
intimidation of anyone who</p><a name="0606231001067"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is assisting
in the investigation of an offence or is a witness or potential witness
or juror or potential juror in proceedings for an
offence&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0606231000693">The police and
courts clearly take this issue seriously and we have seen convictions
for witness intimidation increase by over 30 per cent. between 2000 and
2005.</p><p><a name="0606231000694">The Youth
Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 provides a range of special
measures for witnesses whose evidence is likely to be affected by fear
or distress in connection with testifying in criminal proceedings.
These measures include the use of screens and live links, and a greater
degree of &#147;privacy&#148; in what remains a public hearing, to
be applied in sexual cases, or where there is a fear that the witness
may be intimidated. Intimidated witnesses may also be permitted to give
their evidence in private.</p><p><a name="0606231000695">The Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 introduced similar measures for
witnesses in proceedings for antisocial behaviour orders. The use of
hearsay evidence in civil proceedings involving antisocial behaviour
allows witnesses to remain anonymous. In exceptional cases, in criminal
proceedings, at the discretion of the court, witnesses in criminal
cases, who are unwilling to give evidence through fear for their
safety, may also be permitted anonymity.</p><p><a name="0606231000696">The Court must consider the
potential disadvantages to the defendant and ensure that it is
necessary and that the witness is in genuine and justified fear of
serious consequences if his true identity became known. It must also
ensure that necessary and appropriate precautions are taken to ensure
that the trial itself will be fair. When exercising this discretion the
court should be mindful of four factors; there must be real grounds for
being fearful of the consequences of revealing the identity of the
witness, the evidence must be sufficiently important to make it unfair
to the prosecution to compel them to proceed without it, the
prosecution must satisfy the court as to the creditworthiness of the
witness and finally the court must be satisfied that no undue prejudice
is caused to the defendant. Provided that appropriate safeguards are
applied, and the judge is satisfied that a fair trial can take place,
it may permit anonymity. In criminal cases, law enforcement agencies
are responsible for

we can to ensure that they are assisted in doing so. We are working
with them and other criminal justice agencies to ensure that
intimidated witnesses are identified at an early stage and properly
supported throughout the criminal justice process.</p><p><a name="0606231000697">We fund the
National Witness Mobility Service which gives police forces access to
support from housing experts to assist in the relocation of intimidated
witnesses. The Service has assisted in some serious antisocial
behaviour cases. We are planning to extend this support by facilitating
access to a wider range of services through the establishment of a
central services unit. We have also introduced new legislation which
helps forces to secure the assistance they need from others to set up
protection arrangements and provides additional safeguards for
witnesses. In antisocial behaviour cases, agencies are also encouraged
to give witnesses support after the court hearing&#151;for example by
keeping them informed about the outcome.</p><p><a name="0606231000698">A range of detailed guidance is

authorities are placed under a duty, by section 22 of the Children Act
1989, to safeguard and promote the welfare of looked after children.
The review of children&#146;s cases procedure, derived from section
26 of the 1989 Act, places a duty on local authorities to have in place
a plan for the future care of looked after children and to appoint an
Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO) to conduct the periodic statutory
reviews of their
cases.</p><p><a name="0606231000724">The Children
(Leaving Care) Act 2000 is based on this care planning framework. As
looked after children approach their 16th birthday, when they will
become entitled to services as &#145;care leavers&#146;, their
needs are required to be reassessed in order to inform the construction
of their &#145;pathway plan&#146; (which should be based on their
existing care plan). This plan sets out the services that are necessary
to respond to the young person&#146;s needs, to prepare them for
leaving care and then to support them after they have left care up
until the age of 21, or longer, if they remain in an approved programme
of education or
training.</p><p><a name="0606231000725">For young
people with statements of special educational needs (SEN), including
those who are looked after, there is a statutory transition planning
process, which commences during Year 9 of their compulsory education.
The purpose of this multi-professional process is to plan for young
people&#146;s transition to adult
life.</p><p><a name="0606231000726">Where a child who
is the subject of a SEN statement is also a looked after child, then
their responsible local authority should co-ordinate the respective
planning processes, in order to integrate their transition plan with
their pathway plan, so that young people are provided with the
necessary support in an integrated way before, during and after leaving
care.</p>

Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001) and any guidance
issued by the Secretary of State relating to sections 316 and 316A of
the Education Act 1996. Academy procedures for admitting children with
statements of SEN track those for maintained schools. For example the

authority should write to the school and other authority to ask them
whether, in their
