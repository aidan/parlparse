<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government are committed to a radical reform of public services and e-government is a powerful catalyst for bringing about the transformation necessary to deliver the Government's vision. In recognition of this commitment, we are investing &pound;6 billion over the next three years in e-government.

 The Government are committed to employing disabled people. As at April 2002 disabled staff accounted for 3.6 per cent. of the civil service, up from 2.8 per cent. in 1995. A service wide target has been set at 3.0 per cent. disabled people in the senior civil service by 2004&#150;05. In April 2002 the percentage of disabled staff in the senior civil service was 1.7 per cent., up from 1.5 per cent. in 1998.

<P>
<a name="30128w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Working days lost through industrial action are recorded as unauthorised absence for which pay is stopped.

 I wrote to the North West Regional Assembly on the 10 December 2002 giving the Secretary of State's response to the 'West Midlands to North West Multi Modal Study' (MIDMAN). The study has clearly demonstrated that some road widening is a necessary component of a strategy aimed at tackling congestion on the M6 motorway. Government therefore support the study recommendation to widen the motorway from dual 3 to dual 4 lanes between Junctions lla and 19. The Highways Agency has been instructed to progress this work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department's method for appraising transport schemes looks at a wide range of costs and benefits including the reduction of travel times, safety, accessibility and impacts on the environment, as well as a scheme's contribution to regeneration. We take decisions on particular schemes in the light of all of these factors.

 The Minister for Transport announced on 9 January 2003 the second round of our Cycling Projects Fund. This provides a further &pound;1 million of funding for local, practical projects aiming to deliver an increase in cycling. The fund builds on the more than &pound;2 million that was made available in 2002 to support 138 cycling projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have no current plans to make the wearing of personal protective equipment by cyclists compulsory. The Highway Code advises cyclists to wear clothing which will make them visible and which is 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2003 : Column 724W</I><P>
appropriate for cycling. It also advises them to wear helmets. We have engaged TRL to monitor wearing rates. The latest study shows that in 1999 the overall wearing rate was 22 per cent. on major built up roads. That is not a high enough level of public acceptance to introduce compulsory wearing. There would be enforcement difficulties and it could have adverse effects on the levels of cycling. However, we will continue to monitor wearing rates and will review the option of compulsory wearing from time to time.

 Since 1997 my Department has recorded a total of 20 breaches of port security, ie instances where individuals have gained unauthorised access to Restricted Zones at ports. It is not appropriate to give a detailed breakdown of either the specific port or region where these breaches took place for obvious reasons.

 No court actions and/or other prosecutions have taken place. From 1 January 1997 until 31 December 2002 a total of seven Enforcement Notices (ENs) have been served on UK harbour authorities and harbour operators. The ENs were served under the provisions of the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990 and related to failings to meet the requirements of that Act. Details are as follows:

The trial ran from 1 April 2000 until 31 March 2002 in eight pilot areas. These have been monitored and an independently produced research report of the findings is expected to be published shortly.

<P>

<a name="30128w03.html_para2">European Union legislation lays down the health conditions for harvesting and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs and requires monitoring for biotoxins, including amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). If statutory monitoring reveals that the maximum permissible ASP toxin level in the whole animal has been exceeded, the production or relaying area concerned must be closed until the situation has returned to normal. The Food Standards Agency, the United Kingdom competent authority responsible for shellfish issues, has received a number of representations on the management of ASP in scallops. They are currently considering the adoption of an optional derogation in EU law that would provide for a tiered approach to the testing of ASP toxins.

 No new funding mechanisms have yet been introduced. The Government are currently considering the options. The Spending Review figures announced last year for 2005&#150;06 include an estimate of what might be raised from a new mechanism, such as a charge on development on the floodplain. This was set at &pound;20 million out of an increase in provision for flood and coastal defence of &pound;150 million for that year. No such amount was assumed for 2004&#150;05.

<a name="30128w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In order to be eligible for DEFRA grant aid a capital flood defence project must satisfy fundamental economic, technical and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score based (from April 2003) on a combination of three elements&#151;(i) benefits as compared to cost, (ii) the number of people protected as measured by the number of households at risk, their vulnerability and the extent to which adequate advance warning of flooding can be given, and (iii) environmental protection and enhancement.

<P><I>28 Jan 2003 : Column 733W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30128w04.html_para1">In addition to guidance on the above priority scoring system, DEFRA publishes detailed guidance on aspects of project appraisal (strategic planning, economic, environmental, approaches to risk). The documents are intended to assist knowledgeable practitioners; they are not comprehensive manuals or textbooks and they do not define Government policy. However, compliance with this guidance is likely to produce projects that are acceptable for central Government support.
<P>

 No. The Government have introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over, because older pensioners are more likely to be reliant on television as their window on the world. Older pensioners are also more likely to be on low incomes. We have no plans to extend free television licences to pensioners below the age of 75.

 As announced in the pre-Budget report, the Government will continue a reformed tax credit scheme which will make available approximately a third of the funding that is currently going through the landfill tax credit scheme, around &pound;47 million per year, for spending on local community environment projects. The figure of &pound;47 million will be kept broadly constant in real terms, which will ensure that the current level of support for these types of projects is maintained. The Government are considering how this successor tax credit scheme, which will apply throughout the UK, may be changed to take account of the most serious criticisms of the current scheme made by bodies including the Public Accounts Committee. The Government will set out its plans for reform of the scheme on a Budget timetable.

<a name="30128w07.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Ethiopia qualified for interim debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative at decision point in November 2001. In the current Ethiopian financial year, this will reduce external debt service payments by 54 per cent. and allow an increase in poverty-targeted expenditure of around 1.3 per cent. of GDP. Ethiopia has now completed its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, called &quot;Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Programme".

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w07.html_spnew13"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We expect Ethiopia to reach completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative in 2004, at which stage, it will receive an irrevocable reduction in its debt stock. Total debt relief is expected to be US$1.9 billion in nominal terms, which is equivalent to 47 per cent. of the net present value of debt service. The British Government are concerned that no country should exit the HIPC process with an unsustainable level of debt. Where necessary, we therefore support the provision of additional debt relief at completion point&#151;so called 'topping up'&#151;for countries such as Ethiopia which, since decision point, have suffered shocks which reduce their export earnings and ability to service their debts.

<a name="30128w08.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules need to apply to all members. But they must also be achievable by developing countries, with realistic implementation schedules and targets.
<P>

<a name="30128w08.html_para0">New rules require the right balance between standardisation and flexibility. For rules to be strong and binding, they need to have enough flexibility to meet the varying needs of the WTO membership and to recognise that WTO members are at different stages of development.
<P>

<a name="30128w08.html_para1">Without flexibility, new WTO agreements will be stuck at the lowest common denominator. This will lead to richer members making agreements amongst themselves outside the WTO and without consideration for the impacts on developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30128w08.html_para2">The term special and differential treatment is used to describe special provisions for developing countries in existing WTO agreements <sup>1</sup> . Many developing countries complain that in the Uruguay Round the application of special and differential treatment and the treatment of different country circumstances were haphazard and that longer implementation deadlines for developing countries were decided arbitrarily.
<P>

<a name="30128w08.html_para3">There needs to be a better application of flexibility in designing future WTO rules. Appropriate flexibility should be integrated systematically into WTO agreements, rather than added on as an afterthought.
<P>

<a name="30128w08.html_para4">Special and differential treatment reforms will eventually link into the poverty reduction strategies. Thus the integration of trade policy reform is essential if poor people are to benefit from trade liberalisation. In addition to special and differential treatment, the UK has been supporting the Integrated Framework. The Integrated Framework has two aims: to identify trade capacity building and technical assistance needs in least developed countries to which the multilateral agencies and donors can then make a co-ordinated response; and to mainstream trade into least developed countries poverty reduction strategies, so that pro-poor trade policies are included in a consistent manner in a country's overall development strategy. The Integrated Framework is based on the principle of country ownership and partnership. It is now being implemented in 14 least developed countries and eventually will be extended to Low Income countries. Ultimately the Integrated Framework should cease to be necessary as trade becomes successfully integrated into poverty reduction strategies.

 The world's poorest countries face tariffs that are on average more than twice as high as those facing developed countries. Recent research estimates that developing countries could gain approximately $150 billion a year in real income from a 50 per cent. reduction in tariff barriers and other forms of protection by both developed and developing countries. Similarly, it has also been estimated that a 40 per cent. reduction in agricultural tariffs and export subsidies could boost global real incomes by around $60 billion a year.

 The UN, with our strong support, have been pressurising Zimbabwe to import sufficient food for the non-destitute for many months. Zimbabwe has a state monopoly on cereal imports, and price controls that prevent effective private-sector participation in the food market. All donors have appealed to Zimbabwe to amend the current restrictions. The UN Special Envoy for the Southern Africa Humanitarian crisis, Mr. James Morris, has raised this issue with Mr. Mugabe six times, most recently obtaining agreement that a scheme first proposed in mid-2002 to facilitate private sector involvement, should be reconsidered for wheat imports for urban needs.
<P>

<a name="30128w08.html_para5">Private sector participation would help make food available for those who do have the money to purchase it. But while the private sector as a whole remains excluded, many organisations have been able to obtain import licences for specific programmes of humanitarian assistance.

<i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> The national recorded crime statistics for burglary, robbery and theft of and from vehicles, were used for determining the 30 Basic Command Units (BCUs) with the highest levels of acquisitive crime. Although recorded crime statistics do not differentiate between drug and non-drug related crime, these types of crimes are the ones mostly closely associated with drug use.

 Records of the number of prisoners who would benefit from a programme of treatment are not kept centrally. Data from the Office for National Statistics show that around 80 per cent. of prisoners had used drugs at some point before coming into prison, with 54 per cent. reporting drug dependency in the year prior to custody.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he intends to take to ensure that arrestees who test positive for drugs are directed into treatment programmes.  [92112]<P>

<P>
<a name="30128w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 In the areas in England and Wales where the provisions for drug testing persons in police detention are currently being implemented, it is part of the drug testing procedure that those who test positive for a specified Class A drug are given specific opportunity to see an arrest referral worker, with a view to assessment of their drug misuse and referral to appropriate treatment.

<P>

<a name="30128w09.html_para9">Measures being introduced as part of the Government's new comprehensive programme of criminal justice interventions to get drug misusers into treatment include the enhancement of existing arrest referral schemes and the expansion and extension of the drug testing arrangements under which the police can test persons, after charge, for specified Class A drugs. We are also taking forward in the Criminal Justice Bill the proposal to pilot a presumption against bail for those who refuse to be assessed as to their dependency on, or propensity to misuse, specified Class A drugs, or who then refuse to undergo relevant follow-up action recommended.
<P>

<a name="30128w09.html_para10">The programme will be backed up by improvements in treatment capacity and local delivery.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many people were convicted of offences involving airguns during 2001&#150;02; what proportion of those convictions were for criminal damage; how many of those convicted of criminal damage were aged under 17 years; and what the ages were of all those convicted of offences more serious than criminal damage involving airguns;  [90654]

 The information requested is not collected centrally. However, 240 persons aged 10 and under 17 years were found guilty of offences in England and Wales during 2001 under the various Firearms Acts 1968 to 1997 (11 per cent. of all persons found guilty of firearms offences).

 Numbers of illegal firearm possession offences are not collected separately. Offences of illegal possession of firearms are included in the recorded crime classifications of 'Possession of Weapons' and 'Firearms Acts Offences' (Home Office offence classifications 8B and 81 respectively), but other offences are also included under these classifications, for example, possession of knives and illegal trading in firearms. These offence classifications were used from 1 April 1998, and the figures for England and Wales since that date are given in the table. A breakdown of the offences included under these classifications is included on the Home Office website at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/countrules.html

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w10.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce full 24-hour health care at Wymott prison as there is already a 13-place in-patient facility with 24-hour nursing cover in the health care centre at Garth prison, which serves as a resource for other Prison Service establishments in the area, including Wymott prison.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w10.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The decision to ask training establishments to locate two prisoners in selected single cells was taken centrally, as a result of the overwhelming population pressures faced by the prisons estate. The practice commenced at Wymott on 26 June 2002. Each single cell utilised in this way has been risk assessed for the purpose, and all prisoners are also individually risk assessed to determine their suitability for location with another prisoner.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w10.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 On 27 March 2002, the Prison Service was granted an extension in time of a further five years to the planning clearances already granted for additional single houseblocks for 120 prisoners at both Garth and Wymott prisons.
<P>

<a name="30128w10.html_para4">Planning clearance has been applied for to increase the size of the proposed houseblock at Wymott to 180 places. The outcome of the application is expected on 21 January 2003. On 24 July 2002, planning clearance was granted for an 80 place modular temporary unit (MTU) at Wymott, which will be additional to the 180-place houseblock. Work is under way to construct the 80 place MTU and, subject to a successful planning application, work on the 180-place houseblock will begin in the near future.
<P>

<a name="30128w10.html_para5">There are no immediate plans to build the houseblock at Garth although the position will be regularly reviewed and there are currently no plans to build a complete new prison at either site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w10.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Since July 2002, there have been 1,000 bedwatches for 60 prisoners at Wymott, averaging around 40 per week. No figures are centrally collected on the frequency of bedwatches and information on the average number in other prisons is therefore not available.

<a name="30128w10.html_para6">We have also strengthened the secure remand powers and introduced bail tagging for 12 to 16-year-olds nationally, and 17-year-olds in the 10 street crime priority areas, who repeatedly offend.

 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> Police grant is allocated by the police funding formula and not by police authority bids.

<P>

 An imitation firearm can create the same fear as a real one. It is not acceptable that people going about their business should be put in fear in this way. We therefore propose to introduce a new offence of having an imitation firearm in a public place without reasonable excuse.
<P>

<a name="30128w10.html_para10">This will mean that anyone seen in public with an imitation firearm can be challenged and if they do not have a reasonable explanation for having the gun, they can be arrested before any further offences can be committed.

 We received reports about flooding and landslides in the Maili Su area of Kyrgyzstan in May 2002. There was some concern at the time that Soviet era uranium dumps and deposits could be disturbed, leading to contamination of Kyrgyz rivers. Though this did not happen, there remains some risk that radioactive waste could be disturbed by future landslides and earthquakes. If waste was to enter the Maili Su river, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, through which the river also flows, would be affected. We are not aware of reports suggesting that Afghanistan would be affected, but will continue to monitor the situation.

<a name="30128w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The EU has put in place targeted sanctions including an arms embargo, a travel ban and assets freeze, specifically targeted at 79 members of the Mugabe regime. We have also made clear our views that the British cricket team should not play in Zimbabwe at present. However we do not believe that a general sporting boycott, power sanctions, or wider economic sanctions would be right. Such measures would only serve to harm the Zimbabwean people, who are already suffering enough under Mugabe's leadership. The latest yearly figure for imports from Zimbabwe to the UK is for 2001, when imports amounted to &pound;91 million.

 The decision to locate the North Down Wastewater Treatment Works on the site adjacent to the Donaghadee Carpet Factory was taken in February 2002 by Peter Robinson MP MLA, the then Minister for Regional Development, following a detailed site search and appraisal process, and consideration and evaluation of all relevant factors.

When these are received, Planning Service will assess the responses from consultees to ensure that they are satisfied with the content of the Environmental Statement. If further information is required, an addendum to the Environmental Statement will be necessary.
<P>

<a name="30128w12.html_para4">The application and the Environmental Statement were advertised for public comment in accordance with the normal procedures. A substantial number of objections have been received, including the Donaghadee Planning Action Group.

<a name="30128w12.html_para6">In parallel with the planning issues, the Valuation and Lands Agency has been asked to commence initial land acquisition procedures for the site. The cost of the entire scheme has recently been assessed and is now estimated to be &pound;42 million. The Works has been identified as one of seven major wastewater treatment projects that may be suitable for inclusion in a Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme of work. This programme is currently the subject of a detailed appraisal study that will take several months to complete.

<P>
<a name="30128w12.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Regional Transportation Strategy (RTS) for Northern Ireland 2002&#150;2012 identifies a range of strategic transportation investment priorities including funding of just over &pound;500 million in railways over the next 10 years. It does not specify amounts to be invested in individual railway lines. Commitments to proceed with any major capital scheme will be subject to the normal Budgetary process, economic appraisal and the consideration of any statutory procedures. Furthermore, decisions on the retention of rail services north of Whitehead; and north and north-west of Ballymena, will also be subject to successful results from the introduction of new trains and improved infrastructure on the rest of the network early in the implementation of the Strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 It has been the longstanding policy of successive Governments not to disclose internal policy advice, including legal advice, under Part 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. As I have repeatedly made clear, no decision has been made to take military action and military action is not inevitable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We will be working closely with pathfinder authorities to introduce the standard local housing allowance scheme and will ensure that local stakeholders including landlords, letting agents, and statutory and voluntary sector advisers, are consulted and made fully aware of the changes.
<P>

<a name="30128w14.html_para0">It will be an important part of our evaluation strategy to consider the views of all local stakeholders as well as those of tenants affected by the scheme. Details of how this will be done have not yet been decided but we

<P><I>28 Jan 2003 : Column 775W</I><P>
recognise the importance of consulting the full range of stakeholders at regular stages during the pilot. As usual, the results of the evaluation will be published.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 On 12 December 2001, we responded positively and in detail to the Better Regulation Task Force report &quot;Housing Benefit: A Case Study of Lone Parents". A copy of our response is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30128w14.html_para1">On 17 October 2002, we announced a wide-ranging package of reforms for housing benefit (HB). The overall strategy for reforming HB is to improve administration, promote choice and responsibility, enhance work incentives and reduce levels of fraud and error in the system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> Affected women were identified by a trawl of the NIRS database and invited to claim. In addition, there was a publicity campaign aimed at finding those women who did not receive an invitation to claim for whatever reason.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Currently around half a million pensioners aged 65 or over work. The earnings of pensioners aged 65 or over will be rewardable in the savings credit. The existing earnings disregards of &pound;5, &pound;10 and &pound;20 that apply in the Minimum Income Guarantee will also apply in Pension Credit. The remunerative work rule that excludes from Minimum Income Guarantee pensioners who work 16 hours a week or more (24 hours for couples) will be abolished for Pension Credit.
<P>

<a name="30128w14.html_para2">For example, a pensioner receiving retirement pension of &pound;77.45 and earning &pound;35 per week would get nothing under the present MIG scheme. However, under Pension Credit, he would be &pound;12.65 better off a week, or almost &pound;658 per year.

been refused since 1998; what the total sum issued since 1998 has been; how much remains outstanding; how much has been recovered via debt agencies and court orders; how much has been defaulted; and if he will make a statement.  [88837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Career Development Loans (CDLs) are deferred repayment commercial bank loans designed to help individuals, who may not otherwise be able to afford or have access to funds to pay for vocational education and learning. The DfES operates the programme in partnership with three high street banks and pays the interest on the loan for the period of training covered by the CDL. For the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2002, 79,641 loans have been taken out with a value of &pound;316 million. As at 31 December 2002, &pound;94 million remained outstanding for payment of interest by the Department and this value will continue to reduce over time. The amount that has been defaulted is &pound;24 million and &pound;2.6 million has been recovered so far. This reflects a net default rate of 7 per cent. compared to the 15 per cent. maximum operating limit agreed with the banks to cover the higher level of risk they take in making these particular loans. The exact number of applications refused by the banks is not known. The refusal rate varies between the banks, but the overall rate is around 25 per cent. of applications received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w14.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The national Education Maintenance Allowance will be designed to cover the day-to-day expenses associated with participating in further education, such as the cost of books and equipment, and to help towards the cost of transport to and from a learning centre. Additional funding, via the Learner Support Fund, will be available for students facing particular needs or costs that threaten their access to, or completion of, further education courses. This will include help with the costs of child care.
<P>

<a name="30128w14.html_para3">Under the Learner Support Fund, up to &pound;4,000 per annum is available according to the costs of the child care and the young parent's financial circumstances. The maximum amount available will increase to &pound;5,000 per annum from September 2003 to provide for the higher costs prevailing in some areas.

 Funding for nursery school places will be within local government formula grant from 2003&#150;04. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will announce our final proposals for the 2003&#150;04 local government finance settlement on Monday 3 February; the House will have the chance to debate these on Wednesday 5 February. It will, of course, be for the authority to decide what allocation to make to specific services.

<P>
<a name="30128w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Local authorities in England have been asked to provide estimates of the average time taken to re-let their housing stock on their annual Housing Investment Programme (HIP) returns since 1994. Because of variations in the way local authorities maintain lettings records and compile these estimates, the figures quoted, and any comparisons between authorities, should be treated with caution. Comparable information in respect of re-lettings by registered social landlords is only available from 1996&#150;97.

ONS are not anticipating making changes to their figures, but if this should occur the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consider what impact these may have on the Local Government Finance Settlement. The floors provided for under the Local Government Settlement ensure that no authority receives an increase in grant less than inflation in 2003&#150;04 irrespective of reductions in the estimated resident population of that authority in the 2001 census.

 Decisions on specific health issues like occupational stress are a matter for individual local authority employers and detailed information about causes and prevalence is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, as part of the Review of Ill-Health Retirement in the Public Sector, there continues to be close collaboration with the Employers' Organisation for Local Government and the Association of Local Authority Medical Advisers in the preparation of a Management of Ill-Health Retirement handbook published in September 2002. This includes a chapter on the causes of stress, recognising the symptoms and the implications for local authority managers and those working in the occupational health sector.

 This Government do not set regional housebuilding targets.

Guidance on this is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 11 on 'Regional Planning' and Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 on 'Housing'. These arrangements will continue when regional spatial strategies replace regional planning guidance as provided for in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill.

 The effect of lower maximum Right to Buy discounts on the supply of affordable housing in any area will depend upon a number of factors.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is minded to reduce the maximum Right to Buy discount available to tenants to &pound;16,000 in Christchurch and 41 other areas which are under the greatest housing market pressure, as evidenced by a high local incidence of homelessness and high house prices. The reduction will apply to all social housing available under the Right to Buy scheme in those areas. We have written to the local housing authorities giving them the opportunity to provide reasons why the change should not be made in their area. We will consider carefully all representations received.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister why the number of lets to new council tenants and nominations by landlords to registered social landlords less the number of homes let to homeless households is reduced by 20 per cent. for the purpose of calculating available lets under the reduced discount scheme for right to buy.  [94040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In the initial assessment of 'available lets', a reduction of 20 per cent. was made to allow for dwellings unsuitable for the homeless (such as sheltered housing) and for other inescapable demand (such as urgent medical priority cases). This adjustment was made consistently in respect of all local authorities, so it did not affect their final ranking on the basis of the objective indicator of demand pressure.

 Generally probate cases will not be publicly funded but cases in the other categories may well be.
<P>

<a name="30128w19.html_para3">Since 1 April 2001, all publicly funded legal service suppliers, whether solicitor firms or not for profit agencies, have had to hold a quality mark before being awarded a Legal Services Commission (LSC) contract. All solicitor suppliers for specialist legal services must hold the Specialist Quality Mark (SQM). The SQM focuses, in respect of individual competence, on supervision, training, and file review processes, and requires supervisor solicitors to be accredited to category specific qualifying panels as evidence of competence. The LSC conducts regular quality mark audits to ensure suppliers meet the required standard. The LSC also conducts cost compliance audits to check that public funds claimed by a supplier are being used appropriately.
<P>

<a name="30128w19.html_para4">These audits enable the LSC to take appropriate measures to deal with poor quality work, including cost reductions and, in extreme cases, removal of the contract.

 We are committed to expanding the primary care workforce both through national and local initiatives. The London Workforce Development Confederation has introduced a number of specific programmes to expand the general practitioner workforce in London by 225 GPs. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The London Deanery's successful expansion of the number of training places in GP practices for GP registrars. This year there are an additional 51 training places for GPs in London. Primary care trusts will be able to build on this success by setting up new and more flexible contracts for newly qualified GPs.
<P>
<BR>
 More flexible career opportunities, particularly those designed to retain GPs close to retirement age, are also being put into place by London PCTs including a Flexible Career Scheme which will commence shortly, designed to attract GPs back into practice for part-time working.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30128w22.html_para0">Havering PCT is supporting nine applications for personal medical service status which includes seven salaried GP posts. The PCT is also working to make Havering a more attractive proposition for GPs to retain and further recruit doctors in the area. Some of the areas being progressed are the development of specialist GPs and a means of retaining registrars after they qualify. Developing the primary care infrastructure is also a key element of the PCT's strategy and its involvement in the local improvement finance trust process should further enhance its ability to retain GPs by making improved facilities available to them.

 The table shows the number of national health service sight tests paid for in Shropshire health authority (HA) for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02. Figures for the number of sight tests by constituency and age are not collected centrally, the nearest eligibility category for pensioners is those aged 60 and over.
<P>

<a name="30128w22.html_para1">Eligibility to NHS sight tests was extended to those aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. There was an increase of 24,660 sight tests between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000. It is fair to assume that the vast majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact of shift patterns of working in acute hospitals on <i>(a)</i> continuity of patient care and <i>(b)</i> overall quality of patient care.  [92108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The majority of health professionals have always worked on shift patterns. The main exception has been the provision of resident out of hours medical cover, which has been largely provided by doctors in training. The most common arrangement is for these doctors to work a 'resident on call' where the doctor is resident on hospital premises for the full 24 hour period but only deemed to be working when actually called.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para0">With the extension of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) to doctors in training from August 2004, current resident on call working patterns are unlikely to represent the best use of available resources. Doctors providing out of hours cover will generally have to either move on to some form of shift pattern or provide cover through non-resident on call working.
<P>

been issued (HSC 2003&#150;001) and the Department is funding a programme of pilot projects to test a range of solutions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the cost is of the proposed development by the Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale primary care trust on the site of Irwell Mill, Rochdale Road, Bacup; who will be responsible for the demolition and at what cost; and what payments in connection with the purchase of this site will be made to Stylegleam Ltd.  [91935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w23.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale primary care trust will be the owners of Irwell Mill in the very near future. The site was purchased at an auction, at an overall purchase price of &pound;36,500. &pound;14,500 was paid to the part owners, who are not Stylegleam Ltd., but may be associated with them. The purchases have been agreed by the district valuer.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para4">Most of the mill will be demolished, with the Burnley borough council acting as the agents. The Regional Development Agency is funding the demolition work as part of its contribution to the regeneration of the town. A grant of &pound;292,880 has been made available for this purpose.

<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para5">From September 2003, the site will be transferred into a new public/private company. The primary care trust will have to repay any betterment value to the Regional Development Agency. This is likely to be in the region of &pound;60,000. Any payments to the Regional Development Agency will be paid out of enabling monies, which have been made available to the East Lancashire local investment finance trust project. Thus, the cost of the acquisition and demolition to the primary care trust will be nil.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para6">Once the site has been transferred into the public/private company, the latter will construct a new health centre on the site, estimated at &pound;4.087 million including equipment, to provide health care facilities to national standards.

 In the United Kingdom, there are three licensed products containing the herbal ingredient Kava-kava (Piper methysticum). The majority of medicinal products containing Kava-kava sold in the UK are unlicensed and are exempt from licensing under section 12 of the Medicines Act 1968.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para7">Evidence has emerged that consumption of medicinal products containing Kava-kava may be associated with liver toxicity in rare cases. To date, 70 cases of liver damage, suspected to be associated with the consumption of Kava-kava, have been reported worldwide. The case reports originate from Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Canada, France, the United States and four from the UK.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para8">The severity of the liver damage suffered varies widely. Suspected adverse reactions include abnormal liver enzyme activity, jaundice, hepatitis and liver failure. In seven cases the patients suffered irreversible liver failure and received liver transplants. Four patients have died, including two of the patients who received liver transplants. None of the UK cases were associated with a fatal outcome.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para10">In addition the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) received 13 case reports of hepatotoxicity associated with Kava-kava in 2002 from regulatory authorities world wide, where the date of the adverse reaction or received date were not specified.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para11">A report of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the herbal medicine. The number of reports received cannot be used as a basis for determining the incidence of a reaction as neither the total number of reactions occurring, nor the number of patients using the herbal medicine is known. Herbal medicines are often supplied without prescription and are taken without advice from doctors or pharmacists. It is generally recognised that the reporting rate for medicines supplied over the counter is lower than that of suspected adverse reactions associated with prescription medicines. Therefore, data obtained on suspected adverse reactions associated with herbal medicines through the Yellow Card Scheme cannot be directly compared to reporting for licensed pharmaceutical medicines.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para12">The acceptable level of risk for a medicine will depend on the seriousness of the disease it is being used to treat and its efficacy in treating that disease as well as the availability of alternatives. A risk of an adverse effect that would be acceptable for a life saving treatment such as an anti-cancer medicine would not necessarily be acceptable in a treatment for a non-serious or self-limiting condition.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para13">Each safety issue is considered on a case by case basis. In the case of Kava-kava the limited evidence of efficacy, the unpredictable and serious nature of the adverse reactions, the difficulty in regularly monitoring liver function without medical supervision and the lack of regulatory powers to require label warnings for unlicensed medicines were taken in to account.
<P>

<a name="30128w23.html_para14">The safety of Kava-kava has been discussed with European member states via the pharmacovigilance working party of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. The MCA has in addition communicated with the regulatory authorities of the USA, Australia and Canada. Other European member states have revoked or suspended the licences and Australia and Canada have initiated recalls of all products containing Kava-kava.

<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2003 : Column 819W</I><P>
authorised in the United Kingdom is seven to nine weeks. Zyban should not be used for six months and therefore it is not possible to give an estimate of the likely fatal and non-fatal side effects of Zyban if used for this period of time.
<P>

<a name="30128w25.html_para8">Zyban is an effective aid to smoking cessation, and like all effective medicines is not without side effects. Since its launch in the United Kingdom, full guidance on prescribing and use, including possible side effects, have been present in the summary of product characteristics for health professionals and patient information leaflet for patients.
<P>

<a name="30128w25.html_para9">The side effects that are recognised to occur more commonly, ie, could happen to more than one in 100 people, in association with Zyban are non-serious including insomnia, urticaria, rash, headache, dizziness and nausea. Serious side effects do occur in association with Zyban, albeit rarely. These include seizures (fits or convulsions) which occur with an incidence of approximately 0.1 per cent., (one in 1,000) and hypertension and severe hypersensitivity reactions (which may occur in between one in 1,000 and one in 10,000 people taking Zyban). Of these, seizures and severe hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening.

 The Department of Health's spending plans for 2003&#150;04 for programmes that aim to improve nutrition, including provision and promotion, have not yet been finalised.

 The Department does not hold central figures on the amount of surgical equipment disposed of each year.
<P>

<a name="30128w27.html_para9">Each national health service trust decides how to dispose of its surgical equipment. The NHS takes into account health and safety issues, such as risk of cross-infection when recycling or reselling surgical equipment. These issues include the possibility of the transfer of infections such as vCJD, HIV, hepatitis and the need for ensuring that staff using the equipment are properly trained.

 In previous years, a number of health and social care partnerships have used additional winter funding to create extra capacity in so-called transitional care.

The checklist was assessed against the Ministry of Defence safety management system, and as a result, policy changes were made and the objectives contained in the checklist were integrated into the MOD's Safety Environment and Fire Audit Methodology. The MOD had already adopted the Health and Safety Executive guidance, Successful Heath and Safety Management (HSG 65), into its safety management system and the impact of the checklist was minimal.

To provide timely accommodation for service personnel and to allow for the high mobility of service life, DHE's long-term strategy is to operate with a management margin of no more than 10 per cent. of vacant properties. The welfare of military personnel and their families is paramount: requiring families to move mid-tour to facilitate property disposals is unpopular and could ultimately affect morale and retention. Maintaining a reasonable management margin allows DHE to keep these moves to a minimum. Unlike the situation with many other housing providers, turnover of occupants is generally high, and it would be inappropriate to keep void rates very low by using waiting lists and temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast.<P>

One of the key targets set for DHE is to reduce the management margin progressively towards 10 per cent. by November 2005. A policy of continuous review of all quarters has secured the disposal of nearly 11,000 properties in the last three years. In accordance with wider Government policy, properties that are temporarily surplus but held for known future deployments are offered to registered social landlords, local authorities, and more recently to key workers from the fire, police, prison, NHS, and education services.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The offences contained in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) reflect international law provisions that were already applicable to the conduct of United Kingdom forces in any theatre of engagement. The ICC Statute does not therefore impose new conditions.
<P>

<a name="30128w30.html_para3">The consequences for our forces of UK ratification of the ICC Statute were carefully examined in preparation for the ICC Act 2001. Under the Statute, investigation and, if necessary prosecution of any allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide by a UK national would be carried out by the UK. The Court would intervene only if it determined that a state was unwilling or unable to pursue a particular case, but it is inconceivable that the UK would ever be unable or unwilling to investigate or take appropriate action.

<a name="30128w30.html_para4">The Sea King has provided the backbone of the Royal Navy's anti-submarine capability over the last three decades, but is being progressively withdrawn from service as Merlin becomes operational. The Sea King Airborne Early Warning Mark 2 has been upgraded to Mark 7 to provide enhanced airborne surveillance and control for air defence into the next decade. The Sea King Mark 4, supplemented by the conversion of some Mark 6 aircraft, will continue to provide a support helicopter capability, primarily for three Commando Brigade Royal Marines, until the turn of the decade. The Sea King Mark 5 will provide a SAR capability well into the next decade.

<a name="30128w30.html_para5">Lynx Mark 3 and Mark 8 aircraft provide surveillance and attack capability from assigned frigates and destroyers. This includes surface surveillance and targeting, anti-surface and anti-submarine weapon delivery, and battle damage assessment, as well as key elements of frigates' and destroyers' SAR, humanitarian support and constabulary capabilities. The Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR) will be phased into service during the second half of the decade to succeed and enhance the capability currently provided by the Lynx Mark 3 and Mark 8 helicopters.

Failure to comply with an order of a Reinstatement Committee is a criminal offence, and an employer may be fined on summary conviction. Appeals by either the employer or the Reservist against the determination of the Reinstatement Committee may be made to an Umpire appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he will make a statement on the role and structure of the Royal Naval Reserve;  [92969]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment his Department has made of the changed roles of <i>(a)</i> the RNR and <i>(b)</i> the RMR since 11 September 2001.  [92966]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w31.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) exists to provide a corps of readily available, highly trained personnel to enable the Royal Navy to meet its operational commitments in times of stretch, crisis, tension and war&#151;including peacekeeping and humanitarian operations and disaster relief.
<P>

<a name="30128w31.html_para12">The RNR is based upon 13 general-purpose Reserve Training Centres located throughout the United Kingdom. The majority of RNR Branches and Specialisations provide unique skill sets, which are not generally required in peacetime, but are used to augment the Fleet in times of crisis. The operational structure of the RNR has recently been updated to ensure that these requirements can be met. The structure comprises six branches, some of which cover a number of specialisations.
<P>

<a name="30128w31.html_para13">Following the events of 11 September, my hon Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced that the Ministry of Defence would look again at its defence posture to ensure that we have the right concepts, the right forces and the right capabilities to meet the additional challenges we face from international terrorism and asymmetric threat. He described this work as a New Chapter to the Strategic Defence Review published in 1998. This was presented to Parliament by my hon Friend the Secretary of State for Defence by Command of Her Majesty in July 2002.
<P>

<a name="30128w31.html_para14">Following this review, there are no changes to the role of the Royal Naval Reserve. Neither have there been changes to the role of the RMR, which remains to reinforce the Royal Marines and other services as and when required with individuals and sub-units world-wide.

 All members of the Royal Naval Reserve are volunteers. There were 3,222 volunteers as at 31 December 2002. There are 103 serving&#151;i.e. regular armed forces&#151;personnel and 13 Retired Officers employed in managing the RNR and training the volunteers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are currently fifty Royal Navy personnel in the Balkans. Two patrol craft, one rigid raiding craft and fifty RN or Royal Marine personnel are currently allocated to British Forces Cyprus. In Sierra Leone, three RN personnel are assigned to UNAMSIL and two RN personnel to the International Military Assistance and Training Team.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No Royal Navy assets are specifically allocated to combating piracy. International Maritime Law does however, place an obligation on any seafarer to assist others in distress if they are in a position to do so. RN ships would offer such assistance if appropriate. In areas where there is a known risk of piracy, RN warships would take this into consideration and adjust their own level of readiness accordingly.Again, there are no RN assets dedicated specifically to counter narcotics activities. Military Forces are, however, made available upon request, when operational commitments and resources allow, to support the counter drugs activities of the law enforcement agencies. In recent years, such assistance has been provided in the Caribbean, United Kingdom waters, Atlantic and the Arabian Sea.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what Royal Navy resources are allocated to training former Eastern Bloc countries' armed forces.  [92897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w32.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has pursued for several years an active programme of defence assistance to countries of the former Eastern Bloc, as an integral part of our policy to build stability and security in the region. For geographical and historical reasons, defence assistance is focused principally on land forces but, where practical, the Royal Navy contributes to the overall programme. In particular, students from the former Eastern Bloc attend Royal Naval Initial Officer Training and Tactical and Staff Training at the Naval module of intermediate staff training courses in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Royal Navy also undertakes joint mine warfare training in the Baltic with Allies and the Baltic states; and is supporting the operational sea training of the Polish frigate Pulaski to bring her into NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic for 2004. There is also a well established programme of naval co-operation with Russia which includes some limited elements of training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the specialist <i>(a)</i> anti-aircraft, <i>(b)</i> anti-ship and <i>(c)</i> anti-submarine capabilities of each class of (i) frigate and (ii) destroyer (A) being built and (B) already deployed by the Royal Navy.  [92900]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30128w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The in-service Type 22 (Broadsword Class) and Type 23 (Duke Class) Frigates have been designed primarily for the Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) role. To fulfil this, they have torpedo tubes fitted and Lynx or Merlin ASW helicopters embarked. Their anti-aircraft capability is provided by Sea Wolf missiles, and their anti-surface ship capability by Sea Skua missiles carried on Lynx helicopters, close-range guns and long-range Harpoon anti-surface missiles.
<P>

<a name="30128w32.html_para0">The primary role of the in-service Type 42 Destroyer is to provide air defence for task group operations. For this, it is equipped with Sea Dart anti-aircraft missiles, which also have a secondary anti-surface ship capability. As with the Frigates, Type 42 Destroyers 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2003 : Column 844W</I><P>
also have torpedo tubes and Lynx ASW aircraft for anti-submarine warfare, with anti-surface capability provided by Sea Skua missiles on Lynx aircraft.
<P>

<a name="30128w32.html_para1">Equipped with the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS), the prime role of the future Type 45 Destroyers will be anti-air Warfare. The Sea Skua missile, fitted to the Lynx helicopter, together with the ship's medium range gunnery system, will provide the anti-surface ship capability. Anti-submarine warfare capability will primarily be provided by the Lynx helicopter, equipped with Stingray anti-submarine torpedoes. The systems delivering these capabilities will be considered for progressive updates during the in-service life of the Type 45, which is designed with significant space and weight margins to meet emerging requirements.

 The Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and the other services, take part in a wide range of multinational and bilateral training exercises to prepare for operations and enhance interoperability with NATO and coalition partners. In addition, United Kingdom operational sea training and joint maritime courses (JMCs) are carried out with participants from a wide range of European navies, USA, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, with the aim of preparing units to operate together.
<P>

<a name="30128w32.html_para2">The Royal Navy and Royal Marines maintain personnel exchange programmes with allies. In addition to core exercise activity, exercises are carried out with other nations in support of defence diplomacy initiatives, including Partnership for Peace countries. The Royal Navy and Royal Marines are also committed to the United Kingdom Netherlands Amphibious Force (UKNLAF), which has proved a model for amphibious co-operation for other nations in Europe. This standing force celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2003 and the capability has been maintained through regular shared training opportunities.
<P>

<a name="30128w32.html_para3">Examples of major Royal Navy and Royal Marines' multinational and bilateral exercises in 2002 included an integrated air defence exercise with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia (five powers defence arrangements), exercise Destined Glory with other NATO members and exercise Blackhorse with the USA. Major elements of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines also participated in exercise Saif Sareea in late 2001, alongside the Omani armed forces.

 The Royal Navy (RN) has a squadron of three Hunt Class patrol craft based in Faslane, which support naval operations in Northern Ireland. One patrol craft, with 35 personnel onboard, is routinely deployed to patrol Northern Ireland territorial waters every day of the year. This ship is supported by a team of eight Royal Marines (RM) with four rigid inflatable boats to conduct the boarding of vessels entering or leaving NI ports. There are also 20 RN/RM personnel based in the Province who provide operational support to the patrol vessel.

<P>
<a name="30128w33.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Sea Cadet movement is a national youth charity based on the customs and traditions of the Royal Navy. It provides young people from 10 to 18-years-old with life skills of teamwork, self-respect and social responsibility. It has a training programme ranging from seamanship and maritime skills to music, cookery and computing, and aims to provide teenagers with a serious, but fun, alternative to the youth leisure industry at the heart of the local community.
<P>

<a name="30128w33.html_para0">The Sea Cadet Corps has approximately 400 units. Each unit is a registered charity in its own right run by a management committee and supported by the Sea Cadet Association (SCA) which has branches around the country. The SCA is a fundraising charity which, along with the Ministry of Defence, provides essential
