industry, what assumptions were made in producing the estimate that UK crude oil production will fall below 25 per cent. of refinery demand between 2010 and 2015. [99141]</p>

 The UK&#146;s 25 per cent. derogation from its EU obligation to hold emergency stocks of oil is based on the extent to which UK consumption is supplied by UK production. Our projections are that UK consumption will remain fairly steady in the short to medium term. We expect, partly as a consequence of the new Buzzard field coming fully on-stream, that UK production will rise from current levels in 2007 and 2008, and will then fall, with the UK becoming a net importer of oil on a sustained annual basis by around 2010. A large and growing net import requirement is expected thereafter. It is not clear at what rate production will fall. But it is possible that it will fall fast enough for that proportion of refinery demand and through that of UK consumption which is met by UK production to fall below 25 per cent. We think it prudent to allow for this possibility in the context of our increasing oil stocking obligation, but are keeping the position under review.</p>

 Electricity distribution network operators, of which United Utilities is one, must offer terms to connect consumers. These are set out in their guaranteed standards of service. If consumers are not satisfied that their local electricity distribution network operator is meeting these standard terms and conditions they should discuss the matter with the statutory consumer body, energywatch. If energywatch believe the standards have not been met, they can refer the matter to the regulator, Ofgem, for investigation and action. It should also be noted that there is competition in connections so consumers do not have to use incumbent network operators to provide a connection to their property.</p>

 The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive is required to be implemented in its entirety in all member states by 2007. In the UK, the farming sector is among the last to be regulated by the national transposing regulations (with the exception of new installations).

 DFID&#146;s standard conflict assessment methodology is the Strategic Conflict Assessment (SCA). The SCA is a framework to analyse the implications of conflict for development policy and programming, and vice versa. It is a flexible tool, adaptable to the country context and can be used in conjunction with a range of other assessment tools. The SCA has been in use in its current form since 2001. The framework is outlined in &#147;Conducting Conflict Assessments: Guidance Notes&#148;, which can be found on the DFID website at http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/conflict-assess-guidance.pdf</p>

 The ongoing negotiations on economic partnership agreements (EPAs) between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries have had an effect on the UK&#146;s international development strategies. These agreements are due to be finalised by the end of 2007. The Government have responded specifically to the ongoing EPAs negotiations and we published a policy statement in March 2005 on how we think EPAs should be designed if they are to help the ACP countries develop. This policy determines how we will influence the EPA negotiations and assess their outcome. We continue to talk to other EU member states about taking a similar approach and we continue to put pressure on the European Commission to take account of the ACP countries&#146; development interests, most recently at the meeting of trade and development Ministers in Luxemburg on 16 October.</p>

The Commission are obliged to adhere to these conclusions which endorse some of the key elements of the UK Position paper; notably the support for a flexible approach in which ACP countries will open up their markets to a lesser extent and at a slower pace than the EU. We continue to support ACP countries and negotiators in order to ensure that they have access to independent research and technical assistance. We believe this support will help the ACP make informed choices on what sort of trade relationship they want with the EU. The UK Government continue to be in close contact with the ACP in order to understand their needs and concerns. These conclusions also critically acknowledge the right of the ACP to decide the content of their EPA.</p>

The UK Government are committed to ensuring that this review is meaningful and with the full participation of the ACP. Crucially both the EU and the ACP have agreed that the recommendations of the review will be discussed at a high level and will be taken on board in the 2007 negotiations. As the negotiations progress into 2007, the UK Government will continue monitoring the approach taken by the Commission, as well as listening to the ACP, in order to ensure our 2005 commitments are honoured.</p>

 Giving young people the skills and confidence to resist pressure and delay early sex has been an integral part of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy from the start&#151;both through the national media campaign and in our guidance on sex and relationships education. Data from the independent national evaluation of the strategy show that over the course of the strategy, young people aged 13-17 have become less likely to overestimate the proportion of under 16s having sex and more likely to feel confident to resist pressure from friends. There has been no change in levels of under-age sex since the start of the strategy. The Department has received no representations about this campaign.</p>

 Local authorities have a statutory duty, where necessary, to assess children with special educational needs (SEN) and draw up statements. In carrying out this duty local authorities must have regard to the guidance in the SEN Code of Practice. The Code advises that a local authority should consider carrying out a statutory assessment with a view to drawing up a statement if a child has not responded to the Code&#146;s school-based levels of support, School Action and School Action Plus, and that their needs are such that they cannot be met from the resources normally available to mainstream schools.</p>

The proper implementation of this strategy does not lead to a reduction of entitlement: children who might previously have been given a statement will continue to have their needs met from improved school provision and those with severe or complex needs who still require statements would continue to be provided with them.</p>

 The application period for chairsand members of probation boards closed on 9 and16 October 2006 respectively and the numbers received were for chair, 719 and for members, 2,300. As the respective vacancies stand at 30 and 296 this is an excellent result, which we anticipate will produce sufficient quality candidates to fill the chair and board member vacancies. At this stage I do not, therefore propose to extend the term of office of any chairs or board members. However if after the interview stage there remains a shortfall in either category I will consider amending the relevant statutory instruments.</p>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

 The &#147;Connect to your Council&#148; Take-Up campaign was launched in England in May 2006 with a &#163;3.4 million media budget. Market research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) from Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) shows that 21 per cent. of respondents who were able to recall the advertising declared that they had already visited their council website as a result of the &#147;Connect to your Council&#148; campaign. This translates into 1.3 million visits to the campaign home page and other local government pages of the Directgov website during the first burst of advertising between May to July 2006, with an increase of 88 per cent. in people accessing council websites from one in 11 of the adult population in England pre-campaign to one in six post campaign. Copies of the Central Office of Information (COI) evaluation report on the impact of the first burst of the campaign are available from the DCLG website.</p>

 The right-to-buy scheme (RTB) became available to tenants in October 1980. Local authorities in England report the number of sales, amount of money received and the discount given to Department for Communities and Local Government on a quarterly basis. This return is not statutory, but generally levels of response are greater than 90 per cent. In order to get a consistent estimate of RTB activity DCLG make estimates for missing LA returns.

There were also some 33,000 pensions in payment in cases where noise induced hearing loss was one of a number of conditions accepted as attributable to service. It is not possible to say in these cases whether the pension included an amount in respect of the hearing loss: noise-induced hearing loss of less than 50 dB is not included in the assessment on which the pension is based if the claim was made after January 1993 and WPCS data do not distinguish between cases where the pension includes an element for noise-induced hearing loss and those where it is excluded. In addition, the data show around a further 30,000 cases with noise-induced hearing loss accepted as attributable to service with an overall assessment below the level that would attract an ongoing pension.</p>

 It is not possible to define thenumber of additional claims for compensationand war disablement pensions if the noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss compensation threshold was lowered to 44dB or 35db. However, following a series of meeting with officials my predecessor wrote to the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (&#147;RNID&#148;) on17 March 2006 informing them that it would cost the MOD in the region of &#163;140 million per year if the Department reduced its noise-induced hearing loss compensation threshold to 35dB. This figure was based on data, for 30 June 2005, from the war pension computer system which shows approximately 105,000 cases with an overall assessment of between 1 per cent. and sixty per cent. with NISHL accepted as attributable to service. It does not take account of cases for which there are no records held on the computer system, or any new claims that will be made if the compensation threshold is reduced.</p>

 We are aware of concerns that, while much palm cultivation in Colombia is both legal and unobjectionable, some palms are being grown on lands to which title is in dispute. We are also aware of concerns that palm cultivation can contribute to clearance of tropical forest, which may result in the displacement of people living in these areas. We regularly raise human rights issues with the Colombian Government. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, and the Minister for the Middle East, most recently raised these issues with Colombian Ministers during their respective visits to Colombia in September and October.

 Answering this question would incur disproportionate cost: the information on the financial and organisational support by the UK is not held centrally, and we do not hold detailed information on the financial or organisational support given to bi-communal institutions by the EU or UN. Dialogue and co-operation between the two communities at all levels of society will provide the surest foundation for progress towards a comprehensive settlement. To this end, the UK has made financial contributions to the UN Committee for missing persons, and will continue to respond positively to requests for support for other bi-communal activities. Furthermore, we support the EU Commission in its dispersal of the financial assistance package for the Turkish Cypriots and note that improving contacts between the two communities is part of its overall objective.</p>

 We maintain a dialogue with the Turkish Cypriot community and Turkey on all aspects of the Cyprus problem, including regional trade liberalisation. We encourage the Turkish Cypriot community to make full use of existing opportunities for trade, including exporting goods to the EU via the Green Line and the ports of Limassol and Larnaca. This dialogue continued under the UK presidency of the EU. We do not have details of what representations have been made by subsequent presidencies or the Commission on the implementation of the Green Line Regulation or the use of the ports of Limassol and Larnaca.

Consequently, we continue to support further regional trade liberalisation in promotion of the economic convergence of the two communities and in support of a comprehensive settlement.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) attaches great importance to all aspects of diversity, including age diversity. The Department already has a good overview of the age profile of our workforce and does not need to carry out an age audit. We are working closely with the trades union side on the implementation of the new age regulations, within the structural constraints of the FCO&#146;s workforce planning. As part of our commitment to age diversity, we have abolished the retirement age for the delegated grades below the senior management structure. The retirement age for senior civil servants in all Government Departments is currently set centrally, and has been raised from 60 to 65. We are exploring with the Cabinet Office whether it would be possible to abolish the retirement age for the senior management structure as well. The professional skills needs of older staff are dealt with in the same way as all other officers. Pre-retirement training needs are taken very seriously and a range of training and support is offered by a dedicated team. Anyone working for the FCO can ask to work flexibly. We have published flexible working guidelines for individuals and line managers on our intranet with a link to a flexible working network and an on-line discussion forum for flexible workers.</p>

 We are deeply concerned about human rights in Sri Lanka in general. Officials from our high commission in Colombo visited Jaffna in October. It is clear that the fighting between the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in that area in recent months has had a serious impact on the security of Jaffna and its residents. The strong military presence and actions, such as wide-ranging curfews, are restricting the freedoms of Jaffna&#146;s civilian population and contributing to increased tensions.
