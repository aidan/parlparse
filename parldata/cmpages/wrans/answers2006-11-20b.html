Every secondary school and every local authority is, for example, able to invest in laboratories, where this is needed. Our strategic programmes, Building Schools for the Future and Academies, are also providing brand new science laboratories: planning is underway for almost a third of secondary schools, with every school due to benefit over the longer term.</p>

Teams of leading designers and educationalists with expertise in science teaching will develop a range of exemplar designs for school science laboratories by mid-2007.

Part of the focus of this initiative was to investigate the impact of air pollutants on lung function and another part on studies of the effect of living near roads on respiratory symptoms; others are in part relevant to improving our understanding of the factors that cause or exacerbate asthma. It is not possible separately to identify the asthma related costs included in the latter.<br>
<sup>(3 )</sup>Research active NHS organisations' annual research and development reports identify expenditure in some 16 national priority areas, including respiratory disease.
