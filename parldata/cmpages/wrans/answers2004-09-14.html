 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the debt of <i>(a)</i> the Royal United hospital, Bath and <i>(b)</i> Kennet and North Wiltshire primary care trust is.  [188513]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 At the end of the financial year 2003&#150;04, the total owed by Royal United hospitals, Bath as a result of previous years overspends was &#163;24.7 million.

<p>
<a name="40914w01.html_para0">
The comparable figure for Kennet and North Wiltshire Primary Care Trust was &#163;3.9 million.

<p>14. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn1"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of out-of-hours provision by doctors in North Yorkshire since 1 April.  [188514]</p>









<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 It is the legal responsibility of primary care trusts to ensure that patients have access to high quality out-of-hours services which are delivered to nationally set quality requirements. The four PCTs North Yorkshire will be entering into an agreement with North Yorkshire Emergency Doctors, an established provider of general practitioner home visiting services for out-of-hours services, later this year.

<p>15. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Amess: </b>

<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Primary Care Trusts are responsible for commissioning out-of-hours services which are delivered to nationally set quality requirements. Strategic Health Authorities are responsible for performance managing Primary Care Trusts in the delivery of these services.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to reduce waiting and delivery times for diagnostic equipment.  [188519]</p>









<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national health service is committed to reducing the length of time that people wait before their treatment starts. By 2008 patients will wait no longer than 18 weeks from general practitioner referral to the start of treatment and this includes access to diagnostics.

<p>21. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Reed: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the guidance he issues to Primary Care Trusts on the funding of children&#039;s hospices.  [188521]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Standards for the provision of services for children with life limiting or life threatening illnesses who need palliative care will be issued shortly under the National Service Framework for children and maternity services.

<p>22. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn7"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent assessment he has made of the demand on accident and emergency services.  [188522]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 A&E attendance numbers are collected and published quarterly. The latest figures were made available on 27 August. There were a total of 4,502,578 new and follow up attendances at major A&Es, minor injury units and walk-in centres between April and June 2004.


</p>







<p><a name="40914w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact of the changes introduced by the new general medical services contract on accident and emergency admissions in the out-of-hours period.  [186512]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 No information has been put forward to date to the Department suggesting the established pattern of when patients arrive at accident and emergency during each day has generally altered following the changes to the general medical services contract. We are, however, monitoring any possible impact of the changes to the contract on A&E closely and will continue to do so.

<a name="40914w01.html_sbhd8"><h3 align=center>NHS Administrative Staff</h3>





<p>23. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn9"><b> Sir Teddy Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of staff in the national health service is engaged in administration; and what the percentage was 10 years ago.  [188523]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Current non-medical workforce figures are not directly comparable with pre-1995 figures. As at September 2003, 19 per cent. of the total NHS workforce were managers and clerical and administrative staff compared with 17 per cent. in 1995. Many administrative and clerical staff work directly to health professionals freeing them up to do their job, such as health care support workers and medical secretaries.
</p>






<a name="40914w01.html_sbhd9"><h3 align=center>Health and Social Care Act</h3>





<p>24. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn10"><b> Dr. Evan Harris: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice he has issued to the NHS about public consultations under sections 7 and 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 in respect of election periods.  [188524]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew10"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Sections 7 and 11 guidance does not refer specifically to public consultations during election periods. The guidance supporting section 7 makes it clear that the NHS organisation consulting overview and scrutiny committees should agree with them how long the consultation period should last.
</p>






<a name="40914w01.html_sbhd10"><h3 align=center>Pharmacists</h3>





<p>25. <a name="40914w01.html_wqn11"><b> Dr. Starkey: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the role of pharmacists in preventive health programmes.  [188525]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew11"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Pharmacists already contribute to health improvement, including through stopping smoking services, emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) and needle exchange schemes. We will significantly expand this role through the proposed new contractual framework for community pharmacy, underpinned by a pharmaceutical public health strategy due in 2005.
</p>






<a name="40914w01.html_sbhd11"><h3 align=center>Age-related Macular Degeneration</h3>





<p><a name="40914w01.html_wqn12"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received on making magnifying equipment more easily available to people who are registered visually impaired with age related macular degeneration; and if he will make a statement.  [189038]</p>








<p><a name="40914w01.html_spnew12"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 We have received representation from hon. and right hon. Members and the Royal National Institute of the Blind regarding the provision of closed circuit television (CCTV) readers to help visually impaired people with certain tasks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w01.html_para1">
The provision of CCTVs and other non-optical aids is a decision that lies with social services departments as they are considered to be aids to daily living. Being registered as visually impaired is not a pre-requisite to receiving services. Social services departments are responsible for assessing an individual&#039;s needs and for arranging services to meet those needs; this could include the provision of CCTV. However, hand-held, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Sept 2004 : Column 1496W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
stand and spectacle-mounted magnifiers are easier to use, more widely available, more accessible and more cost effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w01.html_para2">
Encouragement is being given to hospital and social service departments to work more closely together, and perhaps operate a joint budget to allow more flexibility in funding equipment, and provide a wider range of services and equipment than has hitherto been available. The overall level of funding for aids to vision will, however, rest with primary care trusts and local councils.

 The supply of samples by pharmaceutical companies is regulated under the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994.

 Non-clinical staff perform vital functions within the national health service and make an important contribution to the delivery of healthcare and will continue to do so as the clinical NHS workforce increases.

<p><a name="40914w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Government want to see consumers benefit from a wide choice and innovation in the financial services market. The Finance Act 2003 introduced two reliefs (s72 and s73) for purchases funded by &quot;alternative property financing&quot;, which enables individuals to finance a property without paying interest. The combined effect of these reliefs is to place the amount of stamp duty land tax due when purchasing property using these arrangements on a level footing with the amount due on the purchase of property when using &#039;conventional&#039; mortgage products. This will remove a significant barrier to the development of alternative property financing, thus benefiting a range of consumers with increased choice in the mortgage market.
</p>


<p>

The legislation does not discriminate between freehold and leasehold properties, so both can be purchased using alternative property financing without a greater quantity of stamp duty being incurred than under a conventional mortgage.

<p><a name="40914w08.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 DFID spent &#163;4,311 in its London offices on replacement light bulbs during 2003&#150;04. No information is available for our East Kilbride offices, as it is currently being refurbished and the lighting system is therefore being replaced. Information on expenditure on light bulbs in our overseas offices is not centrally available and could not be obtained without incurring a disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w08.html_para0">
DFID is committed to implementing the standards set out in the Government&#039;s Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. The recent refurbishments of our UK offices have given us the opportunity to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings, for instance with installation of Building Management Systems which allow us to monitor and manage energy usage to a much greater extent than in the past.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w08.html_para1">
The design for the refurbishment of our East Kilbride office has received an &quot;excellent&quot; rating under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM); for instance, DFID has installed energy efficient heating systems, and also lighting systems which are movement sensitive and take account of natural lighting levels. Through our green awareness programme DFID is encouraging overseas offices to consider the implementation of similar energy efficiency measures wherever appropriate.

<p><a name="40914w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 In 1998, DFID commissioned Opinion Leader Research (OLR) to undertake baseline focus group research among the UK public. In 2003, DFID commissioned OLR to undertake further focus group research to explore ways of increasing understanding and support for international development in the UK. DFID also commissions two annual opinion polls on public attitudes to development. One poll, undertaken by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), monitors the opinion of the UK adult population, and the second, undertaken by Market and Opinion Research International (MORI), monitors the opinion of schoolchildren. In 1999, we also undertook a readership survey of &quot;Developments&quot; magazine, in order to test its impact and reach. The results of the focus group research and the opinion polls are used to inform, and monitor the impact of, our work on development awareness and education.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of global infant mortality he estimates results from unsafe water and sanitation; and how this is taken into account in the design of the programmes funded by his Department in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goal to reduce the under-five mortality rate.  [188053]</p>








<p><a name="40914w08.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 UN data on infant mortality are not routinely disaggregated by cause of death. It is estimated, however, that diarrhoea causes more than 1.5 million child deaths each year, constituting about 15 per cent. of under-five deaths. Childhood diarrhoea is closely associated with insufficient water, inadequate sanitation, contaminated water and poor hygiene practices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w08.html_para4">
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are strongly inter-dependent and DFID programme interventions include strict controls over appraisal and design to reflect this. DFID&#039;s Water Action Plan, published in March 2004, sets out DFID&#039;s priorities for the integrated provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion at national, regional and international levels. Significant progress to reduce childhood deaths from diarrhoea requires increased coverage of both preventative interventions and curative, such as the provision of effective health care (including oral re-hydration therapy and drug treatments).

 Under the United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 (8 June 2004) resources in the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) are managed and disbursed solely at the discretion of the Interim Iraqi Government. The International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) continues its work as an audit oversight body for the DFI. The IAMB oversees audits conducted by international accounting firms of (i) oil export sales, (ii) the accounting for the proceeds from oil export sales, (iii) the DFI financial statements, and (iv) the disbursement procedures for DFI resources.

 Estimates suggest that immediately after the 2003 conflict, 60 per cent. of urban and 30 per cent. of rural populations had access to safe water. In October 2003, the United Nations and World Bank&#039;s Needs Assessment of Iraq proposed a 2007 target of increasing water access in urban areas by 30 per cent., and in rural areas by 45 per cent., from immediate post-conflict levels. Considerable work has taken place since May 2003 to improve the quantity, quality and reliability of water supplies.

In Basra the water supply situation remains difficult but is now better than before the 2003 conflict.

Major infrastructure work which is mainly US funded is planned over the next year. United Nations agencies are providing up to 800,000 litres of drinking water per day to vulnerable groups and inhabitants of rural areas. Drinking water is also sold by bottle or tanker.

Significant programmes of long-term rehabilitation of electrical infrastructure are being undertaken alongside planning for the expansion of generating capacity with new plants.

Section 5 of the 1960 Act provides local authorities with the power to regulate fire precautions on park home sites, by enabling the local authority to impose conditions on the site licences issued to site owners. The Act enables the First Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister to issue model standards. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has exercised this power most recently in 1989, in Circular 14/89: &quot;Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960&#151;Model Standards&quot;. The model standards represent the standards that are normally expected as a matter of good practice on sites for residential mobile homes or static holiday caravans, or both. The local authority must have regard to the model standards in issuing or reviewing the conditions of a site licence. In addition, the Act provides that a local authority is required to consult with the fire authority for the park as to the extent to which the model standards relating to the fire precautions are appropriate to the land. Ultimately, it is up to the local authority on what conditions they apply to site licences. As part of the on-going park home reform, the model standards are currently being revised and an informal consultation is

<p><a name="40914w13.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The main form of support for all renewable technologies is the Renewables Obligation (RO) which provides a stable and long term market for renewable electricity. Electricity generation from both wave and tidal stream technologies is eligible for the RO.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w13.html_para6">
However, these technologies are still at the developmental stage. Therefore the principal form of support to date has been through the DTI&#039;s Technology Programme that since 1997 has committed around &#163;15 million towards the development of these technologies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w13.html_para7">
On 2 August the Government announced a further &#163;50 million funding primarily focused on supporting the UK&#039;s marine renewables industry through the next phase of development of these technologies, which includes small scale demonstration and pre-commercial stages.

<p><a name="40914w13.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 A study has been commissioned to provide a spatial quantification of renewable sources of energy&#151;wave, tidal and offshore wind across the waters of the UK continental shelf. In addition to the spatial variation of these resources, temporal variations will also be assessed. This study (ATLAS) will assist in deciding which areas of the sea will next be subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w13.html_para9">
The first stage of the study which has just been completed provides information on the energy levels with a resolution of about 12 km. The second stage will involve the conversion of the raw energy potential into the amount of energy presently available. It will also allow higher resolution in specific areas such as through main channels. The study is expected in the autumn and we intend to publish it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w13.html_para10">
Additionally, there have been two previous studies1,2 which examined the potential tidal stream power resource in the UK. The later of those studies completed in 1996 under the EC JOULE-II energy research programme identified a total of 42 potential sites in UK waters with a combined annual output totalling some 31 TWh/yr which represents 8 per cent. of UK annual electricity demand in 2003.

<p><a name="40914w14.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Ben Chapman: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimates have been made of the costs of steel production in the construction of wind farms.  [186600]</p>








<p><a name="40914w14.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 A typical 2 MW wind turbine weighs around 260 tonnes and approximately 95 per cent. of that by weight is steel. Installed costs of onshore wind turbines are around &#163;700,000 per MW, of which the turbines can account for around 75 per cent., although this will depend on factors such as the cost of the foundations and grid connection etc. One a per tonne basis, steel costs even at current market prices would account for less than 10 per cent. of the cost of the turbine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w14.html_para0">
However, the cost of the steel itself is not necessarily the driving cost fact in all components of the turbine. For example, the tower section of the turbine is a relatively simple structure and in this case the amount of steel used will be the primary cost factor. However, other sections such as the nacelle, which contain complex components such as the turbine generator etc, might account for 25&#150;40 per cent. of weight and 25 per cent. of the cost of the turbine. Although steel is still the primary component by weight, other raw materials and the processes involved in making these complex components account for a more significant proportion to total costs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether the 50 MW threshold, above which she determines planning applications for wind farms, is based on the wind farm&#039;s theoretical maximum output, or its actual projected output.  [187039]</p>








<p><a name="40914w14.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 When looking at the capacity of a power station for the purposes of applications made under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, it is the rated capacity which counts. That is the capacity which can be generated by the station and fed through the alternators without causing damage to the alternators.


</p>







<p><a name="40914w14.html_wqn2"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what constitutes a single wind farm for the purposes of planning applications; and whether there is a maximum distance between two clusters of turbines, beyond which they would be regarded as two wind farms.  [187040]</p>








<p><a name="40914w14.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The Department is of the view that a wind farm could be considered as one where it used the same common services such as transmission cables, electricity sub-station and control room. If separate services were to be used then it would be two stand alone proposals and fall to be determined as two separate applications. While there is no maximum distance between each turbine the Department would expect the turbines to be spaced in such a manner that the distance between each turbine is the optimum for generation and satisfying environmental concerns.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimates have been made of levels of carbon dioxide production as a result of building wind farms.  [187570]</p>








<p><a name="40914w14.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 A number of studies have estimated the overall environmental cost of building wind power generation based on energy payback or life cycle analysis. These calculations project the energy output as a ratio of energy required to build, maintain and decommission the power station.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w14.html_para1">
The average wind farm in the UK will pay back the energy used in its manufacture within three to five months, and over its lifetime a wind turbine will produce over 30 times more energy than was used in building, maintenance and decommissioning according to a study commissioned by the British Wind Energy Association.

The issue of entry and exit to Israel is a matter for the Israeli authorities. However, our ambassador in Tel Aviv has recently written to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs to raise our concerns over the treatment of British journalists and representatives of British media organisations.

 TOGETHER is a campaign for both practitioners and the public across all of England and Wales. The approach includes prioritising local concerns about antisocial behaviour, getting the right people from local agencies working with the community

to tackle the problem and making effective use of available sanctions and providing feedback to the community on progress at all stages.

<p>
<a name="40914w18.html_para1">
On the practitioner side, the campaign is an ambitious programme that is designed to provide help, resources and know-how to every practitioner across the country. It has three core aims; to make the use and application of tools and powers simple and effective, to take the best of what is developed locally and spread it nationally, and to create a change in culture so that action is taken. The TOGETHER Academy, ActionLine and Website&#151;backed up by practical step-by step guides and antisocial behaviour ambassadors remove excuses for inaction and raise the level of practice across England and Wales.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made, using the Home Office Trends in Crime model, of the impact on crime rates of <i>(a)</i> economic and <i>(b)</i> demographic changes in each year since 1995.  [187234]</p>








<p><a name="40914w18.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Home Office Trends in Crime model is an empirical model which attempts to explain annual changes in recorded crime in England and Wales by reference to annual changes in a number of economic, demographic, and criminal justice variables. It has been developed by joint external and internal research effort with the purpose of providing the Home Office with a tool for identifying those determinants of crime that are both within and outside of its control.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w18.html_para3">
The model is robust, but highly aggregated. As such it cannot account for all the factors that impact on crime rates. It has nonetheless demonstrated that economic and demographic factors have been important determinants of changes in crime over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40914w18.html_para4">
The model has not been used to attribute annual changes in crime to each of the explanatory variables. However, the model predicts that, if other factors remain constant, a permanent 1 per cent. increase in the growth rate of consumption expenditure reduces the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Sept 2004 : Column 1555W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
growth rate of crime by about 1.7 per cent. On a similar basis, an increase of 1 per cent. in the growth rate of the proportion of young males in the population would increase the growth rate of crime by about 0.5 per cent.

The streamlining Department&#039;s headquarters resulting in a reduction of staff numbers by 30 per cent. to focus resources on the front-line will mean further format comparisons will be as difficult. There will also be similar reductions in the headquarters of Prison Service and Immigration and Nationality Directorate (reducing in total headquarter staff numbers by 2,700 full-time equivalents).

Notes:<br>

1.The Department for Work and Pensions centralised work for Milton Keynes at Aylesbury from 1 July 2003. Medical Services are therefore unable to give specific figures relating to applicants of Milton Keynes in 2004 as all work is referred to Medical Services from Aylesbury.<br>

2. The other category includes where a customer has had a Domiciliary visit or visited another Medical Examination Centre apart from Luton, Aylesbury or Milton Keynes.<br>

3. The &quot;other&quot; category for Aylesbury district office cases in 2003 and 2004 is high as it contains 1447 (2003) and 954 (2004) customers who attended Oxford Medical Examination Centre. These customers attended Oxford as they live in Oxford but the referrals show as Aylesbury due to centralisation; the Department for Work and Pensions centralised work for Oxford at Aylesbury in 2003.<br>

 We have no plans to remove the financial eligibility for legal aid from children and place it on their parents.

The revised guidance was implemented from April 2003. The Legal Services Commission has issued a consultation paper, &quot;A New Focus for Civil Legal Aid&#151;encouraging early resolution; discouraging unnecessary litigation&quot; which contains proposals on the use of conditional fee agreements generally, and the appropriate balance between private and public funding.

An additional &#163;4,000 Golden Hello is also available to those who train in and go on to teach priority subjects in a maintained secondary school. From September 2005, the value of the training bursary for those training in mathematics and science will increase to &#163;7,000 and the Golden Hello payment for those subjects will rise to &#163;5,000 for trainees entering Postgraduate Certificate in Education and equivalent courses at that time. These incentives have helped to increase recruitment to courses of initial teacher training for secondary school teachers by almost one-third between 1999&#150;2000 and 2003&#150;04.
