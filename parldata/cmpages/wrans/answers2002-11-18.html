<a name="21118w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which organisations are responsible for monitoring air quality.  [80503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 In England, legal responsibility for monitoring ambient air quality lies with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In addition the Environment Agency is responsible for ambient air quality monitoring arrangements in relation to regulated industrial processes in England and Wales. Local authorities are responsible for reviewing and assessing ambient air quality in their areas. This usually includes some monitoring of key pollutants. Defra manages the United Kingdom ambient air quality monitoring network on behalf of the Government and the devolved administrations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what air quality targets have been set by her Department over the last five years;  [80507]
<P>
<UL>(2) what procedure is followed to review air quality targets;  [80515]
<P>
(3) what plans she has to implement higher air quality targets.  [80502]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government set out their targets for safeguarding people's health and protecting the environment from air pollution in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which was first published in 1997 and revised in January 2000. The strategy includes health-based standards for benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide, lead, particles, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and low level ozone. It also includes policy objectives for each pollutant to be achieved between 2003 and 2008. On 5 August 2002 we announced tighter objectives for particles, benzene and carbon monoxide and introduced a new objective for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
<P>

<a name="21118w01.html_para0">Section 20 of the Environment Act 1995 requires the Secretary of State to keep the Air Quality Strategy and its standards, objectives and measures under regular review. The Secretary of State is required to consult with a wide range of interests and organisations on any proposals to modify the strategy. We carried out a comprehensive review of the overall strategy and its objectives between 1997 and 1999. A further review began in 2000, concentrating on strengthening three of the current objectives and adding an objective for a new 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2002 : Column 6W</I><P>
pollutant. We intend that the next review, which is likely to begin during 2003, should focus more on progress towards meeting the objectives, rather than on objectives themselves. Should new evidence emerge, however, which indicates that existing air quality targets should be amended, or new ones introduced, this will be taken into account in future reviews.

<a name="21118w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The total number of Countryside Stewardship scheme agreement holders within England as at October 2001 was 14,225. This is broken down by Government Office region as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when her Department will make an announcement on whether the new rights of access under Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 will be implemented on a regional basis; and if she will make a statement.  [80808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I am strongly in favour of implementing the new rights of access to open country on a region by region basis but additional costs and organisational issues have to be addressed. Work is currently being undertaken to make sure that early commencement is a practical proposition. Our aim is to make this historic new right a reality as soon as is practicable and I shall announce a decision shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many farm businesses were in receipt of slaughter premium during each of the last three years.  [80141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w01.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Information is available only on the number of producers who received slaughter premium scheme payments. These details are set out in the table. Because the scheme in Great Britain was administered by different Government Departments in relation to the over and under thirty-month elements of the scheme, there is an element of double counting. Full details are given in the footnotes.

<i>Notes:<P>

England and Wales<P>

</i>During the 2000 scheme year, the Slaughter Premium Scheme for England and Wales was administered as two separate schemes. The UTM element for England was administered by the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), and the OTM and UTM element was administered by the then Intervention Board. In 2001, these elements were combined for producers in England and Wales.<P>

<i>Scotland<P>

</i>During the 2000 and 2001 scheme years, the OTM element of the scheme was administered by the Intervention Board, and latterly, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) administered the UTM element. In 2002, SEERAD took over the full responsibility for both elements and combined them to run as one adult scheme.<P>

<i>Northern Ireland<P>

</i>Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) have administered the adult scheme as one element since the 2000 scheme year.<P>

 The Licensing Bill will introduce flexible opening hours&#151;with the potential for up to 24 hour opening seven days a week, although we expect most premises to extend their opening hours to a more modest extent. This will discourage the culture of binge-drinking before last orders, stimulate a more mature attitude towards alcohol consumption, and help reduce public disorder resulting from artificially early fixed closing times.

Our willingness to put more resources into universal primary education is demonstrated by our new PSA target (20 million more children in schools in 20 countries by 2006), and by plans for support to education. This forecast support for basic education amounts to #1.3 billion over the next five years, either through education sector support or direct budget support. Of this, about #500 million will go to Africa and #800 million to Asia. The figure of #1.3 billion forecast for the next five years exceeds the #700 million committed to UPE since 1997.

 We are working to improve the fast track initiative so that it is embedded in country-led processes. We will provide support within our overall programme of support for Education for All. This means that there must be respect for local priorities and integration into poverty reduction strategy and medium-term economic framework processes. There must also be a recognition that money is only one ingredient in achieving progress and, that in many cases, significant absorptive capacity problems must be addressed before additional funds can be used effectively. There also needs to be much more emphasis on the five high population countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and DRC) where so many of the out-of-school children are. A substantial proportion of the #1.3 billion, which we are forecasting to spend on basic education over the next five years, will be committed in fast track countries, particularly these five.

 Civil Service pensions have been paid through the private sector since the former Paymaster Agency was privatised in April 1997. The contract with Paymaster (1836) Ltd. expired on 30 September 2002 and, following a competitive procurement process, a new contract was awarded to Capita Hartshead.

 Clergy in office receive a stipend and are housed.

The basis for determining the benefits provided by the latter&#151;a lump sum at retirement plus a pension&#151;was designed to take into account all of these factors. The full service pension is currently #10,693 per annum and the retirement lump sum is #32,079.

 Information about the period 1972 to 1990 is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. The current arrangements for an emergency stockpile of vehicles were started in 1991 when the vehicles were concentrated at Marchington. At that time there were 1037 useable vehicles for England and Wales. An additional 116 vehicles were added in 1994 from Scotland. There are currently 1027 vehicles including the 116 for Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21118w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that the experience of homelessness can place families under emotional strain, particularly when they are placed in bed and breakfast hotels. This is why we are investing #125 million this year to tackle homelessness more effectively. This includes helping local authorities develop new approaches that tackle the problems that are making and keeping them homeless.
<P>

<a name="21118w06.html_para6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also commissioned research which will explore the range and type of support needs of homeless families and approaches to meeting these support needs. We are expecting to publish the research in late summer 2003.

<a name="21118w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Homelessness Act places new duties on local authorities and, together with the Priority Need Order, extends the priority groups whom local authorities have a statutory duty to help. Affordable housing is an important part in tackling homelessness that is why we have doubled the resources available for housing since 1997 and will be increasing investment by a further 1.4 billion over the next three years. However, as we made clear in 'More than a roof', the provision of affordable housing will not solve homelessness on its own.
<P>

<a name="21118w06.html_para7">Investment of 125 million this year, together with changes to Housing Benefit subsidies, is helping local authorities to meet this commitment. It will also support new approaches that help people tackle the problems that are making and keeping

 We will announce the new system for distributing formula grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government has allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.

 The incorporation of the neighbourhood and street wardens into a new Neighbourhood Renewal funding stream is already under way. There will be no cost to the office of the Deputy Prime Minister or other Government departments.

<a name="21118w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B>

education authority, taking account of the increases from SR2002, and the new local authority funding system, will be announced by early December. Those allocations will set a trend for local education authorities for the next three years, and we will work with local education authorities to encourage them to deliver three-year budgets for their schools. These will be firm budgets for 2003&#150;04, but will be indicative for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 because of the impact of changes in pupil numbers and other data.

[81087]<P>

 Local education authorities (LEAs) are responsible for paying School Standards Grant (SSG) to individual schools on the basis of a central grant received from the Department. The format of LEAs' financial returns would mean that providing the required information would incur disproportionate cost.

 The Government's proposals on developing the role of support staff, which were published for consultation in October, include proposals which would for the first time provide a regulatory framework to underpin the involvement of support staff in the teaching and learning process. These are based on the key principles that qualified teachers must have overall responsibility for effective teaching and learning, and that there must always be a clear system of leadership and supervision by a qualified teacher to ensure high standards of teaching and learning. Provided those conditions are met, it is proposed that determining what should be delegated should be primarily a matter for the professional judgment of headteachers and qualified teachers rather than for rigid national demarcation. The draft Education (Teaching Work and Registration) 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2002 : Column 32W</I><P>
(England) Regulations 2002 do not include proposed limits on the hours or subjects that a pupil should be either taught or supervised by a teaching assistant. The draft regulations provide that teaching assistants may only undertake a list of Xspecified teaching work" under a system of supervision determined by a qualified teacher using his or her professional judgment. Qualified teachers will remain responsible and accountable for the quality of teaching and learning in their classrooms.

 Provisional figures published today by the Teacher Training Agency show that 31,261 people have been recruited to courses of initial teacher training in England in 2002&#150;03, 2,067 more than in 2001&#150;02. This third successive annual rise in recruitment vindicates the Government's decision, announced last December, to make 1,900 more training places available this year than in 2001&#150;02.

<a name="21118w08.html_para0">The table shows numbers of trainees recruited as a percentage of the total number of training places available by phase and subject. Figures do not include the 1,904 new entrants to the Graduate Teacher Programme so far this year, of whom 935 are training in the priority subjects of mathematics, science, modern languages, technology and English.

 The Electoral Commission is actively engaged in work to raise public awareness of the availability of postal voting.

<a name="21118w08.html_para2">A key element of this programme is dedicated activity to promote postal voting across Great Britain in the spring of each year in which there are public elections. In support of this, the Commission will be producing new leaflets about postal voting by December this year, which will be distributed to Electoral Registration Officers and displayed in post offices across Great Britain prior to the elections planned for next spring.

<a name="21118w08.html_para3">Information about postal voting is also available from the Commission's website and the Commission published good practice advice to local authorities on local promotion of postal voting and other issues in its October 2002 report XMaking an impact".
