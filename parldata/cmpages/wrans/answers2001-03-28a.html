To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn) of 28 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 665W, if the British seafarers referred to by the Chief of Defence Procurement are required to be sponsored reserves;  [155391]
<P>
<UL>(2) how much his Department intends to charge AWSR Shipping Ltd. for managing the subcontract with Harland and Wolff for two ro-ro ferries; and what safeguards his Department has put in place to ensure that when on his Department's business all six ro-ro ferries are manned by British seamen.

<P>
<a name="10328w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 AWSR Shipping Ltd. will manage the shipbuilding contract with Harland and Wolff on the MOD's behalf until the ships are delivered to the company. Negotiations continue with AWSR for the PFI service contract, which we expect to be signed within the next few months. The terms will reflect the cost of the shipbuilding contract management service to the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="10328w01.html_para0">AWSR Shipping Ltd. have bid, and will be required under contract, to provide British seafarers eligible to be called out as sponsored reserves to crew all six ships when on Ministry of Defence business.

<a name="10328w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We will not take a final decision on the membership of the Veterans Forum and the Veterans Task Force until their shape, role and agenda have been discussed in more detail with the range of interested parties, including the main veterans' representative groups. However, we currently expect the Task Force, under my own Chairmanship to include Ministers from the Department of Health, the Department of Social Security, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the Department for Employment and Education, as well as the relevant Scottish and Welsh Departments, the Northern Ireland Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department. I will also chair the Veterans Forum which will include members from the major veterans' representative groups. We will ensure that the smaller representative groups are able to present their views and concerns to the Forum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> new money and <i>(b)</i> new manpower his Department has allocated to the handling of veterans affairs.  [155320]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Veterans initiative will be supported by three new executive staff, together with the budget and support staff required for their effective working. We cannot at this stage predict what new measures might come out of the work of the Veterans Task Force and Forum. We will be commissioning early research into veterans issues and their handling, in addition to that already planned within current departmental programmes. The funding of new measures will be addressed as they are identified.

<a name="10328w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Key: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The appointment of a designated Veterans Minister, with responsibility across Government Departments for ensuring that veterans' concerns are understood and addressed in a holistic manner, represents a clear enhancement rather than a reduction in commitment. This change, together with the establishment of a dedicated Ministerial Task Force, reflects the Government's determination that veterans' issues should be handled in a co-ordinated way to ensure a properly integrated approach to veterans and their concerns.

 A project team has been established to take this proposal forward. At this early stage, no criteria have yet been established to determine who would or would not be included on the memorial. This will be carried out by a scoping study in consultation with ex-service organisations and other interested bodies. Further information will become available in due course.

<P>
<a name="10328w02.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Department for International Development is currently supporting more than 40 projects and programmes around the world with a focus on the rights and needs of people with disabilities. In the past year we have approved nearly &#163;40 million of new funding for work in this area. The global drive to reduce poverty will also bring many benefits, in reducing some of the key causes of disability and improving the quality of life and opportunities for people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="10328w02.html_para2">DFID's strategy on disability is set out in an issues paper published last year, called "Disability, poverty and development". We work closely with Governments, the voluntary and private sectors, and the bilateral and multilateral donor communities, to ensure that disability is addressed in the context of the fight against poverty and the realisation of human rights for all.

 The UK provides bilateral development assistance to the Palestinian Authority and, more broadly, assists Palestinians through our contributions to the EC and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Our programme with the Palestinian Authority supports sustainable economic and social development that benefits the poor. We do this by seeking to support the Middle East Peace Process and improve Palestinian health care, education, access to water and sanitation, gender equality, integration into the global economy and the effectiveness and accountability of the Palestinian Authority. We provide technical assistance rather than direct funding to the Palestinian Authority.

 TV Licensing administer the free licence scheme as agent for the BBC. They collect the information necessary to check the entitlement of applicants to the concession; to manage the concession within the general television licensing system; to satisfy the Department of Social Security and the National Audit Office that the sums claimed by the BBC represent free licences and refunds properly issued and legitimate administrative expenses; and to demonstrate the efficiency and value for money of the administrative arrangements.
<P>

<a name="10328w03.html_para0">Applicants for the free over-75 licence are requested to provide their name, address, date of birth and national insurance number. The first two pieces of information are required to run the television licensing database; the third and fourth are used to check entitlement to the concession by comparison with the information provided for that purpose by the Department of Social Security.

<a name="10328w03.html_spnew3"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 We are committed to widening access to tourism opportunities for all, including disabled people. We are encouraging the hotel sector to recognise the importance of meeting the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 not only because it is a legal requirement but also because it makes sound business sense. For example last year my Department organised a Disability Conference, "Towards 2004", where we engaged with our sectors, including tourism, concentrating on the requirements and implications of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. In additional, the English Tourism Council have recently published "Accessible Britain 2000-01" which is an official guide for disabled people to Quality Assured National Accessible Scheme accommodation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w03.html_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 We do not have this information. However, all businesses which provide a service to the public, including hotels, have a duty placed on them under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Since 1 October 1999 service providers have had to make "reasonable adjustments" for disabled people in the way they provide their services. From 2004 they will also have to make "reasonable adjustments" to the physical feature of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Borrow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what impact the construction of the Ribble Link between the Lancaster Canal and the River Ribble will have on radiation levels in the Ribble estuary.  [155230]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Plans for the construction of the Ribble Link have included environmental assessments of the potential impact on radioactivity levels in the estuary and associated areas. These assessments indicate that the impact on the river and the estuary will be very low. The estimated increases in the levels of radioactivity are 3 per cent. and 0.2 per cent. respectively. The assessments also indicate that the radiation dose impact of the work to members of the public will be insignificant. The dose to those most likely to be affected--Ribble netsmen and consumers of local fish--is calculated to be less than 2 microSieverts a year. This is 2 per cent. of the relevant public dose limit from man-made sources of 1,000 microSieverts. (The average dose from background radiation is 2,200 microSieverts a year.) The estimated dose levels are below the levels of regulatory concern set in the relevant legislation.
<P>

<a name="10328w04.html_para4">The Environment Agency will continue to undertake its own independent environmental radioactivity monitoring programme of the River Ribble and the estuary area and will publish the results in its annual report.

<P>
<a name="10328w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is not possible to produce an accurate estimate of the cost of renationalising the rail network and train companies. However, Railtrack's market capitalisation, based on its current share price, is some &#163;4 billion. The cost of renationalising Railtrack would be significantly more than that because, for example, all Railtrack's spending would be a charge to public expenditure.

<P>
<a name="10328w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2001]:</i> Decisions on the level of charges for hire boat licences are an operational matter for British Waterways. They recognise that canal closures have presented difficulties for waterway businesses and have agreed to defer the date for payments of hire boat licences from 1 April 2001 to 1 June 2001. This arrangement applies to both those who pay by instalments and those who pay in a single payment.

 The Government are committed to tripling the number of cycling trips from a 2000 base by 2010 and quadrupling them from a 1996 base by 2012. &#163;8.4 billion of Government funding has been provided to local authorities in the recent local transport settlement. This will help to promote sustainable transport measures, including cycling. The cycling strategies included in the authorities' local transport plans should identify gaps in the local cycle network and result in improvements to the cycling infrastructure. Initial monitoring suggests that the strategies will result in considerable additional provision for cycling.
<P>

<a name="10328w04.html_para8">We are also actively marketing the main message of the National Cycling Strategy. Early outcomes are the launch of an NCS website and production of a promotional video.

<a name="10328w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In 1994, the Watt Committee on Energy estimated that the net flow of methane from abandoned coal mines was likely to be negligible. Recognising the great uncertainties involved, and the extent of mine closures, my Department has sponsored a study of information currently available with a view to including this source in the UK greenhouse gas inventory. This indicates that emissions from abandoned coal mines constitute a declining source and could currently be in the range 20,000 to 300,000 tonnes of methane per year, or between 0.05 per cent. and 0.8 per cent. of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. We do not have separate estimates fro England and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with the construction industry on adapting for climatic change.  [155616]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had no specific discussions with the construction industry on the subject of climate change. However my Department is in regular contact with the construction industry on a wide range of environmental issues, including those specifically related to climate change. Since I launched our strategy for more sustainable construction: "Building a Better Quality of Life" a year ago, my colleagues and I have been encouraging the industry and its clients to address the issues set out in that strategy, including the reduction of greenhouse gases, by eliminating wasteful and polluting practices which contribute to climate change.
<P>

<a name="10328w05.html_para0">My Department supports research aimed at raising awareness within the construction industry on the implications of climate change. We have recently commissioned a study jointly with the Scottish Executive, the Environment Agency and others to prepare guidance on the flood proofing of buildings and to look at what further research needs to be done in this area. We support the UK Climate Impacts Programme at the University of Oxford to help organisations assess their vulnerability to climate change. We have also invited the Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel to consider what research the construction industry needs on climate change.
<P>

<a name="10328w05.html_para1">I commend the recent report from the Foundation for the Built Environment on "Potential Implications of Climate Change on the Built Environment" which sets out ways in which the construction industry can adapt to meet these challenges.

<a name="10328w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Although precise data are not available, we estimate that around 1,500 units of supported accommodation will be needed to meet the Government target that by 2003 all teenage lone parents under 18 who cannot live with their family or partner should be placed in supervised semi-independent housing with support rather than in an independent tenancy.
<P>

<a name="10328w06.html_para0">An audit of existing provision of supported accommodation for housing teenage parents undertaken by local authorities as part of the 2000 Housing Investment Programme identified between 4,000 and 5,000 units of accommodation as available for lone parents with onsite or floating support, of which around two thirds (2,749 units) was available for teenage parents under 18 years of age. However, it is doubtful whether all of this accommodation is located in line with need or is of sufficient quality to meet the support requirements of teenage parents.
<P>

<a name="10328w06.html_para1">Local authorities are responsible for assessing the need for additional accommodation for teenage parents within their areas. Currently 128 new units of accommodation for teenage parents are being funded through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP). Next year's Approved Development Programme includes 205 new units of accommodation. In addition under the new Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund, &#163;4 million has been allocated to provide 134 new units of accommodation for teenage parents and bids have been received to provide floating support for nearly 200 units of accommodation. The Housing Corporation will be announcing shortly the number of floating support bids, which it will be approving for funding in 2001-02.

 The Government's Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the National Waste Strategy is set out in "Waste Strategy 2000" (Cm 4693-2, Annexe C). The RIA models differing assumptions about the growth in waste arisings and the development of different waste treatments over this period and suggests additional costs ranging from &#163;3.4 to &#163;7.7 billion (present value of costs from 2000 to 2020).

 The regional planning bodies brought forward proposals for 30 schemes which could be separately progressed from the Multi Modal Studies (which are currently looking at solutions to problems within main trunk road corridors). These schemes have been assessed using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) and I have arranged for copies of the appraisal summary tables to be placed in the Library. We have also sought the views of the Government's statutory advisers (English Nature, the Countryside Agency, English Heritage and the Environment Agency) on the proposed schemes. Having considered the NATA appraisals and comments from the statutory advisers we have decided to add the following schemes to the targeted programme of improvements:

<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para0"><i>Leeds Supertram</i>
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para1">Following completion of our appraisal of the proposed Leeds Supertram system of three light rail lines, we are satisfied that the project passes the test for Government funding to be made available and that it should be taken forward as a single scheme. We have also agreed a funding package with the promoters which includes a local contribution towards scheme costs.
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para2">Orders have been made under the Transport and Works Act 1992 giving powers for the scheme. However, these cannot come into force until a special parliamentary procedure has been completed, because the orders authorise the compulsory purchase of open space, for which no land is to be given in exchange. Funding approval is given on the assumption that this process is completed satisfactorily.
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para3"><i>South Hampshire Rapid Transit</i>
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para4">Following completion of our appraisal of the South Hampshire Rapid Transit project, we are satisfied that the project passes the tests for Government funding to be made available. Subject to the scheme receiving Transport and Works Act (TWA) powers and no material change to the scheme as submitted, we intend to provide funding and have agreed a package with the promoters which would include a local contribution towards scheme costs.
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para5">This decision is given solely in respect of the economic appraisal of the scheme as submitted to us and the associated funding arrangements. It does not in any way indicate any view that I may take on the TWA application that is currently being considered on its own merits, having regard to the Inspector's report of the inquiry.
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para6"><i>Bristol and South Gloucester Rapid Transit</i>
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para7">In accordance with the policy set out in my Department's Guidance on Local Transport Plans, Bristol City Council and South Gloucestershire Council sought a provisional view on the economic appraisal for the Bristol and South Gloucester Rapid Transit scheme, prior to seeking the necessary powers under the Transport and Works Act (TWA). I am aware that the authorities are continuing to work on some aspects of the proposed scheme. However, I am satisfied that, on the basis of the available information, were the current proposals and their 



<P>
<P><I>28 Mar 2001 : Column: 641W</I><P>
appraisal to be confirmed by the authorities following that further work they would pass our economic appraisal tests for deciding eligibility for funding.
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para8">This provisional view is given solely in respect of the economic appraisal, and does not in any way indicate any view that I may take on any subsequent TWA application. Any such application would be determined entirely on its merits in the light of all the relevant considerations, and only after all interested persons had been given a full opportunity to state their views.
<P>

<a name="10328w07.html_para9">Should TWA powers be obtained, final approval of the project for funding would depend both on whether an updated economic appraisal, reflecting any changes to the scheme as a result of the TWA process or any other developments, demonstrates that the project still represents good value for money and on conclusions of a satisfactory agreement on funding.

<BR>
As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your question asking for a breakdown of the publicity budget for the 2001 Census and other matters related to the publicity of the Census (146679).
<BR>
The breakdown of the paid publicity budget for the period 2000/01 to 2001/02 is:
<BR>
Main advertising campaign: &#163;4,728,000
<BR>
Other publicity activities: &#163;933,000
<BR>
A carefully planned calendar of public relations events has been organised enabling Census Area Managers to run successful local, yet nationally coherent, campaigns.
<BR>
The objectives of the overall publicity campaign are to establish the necessary level of advance awareness of the Census across the population and to build up public confidence in the Census as a socially worthwhile exercise that is undertaken in the strictest confidence. The banner logo 'Count Me In' aims to encourage universal self-inclusion in the Census.
<BR>
The campaign encompasses both paid and free media with the latter being instigated at local level by Census Area Managers working to a centrally co-ordinated PR calendar. Local PR in England has also benefited greatly through a strategic partnership with BBC Local Radio.
<BR>
The full range of ethnic titles will be used to advertise the Census to ethnic minorities as a component within the main campaign designed to address these communities in a sympathetic and appropriate way.
<BR>
The Census form questions and the information leaflet have been translated into 24 commonly used foreign languages--in addition to Welsh in Wales--and will be available from April 1, as will the 



<P>
<P><I>28 Mar 2001 : Column: 646W</I><P>
dedicated Language Helpline which can offer help in 12 languages. In addition, an ethnic version of the promotional video has been produced using an Asian celebrity, which we hope to place in unused air-time on Asian cable TV.
<BR>
Customised press notices associated with all the main PR events will be disseminated to all ethnic minority media outlets. For our Recruitment Blitz the press notice directed at ethnic minority media carried a supporting quote from Civil Service Commissioner Karamjit Singh CBE, and we specifically targeted metropolitan areas at 14 sites around the country where there would be good links with local TV and radio as well as a high concentration of ethnic minority populations. Our partnership with BBC Local Radio has gained us influence over the BBC's Asian Language Network, which has already run a number of Census promotions.
<BR>
These several activities complement the Community Liaison Programmes pursued at local level by Census Area Managers with the overall aim of raising general public awareness about the census, facilitating the enumeration to ensure the fullest possible coverage and helping to provide a source of potential field staff.
<BR>
The Census2001 Count Me In website contains a wealth of material about the Census in general including a number of factsheets as well as covering specific areas such as recruitment.
<BR>
There are two major initiative to make children and teachers aware of the Census:
<BR>
<i>CensusAtSchool</i> is an outline census for schoolchildren asking questions with youth appeal (covering topics such as mobile phone/pet ownership; football team; height of children compared with 1830s). There are on-line classroom activities that will enable the findings to be analysed using statistical techniques. The results from <i>CensusAtSchool</i> attracted major national and regional press coverage when released in February. The national findings are available on the website <i>www.censusatschool.ntu.ac.uk</i> for schools to make comparisons of local and national trends.
<BR>
<i>Census In School</i> is an educational package for teachers containing modules dealing with the use of Census information which is mapped to the National Curriculum. A CD-ROM version is attached to each pack, and these have been distributed to both junior and secondary schools.

<BR>
As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question about the number of people in Scotland who have benefited from the National Minimum Wage (NMW) by employment sector (155777).
<BR>
The Office for National Statistics has published estimates of the number of jobs paid at less than NMW rates for 1998, 1999 and 2000. These estimates are based on an improved methodology using data from the New Earnings Survey (NES) and Labour Force Survey (LFS). This methodology provides the best estimates for the number of jobs in the UK paid below low hourly rate thresholds. Estimates for the United Kingdom and Government Office Regions, including Scotland, are posted on the National Statistics website at: www.statistics.gov.uk/nsbase/ themes/labour market/nmw lowpay tables.asp
<BR>
The new methodology has been developed to overcome the deficiencies inherent in the two surveys, the NFS and LFS, in measuring low pay. Estimates based on this methodology are not available for the number of jobs paid below NMW rates in Scotland broken down by employment sector.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Rebated gas oil, also known as red diesel, is liable for duty at the rate of 3.13 pence per litre and is used in excepted vehicles and as a heating and industrial fuel. Assuming the current level of use, raising the rate of duty on gas oil to the rate applying to Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel would raise additional duty revenues of around &#163;3 billion. In practice the additional revenue would be significantly less than this because a fourteenfold increase in the duty rate would reduce the demand for rebated gas oil.

<a name="10328w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The climate change levy will be revenue neutral overall, and broadly neutral between services and manufacturing. The levy will raise an estimated &#163;1 billion in its first year, all of which will be recycled back to business via a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers' National Insurance Contributions and through support for business energy efficiency. The effect on any specific business sector or area will depend on a number of factors, including their future energy consumption, their levels of employment, eligibility for discounts, use of exempt renewable energy or combined heat and power, and the extent to which they take up energy efficiency advice and the enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments.

<a name="10328w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> The Government are taking a number of steps to promote the development of offshore wind. We believe that this technology will have an important role to play in helping us to meet our renewables targets.
<P>

<a name="10328w11.html_para6">Offshore wind will be eligible for the new Renewables Obligation that the Government are proposing to introduce in October this year. In addition, in view of the early stage of development of offshore wind, the Government are planning to provide capital grants to support its development. Of the &#163;250 million allocated for renewables support over the next three years, at least &#163;49 million has been allocated specifically for offshore wind and further sums may be allocated in the light of the recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit, due to be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="10328w11.html_para7">The grants will be used to fund a number of early demonstration projects for offshore wind. The aim is that these will reduce the costs involved to a more acceptable level, and provide those involved with a bank of knowledge and experience to enable them to pursue more ambitious projects on a commercial basis.
<P>

<a name="10328w11.html_para8">The Government are also determined to provide a more streamlined consents process for offshore wind. The existing arrangements are fragmented and the proposal is for DTI to act as a "one-stop-shop" for planning and consents. I launched a consultation paper of 20 February and views are sought by 23 April.

 Our records show that the Department, since 1 May 1997, has commissioned no statistical surveys from GGC/NOP. However, the following table lists all statistical surveys that the Department has commissioned from NOP and partnerships since 1 May 1997. The table provides the nature of the work commissioned and the date of origin but excludes contractual costs as a matter of commercial confidence between parties under Exemption 13 of the code of Practice on Access to Public Information.

Discussion can now move forwards, away from talking about whether decommissioning will happen to how it will happen. It is vital that all the paramilitary groups on ceasefire engage fully and actively with the Commission so that the issue of illegally held arms can be resolved once and for all, and I look forward to early and positive reports from the Decommissioning Commission that progress is being made. I am confident that with the steps the Government are taking to implement all of the outstanding elements of the Belfast Agreement, we are creating the right context for such progress to be made.

<P>
<a name="10328w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Government remain committed to normalisation of security as quickly as the threat allows. Major progress has already been made. Since the ceasefire 42 military bases have been demolished, closed or vacated. There are currently under 13,500 troops in Northern Ireland, the lowest level since 1970. Over 3,000 troops have left the Province since the current ceasefires were declared.
<P>

<a name="10328w13.html_para5">In the longer term, the number of army bases will reduce to no more than 20, to include sites in Londonderry, Belfast, Coleraine and Dungannon. However, these further measures will very much depend on the removal of the threat from dissident republicans and continued progress towards a normal civil society.

The shared service centre pilots are expected to cost &#163;8.5 million and the national integrated human resources and payroll system &#163;23 million in 2001-02.

 Ward Environment Budgets were introduced on 1 October last year. Each budget will be worth a minimum of &#163;5,000 in 2001-02. The budgets can be spent on whatever the ward sisters and charge nurses who manage the ward consider will best enhance and humanise patient care or improve the working lives of staff.
<P>

<a name="10328w15.html_para3">All wards can have a budget. No types of ward are excluded. In the vast majority of cases it will be clear which units within a hospital are a ward. At the margins there may however be some doubt whether a particular unit constitutes a ward for the purposes of these budgets. Where there is doubt, the hospital managers will decide how a ward is defined within their hospital with a view to delivering the spirit of this initiative.

 We shall continue to ensure that new staff/students have appropriate, high quality support and are taught by those with practical and recent experience of their professions.

<a name="10328w16.html_para13">Members of the tourist industry have made representations about the severe losses their industry is facing as a result of foot and mouth disease. We estimate that the current loss of revenue to the tourist industry in England is of the order of &#163;100 million a week but it could rise to as much as &#163;250 million a week.

 As with pelagic fishing in the closed areas, there is no limit on the number of vessels which may fish for sand eels. However, observers must be on board for at least 50 vessel trips per member state. Their responsibilities are set out in Article 3 of Commission Regulation 259/2001.

 The Government are determined to ensure that all young people receive high quality, impartial advice about all the learning opportunities available to them. To deliver this we are setting up the new Connexions Service starting in 12 areas in England from April this year, which will ensure that young people who could benefit are actively encouraged to consider vocational options, including Modern Apprenticeships. Connexions Personal Advisers will provide careers advice to all young people about their learning options. Those Personal Advisers based in schools will work as part of a team under the management of headteachers.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> Information on the numbers of students from London who were enrolled in Higher Education institutions is not available in the form requested.

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked Leigh Lewis to reply to your question about the number of people awarded postal status due to hardship incurred in attending Jobcentres. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr Lewis as Chief Executive of the Agency. I am replying as Chief Operating Officer for the Employment Service.




<P>
<P><I>28 Mar 2001 : Column: 678W</I><P>

<BR>
I am afraid it is not possible to provide a count of the number of people being awarded postal status due to hardship incurred by travel expenses to sign on at the nearest Jobcentre. People are required to attend the Jobcentre each fortnight as part of maintaining their claim for Jobseeker's Allowance. However, depending on circumstances, some people are allowed to maintain their claim by post--those who would have to spend an unreasonable amount of time travelling to the Jobcentre, and those who have a mental or physical disability which restricts their mobility.
<BR>
Postal status is not usually awarded on the basis of costs incurred for attending the Jobcentre. However, Jobcentre Managers do have some discretion in offering this facility if someone's journey would involve the use of a form of transport which they could not be expected to use on a regular basis, for example, a ferry.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2001]:</i> The Government have welcomed the report from the Funding Options Review Group of Universities UK as a helpful contribution to the debate about the funding of higher education. The Government are increasing funding to universities and higher education colleges in England by &#163;1.7 billion over the six years to 2003-04; funding per full-time equivalent student will increase in real terms in 2001-02 for the first time in over a decade. The funding shortfall identified in the Universities UK report is for 2003-04. The Government will address the funding needs of the sector from 2003-04 in the next Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Computers Within Reach is a Capital Modernisation Fund (CMF) scheme. Such schemes are intended to provide funding for piloting new policy approaches and are not designed to fund full national schemes. It was therefore never intended that the existing CMF funds allocated, &#163;15 million, would be rolled out as a national scheme. We are currently in phase 1 of the scheme working in certain areas of England. The scheme is an England-only rather than a UK pilot.
<P>

<a name="10328w18.html_para2">We will be evaluating the impact of this, and other pilot CMF schemes such as "Wired Up Communities", alongside our existing policies on "digital divide" issues before we make decisions on our next steps.

 Sure Start districts are identified on the basis of levels of need and deprivation. Once a district has been selected by the Government, it is for a partnership of local stakeholders within the district to choose the precise catchment area. To date 260 Sure Start areas over four waves have now been identified and invited to develop programmes. Warrington was invited to develop a Sure Start programme as part of the third wave.

 None. Sure Start targets children under four living in disadvantaged areas as part of the Government's drive to tackle poverty and social exclusion. Local authority districts are identified by the Government on the basis of their levels of need and deprivation and then invited to develop programmes. The Romsey constituency includes parts of the Test Valley, Eastleigh and Southampton districts. Test Valley and Eastleigh have not been selected for Sure Start. Southampton has been invited twice to develop Sure Start programmes, first in the Trailblazer wave and then, most recently, in the fourth wave. Following invitation, it is for local stakeholders within the district to choose the precise catchment area, and for both Southampton programmes the areas chosen are outside the Romsey constituency.

 Most funding provided by the Department is distributed via local education authorities. Allocations for schools in the Blackpool, North and Fleetwood constituency between the years 1997-98 and 2000-01 under the New Deal for Schools scheme are set out in the table. The Department does not hold information on other support provided to Blackpool, North and Fleetwood schools since 2 May 1997. The Secretary of State wrote to my hon. Friend on 16 February setting out the total funding for her local education authorities (Blackpool and Lancashire) for the years 1996-97 to 2001-02.

 The Department gives guidance on the environmental performance of new school buildings in Building Bulletin 87, "Guidelines for Environmental Design in Schools". This recommends a number of measures for conserving energy. It also contains targets for limiting the amount of carbon dioxide produced by new buildings for both primary and secondary schools, thereby limiting their environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="10328w19.html_para0">The building or adaptation of university buildings is a matter for each university. Universities are independent autonomous institutions who will take investment decisions based on longer term strategic objectives approved by the governing body of that institution. Where this may involve public funding, investment appraisal and business case review will be undertaken by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to ensure that the project is in line with established investment criteria. Each university has an estates strategy which fully considers environmental issues.

 The revised parental contribution scale for day pupils under the music and ballet scheme will require greater contributions than at present from families whose annual income exceeds &#163;25,000 in order to bring it into line with the scale for boarding pupils in terms of affordability and equity. Greater contributions will be required from the parents of boarding pupils where family income exceeds &#163;45,000. However, the income threshold below which the parents of day pupils receive a free place will be higher, at &#163;12,148 per annum, than that for boarding pupils, at &#163;9,798 per annum, in recognition of the costs of keeping day pupils at home.

<a name="10328w20.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if proposals for write-offs of student loans initiated by his Department <i>(a)</i> require extension to European students and <i>(b)</i> require approval by the European Union.  [155871]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w20.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Detailed proposals for the write-off of student loans are still being developed by my Department. We do not believe that they require European Union approval, but we will naturally take full account of relevant EU legislation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w20.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if comparable incentives to the proposed write-offs of student loans for trainee teachers are planned for trainees without loan debt.  [155869]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 No directly comparable incentives are planned for trainees without loan debt. Other measures to encourage more people into teaching, especially in shortage subjects, include improved pay and training, Golden Hellos, and our recently-announced Back To Work bonus for returners to teaching. The number of teachers in England and Wales has increased by 7,400 since 1998, and we hope that this rise will continue.

<P>
<a name="10328w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on progress in implementing changes in funding for external qualifications consequent on the coming repeal of Schedule 2 to the Further and Higher Education Act 1999.  [155876]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Until 31 August 2001 the Learning and Skills Council will continue to consider as eligible for funding, qualifications currently funded by the Further Education Funding Council. On 29 December 2000, the Department published the first list, under section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, of external qualifications that will be approved for use from 1 September 2001 by those under 19. The LSC will draw on this list for those aged 19 or over until 2002-03 when a list under section 97 of the Act will be published.

<a name="10328w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the North Devon constituency, the effects on North Devon of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [155903]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Outlined are details of the effects of a range of the Department's policies on the North Devon constituency and Devon LEA.
<P>

<a name="10328w20.html_para0"><i>Beacon Schools</i>
<P>

<a name="10328w20.html_para1">The Park Community School--awarded Beacon status from 1 September 1998 for working with the home to foster a positive approach to school--home school contracts, personal student development, mentoring and academic tutoring, special educational needs, initial teacher training, and continuous professional development.
<P>

<a name="10328w20.html_para2"><i>School Achievement Awards</i>
<P>

<a name="10328w20.html_para3">Eighteen schools in the constituency were among 108 in Devon to be allocated a total of &#163;728,400 in March 2001. Staff at 16 of the 18 schools in the constituency received Improvement Awards because pupil performance in 2000 was substantially better than in 1997, or because schools had come out of special measures. The remaining two schools received Excellence Awards, because pupil performance in 2000 was better than most schools in similar circumstances. Awards were worth around &#163;5,000 for a typical primary school and &#163;25,000 for a typical secondary school.
<P>

<a name="10328w20.html_para4"><i>Classroom of the Future</i>
<P>

<a name="10328w20.html_para5">Devon LEA was awarded &#163;900,000 as part of the above initiative in February 2001. The stated aim is, in the context of recent educational research, to provide life long learning opportunities that broaden experiences for pupils and the whole community. It will be an inclusive project that provides greater educational opportunities for those living in rural communities, so that social exclusion in isolated rural areas no longer exists. The proposal is to set up units in two primary schools and a community college within an existing cluster of schools, and to work with three technology colleges. The potential of information and communications technology is fully explored, in combination with sustainable design. Partners include Exeter and Plymouth Universities and the Timber Research and Development Association.

 Zimbabwe is clearly in breach of the Harare Commonwealth Declaration, particularly in terms of respect for the rule of law and independence of the judiciary. But a country may be suspended from the Commonwealth only under certain narrowly-defined circumstances, namely the overthrow of an elected government. Such a decision is taken by consensus by all members. The UK is seeking as a member of the High Level Review Group on reform of the Commonwealth, to expand the remit of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) so that it can intervene before the breakdown of democracy, to promote adherence to Commonwealth core values.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10328w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 At last year's UN Commission on Human Rights, the EU sponsored a resolution on Sudan which set out its concerns about violations of human rights. In particular, the resolution addressed the distressing problem of abduction of women and children, an issue which remains high on our agenda. It called on the Government of Sudan to continue to co-operate with the Committee for the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC), and to help facilitate the return of affected individuals.

 There has been a great deal of forced displacement from the oil concession areas in south Sudan in the last year. We do not know how many civilian deaths there have been, but there have undoubtedly been many.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> We and our European partners have taken every opportunity to raise with Iran our concerns about the unsatisfactory nature of the case, and will continue to do so. My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe most recently did so with the Iranian ambassador on 22 January. While noting the reductions in sentence on appeal, we continue to hope that the Iranian judiciary will show clemency. We understand that one of the accused is now due to be released following completion of his two-year sentence. The EU sponsored the 4 December General Assembly Resolution expressing concern about discrimination against people who belong to religious minorities and Iranian failure to comply with international standards on the administration of justice.

<P>

<a name="10328w24.html_para15">Romsey is part of the area covered by the South West Hampshire Youth Offending Team (YOT), which is one of seven teams that make up the Wessex YOT. Due to the rural nature of Romsey and the distance from the YOT office, work with young people who live in Romsey usually occurs in the home. Romsey is not a high crime area in terms of youth offending. Over the past year five young people have been worked with for offences of arson/criminal damage, theft/handling and a road traffic offence.
<P>

<a name="10328w24.html_para16">The South West Hampshire YOT is a multi-agency team comprising staff from the probation service, social services, health authority, an education officer and a parent support co-ordinator. All young people who come to the attention of the YOT are assessed using the ASSET assessment tool and work is allocated on the basis of criminogenic need. This enables the team to identify specific needs for young people and concentrate on the particular area of concern for the individual, for example education. There are two specialist drug workers within

the South West Hampshire YOT, which has been made possible due to close partnership working with the Drugs Advisory Service. An accredited Cognitive Behavioural Programme is run at the YOT office, and transport can be arranged for the young person to attend if required.
<P>

<a name="10328w24.html_para17">In addition, a Motor Offending Programme is being run, which is specific to the South West Hampshire YOT. This has been achieved through links with the Crime and Disorder Partnership and identifying car crime as an area that needs targeting. One of the YOT officers has developed a 16 session programme which young offenders involved in car crime are required to attend.

<a name="10328w24.html_para18"><P>

<a name="10328w24.html_para19">The YOT aims to give victims a consistently good service and places victim issues at the top of their working agenda. The team aims to make all young offenders responsible for the consequences of their actions and reparation takes place wherever possible. The YOT has formed a cohesive multi-agency approach which is making progress on tackling youth offending.

 Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons is appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, who is advised on the appointment by the Home Secretary. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation is appointed by the Home Secretary. We are following the guidelines of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in recruiting for the two posts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he has revised the terms of reference of HM Inspector of Prisons to include the inspection of the Prison Service.  [155105]

<P>
<a name="10328w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The remit of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons is fixed by statute. In summary it is to inspect prisons in England and Wales, reporting on the treatment of prisoners and conditions in prisons, and to report to the Home Secretary on related matters as the Home Secretary directs. The inspection of the Prison Service as a whole, including Prison Service Headquarters, falls outside the Chief Inspector's statutory remit. The proposed terms of reference for Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, which have been sent to the Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee and other Members of this House, do however make clear that the Chief Inspector's responsibilities include reporting on the impact of management decisions within the Prison Service on prison conditions and the treatment of prisoners and, as the Home Secretary directs, on matters concerning Prison Service Headquarters which could impact on prison conditions.
