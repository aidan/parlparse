<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Illsley: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what proposals he has to change the Cabinet Office Security and Intelligence Services Vote departmental expenditure limit for 1999-2000.  [109085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate, the departmental expenditure limit for Class XVII, Vote 2 will be increased by &#163;26,030,000 from &#163;742,947,000 to &#163;768,977,000 and the gross running cost limit will be increased by &#163;30,468,000 from &#163;380,067,000 to &#163;410,535,000.
<P>

<a name="00204w01.html_para0">The change is to effect transfers of &#163;2,500,000 to the Ministry of Defence (Class VI, Vote 1) and &#163;750,000 from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Class II, Vote 1), the take up of running costs end year flexibility of &#163;3,698,000 as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 393W. It also provides for an increase in the departmental expenditure limit of &#163;24,175,000 for services bought from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the reclassification of &#163;10,280,000 from capital to other current expenditure and of &#163;1,790,000 from annual managed expenditure to departmental expenditure limit.
<P>

<a name="00204w01.html_para1">There will be an increase in Appropriations in Aid of &#163;5,651,000 and a net increase in other current expenditure of &#163;4,942,000.
<P>

<a name="00204w01.html_para2">The increases in provision will be offset by transfers or increased receipts, or charged to the Reserve, and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what arrangements for the award of war pensions and other forms of compensation apply to <i>(a)</i> military personnel and <i>(b)</i> British civilians (i) contracted and (ii) seconded to the forces who served in the war theatre during the Gulf conflict;  [107279]
<P>
<UL>
<P>
(2) if he will compensate British civilians seconded or contracted to the forces in the war theatre during the Gulf conflict who have subsequently become ill as a result of their secondment.  [107282]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 For Armed Forces personnel, there are two schemes to compensate for death or injury caused by Service: the War Pension Scheme (WPS) administered by the DSS, and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) administered by MOD. When both Departments accept that the death or injury is attributable to service, benefits are payable from both schemes. In addition to pension arrangements, compensation is also payable from the MOD if it can be proved that an individual's death or injury was caused by negligence by the Department. This compensation system is applied to injuries or death in wartime, but the Department is not required to pay common law compensation if the injury or death occurred where the claimant was actively engaging the enemy. Individuals injured or killed in this scenario receive benefits from the WPS and the AFPS.
<P>

<a name="00204w01.html_para3">In regard to civilians, civil servants are covered by the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS). This provides for the payment of death and injury benefits to those who are killed or sustain injuries attributable to their duties. Civilians who are employees of contractors do not participate in the PCSPS (or the AFPS or WPS), but would be entitled to common law compensation where the Department was liable. MOD civil servants are also entitled to seek common law compensation from their employer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many British civilians <i>(a)</i> seconded and <i>(b)</i> contracted to Her Majesty's forces in the war theatre during the Gulf conflict were subsequently tested for (i) depleted uranium and (b) other uranium; and with what results.  [107281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department's policy on testing Gulf veterans was published in "Testing for the presence of depleted uranium in UK veterans of the Gulf conflict: The Current Position" dated 19 March 1999, a copy of which is in the Library of the House. Under this policy, as at 31 January 2000, my Department had arranged for one civilian veteran's urine to be tested at two laboratories. The results from one laboratory using neutron activation methods showed that the uranium-235 concentration was less than 0.0053 micrograms per litre (g/l) of urine. The concentration of natural uranium was less than 0.73 g/l and that the concentration of depleted uranium (uranium -235 content of about 0.2 per cent.) was less than 2.6 g/l. This result represented the limits of detection by the method used. If uranium was present it was below these concentrations. The second laboratory's results using a different method (Laser Phosphorimetry) 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2000 : Column: 743W</I><P>
were that total uranium concentration was 0.0052 (+/- 0.00076) g/l. Both sets of test results show that uranium, in any form, is not a contributory factor to the patient's ill-health.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many British civilians <i>(a)</i> seconded and <i>(b)</i> contracted to Her Majesty's forces in the war theatre during the Gulf conflict have subsequently suffered from <i>(a)</i> post-traumatic stress disorder, <i>(b)</i> nephrotic syndrome and <i>(c)</i> other kidney or renal problems.  [107283]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department has no mechanisms in place for routinely monitoring the health of its civilian employees, ex-employees, contractors' employees or foreign nationals. However, civilians who provided direct support to British Forces in theatre during the Gulf conflict can be referred by their GP for examination at the MOD's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP). As at 27 January 2000, 63 civilians who went to the Gulf had been seen by MAP physicians. Of these: two were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder; one had nephrotic syndrome; and none were diagnosed with kidney or renal problems, other than nephrotic syndrome.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his estimate of the number of British civilians seconded or contracted to Her Majesty's Forces in the war theatre during the Gulf conflict who were exposed to uranium.  [107303]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2000]:</i> We have no such estimate.

<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what steps he is taking to inform Parliament of <i>(a)</i> the amount spent on nuclear weapons research and <i>(b)</i> plans for research or work on future nuclear weapons systems;  [107597]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans the Government have to fund further work or research on the Trident warhead and its individual components; and at what cost;  [107736]
<P>
(3) what <i>(a)</i> work and <i>(b)</i> research the Government are funding on future nuclear weapons systems and on the components of such systems; and at what cost.  [107737]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Supporting Essay 5 of the Strategic Defence Review White Paper (Cm 3999) provided details of the costs of the nuclear warhead programme in 1997-98. Direct Trident Warhead Related Expenditure is expected to continue at around &#163;120 million per annum (at 1998-99 prices) for the life of the system, of which some &#163;70 million is in support of Research, Development and Capability Maintenance activities. Although research is aimed at stewardship of the Trident warhead, it also ensures the maintenance of a minimum capability to design and produce a successor should this prove necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Assurances of confidentiality were given because it appeared to me (i) that Senator Pinochet had a right, subject to any overriding public interest, to have personal information about his health kept confidential, (ii) because I wished to have authoritative advice about Senator Pinochet's state of health and I was conscious that he had no obligation to submit to a medical examination, and (iii) that it was appropriate to ask Senator Pinochet for his consent only for the purpose for which I needed the information, namely to equip myself to perform my own functions and to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General to perform theirs.

The available information, which relates to the numbers of those nationals issued with notice of intention to deport on the grounds that they have overstayed, is shown in the following table. Central records do not show how many of those persons had obtained a visit visa.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how much has been spent on the New Deal for Lone Parents <i>(a)</i> since the original pilot schemes were established and <i>(b)</i> since its full implementation.  [108000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w03.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The cost of implementing the New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) prototype phase 1 areas was &#163;7.9 million. The cost of implementing the national programme has been &#163;47.6 million, broken down as &#163;0.311 million 1997-98, &#163;22.3 million in 1998-99 and &#163;25 million in 1999-2000 (up to the end of December 1999).
<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para0">Both sums include the cost of project management, the development and provision of IT support, publicity, the cost of evaluation and the costs of NDLP Innovative Pilots.
<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para1">As such it is not possible to equate these with the impact of adviser time spent in helping lone parents into work. The independent evaluation of the NDLP prototype phase is due to be published at the end of this month and will include a full cost/benefit analysis. Similarly, the national programme is being evaluated separately and will also include a cost/benefit analysis. This is due for publication in spring 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps he proposes to take to further investigate the link between low income and chronic bad health highlighted in DSS Research Report No. 95; and if he will make a statement.  [108116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 DSS Research Report 95 was a baseline report from the Earnings Top-up (ETU) evaluation. This provided results of the first surveys of low-paid workers, medium-term unemployed people and employers conducted in 1996, before the introduction of ETU. Forthcoming reports from the ETU evaluation will also include analysis of self-reported health and disability.
<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para2">Much research commissioned by the Department gathers information on self-reported health and disability for low income groups. In addition to the ETU evaluation, the Programme of Research into Low Income Families (PRILIF) and the Survey of Families with Children gathers information on health for families with children. The Jobseeker's Allowance Evaluation has information on the relationship between unemployment-related benefit receipt and poor health. The ONE evaluation will collect information on self-reported health and disability among clients of working age, and the impact of this on their ability to work. The Department also commissions research on clients receiving disability benefits.




<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2000 : Column: 750W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para3">We know that low income and poor health are often linked, and that they can act together to exclude many people from the benefits of a prospering nation. We are determined to overcome these problems. That is why we set out our plans to improve health and reduce the health gap in the White Paper "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" (Cm 4386) and the accompanying "Reducing Health Inequalities: An action report" in July 1999, as well as in our strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion, "Opportunity for all" (September 1999, Cm 4445).

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what special arrangements exist for people from Montserrat relocating in the United Kingdom;  [108136]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on the application of the habitual residence test to evacuees from Montserrat.  [108138]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Special rules were introduced in 1996 to give people coming from Montserrat, after 1 November 1995 because of the volcanic crisis, immediate access to the main safety net benefits: income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, Housing Benefit, and Council Tax Benefit. These rules effectively exempt people coming from Montserrat from the habitual residence test.
<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para4">While no special arrangements for access to the Social Fund were made by Montserrations, existing guidance and directions already made provision for community care grants to be considered for families who are experiencing exceptional pressures. However, in 1998 a bulletin was issued to all staff amplifying the circumstances in which grants could be considered: examples specifically included instances where a disaster has resulted in the evacuation to the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what the subsidies were in each of the past 10 years to <i>(a)</i> Worthing Borough Council, <i>(b)</i> Arun District Council and <i>(c)</i> all English local housing authorities combined for investigation and detection of housing benefit and council tax fraud; and if he will make a statement.  [108186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w03.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Local authorities are paid an administration subsidy that helps meet the general cost of administering the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit schemes. Specific financial incentives for investigating and

<P><I>4 Feb 2000 : Column: 751W</I><P>
detecting fraud were first introduced in April 1993 in the form of the weekly benefits savings scheme. Details of payments made under that scheme are set out in table 1.
<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para5">The criteria for making claims under this scheme were tightened in 1998 following concerns expressed by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee that some councils had previously overclaimed. The scheme has been further amended from 1999-2000 onwards to provide additional incentives to local

authorities who successfully prosecute fraudsters and who adopt the Verification Framework. I have also set out in table 2 the amounts of subsidy paid in respect of the Verification Framework, introduced in 1998-99, which puts checks in place to stop fraud getting into the benefit system.
<P>

<a name="00204w03.html_para6">Table 3 details the challenge fund scheme, which ran from 1996-97 to 1998-99, and encouraged councils to bid for funding for innovative anti-fraud initiatives.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all rebates for contracting-out into a personal pension, including a personal pension based stakeholder pension, will be calculated to reflect the enhanced three part accrual rate in the State Second Pension;

to the effect that evidence, written statements and documents produced by them to the inquiry will not be used in evidence against them in any criminal proceedings, except in limited circumstances. This will not, however, prevent a prosecution based on material other than that provided to the Inquiry. The undertaking was provided because it was certain that without it potential witnesses would be inhibited from providing Lord Cullen with full assistance. It was important that everything reasonably possible was done to enable the inquiry to begin its work immediately and to ensure that it would be fully effective, so that it can establish and publish the truth about the circumstances which led to the tragic rail crash.

 Within East Anglia there are two markets at Norwich and Colchester registered with the Intervention Board for the live collection of over-30-month scheme cattle.

I can confirm that, where the Board already had an established

and satisfactory working relationship with an abattoir, no reference was made to those companies' published accounts in evaluating their tenders. For new suppliers, or in any case of doubt, it is the Board's policy to seek information on the financial standing of a company before entering into a contract.

<P>
<a name="00204w05.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are more than a hundred wide-ranging and forward-thinking recommendations in the Urban Task Force report. The Government have welcomed the report as an important contribution to the urban renaissance debate and are considering its recommendations in detail in drawing up the White Paper on urban policy, due to be published later this year. The Mayor may also wish to consider the report when producing the Spatial Development and other strategies set out in the GLA Act 1999 and generally, as the London boroughs are already doing.
<P>

<a name="00204w05.html_para0">In the meantime, it is important to keep up the momentum and many of the report's recommendations are already being taken forward.

In addition, pilot urban regeneration companies have been published, although as yet there are none in London.

 The cost benefit analysis of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) will depend on a number of factors including the precise system chosen, the timing of its introduction, and the level of safety risk which it addresses. A British rail report on ATP including estimates of costs and benefits was placed in the Library of the House in July 1994, but those estimates would need to be recalculated in the light of specific proposals.

<a name="00204w06.html_para0">A regulatory impact assessment for the Railway Safety Regulations 1999, including a cost benefit assessment of the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), was placed in the Library of each House when the Regulations were laid on 10 August 1999. Following the tragic accident at Ladbroke Grove, we asked Sir David Davies to make an assessment of train protection systems and we expect his report shortly. We will also look to the Health and Safety Commission for advice before any further decisions on train protection are taken.

<P>
<a name="00204w06.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Since 1997, an extra &#163;15 million has been included in the general allocation to health authorities to support implementation of the new ambulance service targets across England; those allocations are weighted to take account of rurality. Furthermore, we have carried out research recently to support ambulance services in delivering the national targets in both urban and rural areas such as Cumbria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to improve the <i>(a)</i> effectiveness and <i>(b)</i> response times for ambulance services in sparsely populated rural counties.  [107490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w06.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 We recognise the practical constraints on ambulance services that have to cope with extremes of geography. In emergency situations the effectiveness of ambulance services is largely dependent on speed of response and the clinical training of their crews. The new response time targets will benefit rural areas as they are based on clinical need rather than geography. However rural services will need to develop alternative approaches to achieving the response times for people with immediately life-threatening conditions including paramedics using fast response vehicles, co-responder programmes (using the fire service and police) and community first responder schemes (local trained volunteers). We have commissioned research on the cost effectiveness of these alternative responses to help local health economies, including those in rural areas, plan specific service improvements.

 Procedure in DTI, as recommended in the Department's Procurement Manual and based on HM Treasury procurement guidance, is that financial appraisal of potential suppliers is undertaken where (a) contracts have a value of up to &#163;10,000 and are critical, novel or contentious; (b) contracts have a value of &#163;10,000 or more. Qualified accountants are required to report on a company's published accounts where contract values exceed &#163;95,000.

 Procedure in DTI, as recommended in the Department's Procurement Manual and based on HM Treasury procurement guidance, is that financial appraisal of suppliers is undertaken pre-award where contract values are &#163;10,000 or more, or are otherwise critical, novel or contentious. Where contract duration is more than one year, checks on financial viability may be undertaken at regular intervals.

benefits. The wood particleboard and fibreboard industry, together with other sectors, will benefit from the proposals announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his 9 November 1999 Pre-Budget Report, including: the lower overall rates of the levy; the exemptions for electricity generated from new forms of renewable energy and good quality combined heat and power plants; and the trebling of support for energy efficiency measures under the levy package.
<P>

<a name="00204w08.html_para0">In addition, those wood particleboard and fibreboard industry sites that are covered by the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control Directive, as defined by reference to Part A of the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulation, will be eligible for an 80 per cent. discount from the levy if they sign up to a negotiated agreement to improve energy efficiency or deliver emissions reductions that meet the Government's criteria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 8 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 572W, what restrictions were placed on contractors carrying out research projects funded by his Department in 1999 in respect of them discussing their findings with journalists <i>(a)</i> before and <i>(b)</i> after publication.  [108190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w08.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Department's standard terms and conditions of contract for services, placed in the Library of the House as indicated in my answer of 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 604W, require a contractor to obtain consent in writing prior to communicating information obtained in the course of work performed under the contract. Where this contract term applies, it would cover discussion of findings with journalists both before and after publication. Where this Department funds research projects as grants rather than service contracts, a similar clause would be applied but only for the purpose of protecting confidential information. In such a case the written consent of the Department and all parties to the project would be required before release. In any event, as I indicated in my earlier answer, the Department actively encourages the publication of results from the research it has funded.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w08.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what restrictions have been placed on contractors carrying out research contracts funded by grants from the Research Councils during 1999 in respect of them discussing their findings with journalists <i>(a)</i> before and <i>(b)</i> after publication; and if he will place a copy of the standard research contract for each Research Council in the Library.  [108188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w08.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Each Research Council has its own terms and conditions that cover the actions of people and institutions in receipt of Research Council funds. None of them includes restrictions on discussing research findings with journalists either before or after publication. One of them, the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC), does request that grantholders notify them in advance of any media releases that refer to BBSRC funded research, so that they can, themselves, respond efficiently to any subsequent media inquiries. All Research Councils actively encourage grantholders to publish their research. They also advise them on the need to protect Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and not to 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2000 : Column: 768W</I><P>
jeopardise its future exploitation. However, the management of IPR generated by grantholders, and any resulting restrictions on discussions with journalists, are a matter for the institution in which the research is conducted and not the Research Councils. Copies of each Research Council's research grant terms and conditions will be placed in the Library of the House shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The time spent on each export licence application varies according to a number of factors on which the assessment of the application is based. No record is kept within the Export Control Organisation of the amount of time afforded to each individual application. Export licence application 6078 was received on 21 September 1999 and refused on 24 January 2000.

 DTI provides a wide range of support to the UK's textile and clothing industry.

 The Government's first priority on coming to office was to secure long-term economic stability and put an end to the damaging cycle of boom and bust. The Government understand the concerns of businesses, including the textile and clothing sectors trading with Europe, about the pound. But short-term fixes would be the biggest threat of all to industry, creating the illusion of temporary relief followed by the reality of long-term damage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w09.html_spnew9"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2000]:</i> There are no free tickets to sponsors. Tickets available to sponsors are part of the sponsorship contractual terms and are an integral part of the benefits sponsors receive in recognition of their financial support for the project. These arrangements are standard for sponsorships of major events. The number of tickets available to sponsors under these arrangements vary according to the level of contribution made by each sponsor. Since they are part and parcel of the sponsorship contract, details are commercially confidential under the confidentiality clauses applicable to both parties. Tickets available to sponsors under the terms of their contractual arrangements do not count towards NMEC's ticket sales and reservations numbers which stand at over one million to date.

and termination provisions. In order to ensure achievement of immovable target dates, NMEC has worked with its contractors to create an environment which has ensured that all key targets were met. As a result none of the construction contracts have been terminated on breach of contract grounds and all issues of performance were resolved through constructive negotiation in a spirit of teamwork. The operation of the Dome is an in-house responsibility and NMEC directly employs the host staff.

<P>
<a name="00204w09.html_spnew11"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2000]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company is responsible for all aspects of the Dome's operation including visitor numbers. The Government are confident that NMEC will increase visitor numbers as the year moves on. The winter months are always the most difficult for those visitor attractions which remain open through the year and the first months of operation at the Dome were always going to be a challenge both in respect of the industry's normal trends and because inevitable teething problems would need to be addressed.

<a name="00204w09.html_spnew12"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2000]:</i> The contracts between NMEC and sponsors of the Millennium Experience are subject to confidentiality clauses applicable to both parties. This is normal practice in commercial operations. The Government have, however, placed in the House Libraries on 17 December 1998, NMEC's "Outline Approach to Official Sponsors of the Dome" and on 14 December 1999, NMEC's pamphlet "Sponsor Identity and Branding Related to Zones". NMEC must operate in a commercial way if it is to deliver its objectives for the Millennium Experience and if it is to compete successfully both in the visitor attraction market, and in the event sponsorship market. Its ability to do so will be compromised if every detail of all its operations and all its contractual terms with suppliers and sponsors are published. In order to meet its public accountability responsibilities, NMEC has made available, and will continue to make available when requested, commercially confidential information, to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House. The Government are satisfied that the NMEC's approach in these matters is acceptable given the commercial nature of its operation.

 <i>[holding</i> <i>answer 13 January 2000]:</i> Over 8,000 of the 10,000 or so guests at the Dome Opening Celebration received their tickets before 31 December. Of the 2,000 or so who did not, arrangements were made for them to pick up their tickets either at Charlton or Stratford rail stations depending on 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2000 : Column: 773W</I><P>
where they had been advised to go beforehand. Every effort was made to contact, before 31 December, those whose tickets could not be despatched in time. The Shareholder, the Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the NMEC Chief Executive and the Metropolitan police have apologised for the inconvenience caused to guests who experienced delays at Stratford in particular, although the process on the night of picking up tickets was not, of itself, a material cause of delays. The event itself, in terms of the numbers attending, the arrangements for the safety of all guests, and the programme of spectacular entertainment, presented NMEC, the police and the transport operators with unprecedented logistical and security requirements. There were clearly some problems with timely ticket issues for all guests and with arrangements at Stratford in particular--and all guests who came via that satellite have been offered a free visit to the Dome on a day of their choosing. Despite those problems, the majority of people who attended on the night had a thoroughly enjoyable evening entertained by some truly spectacular performances.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The former Minister for Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Mr. Banks), had a total of 12 meetings involving either the Chief Executive of Sport England or the Chairman of Wembley National Stadium Limited between May 1997 and July 1999. The dates and details of those attending are as listed. My Department does not hold copies of Sport England's notes, the publication of which is a matter for them to consider, but maintains its own internal notes of such meetings. In respect of my Department's minutes of these meetings, representatives of non-governmental organisations took part in those meetings on the understanding that discussions were in confidence, and I do not, therefore, consider it appropriate that they should be published.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what funds are available from <i>(a)</i> sports foundations sponsored by his Department and <i>(b)</i> the National Lottery to support travel by schoolchildren to playing fields for the purpose of participating in team sports.  [108131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w10.html_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The travel costs to playing fields for schoolchildren is eligible for support under the National Lottery Awards for All programme provided the travel is undertaken outside of school hours and is part of an overall project for which funding is being sought. This programme provides lottery grants of up to &#163;5,000 to support short-term revenue as well as capital schemes. To date, Sport England has made around 2,000 awards totalling &#163;4.8 million under the Programme, although it is not possible to say how much of this relates specifically to travel costs.
<P>

<a name="00204w10.html_para0">The Sportsmatch scheme, which is funded by my Department through Sport England, encourages business sponsors to invest in grass roots sport by matching their investment pound for pound up to &#163;50,000 for eligible projects. Since its introduction eight years ago more than &#163;20 million of Sportsmatch funding has been awarded in 72 sports, the majority supporting youth development programmes. Many of these involve the provision of coaching to youngsters, with a proportion of the funding allocated to transportation from home or school to playing fields and other facilities, although no details are available of the specific sums spent on travel.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the hourly rate paid to <i>(a)</i> solicitors and <i>(b)</i> barristers acting for the families of those persons killed by the Army in Londonderry on 30 January 1972; by what procedures these sums were negotiated and agreed; when they were agreed; how often they are paid; under which estimates budget subheadings provision for these sums falls; and what were the total sums paid to (i) solicitors and (ii) barristers up to 31 December 1999.  [107387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Interim arrangements for the payment of solicitors and barristers acting for the families of those killed on 30 January 1972 have applied since 29 October 1999. The interim rates are as follows--solicitors receive &#163;114 per hour, unqualified personnel &#163;57 per hour, Senior Counsel receive &#163;200 per hour and Junior Counsel &#163;100 per hour. The interim arrangements provide for senior counsel to be paid at the rate of &#163;1,500 per day and Junior Counsel &#163;750 per day. In addition they will be able to claim up to two hours preparatory work per day during the hearing. The Tribunal plans to submit these fees for determination to the Senior Costs Judge later this year, and again when the Tribunal's final report is submitted to the Secretary of State. These arrangements were agreed after consultation between the Inquiry and the Northern Ireland Office. Junior Counsel have challenged these interim arrangements on the grounds that they are entitled to receive two-thirds, not one half, of their senior's rate and are seeking leave to have the matter judicially reviewed.
<P>

<a name="00204w11.html_para0">Payment of these sums is covered by the 1999-2000 Main Supply Estimates and provision falls under the Northern Ireland Office Class XV, Vote 1 within Line K Bloody Sunday (Saville) Inquiry Subhead 2 Other Current Expenditure. Sums are paid monthly after receipt of an invoice. It is not possible to provide a figure for monies paid to solicitors and barristers separately, nor to give a figure for payments for their professional services, separately from their other expenses. The total amount paid out to cover both fees and other expenses up to 31 December 1999 is &#163;7,698,820.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00204w12.html_spnew2"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The Government have allocated an additional &#163;200 million over three years to provide treatment for drug misusers. We are beginning to see the effect of this investment in expansion of treatment services in prisons, the development of arrest referral schemes and the expansion of community-based drug treatment services.
<P>

<a name="00204w12.html_para0">One of the barriers to faster expansion is the shortage of suitably skilled staff and I have recently announced a major new recruitment campaign for drug workers, to begin in March. This campaign will be jointly funded by the Department of Health and the Home Office and we aim to recruit up to 300 new drug workers. We hope to attract people from a wide range of backgrounds, and we are ensuring that training will be available to enable the new drug workers to begin work as quickly as possible.

<P>

<a name="00204w12.html_para1">To compensate staff for working over the period, bank holiday overtime rates payable in the United Kingdom were increased by 50 per cent.

 My Department has commissioned and received a number of reports from a Consultant Occupational Physician at the University of Cambridge. These include a report of research carried out on respiratory function and asthma in children (April 1998), one describing the health hazards of volcanic ash in areas south of the Belham Valley (July 1999), and health risk annexes to Scientific and Hazard Assessment reports received over the last two years, the latest in December 1999.
<P>

<a name="00204w12.html_para6">Future reports will include (i) the outcomes of two toxicological studies on the long-term effects of exposure to volcanic ash (ii) conclusions on the respiratory health of Montserratians on island and (iii) estimates of the long-term effects and health risks associated with cristobalite in volcanic ash.

 We organised health checks for all Montserratians evacuated to the UK under the HMG sponsored evacuation arrangements. Follow-up checks are under consideration. The Government of Montserrat's Environmental Health Department regularly monitor ash levels both on the ground and in the air. In addition, we have agreed in principle to fund a study by the Institute of Occupational Medicine on the respiratory health and exposure to volcanic dust of Montserratian residents.

 We receive weekly reports from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. The volcano's new dome began to grow in November 1999 and now has an estimated volume of 16 million cubic metres. The rate of growth is similar to that associated with the 1997 eruption. Resumed magma ascent reinforces the need for sustained and vigilant monitoring. The December 1999 Scientific and Hazards Assessment Report concluded there are no immediate risks outside the Exclusion Zone.
