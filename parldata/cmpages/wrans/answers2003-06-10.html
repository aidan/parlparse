<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her Answer of 15 May 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 436W, on the Passport Agency, for what reason the figure for the number of lost passports in 1998 is not available; what steps her Department is taking in conjunction with Royal Mail to ensure that passports are delivered safely to customers; and what assessment she has made of the reasons why passports are lost.  [115527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w02.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30610w02.html_para0">Figures for passports reported as being lost in the post only started to be collated routinely and centrally in 1998 with the introduction of the current passport production system and new procedures for claiming compensation from the Royal Mail. Figures for passports reported lost in the post prior to 1999 are not therefore available.
<P>

<a name="30610w02.html_para1">The UK Passport Service has had regular discussions with the Royal Mail about the loss of passports in the post and about options for delivery which might reduce the number of losses but at the same time minimise the inconvenience and additional cost to customers which such delivery arrangements might entail. The UK Passport Service and the Royal Mail also work together on investigations into the disappearance of passports in the postal system.
<P>

<a name="30610w02.html_para2">As the hon. Member will see from my response to another of his questions on 3 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 148W, the UK Passport Service is actively seeking to introduce a secure delivery for all passports returned to customers.
<P>

<a name="30610w02.html_para3">Passports are recorded as having been lost in the post when the passport applicant reports that he or she has not received the document. The three principal reasons why a passport may not be delivered are miss-routing because of incorrect addressing, loss within the postal system as the result of some processing error or theft. In addition it is possible that a report of a lost passport may be made if there is some delay between the passport leaving the UK Passport Service and arrival at its destination.
<P>

<a name="30610w02.html_para4">As recognised by the Cabinet Office "Identity Fraud: A Study" published in July 2002, identity fraud is a serious and growing problem for the UK and it is possible that this has contributed to the increase in passports being reported as having been lost in the post. However, there is no evidence currently available which could establish the degree to which the increase in identity fraud has resulted in the increase in reports of such losses

 It is standard practice for bovine TB reactors to be removed from farm as quickly as possible and slaughtered at an abattoir by a trained slaughterman. In cases where reactor animals are unfit to travel to a slaughterhouse, arrangements are made for slaughter to be carried out on farm by a knackerman, and for a post-mortem to be carried out by the State Veterinary Service (SVS).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of the Commission's proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on farms which entered into agri-environmental schemes before or during the reference period.  [114092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w02.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Under the Commission's proposals, entitlements to the new single payment scheme would be based on claims for CAP direct payments during a reference period running from 2000 to 2002. Farmers who reduced their direct payment claims during that period as a consequence of participation in an agri-environment scheme would, therefore, see that reduction fed through to their single payment entitlement. We have made clear to the Commission and Greek Presidency that the final agreement should include provisions to ensure that agri-environment participants are not disadvantaged. The Commission has now suggested that this could be achieved by allowing the choice of a historical reference period for the single payment scheme which predates an individual's agri-environment agreement(s).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is the Government's policy during negotiations on the reform of the Common Agricultural policy to seek to secure a national reserve amounting to more than 1 per cent. of the reference amount.  [114093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w02.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Government believe that it is important to address the inequities in the initial allocation of single payment entitlements that would be created by the European Commission's proposals. The Commission has recently suggested that those inequities could be addressed through an increase in the range of farmers who would access the national reserve. The size of the reserve would then be increased by reducing reference amounts by up to a maximum of 3 per cent. and drawing in the entitlements of farmers who sold land after the start of the reference period.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2003]:</i> Under the Directive 2001/18, it would be possible for the relevant competent authority to authorise the deliberate release of a GMO subject to the condition that it may not be used in specific geographical locations on grounds of sound scientific evidence of risk to human health or the environment. Any such condition would have to be decided case-by-case. The Directive does not provide for limiting the geographical use of a GMO on any other grounds. If any GMO was assessed as presenting significant risks to human health or the environment, it is highly unlikely that it would be approved at all.

 Under the European Commission's CAP reform proposals, Member States would have the discretion to implement the single payment scheme on the basis of a single common payment rate per hectare rather than individual rates determined by historic subsidy receipts. However, this option would only apply at the regional level and the common payment per hectare would have to made to all farmers in a region, whether their land registered for arable area aid purposes or not. If any such discretion is provided for in the final agreement, the Government will wish to consult interested parties before deciding what, if any, use might be made of it.

 No assessment has been made of the potential impact on the export trade of unsorted kerbside collected recyclables from English recycling schemes to Pacific Rim countries on economic regeneration in the UK. Local authorities must dispose of waste in accordance with the Best Practical Environmental Option (BPEO) which necessitates paying attention to the proximity principle. Waste shipments for recovery must meet the strict criteria that apply to shipments of waste to non-OECD countries under EC legislation. The criteria applied to these shipments of waste for recovery include, among others, that the waste is non-hazardous, not contaminated, and that any Pacific Rim country, if not an OECD member, will have clarified to the European Commission that it is willing and able to recover the waste in an environmentally sound manner.

 In 1999 we started a process to reduce discharges of technetium-99 (Tc-99) from Sellafield. In that year the discharge limit was reduced from 200 TBq/year to 90 TBq/year and, at our request, the Environment Agency commenced a review of the discharges of Tc-99, to be completed ahead of the review of all other radioactive discharges from Sellafield. As required by the Agency, BNFL are currently working to intoduce an abatement technique known as "MAC Diversion", which we hope will be operational shortly. The introduction of that technique should allow the discharge limit to be reduced to 10 TBq/year (5 per cent. of the 1999 limit) by 2006. Further scientific evaluation is currently being carried out to determine whether an alternative abatement technique, based on tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, commonly referred to as TPP, could be used to allow the discharge limit to be reduced before 2006.

<P>

<a name="30610w05.html_para4">Arson is one of the major fire threats facing us today. That is why in 1998 the Government commissioned a study into the arrangements for dealing with the problem of deliberate fire-setting. The study reported in 1999 and made a number of far-reaching recommendations; the most significant of which was the creation of the Government-led Arson Control Forum to provide the strategic direction to the national fight against arson. The forum was launched in April 2001. The forum is now taking forward a programme of preventative measures that address arson in its many guises. The forum continues to fund a number of locally based arson control initiatives and has issued guidance on a variety of arson related subjects.
<P>

<a name="30610w05.html_para5">Car fires comprise a considerable element of the deliberate fires problem and Government have taken a number of steps to address this. New powers will enable local authorities to remove unlicensed vehicles more quickly and tighten vehicle registration procedures.

<a name="30610w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Under the Government's proposals for home information packs, prospective buyers will be provided with key information about homes marketed for sale. Flood risk information is one of the items being considered for inclusion in the pack as part of the standard search arrangements. This proposal is set out in a consultation paper, "Contents of the Home Information Pack", published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 31 March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30610w05.html_para6">Prospective buyers and their professional advisers can already investigate flood risk. The Environment Agency publishes Indicative Floodplain Maps. These are available on the Agency's website: www.environment-agency.gov.uk in the section entitled "What's in your backyard". Prospective home buyers and their professional advisers can interrogate this site by post code to see the area in which a property is situated is at flood risk. More detailed information can be obtained from the local Environment Agency area office and from specialist commercial search companies. New homes should increasingly be located in accordance with the stronger planning guidance we issued in July 2001 in PPG25, "Development and Flood Risk", which sets out a sequential approach to the type of developments compatible with different levels of flood risk. To complement this new guidance, DTLR published, in February 2002, "Preparing for Floods". This sets out interim guidance for improving the flood resistance of all domestic and small business properties. It provides practical advice for existing owners whose properties are at risk of flooding and for those involved in constructing new properties or renovating old ones in flood risk areas. The information it contains is also of value to professionals advising purchasers on the flood resistant capabilities of properties within the mapped areas of flood risk.

<P>
<a name="30610w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 On 22 August 2001, the Government significantly strengthened the planning arrangements for telecommunications development. One change was to increase the time for authorities to deal with prior approval applications from 28 and 42 days to a uniform 56 days. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister strengthened public consultation requirements on mast proposals of 15 metres and below and for masts on buildings and structures so that they are exactly the same as applications for planning permission. We have no plans to change these arrangements.

 Ending the restriction on easterly departures from Heathrow's northern runway, known as the Cranford Agreement, would not on its own have any effect on the runway capacity of the airport. To raise the capacity of Heathrow's existing runways by the introduction of a 'mixed mode' pattern operations would require termination or amendment of the runway alternation scheme and the Cranford Agreement. The Government have no plans to introduce mixed mode.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about on-going works to the northbound bridge of the M6 Motorway Thelwall Viaduct, in Warrington, Cheshire. As you may be aware, this matter was the subject of an Adjournment Debate in the House on 12 May, secured by Helen Southworth MP.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency is responsible for the operation, management, maintenance, and improvement, of the trunk road and motorway network in England, including the Thelwall Viaduct, which typically carries some 150,000&#151;160,000 vehicles per day. All but one lane of the viaduct carrying northbound traffic was closed in July 2002 following the discovery of a failed roller bearing. Detailed investigations were urgently earned out and these revealed other failures in the bridge roller bearings. Continuing intensive investigations found that all 136 roller bearings on the northbound viaduct should be replaced, before further traffic lanes can be opened on that structure. As you may be aware, the Minister stated during the Adjournment Debate, that it might take until March 2005 to complete all the remedial work. The Minister also acknowledged that the cost of the remedial work is likely to be substantial, but did not wish to say anything further on that aspect, given that the question of liability for the failed roller bearings is likely to be decided through litigation and the courts. Notwithstanding that, he also said that funds would be made available to the Agency to enable the remedial work to be carried out.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current restrictions comprise three narrow lanes in each direction on the new southbound viaduct and a single lane on the northbound viaduct, to facilitate traffic leaving the M6 at Junction 21, for Warrington. There are advance warning signs on

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what research was undertaken on the impact of corrosion from de-icing chemicals on the bridge bearings of the Thelwall Viaduct on the M6 at the design stage; and what research has been undertaken since into alternative technologies that could reduce the levels of corrosion.  [118096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The risk of corrosion from environmental pollutants including de-icing chemicals on Thelwell Viaduct was minimised by using stainless steel and provision of enclosures (skirts) around the steel roller bearings. The majority of the bearing locations do not have expansion joints at the road level, thus reducing the risk of surface water and de-icing salts reaching the surfaces of the roller bearings.
<P>

<a name="30610w07.html_para6">The effectiveness of non-corrosive de-icing agents has been researched over many years in UK and other countries. There are limitations on their effectiveness at low temperatures and the use of rock salt is then necessary. Such agents are used in the UK on some major bridges where the higher cost can be justified in whole life terms.

 Estimates of economically recoverable reserves of fossil fuels are inevitably uncertain since they depend on energy prices, technical and economic progress and the extent of yet-to-find reserves. With that caveat, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published reserves estimates in their World Energy Outlook 2002 publication. The IEA estimated that proven global reserves (discovered and expected to economically producible) of conventional crude oil and natural gas liquids are 959 billion barrels. In addition, the IEA estimated undiscovered resources (thought to exist and expected to become economically recoverable) of conventional crude oil and natural gas liquids to be 939 billion barrels and recoverable non-conventional reserves, such as oil shales, to be 580 billion barrels. Based on US Geological Survey data, the World Energy Outlook notes that remaining gas resources, including proven reserves, reserve growth (defined as the increase in known volumes that commonly occur as gas fields are developed and produced) and undiscovered resources,

<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2003 : Column 761W</I><P>
authorities expressed their concerns through the International Accreditation Forum about the activities of a number of overseas certification bodies operating in China. Five of the 11 bodies investigated by the Chinese authorities were accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). UKAS took immediate and robust action by imposing a moratorium on new accreditations for certification carried out outside of the United Kingdom whilst it carried out its own investigation into the activities of the named UKAS-accredited certification bodies. The Government support this approach.
<P>

<a name="30610w12.html_para5">The moratorium was subsequently lifted on 31 July 2002. UKAS found that those UKAS-accredited bodies that were the subject of the Chinese concerns had been operating through agents and that there were some weaknesses, at the UK headquarter offices, in the control of these agents which needed to be addressed. There were though no indications that such deficiencies in procedures applied in the case of other accredited certification bodies. However, in recognition that the certification sector had become more international in nature, UKAS implemented further changes in the way that it assesses certification bodies. These changes require certification bodies to: submit full details of all agency/sub-contracting, etc. arrangements that they have in place; declare all the locations where critical activities are carried out; and list all the countries where UKAS-accredited certificates have been issued. UKAS itself has also made some changes to its internal procedures as a result of its investigation into the Chinese concerns.

<a name="30610w12.html_spnew12"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Accreditation Service's (UKAS) Accreditation Awareness Campaign was launched by my noble friend, Lord Sainsbury, on 27 November 2000. Initially expected to last for 18 months, the campaign continues because of the recognition that awareness in this area can only be achieved via the regular flow of information to the market.

<a name="30610w12.html_para7">The campaign is in two parts, one aimed at raising awareness within government and the other aimed at business (particularly small businesses) so that, within government, potential customers (scheme/standard developers, etc.) of UKAS can make informed choices about their accreditation needs, and businesses can recognise the value of accreditation to the competitiveness of their companies and to risk management.

 Several inkjet cartridge refill businesses have written to express their concern that their operations may be put at risk if the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive scope does not include these goods. I am making clear in my replies that we take these concerns seriously and that I am keen for this sector to continue to flourish. Industry estimates suggest there are over 100 companies that remanufacture ink and toner cartridges for reuse, employing over 2,000 people with another 20 plus 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2003 : Column 763W</I><P>
companies involved in the supply chain. Their combined turnover is said to be in the order of &#163;150 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="30610w13.html_para0">The WEEE Directive does not prevent the reuse or refilling of printer cartridges. The concerns raised by the refill sector relate to existing technology, presently applied to a very small proportion of goods sold. Business estimates that 30 to 40 per cent. of toner and inkjet cartridges are presently reused or recycled equating to 6 to 8,000 tonnes per annum. The WEEE Directive will not affect this.
<P>

<a name="30610w13.html_para1">The European Commission has made clear that printer cartridges do not fall within the scope of the WEEE Directive, but that forthcoming eco-design based EU legislation may pick this issue up. The UK agrees with this assessment. In the mean time, if the spread of new technology preventing reuse starts to significantly impinge on the independent refill market, I will wish to consider what additional action might be necessary.

The UK is a member, through the EU, of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO), a United Nations body established to, among other things, "achieve a reasonable balance between world supply and demand on a basis which will assure adequate supplies of coffee at fair prices to consumers and markets for coffee at remunerative prices to producers".

<P>
<a name="30610w16.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It is very difficult to give accurate figures for amputee numbers countrywide. Some organisations such as Handicap International have been assisting amputees and other war affected people in Sierra Leone for several years. They have found that the number of surviving amputees is much smaller than originally thought since many died as a result of their injuries. Also, some were in inaccessible areas and could not be assisted or even counted. Some of those from remote locations are however coming to Freetown for treatment but numbers are uncertain. Very vulnerable people may still be afraid to come forward despite encouragement to do so. In spite of this the estimate of amputee numbers has not changed since the former Secretary of State wrote to the hon. Member on 3 December 2001 at which time it was estimated at around 1,000.
<P>

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2003]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills has regular on-going discussions with Customs and Excise to consider the impact of VAT and there are no plans to change the VAT rules as they apply to sixth form colleges' purchase of general goods and services. Colleges gained a range of important financial advantages from incorporation, including control over their own assets such as land and buildings, and the freedom to employ their own staff and determine their terms and conditions. Costs such as VAT need to be met from college funds and we have announced the largest ever investment in further education over the next three years. Funding will rise by &#163;1.2 billion, an increase of 19 per cent. in real terms, between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06. We are awaiting advice from Customs and Excise on the levying of VAT on further education capital projects.

 Legislation relating to independent schools has remained largely unchanged since 1944. The Education Act 2002 introduced strengthened regulation and monitoring arrangements to reflect the needs and expectations of parents and pupils in the 21st century.
<P>

<a name="30610w17.html_para4">Many of the standards set out in the new regulations already apply to independent schools, but we have strengthened our powers in some areas to ensure that independent schools educate children in a safe and secure environment and offer a curriculum that enables pupils to fulfil their potential.

<P><I>10 Jun 2003 : Column 780W</I><P>
quantify costs that will fall on schools that have to make improvements. Inspection charges are related to the number of pupils at each school, with a cap of &#163;10,000 for larger schools. In determining the level of charges we gave careful consideration to the pressures on schools operating on limited budgets. We propose that charges will not meet the full cost of inspection and will be based on a sliding scale, depending on the number of pupils at the school, with small schools paying least. For example, a school with 100 pupils would pay &#163;4,500 every six years, or &#163;7.50 per pupil a year.
<P>

<a name="30610w17.html_para6">We issued a consultation document on 27 February 2003 to all independent schools, the independent school associations, including the Headmasters Conference and the Independent Schools Council, the teacher unions and other interested parties.

 In 2002&#150;03, a total &#163;900,000 of departmental funding was spent on the independent/state school partnerships grant scheme. Independent evaluation of the scheme has found that it is achieving its aims and objectives and provides good value for money. As a result, the scheme has been allocated a significant increase of funding over the next three years: &#163;1.25 million in 2003&#150;04, rising to &#163;2 million in 2005&#150;06.

 The Department is committed to raising standards in schools and believes that national testing of children's progress is necessary in order to achieve higher standards.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30610w19.html_para2">This has contributed to the best primary school results ever. The NLS advocates the 'Searchlights' model of reading, and is based on the view that children should be taught to read using synthetic and analytic phonics as well as other strategies such as knowledge of grammar and context. The 'Searchlights' model emphasises the central importance of early phonics but also accepts that children will attempt to make sense of a wide range of print and texts in the course of mastering the phonic code and need to be helped to do so efficiently. This is particularly true with English where, because of its linguistic heritage, a significant proportion of words are not phonetically regular.
<P>

<a name="30610w19.html_para3">The teaching of phonics in the NLS is based on international research over the last 30 years and on good practice seen in England and other countries. The NLS view is supported by international research such as The National Reading Panel Report commissioned by the US Federal Government, 'Teaching to read', in 2000.
<P>

<a name="30610w19.html_para4">The Department for Education and Skills held a seminar on 17 March 2003 to review the latest research and effective practice in the teaching of phonics. An independent report on the seminar is being finalised and will shortly be published. We will then respond to that report and set out our plans for further strengthening the teaching of phonics in primary schools.
<P>

<a name="30610w19.html_para5">The Jolly Phonics programme has been adopted by a number of schools, and some teachers have found it effective in helping children learn to read. Schools are able to choose from a range of phonics programmes including the NLS programme Progression in Phonics (PiPs). It is up to schools and teachers to decide which programme they consider most effective in meeting the needs of their children.

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) have arranged for public investment in UK eUniversities Worldwide (UKeU) to be handled by a Holding Company (the eLearning Holding Company Ltd.), which is owned by the higher education institutions of the UK. HEFCE currently requires that the Holding Company maintains at least a 50 per cent. stake in UKeU so that it may oversee the value for money represented in the services provided, and to oversee quality and standards of a venture which carries a brand backed by UK higher education. The Holding Company appoints three Directors to the Board of UKeU who have rights of veto over decisions of the UKeU Board. The Holding Company has rights to receive any information it requests from UKeU. The Holding Company monitors the venture and reports annually and by exception on the progress of the business to HEFCE as well as to its members, UK higher education institutions. As with all public funds routed through HEFCE, HEFCE are accountable to the Department's accounting officer for their appropriate disbursement. In addition, HEFCE regularly reviews the progress of UKeU, and I meet routinely with both HEFCE and UKeU to keep abreast of developments.

Therefore from November 2002, families on benefits, including IS and JSA(IB), have been sent information about the new tax credits, including information to help them to identify if they will be better off claiming tax credits now.

 The latest draft of the EU constitutional treaty proposes in Article 12 of Part 1 that "the Union shall have exclusive competence to establish competition rules within the internal market, and in the following areas: monetary policy, for the member states which have adopted the euro; common commercial policy; customs union; the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy."
<P>

<a name="30610w23.html_para3">In the amendments that the Government have submitted to the Convention, we have stressed that the competences exercise should largely clarify existing competences rather than extend Union competence. For this reason we have proposed that the competence to establish competition rules within the internal market be listed under Article 13 as an area of shared competence rather than in Article 12 as an area of exclusive competence.

 The Afghan Transitional Administration estimate that around 25 per cent. of the crop was destroyed as a result of their eradication programme for the 2002 harvest.

<a name="30610w24.html_para1">The Afghan National Drug Strategy, which was adopted on 19 May, recognises that eradication will not eliminate drugs from Afghanistan on its own and must be balanced with other measures to interdict drugs and to encourage development of rural communities to promote sustainable alternatives for poppy farmers.

<a name="30610w25.html_para11">Where a person has not been granted asylum, exceptional leave or humanitarian protection or discretionary leave, it follows that we do not consider that they have demonstrated a protection need or a compelling reason why they should be allowed to remain here.

 The 1986 Act provides a strong regulatory framework. It regulates any experimental or other scientific procedure applied to a "protected animal" that may have the effect of causing that animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. It provides an effective means by which to balance the need to protect animals from unnecessary suffering with the legitimate requirements of the scientific community (and the public) for medical and other essential research and safety testing. The system set up under the 1986 Act is flexible and responsive to changing circumstances and requirements and its enabling provisions allow changes to be made quickly and easily by administrative means, or using secondary legislation.

<a name="30610w26.html_para5">The Animal Procedures Committee (ARC) review of the operation of the Act, published in its Annual Report for 1997, concluded that the Act provides a good framework for a well-regulated and responsible use of animals in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom.

 The Bail Act 1976 provides that the court may refuse bail if there are substantial grounds for believing that the defendant would commit an offence if released on bail. Where (in the case of an adult defendant) the evidence of such a risk is the fact that he was already on bail at the date of the offence, Clause 14 of the Criminal Justice Bill requires the court to refuse bail unless it is satisfied that there is no significant risk that he would commit an offence.

<a name="30610w27.html_para0">The Bail Amendment Act 1993 gives the prosecution a right of appeal to the Crown court against a decision by magistrates to grant bail, but this is at present limited to cases where the defendant is charged with or convicted of an offence which is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more (or an offence of taking a conveyance without authority or aggravated vehicle taking). Clause 18 of the Criminal Justice Bill extends this right of appeal to cover all imprisonable offences, as recommended by Lord Justice Auld.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedures are in place to inform victims and witnesses of decisions relating to bail conditions of suspects and early release of prisoners.  [116245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w27.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 In England and Wales (separate arrangements apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland), the police are generally responsible for keeping victims informed of case developments, up to and including their conclusion in the courts. At present, this would not routinely include informing victims about bail decisions although the police have discretion to do so in cases where, for example, it would put the victim at risk of harm if they were not so informed.
<P>

<a name="30610w27.html_para1">One of our manifesto commitments is to introduce a Victims of Crime Bill during the course of this Parliament. The Bill, which will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows, is likely to include a statutory Code of Practice to replace the Victim's Charter. The Code will place some 70 to 80 obligations on criminal justice agencies to deliver specific services, within prescribed timescales, to victims. Among these obligations will be a specific requirement for the police to inform victims of bail decisions and, when relevant, bail conditions.
<P>

<a name="30610w27.html_para2">The Code will apply to victims, including those who go on to give evidence as witnesses. We also recognise that we need to do more to support witnesses who are not victims. An interagency working group has recently undertaken a wide-ranging review of the services provided to witnesses. Among other recommendations, it proposed improving the information given to witnesses and that good practice guidance be developed and disseminated following local pilot studies in witness care.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2003 : Column 814W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30610w27.html_para3">Victims already have a right to be consulted about the release of prisoners. Since April 2001, the National Probation Service for England and Wales has had a statutory duty to consult and notify victims about all release arrangements and release conditions where an offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more for a sexual or other violent offence. There are currently no plans to extend this service to witnesses.

 The larger sample size of the British Crime Survey (BCS) in 2001&#150;02 has resulted in the ability, for the first time, to analyse data (questions that are asked of the whole sample) by police force area such as Merseyside. Results for the Best Value Performance Indicator 120 measuring risk of victimisation of both personal and household crime for Merseyside for 2001&#150;02 interviews can be found in 'Crime in England and Wales 2001&#150;2002', Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/02 (table 7.05).

 The work of the Police Standards Unit (PSU) is assessed regularly and its contribution to the Department's Public Service Agreements scrutinised. In addition, its programme of work is subject to management monitoring through regular programme board meetings on accepted programme management procedures. Its major projects, including, for example, performance improvement work with forces and the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and the Policing Priority Areas projects, are the subject of rigorous independent evaluation providing an assessment of success against objectives. Where appropriate, such evaluation produces good practice models for promulgating to the police service.

 Police authorities are expected to make financial provision to deal with unusual or infrequent events.

Any such applications are considered within existing departmental provision for special grants.
<P>

<a name="30610w29.html_para5">The only force to make application for additional grant in connection with the costs of policing the Golden Jubilee was the Metropolitan Police Service which subsequently received an additional &#163;49 million to counter increased risks of terrorism, including funding to cover the Golden Jubilee costs.

 Counselling is available to staff following a serious incident in the Prison Service. The Prison Service Staff Care and Welfare Service (SCWS) provides an externally sourced, specialist service for those staff who are assessed as requiring counselling. BMI Health Services, the occupational health advisors to the Prison Service also assess and where appropriate, recommend treatment designed to support staff as part of their return to work programme.
<P>

<a name="30610w29.html_para6">In the last 12 months, over 400 prison staff have been provided with an average of seven counselling sessions per person following incidents in establishments. The counselling budget available to SCWS has been significantly increased in the current financial year recognising the importance that the Prison Service places on staff support services.
<P>

<a name="30610w29.html_para7">Additionally, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), a specialised service for staff suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been introduced. Between January and April 2003 three staff have been referred for EMDR treatment. Contact has also been made with 'Combat Stress', an armed forces welfare society for ex-forces staff.

 Support for staff following stress related incidents is managed by the establishment at which they work.

Such duties are given for a time bound period to assist in rehabilitation and recovery from a stress related incident.
<P>

<a name="30610w29.html_para9">The individual needs of an officer are considered in each case and the decision to offer alternative work is guided by medical and support service advice. Establishments have full access to occupational health advice. It is a mandatory requirement to seek occupational health advice in serious stress related illness cases. Staff care and welfare services will also provide additional support and counselling services.
<P>

<a name="30610w29.html_para10">While the non-prisoner contact duties will vary between prisons, they would normally include training, gate duties, administration or non-contact security work. Officers may also be relocated outside of the prison at which an incident occurred.

<P>
<a name="30610w30.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Chope: </B>

<P>

(2) how many thefts of goods from heavy goods vehicles with a value in excess of &#163;10,000 took place in each of the last three years.  [118595]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Reducing vehicle crime, including thefts from heavy goods vehicles, is an essential part of the Government's crime reduction strategy. One measure of the priority that the Home Office attaches to reducing such thefts is the support we are giving to the National Stolen Lorry Load Desk. The Desk, run by the Metropolitan police, collects and analyses information about thefts from heavy goods vehicles and shares it with police and industry to help prevent and detect this crime. The Home Office supported the Desk financially with contributions of &#163;36,000 in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;50,000 in 2002&#150;03, and we are providing &#163;50,000 in 2003&#150;04; matching contributions are raised by industry.
<P>

<a name="30610w30.html_para2">Information on the numbers and values of thefts of goods from lorries is not available centrally. But information provided by the National Stolen Lorry Load Desk shows that the value of property stolen from heavy goods vehicles in thefts notified to and recorded by the Desk amounted to &#163;100 million in 2000, &#163;145 million in 2001 and &#163;124 million in 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 No constabulary operates such quotas. When a motorist is detected committing an offence the police must decide according to the circumstances of each particular case whether to offer a fixed penalty. If a fixed penalty is not offered, it will be for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide on prosecution and if there is a prosecution for the court to decide on conviction and any consequent fine.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many persons have been granted <i>(a)</i> indefinite leave to remain and <i>(b)</i> exceptional leave to remain in each of the last four years for which figures are available.  [115228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w30.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2003]:</i> The latest available information is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="30610w30.html_para4">By way of background, indefinite leave to remain (ILR) can be granted in a variety of circumstances, for example to married and unmarried partners who have successfully completed a two year probationary period, long residence, in employment and business categories, such as work permit employment. A migrant can apply to settle in the United Kingdom as long as they meet the requirements set out in the Rules. In general these are that the migrant has been continuously resident in the UK save for a short trips abroad, for a minimum of four years; and still meets the requirements for stay under that category; and is still required in the UK for employment. Since July 1998, a person granted refugee status will have also been granted ILR concurrently.
<P>

<a name="30610w30.html_para5">Under the Immigration Rules, ILR will also be granted to dependent children of people settled here who are aged under 18. Also, children who are admitted for adoption to someone settled here will qualify for ILR, once the formal adoption proceedings have been completed.
<P>

<a name="30610w30.html_para6">A person who has completed four years exceptional leave may also apply for ILR. The rises in grants of exceptional leave to remain (ELR) have been contributed by a record number of initial decisions in 2001 (119,015) and high levels in 2002 (82,715), and by changes in the mix of applicant nationalities. All cases are decided on their individual merits. The main nationalities to be granted ELR in 2002 were Iraqi (8,130), Afghans (4,710) and Somali (1,400).
<P>

<a name="30610w30.html_para7">On 1 April 2003, exceptional leave for failed asylum seekers was replaced by two forms of leave&#151;Humanitarian Protection (HP) and Discretionary Leave (DL). They are more focused than exceptional leave and early signs are that we will see a reduction in those granted HP and DL compared to those who were previously granted exceptional leave. We have also ensured that the Secretary of State's over-riding discretion in immigration matters has been retained by introducing the concept of Leave Outside the Rules (LOTR). This, as previously, will be used in those wholly exceptional cases in which it would be inappropriate to remove someone from the UK even though they do not qualify under the Rules.

<P>
<a name="30610w31.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The budget allocation for Work Permits (UK) for the financial year 2003/2004 depends on the outcome of continuing discussions between the Home Office and the Treasury. However, from 1 April 2003, employers are charged &#163;95 for the consideration of each work permit application and this will enable WP (UK) to recover a large part of the cost of running the organisation, plus relevant Home Office overheads. Apart from the new Sectors Based Scheme, which is subject to a quota of 20,000 permits, the work permit service is demand-led and responds to the needs of UK employers to recruit overseas workers. Staffing levels within WP (UK) are set according to this demand. WP (UK) currently employs 480 staff.

National health service service providers in some parts of the country may decide to open additional clinics, should this be required to ensure that all patients are seen within two weeks of referral by their general practitioner.

 There will be national health service run and independent sector-run diagnosis and treatment centres (DTCs) providing non-urgent surgery to NHS patients. NHS-run DTCs will be part of NHS trusts and will be subject to NHS governance and standards; independent sector DTCs will be expected to meet independent sector standards and will be regulated and inspected by the National Care Standards Commission. The intention is that the contracts for independent sector DTCs will be based on a standard project agreement containing a common core set of terms and conditions reflecting this. 15 companies have been short-listed and their details can be found at: http://www.doh.gov.uk/growingcapacity/news.htm This will be updated with further information on a regular basis.

<P>

<a name="30610w31.html_para11">Patients treated at NHS expense in DTCs will remain NHS patients and their rights as NHS patients will not be affected. They will, for example, have a right to use the NHS complaints procedure, and providers will be expected to co-operate with the investigation of complaints under that procedure.

 The Department of Health's policy aims to reduce tobacco consumption in any form. Chewing tobacco is a legal tobacco product, though it is not as widely available as other forms of tobacco and is popular among some ethnic communities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps are being taken by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Food Standards Agency to ensure that proposed amendments to European food labelling legislation do not require the labelling of products as containing wheat or egg if the only such presence is a derivative of the original substance which no longer contains the established allergenic component.  [116359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w32.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 As currently drafted, the European Commission's proposal for amendments to European Union labelling rules would require not only that all derivatives of listed allergenic ingredients be declared in the ingredients list, but that the same allergenic ingredient, for example, wheat or egg, also be declared. In cases where the derivatives no longer have the potential to cause an allergic reaction, this additional information is unnecessary and could cause undue concern to allergic consumers. The Food Standards Agency has discussed this issue with interested parties and is supporting revision of the proposal to address this issue by establishing a list of derivatives for which the source allergenic ingredient would not need to be declared, pending evaluation of scientific evidence supporting a permanent exemption.

[116360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w32.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government have consulted widely on the European Commission's proposal to amend the European Food Labelling Directive 2000/13/EC, as regards indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs. Its assessment of the implications has included consideration of the potential benefits to consumers, the implications for enforcement authorities and the potential costs to the food industry. Its view is that the proposed changes would be of particular benefit to consumers with anaphylaxis and with coeliac disease, because it will ensure food labels provide comprehensive information on those ingredients which are most likely to cause intolerance reactions. The proposal would also have a wider benefit for all consumers, including those with special dietary requirements such as diabetics, because it would remove the 25 per cent. compound ingredient rule, which currently allows declaration of a compound ingredient rather than its constituent ingredients, so long as that ingredient contributes less than 25 per cent. of the weight of the product.

Block capital needs (to cover care and maintenance) will be covered in the national tariff paid to foundation trusts for NHS services under contracts with primary care trusts. Providing they act in a way that is consistent with their terms of authorisation, foundation trusts will be free to borrow capital up to a prudential limit for spending on strategic developments. Foundation trusts will also be free to enter into joint venture arrangements&#151;which may provide an additional source of capital investment that helps deliver their NHS functions.

<P>
<a name="30610w36.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In specifying contracts for goods and services, there is a requirement to take environmental issues embodied in the Department's sustainable development strategy into account. This strategy forms a key part of the Department's policies and operations. Assessment against specified criteria (including environmental and sustainable development) is carried out as part of the overall tender evaluation process. The sustainable development principles, on which criteria for individual contract evaluation is based, can be found on the Department's website.

 A range of initiatives are underway to get better value for temporary staff in the National Health Service. Along with the roll-out of NHS Professionals, the aim is to reduce agency costs and to improve the quality of staff through agency framework agreements. Agency framework agreements fix the cost of agency staff, which can only increase in line with the recommendations of the pay review body.
<P>

<a name="30610w36.html_para5">NHS trusts are using the national medical locum agency contract, with the contract value in the first quarter being &#163;15 million. This is expected to show an average saving of 6 per cent. per trust on the medical locum expenditure per annum.
<P>

<a name="30610w36.html_para6">The aim is to roll-out agency agreements and NHS Professionals to cover all aspects of the temporary healthcare labour market. This means covering not just nurses and doctors but also the Allied Health Professions and other healthcare professionals.

 The CSM (Committee on the Safety of Medicines) issued advice in 1980 on the use of benzodiazepines for short-term (two to four weeks) relief of severe anxiety. The CSM said that the use of benzodiazepines to treat short-term 'mild' anxiety was inappropriate and that benzodiazepines should be used to treat insomnia only when it is severe, disabling, or subjecting the individual to extreme distress.
<P>

<a name="30610w36.html_para10">In 1994, the Department of Health issued copies of "Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Benzodiazepine Dependence", published by the Mental Health Foundation, to all health authorities and recommended their use by general practitioners. "Drug Misuse and Dependence&#151;Guidelines on Clinical Management" was then issued in 1999. The British National Formulary (BNF), updated twice yearly, is

caused by the toxicity of the substance, cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), inhalation and choking on vomit and asphyxia through the use of plastic bags over the face. In addition deaths can be caused by accidents while disorientated. These may include falls, vehicle accidents and drowning. A number of deaths and serious injuries have also been caused by fire or explosion when vapour from the substance ignites. More general effects include cold sweats, fainting, headache, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, confusion, dizziness and risk of accidental injury.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) was transposed into UK law and became the Working Time Regulations on 1 October 1998. It applies to all employees, including midwives, working in the UK with the exception of those in the excluded sectors. Doctors in training are currently excluded, but EWTD will apply to them from 1 August 2004. We are working with the Modernisation Agency, piloting solutions to EWTD in a range of trusts, which involve "new ways of working", in terms of role development and the substitution.
<P>

<a name="30610w37.html_para0">An agreement was made in the General Whitley Council on the operation of the regulations for non-medical staff on national contracts, which also includes midwives. Additionally, the Department of Health also issued guidance in Health Service Circular 1998/204, "Working Time Regulations&#151;Implementation in the NHS". It is the responsibility of local national health service employers to implement the regulations as they see fit to meet local circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30610w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The number of doctors required on an on-call rota to comply with the 2004 Working Time Directive (WTD) requirements will vary, depending on a range of local factors, for example the way in which services are organised and/or the skill mix of the staff who provide them.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30610w37.html_para1">There are a range of solutions to WTD compliance which involve changing the working practices of both medical and non-medical staff and building on the increases in consultant and specialist registrar numbers.

This will enable the national health service to deliver increases in both the quality and quantity of service delivery whilst minimising the additional costs of WTD implementation.
