 The creation of medals is the prerogative of the Sovereign. The Sovereign takes advice from the Government of the day, who, in turn, are advised by the inter-departmental, non-political Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals (known as the HD Committee), on which the armed forces are represented. In the case of campaign medals for service during the second world war, the issue was discussed exhaustively by those in command at the time and by the HD Committee. Those who served in Bomber Command during the second world war could qualify for one of the Stars instituted for campaign service for example the 1939-45 Star, the much prized Aircrew Europe Star or the France and Germany Star. World war two campaign medals were instituted for periods of military service in specified geographic areas and did not relate to individual battles, operations or military commands. The HD Committee has made it clear on many occasions that it will not revisit cases for service performed many years previously or where medals already exist for specified periods of service, both of which apply for service in Bomber Command.</p>

 At present there are no formal agreements between Europol and public or private entities relating to the provision of commercial data to Europol.

The Government also believe where it is reasonable and necessary for Europol to be able to process data there must be adequate safeguards to ensure that such data are relevant for its tasks.</p>

 It is the responsibility of retailers to ensure that they have adequate procedures in place to prevent alcohol being sold to people aged under 18 and that their staff are appropriately trained, to enforce this. Many retailers have now adopted a &#145;Think 21&#146; policy, where anyone appearing to be under 21 should be asked for identification prior to any sale of alcohol, which will prevent an offence being committed. Valid forms of identification include a passport or a driving licence with a photo.</p>

Also in 2006 a Maltese official was seconded to Border and Immigration Agency for a week to learn about our detention centres. EU funding has recently been obtained for joint returns work with Malta, and the European Commission is currently considering a joint proposal from the UK, Italy and Malta for funding to establish a centre for migration intelligence analysts on Lampedusa and Malta.

NHS Trusts provide these notifications to NCAS on a voluntary basis, either on forms sent to ONS or via local congenital anomaly registers. The recording of congenital anomalies is more complete in those areas where a register operates, because the register can obtain additional information locally. Consequently, the figures for congenital anomalies are presented separately for areas where a register operated in 2005 and for areas without a register in that year. In 2005, registers covered 45 per cent of births in England and all births in Wales.</p>

Increases over time in the number of notifications for some congenital anomalies in the areas covered by a register in 2005 are likely to be due to the improved completeness of information brought about as these registers came into operation.</p>
</ul><a name="70704w0010.htm_brev4"><a name="07070445001712"><ul><p class="tabletext">Congenital anomalies are reported to NCAS at or after birth, and do not include any information on whether or not the anomaly was diagnosed during pregnancy.</p>

 For the senior civil service (SCS), Departments and agencies are responsible for their own performance management arrangements within a framework set by the Cabinet Office.

Our smaller East Kilbride office is somewhat more difficult to reach via public transport but around 20 per cent. use either trains or buses.

 DFID has committed to spend at least &#163;150 million over the three years from 2005-08 on programmes to meet the needs of children affected by AIDS. When the commitment was made in 2004 it was expected that at least &#163;44 million of this would be delivered through UNICEF. The methodology to track this expenditure is under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_453"><a name="70704w0013.htm_para3"><a name="07070452000128">In 2006 the UK was the second largest donor to UNICEF, providing &#163;105 million. This included &#163;19 million of core financial support and &#163;5 million to increase the coverage, quality and coordination of the global response for children affected by HIV and AIDS. Both of these elements contribute directly to supporting UNICEF's strategic goals, which include reducing the number of paediatric HIV infections by at least 40 per cent. and ensuring that at least 80 per cent. of HIV positive pregnant women receive antiretroviral therapy to prevent mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV.</p>

 DFID's support to these four countries is provided through international (&#147;multi-lateral&#148;) organisations&#151;mainly the European Union, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. In 2004, DFID's contributions through these channels were &#163;1 million to Uruguay; &#163;1 million to Argentina; &#163;6 million to Brazil; and &#163;2 million to Peru. To help these organisations focus on reducing poverty, DFID has a Latin-America regional programme, with offices in Brazil, Bolivia (for the Andes) and Nicaragua (for central America). These offices work with the Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank on two areas: (i) helping poor people benefit from markets, and (ii) making public sectors and political systems more transparent and accountable. In addition, we work on global issues that affect the region such as HIV and AIDS, and trade. Social exclusion is a cross-cutting theme throughout all facets of our work.

 Overall, the UN Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC) runs an effective mechanism for the supply and distribution of non-food items (NFIs) for Darfur in partnership with CARE and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Between January and May this year, 307,178 households were provided with NFIs, roughly 1.8 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="70704w0013.htm_para6"><a name="07070452000135">Given the scale of need in Darfur and like all other sectors, the supply of NFIs requires regular prioritisation to ensure the available resources are directed to the most pressing needs. UNJLC, CARE and other UN and NGO partners regularly meet to define the NFI priorities for Darfur, a process that is working well in very challenging circumstances. A second constraint is that of access for distributing agencies. Pervasive insecurity, including increasing attacks against humanitarian agencies, has limited the ability to deliver NFIs and other aid to populations in need.</p>

 As we make clear in the Government response to the Committee&#146;s Third Report of Session 2006-07, my Department recommends as best practice that schools record all incidents of bullying and report these statistics to their local authority (LA). We will be strengthening this message in our revised overarching anti-bullying guidance and will ensure it is clear in the more specialist guidance we are preparing on homophobic and other forms of prejudice-driven bullying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="70704w0015.htm_para1"><a name="07070452000371">However, we do not believe that a statutory requirement on schools to record incidents of bullying would be effective. It would present significant logistical and bureaucratic difficulties for schools, and  <br>

there would be substantial issues around consistency of definition, collection, and interpretation which would be expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming to overcome. We think it is better to leave this matter to the good judgment and common sense of teachers, who will have detailed guidance on how best to go about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="70704w0015.htm_para2"><a name="07070452000372">The forthcoming &#147;Tellus 2&#148; survey should give us more comprehensive data on young people&#146;s experiences of bullying in schools. It will be an annual survey, starting this year, covering all LAs. Data will be considered by Ofsted in their annual performance assessment of each LA&#146;s services, and could lead to Ofsted looking more closely at anti-bullying practices in a particular authority&#146;s joint area review (JAR). We are currently looking at how we might use data derived from the survey to inform future policy development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_467"><a name="70704w0015.htm_para3"><a name="07070452000373">The Department&#146;s contract with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) includes a specific research element, which is fulfilled by a senior researcher at Goldsmiths College and his team. In our response to the Education and Skills Select Committee&#146;s report on bullying, we made clear that the ABA was planning a substantial piece of research into reactive anti-bullying strategies, and we believed this was the best way forward. Any other research projects will be determined in light of our ongoing policy priorities.</p>
<a name="07070452001495">
<p>The Department does not monitor the progress of individual schools in addressing bullying at a local, regional or national level or, as my earlier answers make clear, collect statistics in this area. However our partners in the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) and National Strategies maintain close links with individual schools and authorities through their regional networks. We have flagged up that there is a need to tackle the bullying of children with SEN and disabilities in our guidance. The ANA and National Strategies work with schools to ensure effective measures are in place to prevent and tackle the bullying of these children. We have also asked the National Strategies to identify schools with weak and ineffective anti-bullying strategies and to provide challenge and support to these schools as appropriate.</p>
<a name="07070452001496">
<p>Following the Government&#146;s commitment to issue specific guidance on prejudice-driven bullying in the Schools White Paper &#145;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&#146;, my Department produced well-received guidance in 2006 on tackling racist bullying, &#147;Bullying around racism, religion and culture&#148;. We will also be launching more specific guidance on how to prevent and tackle homophobic bullying later this year. We recognise there is a need for more specialist guidance to tackle the bullying of pupils with SEN and disabilities Once this is issued we will work with practitioners and with our partners in the field on a programme of dissemination to ensure schools across the country implement the guidance.</p>
<a name="07070452001497">
<p>Our guidance to schools on tackling bullying has always been intentionally non-statutory. Schools need to determine an approach which best suits their local needs and circumstances, taking into account their pupil population and identified priorities. Schools are autonomous institutions, and we want them to retain the flexibility to establish a system of managing behaviour which best suits the needs of the local community they serve.</p>

 Most overseas pupils are educated in independent schools.

These cover suitability to work with children and the quality of boarding provision. These standards require all adult host family members and guardians to be checked through the Criminal Records Bureau, and are monitored through Ofsted inspection.

We are currently revising our over-arching anti-bullying advice to schools, which we propose to issue on-line in September under the title &#145;Safe to Learn: Embedding Anti-Bullying Work in Schools&#146;. This will include specific guidance on prejudice-driven bullying, with links to the guidance on racist bullying we first issued last year, and homophobic bullying guidance prepared for us by Stonewall and Educational Action Challenging Homophobia (EACH). There will also be specific guidance on how to prevent and tackle cyberbullying. To complete this suite of guidance, we will also prepare specific advice on how to tackle the bullying of children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

We have issued the Anti-Bullying Charter to schools and have placed a duty on head teachers to determine measures to prevent all forms of bullying as part of their overall behaviour policy. More recently, we convened a Taskforce to look at all aspects of cyberbullying, made up of internet service providers, mobile phone companies, education professionals and those working in the youth justice system.</p>

 Further to research published by Goldsmiths University on behalf of the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), the Department first published interim guidelines on cyberbullying in July 2006. Around the same time, we formed the Department&#146;s Cyberbullying Taskforce, consisting of industry leaders, particularly Internet Service Providers and mobile phone operators, as well as education practitioners, the professional associations and law enforcement agencies (such as the Youth Justice Board) to develop a range of initiatives to combat cyberbullying in schools, and to ensure parents are provided with the information they need to keep their children safe online.</p>

Some of these officers also had other duties besides anti-bullying work. By 2005/06 the team consisted of one Grade 7, one Senior Executive Officer (SEO), one HEO and 60 per cent. of one EO, all working on anti-bullying work. By the following year this had changed to one Grade 7, two HEOs and 60 per cent. of one EO.</p>

A sector breakdown for combined LA and school based expenditure is not available from 2002-03 and consequently this table shows the total LA recurrent expenditure (except youth and community) per pupil by LA since 1995-96. 2. 1999-00 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the R01 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 outturn forms collected by the DFES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of consistent financial reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted line. 3. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under fives funded by the LA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DFES annual schools census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under five pupil numbers are taken from the early years census but are only included for 1999-00 onwards. For 1998-99 onwards other LA maintained pupils are included in the pupil count. This includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from Form 8b submitted to the DFES. Also included as other LA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained school drawn from the DFES annual school census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis. 4. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990s. Warrington was part of that reorganisation and figures are not available for 1997-98. 5. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 and are subject to change by the LA.<br>

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2007]</i>: The standards for qualified teacher status require that all trainee teachers have a secure knowledge and understanding of their subjects and curriculum areas. They are also required to demonstrate that they are able to put into practice in their teaching the relevant aspects of the National Strategies. In the case of all primary teachers, this means that they will receive training in the teaching of reading. This training will include phonics approaches, such as the teaching of high quality systematic phonic work, in accordance with the recommendations of the Rose Review. The standards for the award of qualified teacher status have recently been revised and strengthened in these areas.</p>

Under the co-chairmanship of Pam Alexander (CEO, SEED A) and Glenda Stone (CEO, Aurora), the taskforce is providing leadership on women's enterprise across Government and the regions, by recommending specific steps to increase women&#146;s business ownership. It is working with the Regional Development Agencies to ensure that women have access to the high-quality support and advice they require to start and grow their businesses.</p>

To celebrate the recruitment of the 1000th ambassador the first WEAN National conference, hosted by the right hon. Margaret Hodge MP (former Minister for Industry and the Regions), took place at Lancaster House on Monday 25 June 2007. The conference was attended by 200 ambassadors from around the country.</p>
