 The Electoral Commission informs me that in April 2008, it introduced a three stage approach to handling potential breaches of the party and election finance laws. First, it conducts an initial assessment using set criteria to determine whether the matter should become casework. Second, the vast majority of matters that become casework are dealt with as 'case reviews'. Finally, a small number of cases, where the matter is more complex, or may involve the use of statutory powers, are dealt with as 'investigations'.</p>

It also conducted 49 case reviews, which were completed in an average of 69 days against a target of 90 days. The Commission undertook two investigations, which averaged 386 days, against a target of completing 90 per cent. of investigations within 180 days.</p>

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is indeed willing to consider the introduction of some flexibility on the period of notice required for a temporary event notice (TEN) under the Licensing Act 2003. We are currently developing a proposal, in discussion with a group of stakeholders, that would give the police discretion to validate a TEN for an event that they consider to be low-risk when that TEN was otherwise invalid because it was issued without the minimum notice. We hope to commence a three-month consultation on this proposal, along with other simplification proposals, before the end of the year.</p>

 DEFRA takes TB in all species, not just cattle, seriously and is committed to dealing with it. Existing legal provisions do allow DEFRA to restrict movements to and from any herd/flock of farmed (mammalian) species suspected of being infected by bovine tuberculosis-so as to reduce the risk of disease spread. In resolving TB problems in such species, DEFRA relies on the co-operation of animal owners to agree testing, slaughter and compensation arrangements.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 October 2009]:</i> This year is very challenging in resource terms, and success in Afghanistan must take priority. As much as the Regular forces, the Reserves must now focus available resources on supporting the ongoing campaign in Afghanistan, which means reducing activity levels elsewhere. These savings have been recommended by the Army and accepted by the Secretary of State. This is about putting today's operations first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="91021w0007.htm_para3"><a name="09102131000919">The measures that have been the subject of recent parliamentary debate and media reporting are specific to this financial year and reflect the fact that we are rightly focusing resources on the main effort, Afghanistan. And that means also focusing on forces currently deployed and the next roulement. But we have not taken these decisions without understanding potential risks, and we are absolutely determined that any risks to deployments to Afghanistan in 2012 will not be allowed to materialise. The Prime Minister is clear that the mission to Afghanistan will have all the resources and backing it needs to succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="91021w0007.htm_para4"><a name="09102131000920">We remain committed to ensuring that we have Reserve forces that meet the needs of Defence, today and tomorrow. Discussions about future training for the TA will be based on the requirement to preserve its ability to support regular forces on operations, and on ensuring that TA soldiers are properly equipped and trained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="91021w0007.htm_para5"><a name="09102131000921">Those reserves deploying over the next year will of course continue to be paid for the training they do to prepare them for their deployment, as well as for the deployment itself. This training will vary for individuals, depending on the task they will be required to do and their current skill set. This pre-deployment training is not being cut back. It will continue to be validated at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell, before individuals are mobilised to join a formed unit for an extended period of training ahead of operations. It cannot be said enough; no soldier will be allowed to deploy to Afghanistan without the necessary training and equipment, whatever their trade, whether regular or reserve.</p>

A current campaign run by the Electoral Commission and the Ministry of Defence involves every armed forces unit, raising awareness of registration for service personnel and their families. To further support this work, the Government have announced that they will extend the service declaration period from three to five years as soon as parliamentary time allows. I recently met armed forces families' representatives and I have written to invite MPs with service establishments in their constituencies to meet with me and give their views on improvements to service voting arrangements. At present, the legislation allows service voters to vote by post or by proxy: we are working with the MOD and the Electoral Commission to ensure that we have in place the most effective measures to support participation among service personnel.</p>

 Responses to the Youth Crime Action Plan consultation indicated that we should look broadly at how we can best incentivise local authorities to invest in alternatives to custody. The Youth Justice Board is, therefore, exploring options as to how we might do this, including the potential of devolving budgets for Court Ordered Secure Remands as set out in the Youth Crime Action Plan and the potential for devolving wider custody budgets. We recognise this is a complex issue and proper consideration needs to be given to the implications of any changes to the placement of vulnerable young  <br>

These checks include requiring the relevant authorities in the member state where the worker's family resides to confirm the composition of the family and to find out whether there are any family benefits in payment in that other member state.</p>

These are net of income from dental charges paid by patients, which are retained locally by PCTs to supplement the resources available for dentistry. PCTs may also dedicate some of their other NHS resources to dentistry if they consider this an appropriate local priority. Allocations are not apportioned by individual constituencies or towns; PCTs determine the distribution of resources within their area on the basis of local needs and priorities.

 There is no information held centrally on which we could base an estimate of the number of children who still receive dental screening examinations in school. The National Screening Committee advised that that there is no evidence to support universal screening for dental disease among children aged six to nine years. In the light of this expert advice, we have concentrated on targeted initiatives like the Brushing for Life scheme which provides for families with young children to receive toothpaste and brushes at child health clinics or Sure Start centres, together with advice on how the children can be seen by a dentist.</p>

 Providers of national health service dental services have contracts with primary care trusts (PCTs) that set out the agreed annual contract sum and the corresponding level of services to be provided over the course of the year. These annual service levels are expressed mainly in terms of 'units of dental activity', which measure courses of treatment according to their relative complexity. Dental providers who under-deliver by up to 4 per cent. may carry this forward and make up the activity in the following year. Where a provider has delivered less than 96 per cent. of the agreed annual service level, it is at the PCTs discretion whether the undelivered activity is carried forward to the following year or an appropriate proportion of the annual contract sum is refunded to the PCT. This is a matter for PCTs to decide locally in the light of individual circumstances, and their decisions are not collected or held centrally.</p>

I am also introducing a range of major reforms to the social and private rented sector. This includes the consultations I have recently published on a devolved system of responsibility and funding for council housing, a major review of the private rented sector and changes to social housing allocations to give people confidence that councils allocate housing in their area fairly, and the initiative I have launched to clamp-down on fraud in the social sector.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many new profiles have been added to the national DNA database by each police force in each month since 8 July 2009; and if he will make a statement. [294062]</p>

 The figures in table 1 show the number of subject profiles added to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) by English and Welsh forces and the British Transport Police in each month between 9 July 2009 and 15 October 2009, broken down by the police force which took the sample.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="91021w0021.htm_para0"><a name="09102144000518">The figures in table 2 show the number of crime scene profiles added to the NDNAD by English and Welsh forces and the British Transport Police in each month between 9 July 2009 and 15 October 2009, broken down by the police force which collected the sample.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="91021w0021.htm_para1"><a name="09102144000519">The number of subject profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals. A proportion of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded on more then one occasion (this may be because the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because of upgrading of profiles). It is currently estimated that 13.8 per cent. of subject profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. The replication rate of 13.8 per cent. should only be applied over the entire database however, as the replication rate for individual police forces varies considerably. The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many and what proportion of recorded crimes were detected using DNA profiles from the National DNA Database in 2008-09. [294209]</p>

 The number and proportion of recorded crimes detected in which a DNA match was available in 2008-09 is shown in table 1. It is also important to note that the detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone. The source of the figures provided is the Forensic performance data, which is collected from police forces by the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="91021w0022.htm_para0"><a name="09102144000972">The figures for the number of crimes detected in which a DNA match was available only include crimes detected in which a DNA match was reported by the National DNA Database (NDNAD). They do not include DNA matches which arise through case work in serious crime, which usually involve comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory, or DNA matches arising from one-off speculative searches of the NDNAD. Data on DNA matches from casework and speculative searches are not included in the police Forensic performance data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="91021w0022.htm_para1"><a name="09102144000973">The presentation of crimes detected with DNA as a proportion of total recorded crime undervalues the relative contribution of DNA to the crime detection rate. It should be noted that the majority of recorded crimes do not have a crime scene (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.) and do not have a crime scene examination. In 2008-09, just under 797,000 crimes had a crime scene examination (17 percent of recorded crimes). In those crimes which have a crime scene examination, some do not yield any forensic material (DNA or fingerprints). In 2008-09, potential DNA material was collected at 99,402 crimes; and of these, 39,795 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD. Of the 39,795 crimes in which a crime scene sample profile was loaded, a match was generated in 36,727 crimes.</p>

 It is our policy, introduced in 2007 and set out in published guidance, that all new schools should have sprinklers installed, except those assessed to be at low risk of an arson attack. It is for local authorities and other promoters of schools to carry out risk assessments, and ensure that sprinklers are installed where deemed necessary. All schools should have adequate fire precautions in place to safeguard life in the event of a fire. Sprinklers are the only fire suppression systems used in schools.</p>
